Kofi Atta Annan (born 8 April 1938) is a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. Annan and the United Nations were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize "for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world."[tpl]cite web|last=Annan|first=Kofi|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2001|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2001/index.html|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=2013-07-25[/tpl] He is the Chairman of The Elders, a group founded by Nelson Mandela.

==Early years and education==

Kofi Annan was born in the Kofandros section of Kumasi in the Gold Coast on 8 April 1938. His twin sister Efua Ataa, who died in 1991, shared the middle name Atta, which in the Akan means 'twin'. Annan and his sister were born into one of the country's Ashanti and Fante aristocratic families; both of their grandfathers and their uncle were tribal chiefs."Kofi Annan – The Man To Save The World?", Saga Magazine, November 2002
In the Akan names tradition, some children are named according to the day of the week on which they were born, and/or in relation to how many children precede them. Kofi in Akan is the name that corresponds with Friday.Akan dictionary entry for Kofi dictionary.kasahorow.com

From 1954 to 1957, Annan attended the elite Mfantsipim school, a Methodist boarding school in Cape Coast founded in the 1870s. Annan has said that the school taught him "that suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere".Kofi Annan – Center of the Storm. Life Map. A Chief's Son PBS In 1957, the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim, the Gold Coast gained independence from Britain and began using the name "Ghana".
In 1958, Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology, now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana. He received a Ford Foundation grant, enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies in economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States, in 1961. Annan then completed a diplôme d'études approfondies DEA degree in International Relations at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, from 1961–62. After some years of work experience, he studied at the MIT Sloan School of Management[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|title=The MIT 150: 150 Ideas, Inventions, and Innovators that Helped Shape Our World|work=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=8 August 2011[/tpl] (1971–72) in the Sloan Fellows program and earned a Master of Science (M.S.) degree.

==Early career==

In 1962, Kofi Annan started working as a Budget Officer for the World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations (UN). From 1974 to 1976, he worked as the Director of Tourism in Ghana. In the late 1980s, Annan returned to work for the UN, where he was appointed as an Assistant Secretary-General in three consecutive positions: Human Resources, Management and Security Coordinator (1987–1990); Program Planning, Budget and Finance, and Controller (1990–1992); and Peacekeeping Operations (March 1993 – December 1996).[tpl]cite web|title=FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL|url=http://www.un.org/sg/formersg/annan.shtml|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 August 2013[/tpl]
The Rwandan Genocide took place in 1994 while Annan directed UN Peacekeeping Operations. In 2003 Canadian ex-General Roméo Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, claimed that Annan was overly passive in his response to the imminent genocide. In his book Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda (2003), General Dallaire asserted that Annan held back UN troops from intervening to settle the conflict, and from providing more logistical and material support. Dallaire claimed that Annan failed to provide responses to his repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository; such weapons could have helped Dallaire defend the endangered Tutsis. In 2004, ten years after the genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed, Annan said, "I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support."[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3573229.stm |work=BBC News  | title=UN chief's Rwanda genocide regret | date=26 March 2004 | accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl]
Annan served as Under-Secretary-General from March 1994 to October 1995. He was appointed a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the former Yugoslavia, serving for five months before returning to his duties as Under-Secretary-General in April 1996.

==Secretary-General of the United Nations==

===Appointment===

On 13 December 1996, the United Nations Security Council recommended Annan to replace the previous Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, whose second term faced the veto of the United States.[tpl]cite press release |title=BIO/3051 – "Kofi Annan of Ghana recommended by Security Council for appointment as Secretary-General of United Nations" |publisher=UN |date=13 December 1996 |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19961213.bio3051.html |accessdate=12 December 2006[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Traub |first=James | authorlink = James Traub |title=The Best Intentions |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |year=2006 |location=New York |pages=66–67 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=chP1YnYFTKYC |isbn=978-0-374-18220-5[/tpl] Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly,[tpl]cite press release |title=GA/9208 -"General Assembly appoints Kofi Annan of Ghana as seventh Secretary-General" |publisher=UN |date=17 December 1996 |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1996/19961217.ga9208.html |accessdate=12 December 2006[/tpl] he started his first term as Secretary-General on 1 January 1997.

===Activities===

In April 2001, Annan issued a five-point "Call to Action" to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Stating it was a "personal priority", Annan proposed a Global AIDS and Health Fund to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis. On 10 December 2001, Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, "for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world".[tpl]cite web|title= The Nobel Peace Prize 2001|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/laureates/laureates-2001/press-2001/|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Committee|accessdate=21 October 2010|location=Oslo|date=12 October 2001[/tpl]
In the years after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the government of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive to the demands of the Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.[tpl]cite news| url =  http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/ritter.html | title =  The Iraqi Threat: How Real Is It? | accessdate = 2011-01-06 | date = October 2002[/tpl]
During the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations. In a September 2004 interview on the BBC, when questioned about the legal authority for the invasion, Annan said he believed it was not in conformity with the UN charter and was illegal.[tpl]Cite news|title=Excerpts: Annan interview |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661640.stm |work=BBC News   |date=16 September 2004 |accessdate=12 December 2006[/tpl]
Annan and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad disagreed sharply on Iran's nuclear program, on an Iranian exhibition of cartoons mocking the Holocaust, and on the then upcoming International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, an Iranian Holocaust denial conference in 2006.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/09/03/annan-iran.html | work=CBC News | title=Iranian PM snubs Annan over nuclear program | date=3 September 2006[/tpl] During a visit to Iran instigated by continued Iranian uranium enrichment, Annan said "I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept that fact and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure it is never repeated."
Annan supported sending a UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur, Sudan. He worked with the government of Sudan to accept a transfer of power from the African Union peacekeeping mission to a UN one. Annan also worked with several Arab and Muslim countries on women's rights and other topics.
Beginning in 1998, Annan convened an annual UN "Security Council Retreat" with the 15 States' representatives of the Council. It was held at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) Conference Center at the Rockefeller family estate at Pocantico, and was sponsored by both the RBF and the UN.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rbf.org/grants/programs/pocconference_2005_F.html |title=Pocantico Conferences 2005 |accessdate=12 December 2006 |work=Rockefeller Brothers Fund website |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001030415/http://www.rbf.org/grants/programs/pocconference_2005_F.html |archivedate = 1 October 2006[/tpl]

===Nobel Peace Prize===

In 2001, its centennial year, the Nobel Committee decided that the Peace Prize was to be divided between the United Nations (UN) and Kofi Annan.
Annan was awarded the Peace Prize for having revitalized the UN and for having given priority to human rights. The Nobel Committee also recognized his commitment to the struggle to contain the spreading of the HIV virus in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism.

===Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT===

On 9 December 2003, Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT was established, through a partnership between the Government of Ghana and the Government of India, and named after Annan in his honor.

====Lubbers sexual-harassment investigation====

In June 2004, Annan was given a copy of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on the complaint brought by four women workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation. The report also reviewed a long-serving staff member's allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter, Director of UNHCR Personnel. The investigation found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment; no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official, or two subsequent complaints filed later that year. In the course of the official investigation, Lubbers wrote a letter which some considered was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges.[ref]
</ref> On 15 July 2004, Annan cleared Lubbers of the accusations, saying they were not substantial enough legally.<ref>[tpl]cite news|author=FIONA FLECK and WARREN HOGE|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/16/world/annan-clears-refugee-chief-of-harassment-accusations.html |title=Annan Clears Refugee Chief Of Harassment Accusations |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2004-07-16 |accessdate=2013-03-29[/tpl]</ref> His decision held until November 2004. When the OIOS issued its annual report to the UN General Assembly, it stated that it had found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment. These events were widely reported and weakened Annan's influence.
On 17 November 2004, Annan accepted an OIOS report clearing Dileep Nair, UN Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services, of political corruption and sexual harassment charges. Some UN staff in New York disagreed with this conclusion, leading to extended debate on 19 November.
The internal UN-OIOS report on Lubbers was leaked, and sections accompanied by an article by Kate Holt were published in a British newspaper. In February 2005, he resigned as head of the UN refugee agency. Lubbers said he wanted to relieve political pressure on Annan."UN refugee chief quits over sex claims", The Age, 21 February 2005

====Oil-for-Food scandal====

In December 2004, reports surfaced that the Secretary-General's son Kojo Annan received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Program. Kofi Annan called for an investigation to look into the allegations.
Annan appointed the Independent Inquiry Committee,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iic-offp.org/about.htm |title=About the Committee |accessdate=12 December 2006 |work=Independent Inquiry Committee into The United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme website[/tpl] which was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iic-offp.org/members.htm |title=Members |accessdate=12 December 2006 |work=Independent Inquiry Committee into The United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme website [/tpl] then the director of the United Nations Association of the US. In his first interview with the Inquiry Committee, Annan denied having had a meeting with Cotecna. Later in the inquiry, he recalled that he had met with Cotecna's chief executive Elie-Georges Massey twice. In a final report issued on 27 October, the committee found insufficient evidence to indict Kofi Annan on any illegal actions, but did find fault with Benon Sevan, a Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years. Appointed by Annan to the Oil-For-Food role, Sevan repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company. Sevan's behavior was "ethically improper", Volcker said to reporters. Sevan repeatedly denied the charges and argued that he was being made a "scapegoat".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243909,00.html |title=Former U.N. Oil-for-Food Chief Benon Sevan Indicted Over Bribes From Saddam's Regime |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |work=Fox News[/tpl] The Volcker report was highly critical of the UN management structure and the Security Council oversight. It strongly recommended a new position be established of Chief Operating Officer (COO), to handle the fiscal and administrative responsibilities than under the Secretary General's office. The report listed the companies, both Western and Middle Eastern, that benefited illegally from the program.

You will lose the UN one way or another. ... That the US is constructively engaged with the UN ... is not well known or understood, in part because much of the public discourse that reaches the US heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/dsgsm287.doc.htm |title=UN needs US, US needs UN to face challenges – HIV/AIDS, SUDAN – that defy national solutions, says Deputy Secretary-General in New York address |accessdate=12 December 2006 |last=Brown |first=Mark Malloch |authorlink=Mark Malloch Brown |date=6 June 2006 |work=United Nations website |publisher=UN [/tpl] Malloch later said his talk was a "sincere and constructive critique of U.S. policy toward the U.N. by a friend and admirer."
The talk was unusual because it violated unofficial policy of not having top officials publicly criticize member nations. The interim U.S. ambassador John R. Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush, was reported to have told Annan on the phone: "I've known you since 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior UN official that I have seen in that entire time."[tpl]cite news|title=Speech by U.

===UN Resolution 61/225: World Diabetes Day===

Kofi Annan witnessed the United Nations General Assembly's passage of UN Resolution 61/225, to establish World Diabetes Day. The Resolution was the second UN General Assembly Resolution on a health-related issue (the other being HIV/AIDS). Resolution 61/225 is the only Health-related UN Resolution to pass by consensus. Sponsored by the Republic of South Africa and Bangladesh, the Resolution was passed on 20 December 2006.

===Farewell addresses===

On 19 September 2006, Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York, in anticipation of his retirement on 31 December. In the speech he outlined three major problems of "an unjust world economy, world disorder, and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law", which he believes "have not resolved, but sharpened" during his time as Secretary-General. He also pointed to violence in Africa, and the Arab-Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention.[tpl]Cite news|first=Evelyn |last=Leopold |title=UN's Annan depicts polarized world in farewell speech |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-09-19T173615Z_01_N19388437_RTRUKOC_0_US-UN-ASSEMBLY-ANNAN.xml&archived=False&src=091906_1412_ARTICLE_PROMO_also_on_reuters |agency=Reuters   |date=16 September 2006 |accessdate=12 December 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]
On 11 December 2006, in his final speech as Secretary-General, delivered at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri, Annan recalled Truman's leadership in the founding of the United Nations. He called for the United States to return to President Truman's multilateralist foreign policies, and to follow Truman's credo that "the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world". He also said that the United States must maintain its commitment to human rights, "including in the struggle against terrorism."[tpl]Cite news|title=Annan chides US in final speech |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6169669.stm |work=BBC News   |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Kofi |last=Annan |title=Independence, Missouri, 11 December 2006 – Secretary-General's address at the Truman Presidential Museum and Library followed by Questions and Answers |url=http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2357 | work=United Nations website |publisher=UN |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2006[/tpl]

==Recommendations for UN reform==

Soon after taking office in 1997, Annan released two reports on management reform. On 17 March 1997, the report ‘Management and Organisational Measures’ (A/51/829) introduced new management mechanisms through the establishment of a cabinet-style body to assist him and be grouping the UN’s activities in accordance with four core missions. A comprehensive reform agenda was issued on 14 July 1997 entitled ‘Renewing the United Nations: A Programme for Reform’ (A/51/950). Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose, the establishment of the position of Deputy Secretary-General, a 10-percent reduction in posts, a reduction in administrative costs, the consolidation of the UN at the country level, and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners. Annan also proposed to hold a Millennium Summit in 2000.[tpl]cite web | title =The Millennium Assembly and the Millennium Summit | url = http://www.un.org/millennium/sg/report/fact.htm | date = March 2000 | accessdate =30 June 2012[/tpl]
After years of research, Annan presented a progress report, In Larger Freedom, to the UN General Assembly, on 21 March 2005. Annan recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other UN reforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/largerfreedom/ |title=In Larger Freedom |accessdate=12 December 2006 |work=United Nations website [/tpl]
On 31 January 2006, Kofi Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK. The speech, delivered at Central Hall, Westminster, also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the UN General Assembly and UN Security Council.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17358&Cr=Iran&Cr1=nuclear |title=Annan addresses UNA-UK in London |accessdate=5 August 2007 |work=United Nations website [/tpl]

Regarding the UN Human Rights Council, Annan has said "declining credibility" had "cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system. Unless we re-make our human rights machinery, we may be unable to renew public confidence in the United Nations itself." However, he does believe that, despite its flaws, the council can do good.[tpl]cite web|last=Annan|first=Kofi|title=Kofi Annan: Despite flaws, UN Human Rights Council can bring progress|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/1208/Kofi-Annan-Despite-flaws-UN-Human-Rights-Council-can-bring-progress|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=December 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Halvorssen|first=Thor|title=Chavez and Nazarbayev Celebrate Tyrannical Victory at U.N.

==Post-UN career==

Upon his return to Ghana, Annan was immediately suggested as a candidate to become the country's next President.Annan 'for president': Africa: News: News24[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]
He has become involved with several organizations with both global and African focuses. In 2007, Annan was named chairman of the prize committee for the Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership, was chosen to lead the new formation of Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), was appointed president of the Global Humanitarian Forum in Geneva, and was selected for the MacArthur Foundation Award for International Justice.
