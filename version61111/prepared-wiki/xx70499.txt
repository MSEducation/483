CATEGORIES: Executive toys

An executive toy (or office toy or desk toy) is a novelty item that is usually a small mechanical gadget placed on the desk of a corporate executive or other office workers. They have no work-related function, but are usually interesting to look at and entertaining.

==History==

An early executive toy may have been a gadget designed by the mathematician and engineer Philo of Byzantium (c. 280 BC â€“ c. 220 BC), which was an octagon-shaped ink pot with openings on each side. One could turn the pot so that any face is on top and dip the pen in the opening, but the ink never ran out through the holes on other sides. The interior inkwell was suspended in the centre on a series of gimbals and remained upright in spite of any rotation.* Piter James, and Nick Thorpe. Ancient Inventions, ISBN 0-345-40102-6
Ancient Chinese emperors and nobles often collected natural and man-made curios, such as multiple concentric carved ivory spheres, or chains carved from a single piece of jade.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The European cabinet of curiosities, or "Wunderkammer" often included devices that were ancestors of modern executive toys, including clockwork automata.
