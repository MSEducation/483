==Early life==

Caven has no sight in his right eye, after being stung by a bee when he was 18 months old.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,15619_4621131,00.html | title=Playing a blinder | publisher=Sky Sports | accessdate=20 March 2013[/tpl] At the age of 17, Caven won the World Youth Masters. When he was 20, tumours were found in his pancreas resulting in its removal and his requirement to have four insulin injections a day for the rest of his life. This is where his darts nickname Jabba originated.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.unicorn-darts.com/team/contenders/jamie-caven.aspx | title=Jamie Caven Profile | publisher=Unicorn Darts | accessdate=20 March 2013[/tpl]
