[[Transport in Kuwait]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Kuwait

As an oil rich nation, Transport in Kuwait is largely road based, one car for every 2.25 people. Bus services make up Kuwait's entire public transport network, as the country has no rail infrastructure. Several railways are planned, including a Kuwait City metro. Kuwait has several maritime ports along the Persian Gulf. There are seven airports, the largest of which is Kuwait International Airport.

Kuwait doesn't have any rail infrastructure, though increasing congestion on the country's roads has led to several railway projects being planned.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/kuwaitmetrosystem/|title=Kuwait Metro System, Kuwait City, Kuwait|publisher=railway-technology.com|accessdate=16 March 2013[/tpl] Kuwait City would form one terminus of the proposed Gulf Railway, a [tpl]convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] railway network which will run from Kuwait to Oman, via cities across the Gulf.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.visit-kuwait.com/500-Single-rail-network-to-link-Kuwait-&-Oman-by-2017.html|title=Single rail network to link Kuwait & Oman by 2017|publisher=Visit Kuwait|accessdate=16 March 2013[/tpl]A four line, [tpl]convert|171|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], metro network within Kuwait city is also in the planning stages.Railway Gazette International July 2008 p409 with map[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/kuwait-finalising-ambitious-metro-plans.html | title=Kuwait finalising ambitious metro plans  | date=22 May 2008 | publisher=Railway Gazette International[/tpl]
