==Cause==

Mumps is a contagious disease that is spread from person to person through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva from an infected person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Mumps can also be spread by sharing food and drinks. The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner.
A person infected with mumps is contagious from approximately 6 days before the onset of symptoms until about 9 days after symptoms start.[tpl]Citation |publication-date=January 11, 2011 |title=Mumps - Symptoms |work=NHS Choices |publisher=National Health Service |publication-place=England |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Mumps/Pages/Symptoms.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]Letter:Compliance with Exclusion Requirements to Prevent Mumps Transmission, By Stephanie M.

==Diagnosis==

A physical examination confirms the presence of the swollen glands. Usually, the disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and no confirmatory laboratory testing is needed. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, a test of saliva or blood may be carried out; a newer diagnostic confirmation, using real-time nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, has also been developed. An estimated 20%-30% of cases are asymptomatic.  As with any inflammation of the salivary glands, serum amylase is often elevated.Amylase: The Test, Lab Tests Online UK[tpl]cite journal |author=Skrha J, Stĕpán J, Sixtová E |title=Amylase isoenzymes in mumps |journal=Eur.

==Prevention==

The most common preventative measure against mumps is a vaccination with a mumps vaccine, invented by American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman at Merck.[tpl]cite book |author=Offit PA |title=Vaccinated: One Man's Quest to Defeat the World's Deadliest Diseases |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian |isbn=0-06-122796-X |year=2007 [/tpl] The vaccine may be given separately or as part of the MMR immunization vaccine which also protects against measles and rubella. In the US, MMR is now being supplanted by MMRV, which adds protection against chickenpox. The WHO (World Health Organization) recommends the use of mumps vaccines in all countries with well-functioning childhood vaccination programmes. In the United Kingdom it is routinely given to children at age 13 months with a booster at 3–5 years(preschool) This confers lifelong immunity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the routine administration of MMR vaccine at ages 12–15 months and at 4–6 years.[ref]
