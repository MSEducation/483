In 1929 he joined another band, the Blues Syncopaters led by Ben Smith, and also worked around the same time in bands led by Earl Dykes, Gene Coy, Lloyd Hunter and Alphonse Trent.

He remained with the band after Moten's death in 1935, when its leadership was taken over by Count Basie, and stayed with the Basie orchestra until 1941.  During that period he performed at the From Spirituals to Swing concerts in New York City in 1938 and 1939.From Spirituals to Swing, liner notes, Definitive Records CD reissue, 2001  However, Minor tended to be overshadowed by other trombonists such as Benny Morton and Vic Dickenson, and rarely took solos.   He joined the Buddy Johnson band in 1942, and also played around that time with Cab Calloway.  He worked with Mercer Ellington in 1945, and also recorded and played with Lucky Millinder and Willie Bryant.
After the 1940s, through to the 1960s, he continued to perform occasionally on a freelance basis.  He died in New York City in 1982 at the age of 72.
