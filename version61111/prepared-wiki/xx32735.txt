The political structure of the Republic was amended by a decree on October 3, 1835, when the centralist system was established.
The constituent states of the Republic lost their freedom, autonomy, independence, and sovereignty by being totally subordinated to the central government. However, the territorial division itself was the same; the text of Article 8 of the Law determined: The national territory is divided into departments, on the basis of population, location and other leading circumstances: its number, extension and subdivisions, would be detailed by constitutional law."Bases Constitucionales Expedidas por el Congreso Constituyente", en Felipe Tena Ramírez", Op.cit. p. 203
The Seven Constitutional Laws ([tpl]lang-es|Siete Leyes Constitucionales[/tpl]) were promulgated on December 30, 1836.[tpl]cite news | title=La Suprema Corte en las Constituciones Centralistas.| url=http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/2/721/37.pdf| language =Spanish[/tpl] The 1st article confirmed the decree of the law October 3, 1835; the Republic would be divided into departments, these in districts and the districts in parties. The 2nd article pointed that the division of the Republic in departments would be under a special law with constitutional character.[tpl]cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 27).| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish[/tpl] On December 30, 1835, a transitory decree was added to the Seven Laws. The decree stated that the territory of Tlaxcala and the Federal District would become a part of the Department of Mexico. The territories of Alta and Baja California would form the department of the Californias. Coahuila y Texas would be divided into two departments. Colima would form part of Michoacán and Aguascalientes would be declared a department.
This period of political instability caused several conflicts between the central government and the entities of the country. There were rebellions in several states such as:[tpl]cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 28)| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish[/tpl]
On September 11, 1842, the region of Soconusco joined Mexico as part of the department of Chiapas.

===Restoration of the Republic and Second Empire===

The Federal Republic was restored by the interim president José Mariano Salas on August 22, 1846. The state of Guerrero was erected in 1849 (provisionally), conditioned to the acceptance of the legislatures of the states of México, Puebla and Michoacán; which would be affected in their territories.
On February 5, 1857, was enacted the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857. On 1864, however, after the French intervention, the conservative Mexicans restored the constitutional monarchy, known as the Second Mexican Empire, led by the emperor Maximilian of Habsburg and supported by the French army of Napoleon III. The Empire was deposed in 1867 by the republican forces of Benito Juarez and the Federal Republic was restored again under the Constitution of 1857.
The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917 was the result of the Mexican Revolution. The third Constitution of Mexico confirmed the federal system of government that is currently in force.[tpl]cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 29)| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish[/tpl]
