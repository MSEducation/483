Namtar (or Namtaru, or Namtara; meaning destiny or fate), was a hellish minor deity in Mesopotamian mythology, god of death, and minister and messenger of An, Ereshkigal, and Nergal.Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary By Jeremy A. Black, Anthony Green, p 134http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/Namtar
Namtar was the son of Enlil anid Ereshkigal; he was born before his father raped the goddess Ninlil. Namtar was considered responsible for diseases and pests. It was said that he commanded sixty diseases in the form of demons that could penetrate different parts of the human body; offerings to him were made to prevent those illnesses. It is thought that the Assyrians and Babylonians took this belief from the Sumerians after conquering them. To some they were the spirit of fate, and therefore of great importance. Apparently they executed the instructions given him concerning the fate of men, and could also have power over certain of the gods. In other writings they were regarded as the personification of death, much like the modern concept of the Grim Reaper.Mesopotamian religion and Ereshkigal under Encyclopædia BritannicaThe Doctrine of Sin in the Babylonian Religion By Julian Morgenstern, Paul Tice p 18-19.Myths of Babylonia and Assyria By Donald A. Mackenzie p.178
In the story of Ishtar's Descent to earth, acting as Ereshkigal's 'messenger', Namtar curses Ishtar with 60 diseases, naming five of the head, feet, side, eyes, and heart, after she arrives to earth.An Encyclopaedia of Religions by Maurice Arthur Canney p. 258
Namtar was regarded as the beloved son of Bêl/Enlil, and was married to the underworld goddess Hušbišag.
