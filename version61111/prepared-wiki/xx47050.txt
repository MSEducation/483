Coulon went on to be defeated by the New Democratic Party's Thomas Mulcair in the by-election.[tpl]cite news|title=NDP take Outremont|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=90fd99ba-7462-4b2a-8433-424388603d69|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=18 September 2007[/tpl]
In May 2007, Garneau filed nomination papers to be the party's candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie, after former Liberal Party Deputy Leader Lucienne Robillard announced she would not be seeking re-election. However, a week after filing his nomination papers Dion announced that he had hand-picked a candidate for the riding. Garneau later withdrew his nomination papers and announced he no longer had an interest in politics. In October 2007, Garneau and Dion held a joint news conference where they announced that Garneau would be the Liberal Party candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie. Garneau stated he changed his mind about running for politics after meeting with Dion. Robillard announced her resignation as Member of Parliament in January and a by-election was later scheduled for September 8, 2008.[tpl]cite news|last=Larsen|first=Wayne|title=Garneau looks forward to by-election|url=http://www.westmountexaminer.com/LocalNews/2008-06-11/article-1538211/Garneau-looks-forward-to-byelection/1|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Montréal Express|date=11 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Harper calls three federal byelections for early September|url=http://www.paherald.sk.ca/Politics/2008-07-25/article-177179/Harper-calls-three-federal-byelections-for-early-September/1|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=Canadian Press|date=25 July 2008[/tpl] However, the by-election was cancelled during the campaign when Prime Minister Stephen Harper called a general election for October 14, 2008. Though some pundits predicted a close race between Garneau and NDP candidate Anne Lagacé-Dowson, Garneau went on to win the riding by over 9,000 votes.[tpl]cite news|title=Tight Liberal/NDP race predicted for Westmount-Ville Marie by-election|url=http://www.westislandchronicle.com/News/Politics/2008-08-13/article-636167/Tight-Liberal-NDP-race-predicted-for-Westmount-Ville-Marie-by-election/1|accessdate=21 October 2012|newspaper=The West Island Chronicle|date=13 August 2008[/tpl]

On November 21, 2012, Garneau was named his party's Natural Resources critic after David McGuinty resigned the post after saying that Conservative members of Parliament from Alberta "really should go back to Alberta" and run for the Alberta legislature or municipal office if they were not willing to adopt a national outlook with regards to energy.[tpl]cite news|title=MP McGuinty drops critic role over 'go back to Alberta' gibe|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/11/21/pol-david-mcguinty-.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=21 November 2012[/tpl] On January 30, 2013, Garneau was replaced as Natural Resources critic by Ted Hsu.

Garneau took an aggressive stand against perceived frontrunner Justin Trudeau, arguing that Trudeau had not released enough substantial positions to be elected leader and suggesting unnamed previous Liberal Leaders had similarly not been vetted, and that the results had been disastrous.[tpl]citation|title=Garneau Calls on Trudeau to Take a Stand|url=http://marcgarneau.ca/garneau-calls-on-trudeau-to-take-a-stand/|accessdate=19 February 2012[/tpl]
