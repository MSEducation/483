===Television series===

During the summer of 2006, TNT produced an eight-episode miniseries on various short stories by Stephen King. Although one may assume from the title that all of the episodes in the miniseries are from the collection of the same name, this is true for only five of the eight ("Battleground" was featured in Night Shift and "The Road Virus Heads North" and "Autopsy Room Four" appear in Everything's Eventual).
