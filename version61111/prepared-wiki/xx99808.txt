[[Cartan decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Lie algebras

The Cartan decomposition is a decomposition of a semisimple Lie group or Lie algebra, which plays an important role in their structure theory and representation theory.  It generalizes the polar decomposition or singular value decomposition of matrices.  Its history can be traced to the 1880s work of Ã‰lie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing. http://books.google.com/books?id=udj-1UuaOiIC&pg=PA46&dq=history+cartan+decomposition&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aa-wUuCDEMGmkQfNqoHABg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=history%20cartan%20decomposition&f=false

==Cartan involutions on Lie algebras==

Any real semisimple Lie algebra has a Cartan involution, and any two Cartan involutions are equivalent.

===Examples===

==Cartan pairs==

==Cartan decomposition on the Lie group level==

In the compact and noncompact case this Lie algebraic result implies the decomposition
