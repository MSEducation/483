Crvena Zvezda finished top of the table in regular season, although the club didn't play its last round match against Maccabi, since the Israeli club didn't travel to Belgrade due to the state of emergency proclaimed following the March 2003 assassination of Serbian prime minister Zoran Đinđić. ABA awarded the game to Crvena Zvezda. In first match in Tel Aviv Crvena Zvezda defeated Maccabi.
