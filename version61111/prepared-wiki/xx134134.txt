==Criticism of Ken Loach==

Following the Cannes prize announcement, for The Wind That Shakes the Barley, Ruth Dudley Edwards wrote in the Daily Mail on 30 May 2006 that Loach's political viewpoint "requires the portrayal of the British as sadists and the Irish as romantic, idealistic resistance fighters who take to violence only because there is no other self-respecting course,""Why does Ken Loach loathe his country so much?" The Daily Mail, 30 May 2006 and attacked his career in an article."Ken Loach hits back at English tabloids" Indymedia Ireland, 1 June 2006 The following week, Edwards continued her attack in The Guardian, admitting that her first article was written without seeing the film (which at that stage had only been shown at Cannes), and asserting that she would never see it "because I can't stand its sheer predictability.""What about making Black and Tans: the movie?" The Guardian, 6 June 2006
