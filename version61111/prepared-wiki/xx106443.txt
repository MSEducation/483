[tpl]Audio|De-Bernt_Notke.ogg|Bernt Notke[/tpl] (born c. 1435 in Lassan in Pomerania; died winter 1508/1509 in Lübeck) was the most important German painter and sculptor in Northern Europe in his times.
Most famous is his sculpture Sankt Göran och Draken (Saint George and the Dragon) for the Storkyrkan in Stockholms Gamla stan. An exact copy of this sculpture is at St. Catherine's Church in Lübeck. The statue had been commissioned by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder, to commemorate Sture's victory over King Christian I of Denmark in the 1471 Battle of Brunkeberg. 
He is the creator of the world's largest triumphal cross, in Lübeck Cathedral.
His Danse Macabre in St. Mary was destroyed in the course of the Bombing of Lübeck in World War II.
Parts of his Danse Macabre for Reval are saved in St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn.
The trade with sacral art went as far as Northern Norway. There is an altar from Notke in Trondenes Church near Harstad.
