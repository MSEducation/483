Genesis of a Music is a book first published in 1947 by microtonal composer Harry Partch (1901–1974).
Partch first presents a polemic against both equal temperament and the long history of stagnation in the teaching of music; according to Alex Ross, this is "the most startling forty-five-page history of music ever written". In particular, Partch holds Johann Sebastian Bach responsible for a downhill trend in music, holding him responsible for "the movement toward equal-tempered tuning, which meant that composers could not absorb the scales of other world traditions; and the urge to make music ever more instrumental and abstract."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/18/050418crmu_music|title=Off the Rails|last=Ross|first=Alex|date=18 April 2005|work=The New Yorker|page=199|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl]
He then goes on to explain his tuning theory based on just intonation, the ensemble of musical instruments of his own invention (such as the "Surrogate Kithara, a struck-string, harplike instrument",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/162953/|title=New York Songs of the Open Road|last=Gann|first=Kyle|date=23 January 2001|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl] and the guitar with movable frets he used to compose Barstow[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2009-05-28/music/harry-partch-39-s-boxcar-revelations/|title=Harry Partch's Boxcar Revelations|last=Payne|first=John|date=27 May 2009|work=Los Angeles Weekly|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl]), and several of his largest musical compositions.
The book has been highly influential to succeeding generations of microtonal composers, including Lou Harrison,[tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.chronogram.com/issue/2011/10/Music/Lou-Harrison-Outsider-Inside|title=Lou Harrison: Outsider Inside|last=Aaron|first=Peter|date=29 September 2011|work=Chronogram|accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl] Ben Johnston,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.isthmus.com/daily/article.php?article=25644|title=They score!
