==History==

The town of Northfield first authorized a bridge at or near the site of the current bridge in 1810. The bridge was built by a private corporation with the town holding stock. The new bridge was destroyed in a flood after only a few years. A horse boat ferry, known as Bennett's Meadow Ferry, replaced the river crossing.J.H. Temple,G. Sheldon, and M.T. Stratton, A History of the Town of Northfield, (J. Munsell, 1875) In 1897, the state legislature authorized Franklin County to construct a second bridge at or near the site of the ferry at a cost not to exceed $35,000. The new bridge was designed by Edward Shaw of Boston and was opened to traffic in 1899.Massachusetts General Court, Acts of 1897, Chapter 497 The bridge was one of the first bridges erected by a then novel method without the use of false works that has since become standard procedure."A Novel Method of Bridge Erection; Connecticut River Bridge, Northfield, Mass.", Engineering News, Sept. 7, 1899. The 1899 bridge was later demolished and a third bridge (the current bridge) was constructed just south of the former bridge, resulting also in the slight realignment of the highway.
