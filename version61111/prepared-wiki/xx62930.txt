==Life and career==

Maiman was born in Los Angeles, California, to Abraham "Abe" Maiman, an electrical engineer and inventor, and Rose Abramson. At a young age his family moved to Denver, Colorado, where he helped his father with experimentation in a home electronics laboratory. In his teens Maiman earned money by repairing electrical appliances and radios,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1551179/Theodore-Maiman.html |title=Theodore Maiman |date=11 May 2007 |publisher=The Telegraph[/tpl] and after leaving high school was employed as a junior engineer with the National Union Radio Company at age 17.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.laserinventor.com/bio.html |title=Laser Inventor, Biography of Theodore Maiman from laserinventor.com |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl]
Following a year's service in the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II,[tpl]Cite book |first=Rod |last=Waters |title=Maiman's Invention of the Laser: How Science Fiction Became Reality |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing |year=2013 |url=http://www.maimanbook.com |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] he earned a B.S. in Engineering Physics from the University of Colorado. Maiman then went on to graduate studies at Stanford University where he earned an M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1951 and a PhD in Physics in 1955. His doctoral thesis in experimental physics, under the direction of Willis Lamb, involved detailed microwave-optical measurements of fine structural splittings in excited helium atoms. He also devised laboratory instrumentation for Lamb’s experiments. Maiman published two articles jointly with Lamb in Physical Review, the second of which was based on his own thesis research.[tpl]Cite journal |first1=T.

In 1956 Maiman started work with the Atomic Physics Department of the Hughes Aircraft Company (later Hughes Research Laboratories or HRL Laboratories) in California where he led the ruby maser redesign project for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, reducing it from a 2.5-ton cryogenic device to 4 pounds while improving its performance.[tpl]rp|88[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title=Oral History Transcript– Dr. Irnee D’Haenens - Interview |first=Joan |last=Bromberg |date=5 February 1985 |publisher=American Institute of Physics, Niels Bohr Library & Archives |url=http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5015.html |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] As a result of this success Maiman persuaded Hughes management to use company funds to support his laser project beginning in mid-1959. On a total budget of $50,000, Maiman turned to the development of a laser based on his own design with a synthetic ruby crystal, which other scientists seeking to make a laser felt would not work.[tpl]Cite journal |first=George F. |last=Smith |date=June 1984 |title=The Early Laser Years at Hughes Aircraft Company |journal=IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics QE-20 |volume=6 |pages=577-584 |others=excerpted as "Maiman’s Work" HRL Laboratories |url=http://www.hrl.com/lasers/pdfs/maiman_work.pdf[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |author=Theodore H.

Maiman had begun conceptualizing a solid-state laser design even before he undertook the maser project at Hughes.[tpl]rp|45[/tpl][tpl]rp|88[/tpl] Moving the microwave frequency of masers up the electromagnetic spectrum 50,000-fold to the frequency of light would require finding a feasible lasing medium and excitation source and designing the system.[tpl]rp|34-37[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title=Lasers |edition=2nd |publisher= Wiley-Interscience |last= Lengyel |first=Bela A. |year=1971 |isbn=0-471-52620-7 |pages=41-42[/tpl] Other major research groups at IBM, Bell Labs, MIT, Westinghouse, RCA, Columbia University, among others, were also pursuing projects to develop a laser.[tpl]rp|7[/tpl][tpl]rp|45[/tpl] Their work was stimulated by a 1958 paper by Arthur L. Schawlow and Charles H. Townes offering theoretical analysis and a proposal for a gaseous system using potassium vapor excited by a potassium lamp.[tpl]rp|216[/tpl][tpl]rp|92[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last1=Schawlow |first1=A.L. |last2=Townes |first2=C.H. |date=December 1958 |title=Infrared and Optical Masers |journal=Physical Review |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=1940-1949[/tpl] However, Maiman identified multiple flaws in the Schawlow-Townes proposal and pursued his own solid-state design.[tpl]rp|111[/tpl][tpl]rp|151-156[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2800106 |first=Irnee J. |last=D’Haenens |date=October 2007 |title=Obituary: Theodore Harold Maiman |journal=Physics Today |volume=60 |issue=10 |page=72[/tpl] His successful design utilized synthetic pink ruby crystal as the lasing medium and a spiral xenon flash lamp as the excitation source.[tpl]rp|226-234[/tpl][tpl]rp|170-182[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last=Lengyel |first=Bela A. |year=1966 |title=Introduction to Laser Physics |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |pages=90-101[/tpl] As Townes later wrote, "Maiman's laser had several aspects not considered in our theoretical paper, nor discussed by others before the ruby demonstration."[tpl]rp|108[/tpl]
Following his invention of the laser, in 1961 Maiman and seven colleagues departed Hughes to join the newly formed Quantatron company, which grew in-house ruby crystals for lasers. In 1962 Maiman founded and became the president of the Korad Corporation, which manufactured high-power ruby lasers. After Korad was fully acquired by Union Carbide in 1968, Maiman left to found Maiman Associates, a venture capital firm. In 1971 Maiman founded the Laser Video Corporation, and from 1976 to 1983 he worked as vice president for advanced technology at TRW Electronics (now Northrup Grumman).[tpl]rp|232[/tpl] He later served as consultant to Laser Centers of America, Inc. (now LCA-Vision Inc.) and director of Control Laser Corporation. Maiman continued his involvement in laser developments and applications. In addition to his patent for the first working laser, Maiman authored a number of patents on masers, lasers, laser displays, optical scanning, and modulation.[tpl]Cite web |title=Laser Pioneer Ted Maiman Dies at 79 |publisher=LaserFocusWorld |date=15 May 2007 |url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/oer/print/volume-14/issue-10/features/laser-pioneer-ted-maiman-dies-at-79.html |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl]

==Awards and recognition==

Maiman received numerous prizes, awards, and accolades over the years for his development of the first laser. He was given membership in both the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering. He was made a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Optical Society of America (OSA), and the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). In 1962 Maiman was awarded the Franklin Institute’s Stuart Ballantine Medal for physics.[tpl]Cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology |editors=Lance Day, Ian McNeil |year=1996 |page=796 |isbn=9781134650200 |url=http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=m8TsygLyfSMC&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl] In 1966 Maiman received the American Physical Society’s Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize and the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Award for distinguished contribution in the field of science, presented in a White House ceremony by President Lyndon B. Johnson.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=27564 |others=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley |author=Lyndon B.

He was the recipient of the 1983/84 Wolf Prize in Physics and was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame that year.[tpl]Cite web |publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame |title=Inventor Profile: Theodore Harold Maiman |url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/96.html |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] In 1987 Maiman was awarded the Japan Prize in Electro-Optics for "realization of the world's first laser."[tpl]Cite web |publisher=The Japan Prize Foundation |title=Laureates |url=http://www.japanprize.jp/en/laureates_by_nameK-O.html |accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl] In 1994 he was inducted as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the only non-physician, non-royal member. Many universities granted Maiman honorary degrees, with the last from Simon Fraser University in 2002.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:List_of_IEEE_Milestones |title=List of IEEE Milestones |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=3 August 2011[/tpl]
Recognition for Maiman and his laser invention continued posthumously. In a 2007 obituary testimonial, maser co-inventor Charles H. Townes described Maiman's 1960 Nature article on his laser as "probably more important per word than any of the papers published by Nature over the past century."[tpl]Cite journal |first=Charles H. |last=Townes |date=7 June 2007 |title=Obituary: Theodore H.
