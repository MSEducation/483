Beta Virginis (β Vir, β Virginis) is a star in the constellation Virgo. It has the traditional names Zavijava (also Zavijah) and Alaraph.Atlas of the Heavens, part II, catalogue, Antonín Bečvář Despite being the beta star of the constellation Virgo it is only the fifth star in order of brightness.
Physically, Beta Virginis is larger and more massive than the Sun, and is comparatively metal-rich (that is, it has a higher preponderance of elements heavier than helium).[ref]

Since it is close to the ecliptic, it can be occulted by the Moon and (very rarely) by planets. The next planetary occultation of Zavijava will take place on 11 August 2069, by Venus. 
This was the star Einstein used during the solar eclipse of September 21, 1922, to determine the speed of light in space,[tpl]Dubious|date=March 2012[/tpl] as it was close to the Sun.

==Etymology==

The medieval name Zavijava (Zavijah, Zavyava, Zawijah) is from the Arabic زاوية العواء zāwiyat al-cawwa’ "Corner of the barking (dog)". Another name was Alaraph.

==Hunt for substellar objects==

According to Nelson & Angel (1998),The Range of Masses and Periods Explored by Radial Velocity Searches for Planetary Companions Beta Virginis could host two or three jovian planets in wide orbits. The authors have set an upper limit of 1.9, 5 and 23 Jupiter masses for the putative planets with orbital periods of 15, 25 and 50 years respectively. Also Campbell et al. 1988A search for substellar companions to southern solar-type stars inferred the existence of planetary objects or even brown dwarfs around Beta Virginis.
However more recent studies have not confirmed the existence of any substellar companion around Beta Virginis yet. McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets Detection Limits from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search Program with masses between 0.16 and 4.2 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 Astronomical Units.
