[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]

CATEGORIES: Johannes Kepler, Orbits, Equations, Copernican Revolution

In astronomy, Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun. Kepler's laws are now traditionally enumerated in this way:
Most planetary orbits are almost circles, so it is not apparent that they are actually ellipses. Calculations of the orbit of the planet Mars first indicated to Kepler its elliptical shape, and he inferred that other heavenly bodies, including those farther away from the Sun, have elliptical orbits also. Kepler's work broadly followed the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus by asserting that the Earth orbited the Sun. It innovated in explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with epicycles.
Isaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the solar system to a good approximation, as consequences of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation. Together with Newton's theories, Kepler's laws became part of the foundation of modern astronomy and physics.See also G. E. Smith, "Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica", especially the section Historical context ... in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).

==Nomenclature==

It took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. Voltaire's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of "laws". The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers in its article on Kepler (p. 620) states that the terminology of scientific laws for these discoveries was current at least from the time of Joseph de Lalande. It was the exposition of Robert Small, in An account of the astronomical discoveries of Kepler (1804) that made up the set of three laws, by adding in the third. Small also claimed, against the history, that these were empirical laws, based on inductive reasoning.
Further, the current usage of "Kepler's Second Law" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two versions of it, related in a qualitative sense, the "distance law" and the "area law". The "area law" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.[tpl]cite book|author=Bruce Stephenson|title=Kepler's Physical Astronomy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pxCYAeOqJg8C&pg=PA170|year=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03652-7|page=170[/tpl]

==History==

Johannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe. Kepler's third law was published in 1619.
Kepler in 1622 and Godefroy Wendelin in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter.Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits, showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law.  See:  Joanne Baptista Riccioli, Almagestum novum … (Bologna (Bononiae), (Italy):  Victor Benati, 1651), volume 1, page 492 Scholia III.  In the margin beside the relevant paragraph is printed: Vendelini ingeniosa speculatio circa motus & intervalla satellitum Jovis.  (The clever Wendelin's speculation about the movement and distances of Jupiter's satellites.) In 1622, Johannes Kepler had noted that Jupiter's moons obey (approximately) his third law in his Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae of Copernican Astronomy (Linz (“Lentiis ad Danubium“), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, page 554. The second law ("area law" form) was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664; but by 1670 he was publishing in its favour in Philosophical Transactions, and as the century proceeded it became more widely accepted.[tpl]cite book|author=Wilbur Applebaum|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k43Q9RHuGXgC&pg=PT603|date=13 June 2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-58255-5|page=603[/tpl] The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published.[tpl]cite book|author=Roy Porter|title=The Scientific Revolution in National Context|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l61fl6Z1sxQC&pg=PA102|date=25 September 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39699-8|page=102[/tpl]

==First Law==

Mathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:
where (r, θ) are polar coordinates, d is the focal parameter, and ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse.
Note that 0 For a planet r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun.
At θ = 0°,  perihelion, the distance is minimum 
At θ = 90° and at θ = 270°, the distance is equal to the semi-latus rectum.
At θ = 180°, aphelion,  the distance is maximum 
The semi-major axis a is the arithmetic mean between rmin and rmax:
The semi-minor axis b is the geometric mean between rmin and rmax:
The semi-latus rectum p is the harmonic mean between rmin and rmax:
The eccentricity ε is the coefficient of variation between rmin and rmax:
The area of the ellipse is
The special case of a circle is ε = 0, resulting in r = p =  rmin = rmax = a = b and A = π r2.

==Second law==

This law relates radial distance and angular velocity in eliptical orbits. That is, in a perfectly circular orbit, the orbital radius of the satellite would be constant and therefore so would be its observed angular velocity. In elliptical orbits, the orbital radius of the satellite will vary and therefore so will its angular velocity. This is shown in the above animation where the satellite travels "faster" (greater angular velocity) when closer to the parent object, then "slower" (less angular velocity) at a more distant radius. The result is that the blue sectors are shorter but wider when close to the body, then longer but narrower at a greater distance. Kepler's 2nd law states that for a given elliptical orbit, any two sectors of equal time duration will have the same area. This implies that radial distance and angular velocity have an inversely proportional relationship in a given orbit; angular velocity is minimum at apoapsis and maximum at periapsis. The constant of proportionality is the rate at which area in the ellipse is covered.

===Mathematical derivation===

The planet moves faster when it is closer to the Sun.
The area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is
So the period
satisfies
and the mean motion of the planet around the Sun 
satisfies

==Third law==

The third law, published by Kepler in 1619 http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Skeplaws.htm captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.
Kepler enunciated this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the "music of the spheres" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.Burtt, Edwin. The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science. p. 52.
So it used to be known as the harmonic law.[tpl]cite book |title=Physics, the Human Adventure |author=Gerald James Holton, Stephen G.

The modern formulation with the constant evaluated reads:
with

==Zero eccentricity==

Kepler's laws refine the model of Copernicus, which assumed circular orbits. If the eccentricity of a planetary orbit is zero, then Kepler's laws state:
Actually, the eccentricities of the orbits of the six planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are quite small, so the rules above give excellent approximations of planetary motion, but Kepler's laws fit observations even better.
Kepler's corrections to the Copernican model are not at all obvious:
The nonzero eccentricity of the orbit of the earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox, around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately
which is close to the correct value (0.016710219). (See Earth's orbit).
The calculation is correct when the perihelion, the date that the Earth is closest to the Sun, is on a solstice. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice on December 21 or 22.

==Planetary acceleration==

Isaac Newton computed in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.
This suggests that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets.
Newton defined the force on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration. (See Newton's laws of motion). So:
Here the Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed Newton's law of universal gravitation:
As the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform to Kepler's laws approximately. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model and fits actual observations more accurately. (See two-body problem).
A deviation in the motion of a planet from Kepler's laws due to the gravity of other planets is called a perturbation.
Below comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.

===Acceleration vector===

So differentiating the position vector twice to obtain the velocity and the acceleration vectors:
So
where the radial acceleration is
and the transversal acceleration is

===The inverse square law===

Kepler's laws say that
is constant.
So the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's laws is directed towards the sun.
Kepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:
Differentiating with respect to time
or
Differentiating once more
Substituting the equation of the ellipse gives
where 
The inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit.

===Newton's law of gravitation===

By Newton's second law, the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:
The acceleration of solar system body number i is, according to Newton's laws:
In the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes
which is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.
If the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes
So in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.
In the three-body case the accelerations are
These accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the three-body problem is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is basis for perturbation calculations. See Lunar theory.

==Position as a function of time [tpl]anchor|position_function_time[/tpl]==

Kepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation.
The procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (r,θ) of a planet as a function of the time t since perihelion, is the following four steps:
The important special case of circular orbit, ε = 0, gives θ = E = M. Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be normal, a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly.
The proof of this procedure is shown below.

===Mean anomaly, M===

The Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:
and 
The problem is to compute the polar coordinates (r,θ) of the planet from the time since perihelion, t.
It is solved in steps. Kepler considered the circle with the major axis as a diameter, and 
The area swept since perihelion, 
is by Kepler's second law proportional to time since perihelion. So the mean anomaly, M, is proportional to time since perihelion, t.
where n is the mean motion.

===Eccentric anomaly, E===

When the mean anomaly M is computed, the goal is to compute the true anomaly θ. The function θ=f(M) is, however, not elementary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.ifpan.edu.pl/firststep/aw-works/fsII/mul/mueller.html|title=EQUATION OF TIME -- PROBLEM IN ASTRONOMY|last=MÜLLER|first=M|year=1995|publisher=Acta Physica Polonica A|accessdate=23 February 2013[/tpl] Kepler's solution is to use 
as an intermediate variable, and first compute E as a function of M by solving Kepler's equation below, and then compute the true anomaly θ from the eccentric anomaly E. Here are the details.
Division by a2/2 gives Kepler's equation
This equation gives M as a function of E. Determining E for a given M is the inverse problem. Iterative numerical algorithms are commonly used.
Having computed the eccentric anomaly E, the next step is to calculate the true anomaly θ.

===True anomaly, θ===

Note from the figure that
so that
to get
The result is a usable relationship between the eccentric anomaly E and the true anomaly θ.
A computationally more convenient form follows by substituting into the trigonometric identity:
Get
Multiplying by 1+ε gives the result
This is the third step in the connection between time and position in the orbit.

===Distance, r===

The fourth step is to compute the heliocentric distance r from the true anomaly θ by Kepler's first law:
