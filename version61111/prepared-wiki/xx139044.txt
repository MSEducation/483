Stod is a former municipality in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway.  The municipality originally encompassed the northern part of the present-day municipality of Steinkjer, stretching from the town of Steinkjer along the lake Snåsavatnet to the municipal border with Snåsa.  The old municipality administration was in the village of Binde.  The main church for Stod was For Church, located just south of the administrative center.  The local sports team is Stod IL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://snl.no/Stod./kommune|title=Stod. – kommune|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl]
Stod is best known for rock carvings in the Bølareinen field that are approximately 6000 years old.  The carvings are of animals and humans.  There are several other prehistoric sites, including two stone circles, one on the Nordgård farm and one at the rectory, both of which are partially destroyed.  
Traditionally, agriculture and forestry were the major industries in Stod, but construction of the Nordlandsbanen railway brought with it new jobs and a dairy.  Today most residents of Stod work in the town of Steinkjer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.steinkjerleksikonet.no/index.php?artikkel=815|title=Stod kommune|author=Steinkjerleksikonet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-07-16[/tpl]

==History==

The parish of Stod was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).  On 23 January 1858, the town of Steinkjer was established with a population of 1,150.  The new town was separated from Stod to constitute its own municipality leaving Stod with 3,471 residents. 
On 1 January 1869, the western district of Egge (population: 941) was separated from Stod to form its own municipality.  This left Stod with 2,530 inhabitants.  On 1 January 1909, the northern district of Kvam (population: 1,169) became a separate municipality, leaving Stod with 934 inhabitants.  
On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place:  the municipalities of Stod, Egge, Kvam, Ogndal, Beitstad, and Sparbu were merged with the town of Steinkjer to form the new municipality of Steinkjer. Prior to the merger, Stod had a population of 1,268.[tpl]cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian[/tpl]
