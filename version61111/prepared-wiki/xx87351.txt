[[Osgoode Main Street]]

CATEGORIES: Roads in Ottawa

Osgoode Main Street is the name of a street in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Until recently it was known as Main Street. The name was changed however to Osgoode Main Street so as not to confuse it with the Main Street located a little closer to the city centre. Osgoode Main Street is actually located in the Town of Osgoode, Ontario, but is within the City of Ottawa jurisdiction due to a recent amalgamation. This consequently resulted in its name change. Osgoode Main Street serves as the Main Street of Osgoode, and it is also known as Ottawa Road #114. It runs from River Road in the west to Stagecoach Road in the east. The eastern junction is in the community of West Osgoode, Ontario (which ironically is east of the town of Osgoode).
