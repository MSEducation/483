After leading the National League Wild Card race for most of the season, the Giants were ultimately passed by the Colorado Rockies. The team finished third in the NL West and second in the Wild Card. Though they missed the playoffs, the Giants surpassed most expectations for their season; for example, Sports Illustrated projected that the Giants would finish with a record of 77–85.[tpl]Citation |title=SI's 2009 MLB Scouting Reports |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/03/30/scouting.reports/index.html |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2009[/tpl] Sports Illustrated's Lee Jenkins noted San Francisco's promising farm system (including products Pablo Sandoval and Madison Bumgarner) and the perceived weakness of the NL West as reasons to be optimistic about the Giants' potential.[tpl]Citation |last=Jenkins |first=Lee |title=SI's 2009 MLB Scouting Reports - San Francisco Giants |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/03/30/giants/ |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2009[/tpl] Additionally, the Giants' starting rotation boasted three Cy Young Award winners: Randy Johnson, Tim Lincecum, and Barry Zito.
