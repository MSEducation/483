Females are 6 to 9 mm long, males up to 10 mm. Bathippus is a colorful, long-legged genus, with long, thin bodies. The males have long, robust, forward-pointing chelicerae. The colors differ between species, but the carapace is in most species orange, sometimes with lighter stripes. The opisthosoma is grey, sometimes with three or four pairs of dark grey marks. The legs are orange, with the latter two pairs lighter than those in front.Murphy & Murphy 2000: 295
