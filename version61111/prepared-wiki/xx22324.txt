Hauts-de-Seine ([tpl]IPA-fr|o.də.sɛn|pron[/tpl]; literally "Seine Heights") is a department of France. It is part of the Île-de-France region, and covers the western inner suburbs of Paris. It is small and densely populated and contains the modern office, theatre, and shopping complex known as La Défense.

==Administration==

Hauts-de-Seine is made up of three departmental arrondissements and 36 communes:

==History==

The department of Hauts-de-Seine was created in 1968, from parts of the former départements of Seine and Seine-et-Oise.   Its creation reflected the implementation of a law passed in 1964, and Nanterre had already been selected as the prefecture for the new department early in 1965.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Hauts-de-Seine received national attention as the result of a corruption scandal concerning the misuse of public funds provided for the department's housing projects. Implicated were former minister and former President of the general council of the Hauts-de-Seine, Charles Pasqua, and other personalities of the RPR party. (See corruption scandals in the Paris region.)

==Economy==

Hauts-de-Seine is France's second wealthiest département (behind Paris) and one of Europe's richest areas. Its GDP per capita was € 62,374 in 2003, according to INSEE official figures.
