==Early life==

Naoko Takeuchi was born to Kenji and Ikuko Takeuchi. She has a younger brother named Shingo. She used the names of her family members in the manga of Sailor Moon, and mentions this in interviews and in several comic-strips which she produced in place of author-notes.
Takeuchi attended Kofu Ichi High School.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/prism/notes/gradation02.html | title= The Manga of Takeuchi Naoko |accessdate= October 27, 2006 |last= Glover |first= Alex [/tpl] She wore sailor suits and joined the astronomy and manga clubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.a.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~ayano/naoko/abst.html|title= 武内直子先生インタビューの要旨|last=Obayashi|first=Ayano|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021006084159/www.a.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~ayano/naoko/abst.html|archivedate=October 6, 2002|accessdate=February 8, 2012[/tpl] This experience later influenced her work, Sailor Moon, as well as her previous manga such as Love Call and Rain Kiss. She wanted to become a manga artist at this age, however her father, Kenji, said that in case she did not make it she should find another profession, so she went to university to study for a degree in chemistry.
Takeuchi graduated from Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy, where she received a degree in chemistry. (Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy merged with Keio University in 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081002140014/http://www.keio.ac.jp/english/press_release/070326e.pdf |title= The Manga of Takeuchi Naoko |accessdate= June 16, 2008 |last= Anzai |first= Yuichiro [/tpl]) [tpl]As of | 2010[/tpl] the buildings still exist.

==Career==

While a tertiary student, Takeuchi worked as a miko at Shiba Daijingu shrine not far from the university which she attended. This experience later became the ground-work for one of her characters in Sailor Moon, Rei Hino.[tpl]cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | title= Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon shinsouban Volume 3 |chapter= Rei-chan & Mako-chan Punch! |publisher= Kodansha |date= October 23, 2003 |isbn= 4-06-334783-4 [/tpl]

===Kodansha===

Takeuchi then worked for Kodansha, starting at the age of 19 when she published Love Call, which received an award. She worked steadily on one-shot pieces until writing Maria. She based this work, her first serial comic, loosely on Daddy-Long-Legs and on her friend Marie Koizumi, who helped her write it.
Takeuchi had another serial call The Cherry Project, which ran for three volumes and dealt with skating. Upon completing The Cherry Project she wanted to do a manga on outer space and girl fighters. Her editor Fumio Osano (nicknamed Osa-P) asked her to put the fighters in sailor-suits, and thus began Sailor V. When plans began to turn Sailor V into an anime, she reworked the series and added four other Sailor Soldiers. This became Sailor Moon, which proved a hit. While she worked on Sailor Moon she also simultaneously worked on Sailor V. However, the magazine that ran Sailor V was canceled. The project to turn Sailor V into an anime was canceled with the magazine.[ref][tpl]cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | title= Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon shinsouban Volume 3 |chapter= Liner Notes |publisher= Kodansha |date= October 23, 2003 |isbn= 4-06-334783-4 [/tpl] :"Run-Run, the magazine she was serialized in, went belly-up. The OVA they planned to put out never came out. She met a harsh fate. It's enough to make one sick.
Minako: Where did Run-Run go? When is my video coming out?"[/ref]
After finishing Sailor Moon, then worked on PQ Angels. This gained a fair amount of popularity but got suddenly canceled due to Kodansha losing seven pages of manuscript. It is possible that it would have become an anime: Takeuchi has mentioned that Toei had the manuscript.

===PNP establishment===

"PNP" stands for "Princess Naoko Planning". Takeuchi established this company to manage her properties, mainly Sailor Moon. Later this encompassed Yoshihiro Togashi's work as well and showed up in the credits for such anime as Level E and Hunter × Hunter. Takeuchi runs the company herself. Its name shows up on several musical credits such as Shin Kaguya Shima Densetsu.

===Departure from Kodansha===

Takeuchi felt upset at the loss of seven pages of the PQ Angels manuscript in 1997. Kodansha had originally planned for the manga to become a tankōbon, but with the loss of the manuscript pages this became impossible. Osano Fumio also left her for a shōnen magazine. Then the plans for the Materials Collection were canceled by Kodansha. Naoko Takeuchi left Kodansha, and went to the publisher Shueisha, hoping to find out more about the manga industry and whether manuscripts often get lost.
In 1998, Takeuchi visited the United States and attended Comic-Con. With assistance from Mixx Entertainment she answered questions—mainly about Sailor Moon. She also asked the audience if they liked the occult, which was most likely the beginnings of Love Witch. She also that year published the first Sailor Moon property since leaving Kodansha, Sailor Moon Infinity Collection Art Book with limited releases.

===Working for Togashi and marriage===

In her short comic strip Princess Naoko Takeuchi Back-to-Work Punch!!, Takeuchi met Yoshihiro Togashi at a meeting and had a meeting arranged between them by voice actress Megumi Ogata.Princess Takeuchi Naoko's Return-to-Society Punch!! - Round 2Princess Takeuchi Naoko's Return-to-Society Punch!! - Round 2 She worked for Togashi as an assistant (doing screentone) and as a manager on volume 1 of Hunter × Hunter. However the work and the demands proved more than she had expected, so she ended up quitting.
Around this time Takeuchi conceived the idea for Toki*Meka, which eventually turned into Toki*Meca.[tpl]cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | title= Toki Meca Volume 1 |chapter= Author Notes |publisher= Kodansha |date= August 23, 2005 |isbn= 4-06-372061-6 [/tpl] Togashi had a similar idea at the same time as her, but never fully brought it to fruition. He helped somewhat with Toki*Meka at this point in developing the idea by drawing some concept sketches, which Naoko Takeuchi showed in Toki*Meca volume 1.
Togashi and Takeuchi married in 1999. They have a son, born in January 2001, whose real name they choose not to disclose, but whom they have nicknamed "Petit Ōji," which means "little prince" in combined French and Japanese.

===Return to Kodansha===

With the imminent expiration of the Sailor Moon license, Kodansha eventually made a deal with Takeuchi, and she returned in 1999 to make the Materials Collection. Her first serialized manga after her return started: Love Witch. Love Witch was cancelled by Kodansha for unknown reasons. Takeuchi also started to work on the reprints of Sailor Moon and Sailor V.
She also made a one-shot Toki*Meka.

She showed up at the official conference with a fist up, meaning "good luck", in Act Zero.
During the time she worked on PGSM Takeuchi released no new manga.

===Return to drawing manga===
