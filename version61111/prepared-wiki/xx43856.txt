Dumbo is a 1941 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and premiered on October 23, 1941, by RKO Radio Pictures. Sound was recorded conventionally using the RCA System. One voice was synthesized using the Sonovox system, but it, too, was recorded using the RCA System.
Dumbo, the fourth animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, is based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl for the prototype of a novelty toy ("Roll-a-Book").Obituary: Helen Aberson Mayer. The Independent. April 12, 1999. Retrieved September 30, 2009. The main character is Jumbo Jr., a semi-anthropomorphic elephant who is cruelly nicknamed "Dumbo". He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using his ears as wings. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy – a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.
Dumbo was made to recoup the financial losses of Fantasia. It was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio, and at 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features.

==Plot==

A stork delivers babies while circus animals are being transported, by train. Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby who is soon taunted by the other (female) elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him "Dumbo".
Once the circus is assembled, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for bullying of her son, so she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone. Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again, appoints himself as Dumbo's mentor and protector.
The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo trips over his ears and misses his target, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo dislikes this job and is now more miserable than ever.
To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back, Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup, so Timothy takes him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to them, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants.
The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help from a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a "magic feather" to boost his confidence.
Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time, from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather; Timothy quickly tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.
After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.

==Cast==

Like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, all the voice actors are uncredited for their roles in the film.[tpl]cite web | title=Dumbo | publisher=Internet Movie Database |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033563/| accessdate=January 7, 2012[/tpl]

==Production==

===Development===

Dumbo is based upon a children's story written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl that was prepared to demonstrate the prototype of a toy storytelling display device called Roll-A-Book, which was similar in principle to a panorama. It involved only eight drawings and just a few lines of text, and had Red Robin as Dumbo's ally instead of Timothy Mouse.
Dumbo was first brought to the attention of Walt Disney in late 1939 by Disney's head of merchandise licensing Kay Kamen, who showed a prototype of the Roll-A-Book that included Dumbo. Disney immediately grasped its possibilities and heartwarming story and purchased the rights to it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Essays/DumboRollABook/DumboRollABook.html |title=The Mysterious Dumbo Roll-A-Book |publisher=Michaelbarrier.com |accessdate=May 31, 2010[/tpl]
Originally it was intended to be a short film; however, Disney soon found that the only way to do justice to the book was to make it feature-length.John Canemaker-Commentary-Dumbo, 2007 Special Edition DVD At the time, the Disney Studio was in serious financial trouble due to the war in Europe, which caused Pinocchio and Fantasia to fail at the box office, with the result that Dumbo was intended to be a low-budget feature designed to bring revenue to the studio.[tpl]cite web| title=TCM's Leading Ladies, 'Dumbo' at the El Capitan|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/features/?id=2077&p=.htm| publisher=boxofficemojo.com| author=Holleran, Scott| date=June 1, 2006| accessdate=March 3, 2010[/tpl] Storymen Dick Huemer and Joe Grant were the primary figures in developing the plot. They wrote the script in chapters, much like a book, an unusual way of writing a film script. Regardless of this, very little was changed from the original draft.Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo-Dumbo, 2011 DVD

===Casting===

None of the voice actors for Dumbo received screen credit, much like in Snow White and Pinocchio. Timothy Mouse was voiced by Edward Brophy, a character actor known for portraying gangsters. He has no other known animation voice credit. The pompous matriarch of the elephants was voiced by Verna Felton, who also played the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella, the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, and Flora of the Three Good Fairies in Sleeping Beauty. Other voice actors include the perennial Sterling Holloway in appearing as Mr. Stork, Cliff Edwards, better known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Jim Crow, the leader of the crows, and John McLeish, best known for narrating the Goofy "How To" cartoons, providing the opening narration.

===Animation===

When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director Ben Sharpsteen was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive. As a result, Dumbo lacks the lavish detail of the previous three Disney animated features (Fantasia, Pinocchio, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs): character designs are simpler, background paintings are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the character animation. Although the film is more "cartoony" than previous Disney films the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement.
Watercolor paint was used to render the backgrounds. Dumbo and Snow White are the only two classic Disney features to use the technique, which was regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used oil paint and gouache. 2002's Lilo & Stitch, which drew influences from Dumbo, also made use of watercolor backgrounds.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.no/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC&pg=PA573&lpg=PA573&dq=%22looked+to+dumbo+as+a+model%22&source=bl&ots=iJTqzv-izg&sig=bOrsIpaKJZJ_IQqsEkLjLzEgsYY&hl=no&sa=X&ei=BU-sT7unDpP34QTtodXTAw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22looked%20to%20dumbo%20as%20a%20model%22&f=false |title=Hollywood Cartoons : American Animation in Its Golden Age  |accessdate=2014-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/362/362707p1.html |title=A Look Inside the Creation of Lilo and Stitch |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=2002-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-13[/tpl]
The simplicity freed the animators from being overly concerned with detail, and allowed them to focus on the most important element of character animation: acting. Bill Tytla's animation of Dumbo is today considered one of the greatest accomplishments in American animation.[tpl]By whom|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Disney strike===

During the production of Dumbo, Herbert Sorrell leader of the Screen Cartoonists Guild, demanded Disney sign with his union, rather than the IATSE, which Disney had already signed. Disney declined saying that he would put it to a vote. Sorrel again demanded that Disney sign with his union, but Disney once again refused. On May 29, 1941, shortly after rough animation on Dumbo was complete, much of the Disney studio staff went on strike. A number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns who go to "hit the big boss for a raise". The strike lasted five weeks, and ended the "family" atmosphere and camaraderie at the studio.

===Distribution===

Completed in fall 1941, Disney's distributor RKO Radio Pictures initially balked at the film's 64-minute length and wanted Disney to either make it longer, edit it down to a short subject length, or allow them to release it as a B-movie. Disney refused all three options, and RKO reluctantly issued Dumbo, unaltered, as an A-film.

===Songs and performers===

On Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic, "Pink Elephants on Parade" is included on the green disc, "Baby Mine" is on the purple disc, and "When I See an Elephant Fly" is on the orange disc. On Disney's Greatest Hits, "Pink Elephants on Parade" is on the red disc.

===Wartime references===

Following the aerial montage of Dumbo, there is a newspaper montage. Next to the picture of the flying elephant, there is the headline "Bombers for Defense". It is a reference of the national defense during the ongoing World War II. There is also a reference to the fireside chats of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 102-103

==Release==

===Box office===

Despite the advent of World War II, Dumbo was still the most financially successful Disney film of the 1940s. After its October 23 release, Dumbo proved to be a financial miracle compared to other Disney films. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White, less than a third of the cost of Pinocchio, and certainly less than the expensive Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release; it and Snow White were the only two pre-1943 Disney features to turn a profit. The film was re-released in theaters in 1949, 1959, 1972, and 1976.

===Critical reception===

Reviews for the film at its initial release were largely positive. Variety said that Dumbo was "a pleasant little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor, a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waltdisney.com/content/timely-dumbo-almost-cover-boy|title=The Timely "Dumbo": Almost a Cover Boy|work=Walt Disney Family Museum|date=May 16, 2011|accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl] Cecilia Ager, writing in PM, called Dumbo "the nicest, kindest Disney yet", and Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, said that the film was "the most genial, the most endearing, the most completely precious cartoon feature film ever to emerge from the magical brushes of Walt Disney's wonder-working artists". TIME responded to the reception of the film with plans to name the character as its "Mammal of the Year" (a play on its annual "Man/Person of the Year" honor), with an appearance on the cover of the magazine's December 29, 1941 edition. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 of that year shifted the news cycle away from Dumbo, although the previously planned essay on the film, with a more appropriate introduction, appeared in the December 29 issue's "Cinema" section.
Today, the film holds a 97% rating at movie aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/1947/awardCompetition.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dumbo |accessdate=January 4, 2009|publisher=festival-cannes.com[/tpl] Film critic Leonard Maltin described it as "One of Walt Disney's most charming animated films".Maltin, Leonard.

This was one of the first of Disney's animated films to be broadcast, albeit severely edited, on television, as part of Disney's anthology series.

===Home video===

Dumbo, along with Alice in Wonderland, was the first of Disney's canon of animated films to be released on home video. The film was originally released on June 26, 1981 on VHS and Betamax, followed by a Laserdisc release in June 1982 and then once again on VHS and Betamax as part of Walt Disney Classics Video Collection release on December 3, 1985.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]

==Awards and nominations==

Dumbo won the 1941 Academy Award for Original Music Score, awarded to musical directors Frank Churchill and Oliver Wallace. Churchill and lyricist Ned Washington were also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song for "Baby Mine" (the song that plays during Dumbo's visit to his mother's cell), but did not win for this category.[tpl]cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2009/02/snow-white-and.html |title=Animated films are unwelcome outside designated categories, as "WALL-E" and "Waltz" shutouts remind us |accessdate=September 30, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The film also won Best Animation Design at the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.

==Controversy==

===Allegations of racial stereotyping===

Writer Richard Schickel charged that the crow characters in the film are African-American stereotypes in his book, The Disney Version (1968). The leader crow, played by Cliff Edwards, was originally named "Jim Crow" for script purposes, and is listed as such in the credits. However, all of other crows are voiced by African-American actors, who were all members of the popular all-black Hall Johnson Choir. Despite suggestions by writers such as Schickel who have criticized the portrayal as racist,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Schickel|first=Richard|title=The Disney Version|place=New York|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1968|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] other writers have rejected these claims.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Grant|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters|place=New York|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1987|page=175|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Defenders note that the crows form the majority of the characters in the movie who are sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, that they are free spirits who bow to no one, and that they are intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common in the previous decade. Furthermore, the crows' song "When I See An Elephant Fly", which uses intricate wordplay in the lyrics, is oriented more toward mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears.

==Proposed Sequel==

In 2001, the "60th Anniversary Edition" DVD of Dumbo featured a sneak peek of Dumbo II, including new character designs and storyboards. Robert C. Ramirez (Joseph: King of Dreams) was to direct the sequel, in which Dumbo and his circus friends navigated a large city after being left behind by their traveling circus. Dumbo II also sought to explain what happened to Dumbo's father, Mr. Jumbo. Dumbo's circus friends included the chaotic twin bears Claude and Lolly, the curious zebra Dot, the older, independent hippo Godfry, and the adventurous ostrich Penny. The animals were metaphors for the different stages of childhood.[tpl]cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Josh|url=http://animatedviews.com/2013/from-snow-queen-to-pinocchio-ii-robert-reeces-animated-adventures-in-screenwriting/|title=From Snow Queen to Pinocchio II: Robert Reece's animated adventures in screenwriting|publisher=Animated Views|date=April 22, 2013|accessdate=May 4, 2013[/tpl] Dumbo II was supposed to be set on the day immediately following the end of the first Dumbo movie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jmraises/other/otherdumboII.html |title=Dumbo II|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jmraises/other/otherdumboII.html&date=2009-10-26+00:54:35|archivedate=October 26, 2009[/tpl] John Lasseter canceled Dumbo II soon after being named Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2006.[tpl]cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2007/06/21/say-so-long-to-direct-to-video-sequels-disneytoon-studios-tunes-out-sharon-morrill.aspx|title=Say "So Long!" to direct-to-video sequels: DisneyToon Studios tunes out Sharon Morrill|publisher=JimHillMedia.com|date=April 22, 2007|accessdate=January 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Dumbo's Circus===

Dumbo's Circus was a live-action/puppet television series for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the film, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes.

In the end, the Ringmaster is defeated when he is knocked unconscious by a well-aimed custard pie.

===In other films===

In Steven Spielberg's comedy 1941 (1979), Major General Joseph W. Stilwell is portrayed as attending a showing of Dumbo at a Hollywood Boulevard theater (Stilwell had remarked in his memoirs that viewing Dumbo in 1941 was one his happier moments during WWII). Two sequences from Dumbo are seen being projected in the cinema: "Baby Mine" and "When I See an Elephant Fly."
In the Disney film The Great Mouse Detective (1986), a bubble-blowing Dumbo toy can be seen, said toy being patterned after the scene when Dumbo and Timothy were intoxicated.
Dumbo and Casey Jr. make cameos in Disney (and Amblin's) live-action/animated film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit(1988).
In A Bug's Life (1998), (made by Pixar and Disney), the wagons that transport P. T. Flea's Circus are empty boxes of "Casey Jr. Cookies" named after the train in this film that transports the circus.
