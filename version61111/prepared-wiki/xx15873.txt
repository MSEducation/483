===Tourism===

Tourism accounts for much of Uruguay's economy. Tourism in Montevideo is centered in the Ciudad Vieja area, which includes the city's oldest buildings, several museums, art galleries, and nightclubs, with Sarandí Street and the Mercado del Puerto being the most frequented venues of the old city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/circuitos-turisticos/la-nueva-ciudad-vieja |title=La nueva Ciudad Vieja |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl] On the edge of Ciudad Vieja, Plaza Independencia is surrounded by many sights, including the Solís Theatre and the Palacio Salvo; the plaza also constitutes one end of 18 de Julio Avenue, the city's most important tourist destination outside of Ciudad Vieja. Apart from being a shopping street, the avenue is noted for its Art Deco buildings,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/circuitos-turisticos/art-deco  |title=Art déco |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl] three important public squares, the Gaucho Museum, the Palacio Municipal and many other sights.

===Retail===

Montevideo is the heartland of retailing in Uruguay. The city has become the principal centre of business and real estate, including many expensive buildings and modern towers for residences and offices, surrounded by extensive green spaces. In 1985, the first shopping centre in Rio de la Plata, Montevideo Shopping was built.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jK4QyY4vIHgC&pg=PA106&dq=Montevideo+Shopping++1985#v=onepage&q=Montevideo%20Shopping%20%201985&f=false|title=The engineer's contribution to contemporary architecture|author=Remo Pedreschi|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=2000|pages=106–112|isbn=0-7277-2772-9[/tpl] In 1994, with building of three more shopping complexes such as the Shopping Tres Cruces, Portones Shopping, and Punta Carretas Shopping, the business map of the city changed dramatically. The creation of shopping complexes brought a major change in the habits of the people of Montevideo. Global firms such as McDonald's and Burger King etc. are firmly established in Montevideo.
Apart from the big shopping complexes, the main retailing venues of the city are: most of 18 de Julio Avenue in the Centro and Cordón barrios, a length of Agraciada Avenue in the Paso de Molino area of Belvedere, a length of Arenal Grande St. and the surrounding streets in Villa Muñoz and a length of 8 de Octubre Avenue in Unión.

==Landmarks and architecture==

The architecture of Montevideo ranges from Neoclassical buildings such as the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral to the Postmodern style of the World Trade Center Montevideo or the [tpl]convert|158|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] ANTEL Telecommunication Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=38764|title=Antel Tower|publisher=Skyscraper City|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl] The Along with the Telecommunications Tower, the Palacio Salvo dominates the skyline of the Bay of Montevideo. The building façades in the Old Town reflect the city's extensive European immigration, displaying the influence of old European architecture. Notable government buildings include the Legislative Palace, the City Hall, Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower. The most notable sports stadium is the Estadio Centenario within Parque Batlle. Parque Batlle, Parque Rodó and Parque Prado are Montevideo's three great parks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/parques-y-plazas |title=Parques y plazas|publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl]
The Pocitos district, near the beach of the same name, has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940, with a mixture of styles. Other landmarks in Pocitos are the "Edificio Panamericano" designed by Raul Sichero,[tpl]cite book|title=Guillermo Gómez Platero, arquitecto|author=Platero, Guillermo Gómez |publisher=Editorial Dos Puntos|year= 2002[/tpl] and the "Positano" and "El Pilar" designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis García Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s. However, the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood, with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Palacio Legislativo===

The Palacio Legislativo in Aguada, the north of the city centre, is currently the seat of the Uruguayan Parliament. Construction started in 1904 and was sponsored by the government of President José Batlle y Ordóñez.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.easydestination.net/2MONTEVIDEO.html|title= Montevideo Travel Guide|accessdate=17 November 2010|publisher=Easy Destination[/tpl] It was designed by Italian architects Vittorio Meano and Gaetano Moretti, who planned the building's interior. Among the notable contributors to the project was sculptor José Belloni, who contributed numerous reliefs and allegorical sculptures.

===World Trade Center Montevideo===

World Trade Center Montevideo officially opened in 1998, although work is still ongoing as of 2010. The complex is composed of three towers, two three-story buildings called World Trade Center Plaza and World Trade Center Avenue and a large central square called Towers Square. World Trade Center 1 was the first building to be inaugurated, in 1998.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] It has 22 floors and 17,100 square metres of space. That same year the avenue and the auditorium were raised. World Trade Center 2 was inaugurated in 2002, a twin tower of World Trade Center 1. Finally, in 2009, World Trade Center 3 and the World Trade Center Plaza and the Towers Square were inaugurated. It is located between the avenues Luis Alberto de Herrera and 26 de Marzo and has 19 floors and [tpl]convert|27000|sqm|sqft[/tpl] of space. The [tpl]convert|6300|sqm|sqft|adj=on[/tpl] [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] World Trade Center Plaza is designed to be a centre of gastronomy opposite Towers Square and Bonavita St. Among the establishments on the plaza are Burger King, Walrus, Bamboo, Asia de Cuba, Gardenia Mvd, and La Claraboya Cafe.
The Towers Square, is an area of remarkable aesthetic design, intended to be a platform for the development of business activities, art exhibitions, dance and music performances and social place. This square connects the different buildings and towers which comprise the WTC Complex and it is the main access to the complex. The square contains various works of art, notably a sculpture by renowned Uruguayan sculptor Pablo Atchugarry. World Trade Center 4, with 40 floors and [tpl]convert|53500|sqm|sqft[/tpl] of space is under construction as of 2010.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Telecommunications Tower===

Torre de las Telecomunicaciones (Telecommunications Tower) or Torre Antel (Antel Tower) is the [tpl]convert|158| m|ft[/tpl], 37 floor headquarters of Uruguay's government-owned telecommunications company, ANTEL, and is the tallest building in the country. It was designed by architect Carlos Ott. It is situated by the side of the Bay of Montevideo. The tower was completed by American Bridge and other design/build consortium team members on 15 March 2000.
When its construction was announced, many politicians complained about its cost (US$40 million, plus US$25 million for the construction of the other 5 buildings of the Telecommunications Complex). Problems during its construction turned the original US$65 million price into US$102 million. Today, the tower is seen by many political opponents as a frivolous waste of money and a monument to Julio María Sanguinetti's vanity.Polémica en torno a costo y funcionalidad de la Torre de Antel provoca enfrentamiento en el seno del gobierno

===Ciudad Vieja (Old City)===

Ciudad Vieja was the earliest part of the city to be developed and today it constitutes a prominent barrio of southwest Montevideo. It contains many colonial buildings and national heritage sites, but also many banks, administrative offices, museums, art galleries, cultural institutions, restaurants and night-clubs, making it vibrant with life. Its northern coast is the main port of Uruguay, one of the few deep-draft ports in the Southern Cone of South America.
Montevideo's most important plaza is Plaza Independencia, located between Ciudad Vieja and downtown Montevideo. It starts with the Gateway of The Citadel at one end and ends at the beginning of 18 de Julio Avenue. It is the remaining part of the wall that surrounded the oldest part of the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kLgAqqpBVusJ:www.offbeattravel.com/uruguay-montevideo-colonia-attractions.html+Gateway+of+The+Citadel+in+Montevideo,+Uruguay&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=firefox-a|title=Visiting Colonia and Montevideo Uruguay: Recipe for a great visit|accessdate=18 November 2010|publisher=Offbeattravel[/tpl] Several notable buildings are located here. thumb|240px|right|Solís Theatre The Solís Theatre is Uruguay's oldest theatre. It was built in 1856 and is currently owned by the government of Montevideo. In 1998, the government of Montevideo started a major reconstruction of the theatre, which included two US$110,000 columns designed by Philippe Starck. The reconstruction was completed in 2004, and the theatre reopened in August of that year."Se reabrió el Teatro Solís", La Nación, 27 August 2004 The plaza is also the site of the offices of the President of Uruguay (both the Estévez Palace and the Executive Tower).

Palacio Salvo, at the intersection of 18 de Julio Avenue and Plaza Independencia, was designed by the architect Mario Palanti and completed in 1925. Palanti, an Italian immigrant living in Buenos Aires, used a similar design for his Palacio Barolo in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Palacio Salvo stands [tpl]convert|100|m|ft[/tpl] high, including its antenna. It is built on the former site of the Confitería La Giralda, renowned for being where Gerardo Matos Rodríguez wrote his tango "La Cumparsita" (1917.)Buscando la Verdad – La Cumparcita at jaimegorenstein.com Palacio Salvo was originally intended to function as a hotel but is now a mixture of offices and private residences.[tpl]cite book|author=Mimi Bohm|title=Buenos Aires, Art Nouveau|year=2005|publisher=Ediciones Xavier Verstraeten|location= Buenos Aires[/tpl]
Also of major note in Ciudad Vieja is the Plaza de la Constitución (or Plaza Matriz). During the first decades of Uruguayan independence this square was the main hub of city life. On the square are the Cabildo—the seat of colonial government—and the Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral. The cathedral is the burial place of Fructuoso Rivera, Juan Antonio Lavalleja and Venancio Flores. Another notable square is Plaza Zabala with the equestrian statue of Bruno Mauricio de Zabala. On its south side, Palacio Taranco, once residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers, is now the Museum of Decorative Arts. A few blocks northwest of Plaza Zabala is the Mercado del Puerto, another major tourist destination.

===Forts===

The first set of subsidiary forts were planned by the Portuguese at Montevideo in 1701 to establish a front line base to stop frequent insurrections by the Spaniards emanating from Buenos Aires. These fortifications were planned within the River Plate estuary at Colonia del Sacramento. However, this plan came to fruition only in November 1723, when Captain Manuel Henriques de Noronha reached the shores of Montevideo with soldiers, guns and colonists on his warship Nossa Senhora de Oliveara. They built a small square fortification. However, under siege from forces from Buenos Aires, the Portuguese withdrew from Montevideo Bay in January 1724, after signing an agreement with the Spaniards.[tpl]Cite book|author= David |title= Historic cities of the Americas: an illustrated encyclopedia, Volume 1|page=817|accessdate=17 November 2010|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=q1a4j2HNmjUC&pg=PA817|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2005|isbn= 1-57607-027-1[/tpl]

====Fortaleza del Cerro (Fortress del Cerro)====

Fortaleza del Cerro overlooks the bay of Montevideo. An observation post at this location was first built by the Spanish in the late 18th century. In 1802, a beacon replaced the observation post; construction of the fortress began in 1809 and was completed in 1839. It has been involved in many historical developments and has been repeatedly taken over by various sides. In 1907, the old beacon was replaced with a stronger electric one. It has been a National Monument since 1931[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/datos-%C3%BAtiles/barrios/cerro-municipio|title=Cerro – Municipio A |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo |accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] and has housed a military museum since 1916. Today it is one of the tourist attractions of Montevideo.

====Punta Brava Lighthouse====

Punta Brava Lighthouse (Faro Punta Brava), also known as Punta Carretas Lighthouse, was erected in 1876. The lighthouse is [tpl]convert|21|m|ft[/tpl] high and its light reaches [tpl]convert|15|mi|km[/tpl] away, with a flash every ten seconds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotelcaladivolpe.com.uy/img/pdf/cala_vecindario_fr.pdf|title=Our Neighbourhood|publisher=Hotel Caladivolpe|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl] In 1962, the lighthouse became electric. The lighthouse is important for guiding boats into the Banco Inglés Buceo Port or the entrance of the Santa Lucía River.

===Rambla of Montevideo===

The Rambla is an avenue that goes along the entire coastline of Montevideo. The literal meaning of the Spanish word rambla is "avenue" or "watercourse", but in the Americas it is mostly used as "coastal avenue", and since all the southern departments of Uruguay border either the Río de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean, they all have ramblas as well. As an integral part of Montevidean identity, the Rambla has been included by Uruguay in the Indicative List of World Heritage sites,UNESCO: Rambla of Montevideo candidacy [tpl]es icon[/tpl] though it has not received this status. Previously, the entire Rambla was called Rambla Naciones Unidas ("United Nations"), but in recent times different names have been given to specific parts of it.
The Rambla is a very important site for recreation and leisure in Montevideo. Every day, a large number of people go there to take long strolls, jog, bicycle, roller skate, fish and even—in a special area—skateboard. Its [tpl]convert|27|km|adj=on[/tpl] length makes it one of the longest esplanades in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/paseos/costa/rambla |title=Rambla |publisher=Intendencia de Montevideo |accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl]
Montevideo is noted for its beaches, which are particularly important because 60% of the population spends the summer in the city. Its best known beaches are Ramírez, Pocitos, Carrasco, Buceo and Malvín. Further east and west are other beaches including the Colorada, Punta Espinillo, Punta Yeguas, Zabala and Santa Catarina.

===Cemeteries===

There are five large cemeteries in Montevideo, all administered by the "Fúnebre y Necrópolis" annex of the Intendencia of Montevideo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/dependencias/1087 |title=Fúnebre y Necrópolis | Intendencia de Montevideo |publisher=Montevideo.gub.uy |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]
The largest cemetery is the Cementerio del Norte, located in the northern-central part of the city. The Central Cemetery (Spanish: Cementerio central), located in Barrio Sur in the southern area of the city, is one of Uruguay's main cemeteries. It was one of the first cemeteries (as against church graveyards) in the country, founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the Catholic Church. It is the burial place of many of the most famous Uruguayans, such as Eduardo Acevedo, Delmira Agustini, Luis Batlle Berres, José Batlle y Ordóñez, Juan Manuel Blanes, François Ducasse, father of Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse),Arte oculto en el cementerio – elpais.com.uy [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Luis Alberto de Herrera, Benito Nardone, José Enrique Rodó, and Juan Zorrilla de San Martín.
The other large cemeteries are the Cementerio del Buceo, Cementerio del Cerro, and Cementerio Paso Molino.
The British Cemetery Montevideo (Cementerio Británico) is another of the oldest cemeteries in Uruguay, located in the Buceo neighbourhood. Many noblemen and eminent persons are buried there. The cemetery originated when the Englishman Mr. Thomas Samuel Hood purchased a plot of land in the name of the English residents in 1828. However, in 1884 the government compensated the British by moving the cemetery to Buceo to accommodate city growth. A section of the cemetery, known as British Cemetery Montevideo Soldiers and Sailors, contains the graves of quite a number of sailors of different nationalities, although the majority are of British descent. One United States Marine, Henry de Costa, is buried here.Lone U.S. Marine in British Cemetery honoured on U.S. Marine Corps birthday

==Culture==

Montevideo has a very rich architectural heritage and an impressive number of writers, artists, and musicians. Uruguayan tango is a unique form of dance that originated in the neighbourhoods of Montevideo towards the end of the 1800s. Tango, candombe and murga are the three main styles of music in this city. The city is also the centre of the cinema of Uruguay, which includes commercial, documentary and experimental films.

===Literature===

The first public library in Montevideo was formed by the initial donation of the private library of Father José Manuel Pérez Castellano, who died in 1815. Its promoter, director and organizer was Father Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga, who also made a considerable donation along with donations from José Raimundo Guerra, as well as others from the Convent of San Francisco in Salta.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bibna.gub.uy/historia.html|title=mec-historia |publisher=Ministerio de Ecucacion y Cultura |language=Spanish |accessdate=12 December 2010[/tpl] In 1816 its stock was 5,000 volumes.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] The current building of the National Library of Uruguay (Biblioteca Pública de Uruguay) was designed by Luis Crespi in the Neoclassical style and occupies an area of [tpl]convert|4000|sqm|sqft[/tpl].

====Authors====

The city has a long and rich literary tradition. Although Uruguayan literature is not limited to the authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is the centre of the editorial and creative activity of literature.
In 1900, the city had a remarkable group of writers, including José Enrique Rodó, Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Delmira Agustini and Felisberto Hernández. Montevideo was then called the "Atenas del Plata" or the "Athens of the Rio de la Plata".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tacuy.com.uy/Servicios/Montevideo/index.htm|title=Movimiento cultural |author=Javier Meneses Silva|publisher=Tacuy.com.uy |language=Spanish|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl]

===Music===

In Montevideo, as throughout the Rio de Plata region, the most popular forms of music are tango, milonga and vals criollo. Many notable songs originated in Montevideo including "El Tango supremo", La Cumparsita", La Milonga", "La Puñalada" and "Desde el Alma", composed by notable Montevideo musicians such as Gerardo Matos Rodríguez, Pintín Castellanos and Rosita Melo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spanishcourses.info/cities/montevideo-uruguay-41-EN.htm|title=Montevideo, Uruguay|publisher=Spanish courses|accessdate=18 November 2010[/tpl] Tango is deeply ingrained in the cultural life of the city and is the theme for many of the bars and restaurants in the city. Fun Fun' Bar, established in 1935, is one of the most important places for tango in Uruguay as is El Farolito, located in the old part of the city and Joventango, Café Las Musas, Garufa and Vieja Viola. The city is also home to the Montevideo Jazz Festival and has the Bancaria Jazz Club bar catering for jazz enthusiasts.

In the early 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the military junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a "hotbed of resistance". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by people who had been let out of jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture. It resumed much later.[tpl]cite book|author= Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art|title= Rimer Cardillo: Impressions (and Other Images of Memory) 16 October – 12 December 2004 |pages=11–13 |accessdate=17 November 2010 |url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bOno-rgMuP8C&pg=PA11 |publisher= SUNY Press |year=2004 |isbn= 1-4384-3110-4[/tpl]

===Museums===

The Montevideo Cabildo was the seat of government during the colonial times of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. It is located in front of Constitution Square, in Ciudad Vieja. Built between 1804 and 1869 in Neoclassical style, with a series of Doric and Ionic columns, it became a National Heritage Site in 1975. In 1958, the Municipal Historic Museum and Archive was inaugurated here. It features three permanent city museum exhibitions, as well as temporary art exhibitions, cultural events, seminars, symposiums and forums.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/museos-y-salas/museo-y-archivo-historico-municipal-cabildo |title=Museo y Archivo Histórico Municipal – Cabildo | Intendencia de Montevideo |publisher=Montevideo.gub.uy |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]
The Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules Chifflot León who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portaluruguaycultural.gub.uy/2009/08/museo-de-artes-decorativas-palacio-taranco-2/ |title=Uruguay Cultural » Museo de Artes Decorativas Palacio Taranco |publisher=Portaluruguaycultural.gub.uy |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th–18th century from the area of present-day Iran.

===Cuisine===

The center of traditional Uruguayan food and beverage in Montevideo is the Mercado del Puerto ("Port Market"). A torta frita is a pan-fried cake consumed in Montevideo and throughout Uruguay. It is generally circular, with a small cut in the centre for cooking, and is made from wheat flour, yeast, water and sugar or salt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.montevideo.gub.uy/ciudad/cultura/costumbres/torta-frita-cuando-llueve|title=Torta Frita Cuando Llueve|publisher=Montevideo.gub.uy|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl] Beef is very important in Uruguayan cuisine and an essential part of many dishes. Montevideo has a variety of restaurants, from traditional Uruguayan cuisine to Japanese cuisine such as sushi. Notable restaurants in Montevideo include Arcadia atop the Plaza Victoria, widely regarded to be the finest restaurant in the city. Arcadia is set in a classic Italian-inspired dining room and serves lavish dishes such as terrine of pheasant marinated in cognac, grilled lamb glazed with mint and garlic, and duck confit on thin strudel pastry with red cabbage. El Fogon is more popular with the late-night diners of the city. Its interior is brightly lit and the walls covered with big mirrors. Officially a barbecue and seafood restaurant, it serves grilled meat dishes, as well as salmon, shrimp and calamari. Also of note is the Cru. Numerous restaurants are located along the Rambla of Montevideo. There is an Irish pub in the eastern part of the Old District named Shannon Irish pub, another testament to the European heritage of the city.

===Festivals===

As the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo is home to a number of festivals and carnivals including a Gaucho festival when people ride through the streets on horseback in traditional gaucho gear. The major annual festival is the annual Montevideo Carnaval which is part of the national festival of Carnival Week, celebrated throughout Uruguay, with central activities in the capital, Montevideo. Officially, the public holiday lasts for two days on Carnival Monday and Shrove Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, but due to the prominence of the festival, most shops and businesses close for the entire week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/uruguay/|title=Montevideo Carnaval|publisher=Carnaval.com|accessdate=19 November 2010[/tpl]
During carnival there are many open-air stage performances and competitions and the streets and houses are vibrantly decorated. "Tablados" or popular scenes, both fixed and movable, are erected in the whole city. Notable displays include "Desfile de las Llamadas" ("Parade of the Calls"), which is a grand united parade held on the south part of downtown, where it used to be a common ritual back in the early 20th century. Due to the scale of the festival, preparation begins as early as December with an election of the "zonal beauty queens" to appear in the carnival.

==Religion==

Church and state are officially separated since 1916 in Uruguay. The religion with most followers in Montevideo is Roman Catholicism and has been so since the foundation of the city. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montevideo was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Montevideo in 1830. The vicariate was promoted to the Diocese of Montevideo on 13 July 1878.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Archdiocese of Montevideo[/tpl] Pope Leo XIII elevated it to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese on 14 April 1897. The new archdiocese became the Metropolitan of the suffragan sees of Canelones, Florida, Maldonado–Punta del Este, Melo, Mercedes, Minas, Salto, San José de Mayo, Tacuarembó.
Montevideo is the only archdiocese in Uruguay and, as its Ordinary, the archbishop is also Primate of the Uruguayan Church. The archdiocese's mother church and thus seat of its archbishop is Catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción y San Felipe y Santiago. As of 2010, the current Archbishop of Montevideo is Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet, SDB, since his appointment on 11 February 2014.[tpl]Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bstbe|Archbishop Daniel Sturla, SDB|February 11, 2014[/tpl]
Other religious faiths in Montevideo are Protestantism, Umbanda, Judaism and there are many people who define themselves as Atheists and Agnostics, while others profess "believing in God but without religion".[tpl]cite web |title=Extended National Household Survey, 2006: Religion |language=Spanish |format=PDF |publisher=National Institute of Statistics |url=http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/flash/Flash%206_Religion.pdf [/tpl]

===Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral===

The Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral is the main Roman Catholic church of Montevideo. It is located in Ciudad Vieja, immediately across Constitution Square from the Cabildo. In 1740 a brick church was built on the site. In 1790, the foundation was laid for the current neoclassical structure. The church was consecrated in 1804. Bicentennial celebrations were held in 2004.
In 1897, Pope Leo XIII elevated the church to Metropolitan Cathedral status. Important ceremonies are conducted under the direction of the Archbishop of Montevideo. Weddings and choral concerts are held here and the parish priest conducts the routine functions of the cathedral. In the 19th century, its precincts were also used as a burial place of famous people who died in the city. For decades, the prison and the nearby parish church were the only major buildings in the neighbourhood.

===Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón===

Nuestra Señora del Sagrado Corazón ("Our Lady of the Sacred Heart"), also known as Iglesia Punta Carretas ("Punta Carretas Church"), was built between 1917 and 1927 in the Romanesque Revival style. The church was originally part of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, but is presently in the parish of the Ecclesiastic Curia. Its location is at the corner of Solano García and José Ellauri. It has a nave and aisles. The roof has many vaults. During the construction of the Punta Carretas Shopping complex, major cracks developed in the structure of the church as a result of differential foundation settlement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rtdz2XRFqQoJ:www.trekearth.com/gallery/South_America/Uruguay/South/Montevideo/Montevideo/photo741444.htm+Nuestra+Se%C3%B1ora+del+Sagrado+Coraz%C3%B3n,+Montevideo&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in&client=firefox-a|title=Iglesia de Sagrado Corazón by anaines |accessdate=20 November 2010|publisher=Trekearth[/tpl]

Many eminent Uruguayans have graduated from this university, including Carlos Vaz Ferreira, José Luis Massera, Gabriel Paternain, Mario Wschebor, Roman Fresnedo Siri, Carlos Ott and Eladio Dieste
The process of founding the country's public university began on 11 June 1833 with the passage of a law proposed by Senator Dámaso Antonio Larrañaga. It called for the creation of nine academic departments; the President of the Republic would pass a decree formally creating the departments once the majority of them were in operation. In 1836, the House of General Studies was formed, housing the departments of Latin, philosophy, mathematics, theology and jurisprudence. On 27 May 1838, Manuel Oribe passed a decree establishing the Greater University of the Republic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.universidad.edu.uy/renderPage/index/pageId/98#heading_761 |title=Portal de la UdelaR – Historia |publisher=UdelaR |accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl] That decree had few practical effects, given the institutional instability of the Oriental Republic of the Uruguay at that time.

==Sports==

Montevideo is a strong centre of professional sport, and by far the most prominent in Uruguay. Estadio Centenario, the national football stadium in Parque Batlle, was opened in 1930 for the first World Cup, as well as to commemorate the centennial of Uruguay's first constitution. In this World Cup, Uruguay won the title game against Argentina by 4 goals to 2.[tpl]cite book|last=Burford|first=Tim |title=Uruguay|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9eZ9-u6OqKwC&pg=PA36|year=2010|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=1-84162-316-4|pages=35–36[/tpl] The stadium has 70,000 seats. It is listed by FIFA as one of the football world's classic stadiums, along with Maracanã, Wembley Stadium, San Siro, Estadio Azteca, and Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.FIFA.com A museum located within the football stadium has exhibits of memorabilia from Uruguay's 1930 and 1950 World Cup championships. Museum tickets give access to the stadium, stands, locker rooms and playing field.
Between 1935 and 1938, the athletics track and the municipal velodrome were completed within Parque Batlle. The Tabaré Athletic Club is occasionally made over as a carnival theatre using impermanent materials.[tpl]cite book|last=Remedi|first=Gustavo |title=Carnival theatre: Uruguay's popular performers and national culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Hr4VCx7x3mMC&pg=PA95|year=2004|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-3455-6|page=95[/tpl]Finzer, p. 103

The Golf Club of Punta Carretas was founded in 1894 covers all the area encircled by the west side of Bulevar Artigas, the Rambla (Montevideo's promenade) and the Parque Rodó (Fun Fair).

==Transport==

The Dirección Nacional de Transporte (DNT), part of the national Ministry of Transport and Public Works, is responsible for the organization and development of Montevideo's transport infrastructure. A very good bus service network covers the entire city. An international bus station, the Tres Cruces Bus Terminal, is located on the lower level of the Tres Cruces Shopping Center, on the side of Artigas Boulevard. This terminal, along with the Baltazar Brum Bus Terminal (or Rio Branco Terminal) by the Port of Montevideo, handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within Uruguay.Tres Cruces TerminalA.F.E.
The State Railways Administration of Uruguay (AFE) operates three commuter rail lines, namely the Empalme Olmos, San Jose and Florida. These lines operate to major suburban areas of Canelones, San José and Florida. Within the Montevideo city limits, local trains stop at Lorenzo Carnelli, Yatai (Step Mill), Sayago, Columbus (line to San Jose and Florida), Peñarol and Manga (line Empalme Olmos) stations. The historic 19th century General Artigas Central Station located in the neighbourhood of Aguada, six blocks from the central business district, was abandoned 1 March 2003 and remains closed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.observa.com.uy/osecciones/ociudadano/calientenota.aspx?id=63259 |title=Observa Ciudadano :: Montevideo – Uruguay :: |publisher=Observa.com.uy |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sociedaduruguaya.org/2009/02/consultor-ferroviario-europeo-visitara-la-estacion-central-general-artigas.html |title=Consultor ferroviario europeo visitará la Estación Central General Artigas |publisher=Sociedad Uruguaya |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] A new station, [tpl]convert|500|m[/tpl] north of the old one and part of the Tower of Communications modern complex, has taken over the rail traffic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lfu1.tripod.com/index-8.html |title=Passenger Group defending Montevideo Central Station |publisher=Lfu1.tripod.com |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]

===Port===

The port on Montevideo Bay is one of the reasons the city was founded. It gives natural protection to ships, although two jetties now further protect the harbour entrance from waves. This natural port is competitive with the other great port of Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.anp.com.uy/montevideo/infraestructura/mvd_infraestructura.asp|publisher=Puerto de Montevideo |accessdate=17 November 2009 |language=spanish |title=Infraestructura Física – Proyecto Nueva Terminal de Contenedores del Puerto de Montevideo.[/tpl]
The main engineering work on the port occurred between the years 1870 and 1930. These six decades saw the construction of the port's first wooden pier, several warehouses in La Aguada, the north and south Rambla, a river port, a new pier, the dredged river basin and the La Teja refinery. A major storm in 1923 necessitated repairs to many of the city's engineering works. Since the second half of the 20th century, physical changes have ceased, and since that time the area has degraded due to national economic stagnation.
The port's proximity has contributed to the installation of various industries in the area surrounding the bay, particularly import/export businesses and other business related to port and naval activity. The density of industrial development in the area surrounding the port has kept its popularity as a residential area relatively low despite its centrality. The main environmental problems are subaquatic sedimentation and air and water contamination.

==Healthcare==

In Montevideo, as elsewhere in the country, there are both public and private health services. In both sectors, medical services are provided by polyclinics and hospitals or sanatoria. The term hospital is used here for both outpatient and inpatient facilities, while sanatorio is used for private short- and long-term facilities for the treatment of illnesses.

===Public hospitals===

Hospital de Clínicas "Dr. Manuel Quintela" is a University Hospital attached to the University of the Republic, and is located on Avenida Italia. It functions as an adult general polyclinic and hospital. The building was designed by architect Carlos Surraco in 1928–1929 and has a surface area of [tpl]convert|110000|sqm|sqft[/tpl] on 23 floors. The hospital was inaugurated 21 September 1953. For many years it was led by Dr. Hugo Villar, who was a considerable influence on the institution.
Hospital Maciel is one of the oldest hospitals in Uruguay and stands on the block bounded by the streets Maciel, 25 de Mayo, Guaraní and Washington, with the main entrance at 25 de Mayo, 172. The land was originally donated in Spanish colonial times by philanthropist Francisco Antonio Maciel, who teamed up with Mateo Vidal to establish a hospital and charity. The first building was constructed between 1781 and 1788 and later expanded upon. The present building stems from the 1825 plans of José Toribio (son of Tomás Toribio) and later Bernardo Poncini (wing on the Guaraní street, 1859), Eduardo Canstatt (corner of Guaraní and 25 de Mayo) and Julián Masquelez (1889).HOSPITAL MACIEL (Ex Hospital de San José y La Caridad) The hospital has a chapel built in Greek style by Miguel Estévez in 1798.Capilla de la Caridad
Hospital Pereira Rossell was founded in 1908 and was built on land donated in late 1900 by Alexis Rossell y Rius and Dolores Pereira de Rossell.Sello conmemorativo de los 100 años del Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell It was the city's first pediatric hospital, and shortly afterwards the addition of an obstetric and gynaecological clinic in 1915 made it the first maternity hospital as well.
