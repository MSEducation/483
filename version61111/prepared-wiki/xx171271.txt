Giulietta e Romeo is an Italian-language musical with music by Riccardo Cocciante and lyrics by Pasquale Panella, based on William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.  Since its world premiere in Verona on June 1, 2007, directed by Sergio Carrubba, the musical has toured throughout Italy, playing in various Italian cities, including Rome, Milan, Naples and others.  There are plans to stage it in other European nations in the Italian language. 
The cast is composed mostly of boys and girls between the ages of 15 and 18.  Each actor has at least two roles. 

==Plot==

Giulietta and Romeo's young love is strongly opposed by their two families, the Capuletis and the Montecchis.  Their feelings are intensely passionate, but they inevitably meet a tragic fate.

===Changes from the Shakespeare story===

Mercuzio is an omniscient character, who sings the overture and guides the meeting of Romeo and Giulietta during the party at Capuleti's home.  The role of Tebaldo is circumscribed to the quarrels among the family clans. He has a scanty character and grazes madness.  Lord Capuleti's role is expanded.  The roles of Lady Capuleti and Lady Montecchi are eliminated.
Giulietta dies because of a heartbreak, instead of by the dagger.  Padre Lorenzo is the character that indirectly decides the fate of Romeo and Giulietta driving them during the second act. At the end he will cry over the deaths together with the two fathers.
