This also occurred even with coins made of less expensive metals such as steel in India.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6766563.stm "Sharp practice of melting coins" – BBC News (accessed 30 May 2009)

==Theory==

Gresham's law states that any circulating currency consisting of both "good" and "bad" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the "bad" money.  This is because people spending money will hand over the "bad" coins rather than the "good" ones, keeping the "good" ones for themselves.
Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the artificially overvalued money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save rather than exchange the artificially demoted one (which they actually value higher).
Consider a customer purchasing an item which costs five pence, who possesses several silver sixpence coins. Some of these coins are more debased, while others are less so – but legally, they are all mandated to be of equal value. The customer would prefer to retain the better coins, and so offers the shopkeeper the most debased one. In turn, the shopkeeper must give one penny in change, and has every reason to give the most debased penny. Thus, the coins that circulate in the transaction will tend to be of the most debased sort available to the parties.
If "good" coins have a face value below that of their metallic content, individuals may be motivated to melt them down and sell the metal for its higher intrinsic value, even if such destruction is illegal. As an example, consider the 1965 United States half dollar coins, which contained 40% silver. In previous years, these coins were 90% silver.  With the release of the 1965 half dollar, which was legally required to be accepted at the same value as the earlier 90% halves, the older 90% silver coinage quickly disappeared from circulation, while the newer debased coins remained in use. As the value of the dollar (Federal Reserve notes) continued to decline, resulting in silver content above the face value of the coins, many of the older half dollars were melted down. Beginning in 1971, the U.S. government gave up on including any silver in the half dollars, as even the metal value of the 40% silver coins began to exceed their face value.
A similar situation occurred in 2007 in the United States with the rising price of copper and zinc, which led the U.S. government to ban the melting or mass exportation of one-cent and five-cent coins.
In addition to being melted down for its bullion value, money that is considered to be "good" tends to leave an economy through international trade. International traders are not bound by legal tender laws as citizens of the issuing country are, so they will offer higher value for good coins than bad ones. The good coins may leave their country of origin to become part of international trade, escaping that country's legal tender laws and leaving the "bad" money behind. This occurred in Britain during the period of the gold standard.

==History of the concept==

The law was named after Sir Thomas Gresham, a sixteenth-century financial agent of the English Crown in the city of Antwerp, to explain to Queen Elizabeth I what was happening to the English shilling. Her father, Henry VIII, had replaced 40 percent of the silver in the coin with base metals, to increase the government's income without raising taxes. Astute English merchants and even ordinary subjects would save the good shillings from pure silver and circulate the bad ones; hence, the bad money would be used whenever possible, and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation.
Gresham was not the first to state the law which took his name. The phenomenon had been noted much earlier, in the 14th century, by Nicole Oresme. In the year that Gresham was born, 1519, it was described by Nicolaus Copernicus in a treatise called Monetae cudendae ratio: "bad (debased) coinage drives good (un-debased) coinage out of circulation." Copernicus was aware of the practice of exchanging bad coins for good ones and melting down the latter or sending them abroad, and he seems to have drawn up some notes on this subject while he was at Olsztyn in 1519. He made them the basis of a report which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522, attending the session with his friend Tiedemann Giese to represent his chapter. Copernicus's Monetae cudendae ratio was an enlarged, Latin version of that report, setting forth a general theory of money for the 1528 diet. He also formulated a version of the quantity theory of money.Angus Armitage, The World of Copernicus, chapter 24: 'The Diseases of Money', pp. 89–91
According to the economist George Selgin in his paper "Gresham's Law":
Gresham made his observations of good and bad money while in the service of Queen Elizabeth, with respect only to the observed poor quality of British coinage. The earlier monarchs, Henry VIII and Edward VI, had forced the people to accept debased coinage by means of their legal tender laws. Gresham also made his comparison of good and bad money where the precious metal in the money was the same metal, but of different weight. He did not compare silver to gold, or gold to paper.

===Origin of the name===

In his "Gresham's Law" article, Selgin also offers the following comments regarding the origin of the name:
The referenced passage from The Frogs is as follows (usually dated at 405 BC):[tpl]cite web|last=Αριστοφάνης|title=Βάτραχοι|url=http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/Βάτραχοι#v720|publisher=Βικιθήκη|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] 

===Precursors===

According to Ben Tamari, the currency devaluation phenomenon was already recognized in ancient sources.[ref]Originally published as

Ibn Taimiyyah (1263–1328) described the phenomenon as follows:
Notably this passage mentions only the flight of good money abroad and says nothing of its disappearance due to hoarding or melting.Economic Concepts of Ibn Tamiyyah

==Reverse of Gresham's Law (Thiers' Law)==

In an influential theoretical article, Rolnick and Weber (1986) argued that bad money would drive good money to a premium rather than driving it out of circulation. However, their research did not take into account the context in which Gresham made his observation. Rolnick and Weber ignored the influence of legal tender legislation which requires people to accept both good and bad money as if they were of equal value. They also focused mainly on the interaction between different metallic monies, comparing the relative "goodness" of silver to that of gold, which is not what Gresham was speaking of.
The experiences of dollarization in countries with weak economies and currencies (for example Israel in the 1980s, Eastern Europe and countries in the period immediately after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, or South American countries throughout the late 20th and early 21st century) may be seen as Gresham's Law operating in its reverse form (Guidotti & Rodriguez, 1992), since in general the dollar has not been legal tender in such situations, and in some cases its use has been illegal.
Adam Fergusson pointed out that in 1923 during the great Inflation in the Weimar Republic Gresham's Law began to work in reverse, since the official money became so worthless that virtually nobody would take it. This was particularly serious since farmers began to hoard food.  Accordingly, any currencies backed by any sorts of value became the circulating mediums of exchange.When Money Dies: The Nightmare of the Weimar Collapse. Chapter 12: The Bottom of the Abyss In 2009 hyperinflation in Zimbabwe began to show similar characteristics.
These examples show that, in the absence of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, in the absence of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.[tpl]cite web|url=http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/07/the-states-theory-of-money-california-and-canadian-tire.html |title=The State(s) Theory of Money: California and Canadian Tire|last=Rowe |first=Nick |date=2009-07-14|work=Worthwhile Canadian Initiative|accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl]
The Nobel prize-winner Robert Mundell believes that Gresham's Law could be more accurately rendered, taking care of the reverse, if it were expressed as, "Bad money drives out good if they exchange for the same price.""Uses and Abuses of Gresham's Law in the History of Money", Robert Mundell, Columbia University (August 1998)http://www.columbia.edu/~ram15/grash.html
The reverse of Gresham's Law, that good money drives out bad money whenever the bad money becomes nearly worthless, has been named "Thiers' Law" by economist Peter Bernholz, in honor of French politician and historian Adolphe Thiers.Monetary Regimes and Inflation, pages 41, 115, 132, Peter Bernholz, 2003, Edward Elgar Publishing, Northampton, Massachusetts, ISBN 978-1-84542-778-8  "Thiers' Law will only operate later the inflation when the increase of the new flexible exchange rate and of the rate of inflation lower the real demand for the inflating money."Bernholz, page 132

==Application==

The principles of Gresham's law can sometimes be applied to different fields of study.  Gresham's law may be generally applied to any circumstance in which the "true" value of something is markedly different from the value people are required to accept, due to factors such as lack of information or governmental decree.
In the market for used cars, lemon automobiles (analogous to bad currency) will drive out the good cars.Phlips, Louis.  The Economics of Price Discrimination, 1983.  p. 239.  The problem is one of asymmetry of information.  Sellers have a strong financial incentive to pass all used cars off as "good" cars, especially lemons.  This makes it difficult to buy a good car at a fair price, as the buyer risks overpaying for a lemon.  The result is that buyers will only pay the fair price of a lemon, so at least they reduce the risk of overpaying.  High-quality cars tend to be pushed out of the market, because there is no good way to establish that they really are worth more. Certified pre-owned programs are an attempt to mitigate this problem by providing a warranty and other guarantees of quality. "The Market for Lemons" is a work that examines this problem in more detail.
Some also use an explanation of Gresham's Law as "The more efficient you become, the less effective you get"; i.e. "when you try to go on the cheap, you will stop selling" or "the less you invest in your non-tangible services, the fewer sales you will get."
Vice President Spiro Agnew used Gresham's law in describing American news media, stating that "Bad news drives out good news," although his argument was closer to that of a race to the bottom for higher ratings rather than over and undervaluing certain kinds of news."Television News Coverage" 13 November 1969, Des Moines, Iowa 
Gresham's law has been cited as "Silver currency will inevitably force gold currency out of circulation" (L. Pyenson, Servants of Nature (W.W. Norton, 1999) p. 21);  this suggests a fundamental misinterpretation, cf. Mundell (above).
