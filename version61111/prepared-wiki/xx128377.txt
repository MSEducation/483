Frequency domain (FD) sensor is an instrument developed for measuring soil moisture content. The instrument has an oscillating circuit, the sensing part of the sensor is embedded in the soil, and the operating frequency will depend on the value of soil's dielectric constant.
There are two types of sensors:
Compared to time domain reflectometer (TDR), FD sensors are cheaper to build and have a faster response time. However because of the complex electrical field around the probe, the sensor needs to be calibrated for different soil types.  Some commercial sensors have been able to remove the soil type sensitivity by using a high frequency.
