==Career==

In 1973, Susan Blackmore graduated from St Hilda's College, Oxford, with a BA (Hons) degree in psychology and physiology. She received an MSc in environmental psychology in 1974 from the University of Surrey. In 1980, she earned a PhD in parapsychology from the same university, her doctoral thesis was "Extrasensory Perception as a Cognitive Process." Blackmore taught at the University of the West of England in Bristol until 2001. After some period of time spent in research on parapsychology and the paranormal,[tpl]sfn|Blackmore|1986|p=163[/tpl] her attitude towards the field moved from belief to scepticism.[tpl]cite journal |title= A Critical Examination of the Blackmore Psi Experiments |url= http://archived.parapsych.org/psiexplorer/blackmore_critique.htm |last= Berger |first= R.E. |date= April 1989 |journal = The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research |volume= 83 |pages= 123–144[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Blackmore|1986|p=249[/tpl] In 1987, Blackmore wrote that she had believed herself to have undergone an out-of-body experience shortly after she began running the Oxford University Society for Psychical Research (OUSPR):[tpl]cite journal |last= Blackmore |first= S. |title = The Elusive Open Mind |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/si87.html |magazine= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 11 |year= 1987 |pages= 125–135 |issue=3[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first=R. |last= Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |chapter= out-of-body experience (OBE)  |url= http://www.skepdic.com/obe.html |date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118045633|pages=270–271 (print)[/tpl]
 Within a few weeks I had not only learned a lot about the occult and the paranormal, but I had an experience that was to have a lasting effect on me—an out-of-body experience (OBE). It happened while I was wide awake, sitting talking to friends. It lasted about three hours and included everything from a typical "astral projection," complete with silver cord and duplicate body, to free-floating flying, and finally to a mystical experience.
 It was clear to me that the doctrine of astral projection, with its astral bodies floating about on astral planes, was intellectually unsatisfactory. But to dismiss the experience as "just imagination" would be impossible without being dishonest about how it had felt at the time. It had felt quite real. Everything looked clear and vivid, and I was able to think and speak quite clearly.
In a New Scientist article in 2000, she again wrote of this:
 It was just over thirty years ago that I had the dramatic out-of-body experience that convinced me of the reality of psychic phenomena and launched me on a crusade to show those closed-minded scientists that consciousness could reach beyond the body and that death was not the end. Just a few years of careful experiments changed all that. I found no psychic phenomena - only wishful thinking, self-deception, experimental error and, occasionally, fraud. I became a sceptic.[tpl]cite journal |author=Blackmore, S. |year=2000 |title=First person—into the unknown |journal=New Scientist |volume=4 |page=55[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title= Paranormal belief and the avowal of prior scepticism |url= http://tap.sagepub.com/content/17/5/681.full.pdf |last= Lamont |first= P. |journal= Theory & Psychology |date= October 2007 |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages= 681–96 |doi= 10.1177/0959354307081624[/tpl] 
In an article in The Observer on sleep paralysis Barbara Rowland wrote that Blackmore, “carried out a large study between 1996 and 1999 of 'paranormal' experiences, most of which clearly fell within the definition of sleep paralysis.”[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2001/nov/18/life1.lifemagazine7 |newspaper=The Observer |title=In the dead of the night |date=17 November 2001 |last=Rowlands |first=B. |accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]

==Memetics==

Susan Blackmore has made contributions to the field of memetics.[tpl]cite book|last=Aunger|first=R.|title=Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192632449[/tpl] The term meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene. In his foreword to  Blackmore's book The Meme Machine (1999), Dawkins said, "Any theory deserves to be given its best shot, and that is what Susan Blackmore has given the theory of the meme."[tpl]citation |last= Dawkins |first= R. |chapter= Forward[/tpl] In [tpl]harvnb|Blackmore|1999|p=xvi[/tpl] Other treatments of memes, that cite Blackmore, can be found in the works of Robert Aunger: The Electric Meme,[tpl]cite book|last=Aunger|first=R.|title=The Electric Meme: A New Theory of How We Think|year=2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743201506[/tpl] and Jonathan Whitty: A Memetic Paradigm of Project Management.[tpl]cite journal |title= A memetic paradigm of project management |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:8801&dsID=sjw_ijpm_05.pdf |journal= International Journal of Project Management |volume= 23 |issue= 8 |pages= 575–83 |doi= 10.1016/j.ijproman.2005.06.005 |accessdate= 19 July 2013 |last= Whitty |first= J.[/tpl]
Blackmore's treatment of memetics insists that memes are true evolutionary replicators, a second replicator that like genetics is subject to the Darwinian algorithm and undergoes evolutionary change.[tpl]cite episode |title= Susan Blackmore: Memetic Evolution |url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/07/2/l_072_05.html |series= Evolution: "The Minds Big Bang" |network= PBS |station= WGBH |year= 2001 |format= video[/tpl] Her prediction on the central role played by imitation as the cultural replicator and the neural structures that must be unique to humans in order to facilitate them have recently been given further support by research on mirror neurons and the differences in extent of these structures between humans and the presumed closest branch of simian ancestors.[tpl]cite book |title= Perspectives on Imitation: From Neuroscience to Social Science |volume= Vol. I: Mechanisms of Imitation and Imitation in Animals |editor1-first= S. |editor1-last= Hurley |editor2-first= N. |editor2-last= Chater |first= M. |last= Iacoboni |chapter= Chapter 2: Understanding Others: Imitation, Language and Empathy |location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2005 |pages= 77–100 |isbn= 9780262582506[/tpl]
At the February 2008 TED conference Blackmore introduced a special category of memes called temes. Temes are memes which live in technological artifacts instead of the human mind.[tpl]cite news |title= Humans Are Just Machines for Propagating Memes |url= http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/02/ted_blackmore?currentPage=all |last= Zetter |first= K. |date= 29 February 2008 |work= Wired website[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Blackmore is an active practitioner of Zen, although she identifies herself as "not a Buddhist".[tpl]cite episode |title= Susan Blackmore on Zen Consciousness |url= http://ttbook.org/book/susan-blackmore-zen-consciousness |series= To the Best of Our Knowledge |network= NPR |transcript= Transcript for Susan Blackmore uncut |transcripturl= http://ttbook.org/book/transcript/transcript-susan-blackmore-uncut |producer= Wisconsin Public Radio |date= 31 October 2012 |last= Paulson |first= S. (interviewer)[/tpl] Blackmore is an atheist who has criticised religion sharply, having said, for instance,[tpl]cite book |title= Neurotheology: Brain, Science, Spirituality, Religious Experience |editor-last= Rhawn |editor-first= R. |chapter= Zen Into Science |url= http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Chapters/NeurotheologyZen.htm |publisher= University Press |location= San Jose, CA |year= 2002 |last= Blackmore |first= S. |isbn= 9780971644588 |pages= 159–161[/tpl]  All kinds of infectious memes thrive in religions, in spite of being false, such as the idea of a creator god, virgin births, the subservience of women, transubstantiation, and many more. In the major religions, they are backed up by admonitions to have faith not doubt, and by untestable but ferocious rewards and punishments." 
On 15 September 2010, Blackmore, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|newspaper= The Guardian |accessdate=20 July 2013 | location=London | date=15 September 2010[/tpl] On 16 September 2010, Blackmore wrote in The Guardian that she no longer believed that religion is a maladaptive by-product of consciousness ("virus of the mind") but is evolutionarily adaptive.[tpl]cite book |editor1-first= P. |editor1-last= Becker |editor2-first=U. |editor2-last= Diewald |title= Zukunftsperspektiven Im Theologisch-naturwissenschaftlichen Dialog |url= http://www.academia.edu/710274/God_in_the_Brain_How_much_can_Neurotheology_explain |year= 2011|publisher= Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |isbn= 9783525569573 |pages= 306–14 |last= Blume |first= M. |chapter= God in the Brain?
