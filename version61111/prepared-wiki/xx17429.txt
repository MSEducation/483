Not all atmospheric re-entries have been successful and some have resulted in significant disasters.

==Uncontrolled and unprotected reentries==

Of satellites that reenter, approximately 10-40% of the mass of the object is likely to reach the surface of the Earth.Spacecraft Reentry FAQ: How much material from a satellite will survive reentry? On average, about one catalogued object reenters per day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
Due to the Earth's surface being primarily water, most objects that survive reentry land in one of the world's oceans. The estimated chances that a given person will get hit and injured during his/her lifetime is around 1 in a trillion.Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies- Spacecraft Reentry[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In 1978, Cosmos 954 reentered uncontrolled and crashed near Great Slave Lake in  the Northwest Territories of Canada. Cosmos 954 was nuclear powered and left radioactive debris near its impact site.Settlement of Claim between Canada and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by "Cosmos 954" (Released on April 2, 1981)
In 1979, Skylab reentered uncontrolled, spreading debris across the Australian Outback, damaging several buildings and killing a cow.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] The re-entry was a major media event largely due to the Cosmos 954 incident, but not viewed as much as a potential disaster since it did not carry nuclear fuel. The city of Esperance, Western Australia, issued a fine for littering to the United States, which was finally paid 30 years later (not by NASA, but by privately collected funds from radio listeners).Littering fine paid  [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] NASA had originally hoped to use a Space Shuttle mission to either extend its life or enable a controlled reentry, but delays in the program combined with unexpectedly high solar activity made this impossible.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]

===Deorbit disposal===

In 1971, the world's first space station Salyut 1 was deliberately de-orbited into the Pacific Ocean following the Soyuz 11 accident. Its successor, Salyut 6, was de-orbited in a controlled manner as well.
On June 4, 2000 the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was deliberately de-orbited after one of its gyroscopes failed. The debris that did not burn up fell harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean.  The observatory was still operational, but the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous.  With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash was preferable to letting the craft come down at random.
In 2001, the Russian Mir space station was deliberately de-orbited, and broke apart in the fashion expected by the command center during atmospheric re-entry. Mir entered the Earth's atmosphere on March 23, 2001, near Nadi, Fiji, and fell into the South Pacific Ocean.
On February 21, 2008, a disabled US spy satellite, USA 193, was successfully hit at an altitude of approximately [tpl]convert|246|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] by an SM-3 missile fired from the U.S. Navy cruiser Lake Erie off the coast of Hawaii. The satellite was inoperative, having failed to reach its intended orbit when it was launched in 2006.  Due to its rapidly deteriorating orbit, it was destined for uncontrolled reentry within a month. United States Department of Defense expressed concern that the [tpl]convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on[/tpl] fuel tank containing highly toxic hydrazine might survive reentry to reach the Earth’s surface intact.
Several governments including those of Russia, China, and Belarus protested the action as a thinly-veiled demonstration of their anti-satellite capabilities.[tpl]cite news |first=Andrew |last=Gray |title= U.S. has high confidence it hit satellite fuel tank |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1930844420080222 |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080225204300/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1930844420080222| archivedate= 25 February 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] China had previously caused an international incident when it tested an anti-satellite missile in 2007.
