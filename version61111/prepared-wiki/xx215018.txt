[[Khanhoo]]

CATEGORIES: Rummy, Chinese card games

 
Khanhoo is a non-partnership Chinese card game of draw-and-discard structure which may be as old as T'ienkeu ("Heaven and Nines"), revised in its rules and published in an authorized edition by Emperor  Kao Tsung in 1130 AD for the information of his subjects. Meaning "watch the pot", it is very possibly the ancestor of all rummy games.Sid Sackson, Card Games Around the World, pg. 7, Dover publications (1994), ISBN 0-486-28100-0
Adapted to the western taste by Sir William Henry Wilkinson, British sinologist and Consul-General in China and Korea in the mid-1890s, it belongs to the same family as Mahjong and the mid-nineteenth century Mexican card game Conquian, whose name probably derives from the Chinese card game Kon Khin.

==History==

===Terminology===

Khanhoo, "Kanhǔ" (Pinyin: 看虎) or "Kanhú" (Pinyin: 看湖), seems to have its roots derived from a term in Mahjong, being Hu (和) a state where a player has a certain combined set of Mahjong tiles that turns out to be victorious. Winning is called hú (胡) in Chinese. Kanhu, which is phonetically related to Khanhoo, is one of the games with the terminological component Hu, there being many other games with the name Hu. The card games Mohu poker (默和牌) and Penghu poker (碰和牌) also bear the same terminology.

===Evolution===

Although Kanhu may be a simplified derivative form of Mǎ diào (马吊牌), Dohu, also known as Kanhu, was one of the gambling games during the Ming Dynasty. The game of Mǎ diào, also known as the Paper tiger, played with a 40-card deck and four flowers called Shiwanguan, Wanguan, Suozi, and Wenqian, not only emerged and prevailed during the Ming Dynasty, but also waned in the early Qing Dynasty. Despite the fact that there were over 30 revisions on the Great Qing Legal Code, which banned the game of Mǎ diào in 1740, the card players ignored the officials and the law code, and like this the game was slightly modified into another called Peng He Pai (碰和牌), as the number of cards doubled to 120 so that the set could then be played in the form of Kan (3 consecutive numbers), Peng (3 identical pieces) and Gand (4 identical pieces).[tpl]cite web|last=Sloperama|title=History of Mah-Jongg|url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq11h.html|publisher=Sloperama.com|accessdate=26 January 2013[/tpl] 
Although the game of Mǎ diào is widely considered to be the first card game in Chinese history, researchers in the subject contradict this theory by saying that Yezixi (叶子戏), of the Tang Dynasty, is the first one. But this is again denied by other researchers seen that the game of Yezixi is asserted not to be based on paper cards, but instead on some other materials like bamboo. It has four derivatives: Dohu (斗虎) (Kanhu) (看虎), Che Zhang (扯张), Mo He Pai (默和牌) (Mohu) and Peng He Pai (碰和牌) (Penghu). Both games, Penghu and Mohu, flourished during the Qing Dynasty,[tpl]cite web|last=CEFC|title=La culture insolente du mah-jong. Le miroir d’une autre société chinoise|url=http://www.cefc.com.hk/pccpa.php?lg=fr&aid=709|publisher=CEFC|accessdate=26 January 2013[/tpl] so that the game of Kanhu may probably have emerged after the beginning of Qing Dynasty and later evolved into the game of Mahjong, although this cannot be substantiated.

==Chinese version==

===Suits===

Known to the Chinese laborers as Káan ú, the game is played by two or more persons with one complete pack of one hundred and twenty cards. The three suits in the deck are: 
The three extra cards, which correspond more or less closely with the joker of our Euchre pack, are called: 

===Meldings===

In the Chinese version of the game the following triplets are called ngán (eyes):
A winning hand must contain at least one of the above combinations called "eyes" and the remaining cards must be arranged in one or more combinations called pát tsz (boys), a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, or three cards of the same rank. All aces, the red flower, white flower, and old thousand, may be added to these "eyes", to the sequences or triplets to form a winning hand. The dealer is chosen by drawing a card from the pack and counting the players up to the number of the card drawn. The dealer deals the first card to himself and fourteen others to each of the players, so that in the end he has fifteen. As this is the number needed for a winning hand, and the dealer alone has this number, he is the only player with the chance to win on the cards dealt to him. Either he wins or discards one card to the player on his left who now has gythe chance to take that card or buy one from the stock to see if he wins or discards. The third player then has his turn of play and so on. The first to show a winning hand composed of "eyes", sequences and combinations, wins the game, usually played for money bet in a pot.

==English version==

In 1891 Sir William induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the "extra cards" and two Jokers. As the years passed, his passion for the game became so great that in his last books he was designated as William "Khanhoo" Wilkinson,[tpl]pt icon[/tpl] Colección por fascículos - Juegos de Cartas, Ediciones Altaya, Barcelona (1997), in cooperation with Naipes Heraclio Fournier, Vitoria, Spain. as published in a collection of fascicles issued in Portugal and Brazil in 1997.  
The Chinese game from which Sir William got his inspiration is called Káan ú and seems to have been widespread in China in the second half of the nineteenth century. In China it is played with four 30-card decks of "money cards," also called kun p'ai, or "stick cards."

===Deck of cards===

The kun p'ai pack can be adapted from two English 52-card decks, removing all cards ♠, except for the J's ♠, Q's ♠ and K's ♠, and the 10's, J's, Q's, K's ♦, ♣, ♥. Add one Joker and a Khanhoo 61-card deck will have been formed.

===Game play===

Distribute fifteen cards one by one or in batches of two or three to each player and stock the remaining cards face down to the table to form a stock pile. In turn, the first player draws, melds if possible and discards one face up to the table to form a waste pile. Then the next player draws, melds if possible and discards one to the table.[tpl]cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=William Henry|title=The Game of Khanhoo|year=1891|publisher=Charles Goodall & Son|location=London|pages=9–25[/tpl] [tpl]OCLC|81622398[/tpl]  
If a thrown card suits any of the players, it must be melded immediately so that all the other players can see why that player needed that card. But if a player draws a card from the stock pile, it needs not to be shown until he is able to lay all his cards at once.
The aim of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, such as 50 or 100 points, wins the match,[tpl]de icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|last=Voigt|first=Claus|title=Asiatische Spiele|year=2006|publisher=Schlütersche|isbn=3899940431|page=92|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_x_rZ1ojQSkC&pg=PA89&dq=khanhoo#v=onepage&q=khanhoo&f=false[/tpl] which can be achieved in two, three or more rounds of games.

===Scores===

In a game of less than 5 players, the best possible hand would score 29 points (besides 5 for full hand): Double Khanhoo (15 points), any Double Triplet (10 points) and any one of the Royal Groups (4 points) equals 29 points.
The smallest possible score would be 2: Two sequences of 9 and 6 cards or two of 8 and 7 cards respectively. Though sequences score so little they are of great use in filling a hand. Not only does a long sequence take up a large proportion of the 15 cards, but a sequence of more than 3 cards is exceedingly useful, as either a card can be thrown away in order to declare full hand, or used in a triplet, without spoiling the sequence.

===Settling===

At the close of a game players may pay or receive the difference between their scores, as at Skat. Thus if A wins with 52 when B stands at 49, and C and D at 47 each, A receives 3 from B and 5 each from C and D, or 13 in all - B 2 each from C and D, 4 in all, less his 3 paid to A, or a net sum of 1. C and D pay in all 7 each, 5 to A and 2 to B, receiving nothing, as they tie for last place. Points may be anything, from counters to bank notes.

===Penalties===

The penalty for a misdeal is to be deducted from the dealer's score or added to that of each of his opponents, at the option of the latter. Dealing out of turn is not considered a misdeal, nor is the exposure of a card while dealing. In the former case the rightful dealer may claim the deal at any time before the first card is dealt; in the latter, the player whose card is exposed may call for a new deal.
In a three-to-four-hand game, a player calling "bump" may be challenged by any of his opponents to show his cards, and if the cards shown would not make a trick with the card thrown, 5 points are taken from his score or added to the score of each of his opponents, and the elder hand which effected the bump may take the trick into his hand as though he had not gained it by bumping. The cards shown by the offender are not, however, considered exposed and may be used to form tricks.

===Strategy===

Khanhoo is not only a game of chance, depending on the distribution of the cards or the sequence in which the cards are being drawn. It is also a game of skill and expertise, specially in a two-handed game.

===Variation===

A variation of the game can be played by using three decks comprising 90 cards, plus two Jokers to form a new sequence of meldings. 

===Features===

There are only three suits in the deck: Nine cards from Ace through Nine, six Courts and one Joker (One Joker in a 2-hand game or two in a 3-hand game), which can replace any card.
Only the A ♥, 2 ♣ and the 3 ♦ may be used to form a Khanhoo, and only the 7 ♦, 8 ♣ and the 9 ♥, with their respective Courts, may be used to form a Royal Group.
Players cut for the deal, the lowest card winning. Each player receives fifteen cards dealt one at a time or in batches of two or three. The player sitting left of the dealer receives one extra card and has the privilege of leading first. Where the number of players is 4 or 8, the player who cuts the highest card may, before the cards are dealt, elect to go "orphan". In this case he receives six cards dealt one at a time. Should he happen to be the original leader, he will receive an extra card making seven in all.
The game of Khanhoo moves clockwise.
All discarded cards are placed face upwards on the table in order of rejection, so that the previous-last card is covered by the last one played. When the stock is exhausted before a full hand is declared, the heap of rejected cards is turned over, so as to face downwards on the table, forming a new stock then.
In a game for three players the possession of a thrown-out card may be claimed by the third player seated to the right of the player who discarded that card, once he can meld it immediately, after which the game proceeds in the order of play. If four or more players take part in the game, two or more players may request the throw-out card once their meld, except for a "sequence", scores higher than any other, having preference to the card the player in the order of play sitting left to the player who discarded that card. This action is called "bump" because one of the players is bumped by another.
The four-hand game can also be played with one complete pack of 120 cards, plus one Joker. If five or more play, up to five Jokers may be added, each additional one increasing the element of chance in the game. The game proceeds exactly as in the case of three players. 
When four or more players take part in the game, the highest card may elect to go "orphan". There will be then a stock of nine cards left. The game proceeds exactly as with three players, except that there are now two or more players who can bump, instead of one. But for the first and second players, either the third, fourth or the other players in the order of play may claim this privilege, the fourth player being subjected to the third and the third to the challenge of the second. The superior trick, declared in number of points, gets the bump in whomsoever hand it may be, although with equal combinations the elder hand has the first right to bump in the order of play.
The following additions to the number of possible tricks may add an interesting feature to the game:
