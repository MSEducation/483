Critical Mass is a cycling event typically held on the last Friday of every month; its purpose is not usually formalized beyond the direct action of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city or town streets on bikes.
The event originated in 1992 in San Francisco; by the end of 2003, the event was being held in over 300 cities around the world.[tpl]Cite journal |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/729324/London-How-cyclists-around-the-world-put-a-spoke-in-the-motorist%27s-wheel.html|title=London: How cyclists around the world put a spoke in the motorist's wheel|first=Richard |last= Madden|date=December 15, 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK[/tpl]
Critical Mass has been described as "monthly political-protest rides", and characterized as being part of a social movement.[tpl]cite news | title=Holy Rollers | first=Ben | last=Mcgrath | date=November 13, 2006 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/061113fa_fact[/tpl] It has been described as a "monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets."[tpl]cite web | title=Critical Mass London | publisher=Urban75 |year=2006 |url=http://www.urban75.org/photos/critical[/tpl] Participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as "celebrations" and spontaneous gatherings, and not as protests or organized demonstrations.[tpl]cite web |title= Pittsburgh Critical Mass |url= http://pghcriticalmass.org/|accessdate=November 16, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Critical Mass: Over 260 Arrested in First Major Protest of RNC |date=August 30, 2004 |publisher=Democracy Now! |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/30/1453256[/tpl] This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police.[tpl]cite news |title= Critical crackdown |first=Matt |last=Seaton |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= October 26, 2005 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1600570,00.html [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=*BCM* Hong Kong Critical Mass News | first=Adam | last=Rosi-Kessel | date=August 24, 2004 | url= http://www.bostoncriticalmass.org/pipermail/bostoncriticalmass/2004-August/000146.html[/tpl]

==History==

Critical Mass-like bike tours with hundreds of participants took place in Stockholm, Sweden in the early 1970s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alternativstad.nu/Dokument/cyklister-i-storsthlm.html|accessdate=November 16, 2009|title=Cyklister i Storstockholm |language=Norwegian[/tpl] But the first ride within the present wave took place on Friday, September 25, 1992 at 6Â pm in San Francisco. At that time, the event was known as Commute Clot and was composed of a couple of dozen cyclists who had received flyers on Market Street.
Shortly after this, some participants in that ride went to a local bicycle shop for a screening of Ted White's documentary Return of the Scorcher, about bike culture overseas. In that film, American human powered vehicle and pedicab designer George Bliss noted that, in China, both motorists and bicyclists had an "understood" method of negotiating intersections without signals. Traffic would queue up at these intersections until the backlog reached a "critical mass", at which point that mass would move through the intersection. This term from the footage of the movie, was applied to the name of the ride,[ref]
</ref> and the name caught on, replacing "Commute Clot" by the time of the second event.<ref name=10years/>
By the time of the fourth ride, the number of cyclists had increased to around 100 and participation continued to grow dramatically, reaching about 1,000 riders, on average.
The name was soon adopted as a generic label by participants in similar but independent mass rides that were either initiated in various locations around the world at around the same time, or had already existed before 1992 under other names. The term "masser" is sometimes applied to a frequent participant.[tpl]cite web |url= http://chicagocriticalmass.org/about/faq|title=About Critical Mass|publisher=Chicago Critical Mass|accessdate=November 16, 2009[/tpl]
Fred Nemo, a member of the Portland-based band Hazel, documented on his website how people from San Francisco played a role in getting Critical Mass started in Oregon, accompanied by cops on bicycles:[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.monkeychicken.com/cmh.htm | first= Fred |last=Nemo | title= A Slightly Personal History of Portland Critical Mass | work= monkeychicken.com| accessdate=2013-07-17[/tpl]
 Sometime in August of '93 Sara Citybikes  spots dozens of flyers around town that go something like "Tired of being run off the road by cars? Of riding alone, afraid, intimidated? Come to a Critical Mass planning meeting..." ...On the appointed day, I accompany her down to the Howling Frog Cafe, ... noting the 20 or so cyclists of widely varying aspect, mostly listening to some folks from San Francisco rant about cars.  The afternoon of the last Friday in September finds over a hundred cyclists congregating in the South Park Blocks by Portland State... The combination of camaraderie and the feeling of utter safety is a potent mixture, and seems to inspire a cosmic unity of movement among our diverse crowd of bikers. It seems even the couple of bicycle cops escorting us feel it. And when John Benenate up ahead, in his scarily low-to-the-ground paraplegic's recumbent, goes sailing through a red light with a whoop and a holler and the cops blithely ignore it, it seems a revolutionary moment. 

==Organization and tactics==

===Structure===

Critical Mass has a decentralized (rather than hierarchical) structure. Critical Mass is sometimes called an "organized coincidence", with no leadership or membership. The routes of some rides are decided spontaneously by whoever is currently at the front of the ride, while others are decided prior to the ride by a popular vote of suggested routes often drawn up on photocopied fliers. The term xerocracy was coined to describe a process by which the route for a Critical Mass can be decided: anyone who has an opinion makes their own map and distributes it to the cyclists participating in the Mass. Still other rides decide the route by consensus. The disorganized nature of the event allows it to largely escape clampdown by authorities who may view the rides as forms of parades or organized protest. Additionally, the movement is free from the structural costs associated with a centralized, hierarchical organization. In order for the event to function, the only requirement is a sufficient turn-out to create a "critical mass" of riders dense enough to occupy a piece of road to the exclusion of drivers of motorized vehicles.  Authorities in New York, California and Oregon have expressed concern with the difficulty of coordinating with the riders, due to the lack of leadership.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.registerguard.com/news/2006/05/20/a1.criticalmass.0520.p2.php?section=cityregion|title=Rolling protests hit bump|first=Susan|last= Palmer|publisher=The Register-Guard (Eugene, OR)|date=May 20, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-11-15-bikes-new-york_x.htm|date=November 15, 2004|work=USA Today|title=Big pack of bikes piques police|first=Martha T. |last=Moore[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/04.03.97/bikes-9714.html|publisher=MetroActive News & Issues|title=Bicyclists see transportation as critical|first1=Dylan|last1= Bennett | first2=Gretchen | last2=Giles |accessdate= November 16, 2009[/tpl]

===Scale===

Critical Mass rides vary greatly in many respects, including frequency and number of participants. For example, many small cities have monthly Critical Mass rides with fewer than twenty riders which offer safety in numbers[ref]
