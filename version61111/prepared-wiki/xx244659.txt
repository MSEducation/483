[[Selamat Sultan]]

CATEGORIES: Kelantan, Anthems of Malaysia

Selamat Sultan is the state anthem of Kelantan, Malaysia. On July 5, 1927, the Goanese Bandmaster of the Kelantan Police Band, Haji Mohamed bin Mohamed Saaid (1888–1939) was ordered to compose a song (only tunes) to be played to the then-Sultan of Kelantan, Ismail. Subsequently, the words were composed by Mahmood bin Hamzah (1893–1971), who was the State secretary at that time.
