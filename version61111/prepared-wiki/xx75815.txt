CATEGORIES: Geography of Iraq

Khujut Rabu' ([tpl]lang-ar|خوجوت رابه[/tpl]) is a local area to the South-East of Baghdad, Iraq, near the town of the present-day Salman Pak. Also Khujut Rabua. In ancient times this was the location of Ctesiphon and Seleucia on the Tigris.  This area was the capital city of the Parthian Civilization. Modern excavations of these two ancient cites have provided many artifacts from ancient times, including the alleged Baghdad Battery.  Modern tourists can still visit the Arch of Ctesiphon.
