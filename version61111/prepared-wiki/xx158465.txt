Slaves' Graves & Ballads is the third album by American experimental rock band Dirty Projectors. It is a combination of two EPs released in 2004, titled Slaves' Graves and Ballads, hence the name of the LP combination of the two. The two EPs have drastically different sounds: the first features frontman and guitarist Dave Longstreth accompanied by a chamber orchestra called The Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra; the second features Dave and his guitar. When they were originally released, tracks 1-7 were Slaves' Graves and tracks 8-14 constituted Ballads.
