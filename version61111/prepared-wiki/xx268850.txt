Birchet (first name and dates unknown) was an English cricketer who played in major cricket matches in 1768.

==Career==

Birchet played in one major 11-a-side match in 1768 for the Caterham Cricket Club side which represented Surrey against Kent. The match took place on 10 June and Caterham won by 14 runs, Birchet making scores of 3 and 1.Buckley, p.48.  Birchet was also named in a single wicket "fives" match played on 28 May at the Artillery Ground.  He played for the Duke of Dorset's five against a team raised by Sir Horatio Mann.  Birchet scored 1 in the first innings but did not bat in the second, Dorset's team winning by 3 wickets.Buckley, p.47.
Birchet is only recorded on those two occasions and it is not known if he played regularly in earlier and later seasons. Players were rarely mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other known references to Birchet.
