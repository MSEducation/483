Since 2011, the character's storylines have been met with controversy and negative feedback. Case herself has stated that she has been unhappy with the character being paired with "too many men" because it "waters" the storyline down. A storyline in which she let her children believe she was dead was heavily frowned upon by Yahoo!.[tpl]cite web|last=Jones|first=Jae'|title=Will Nick and Adam Forgive Sharon on 'The Young and the Restless'?|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/news/nick-adam-forgive-sharon-young-restless-201400976.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=January 10, 2012|coauthors=Jae' Jones|date=July 30, 2011[/tpl] The show's cast and viewers were appalled when Sharon was romantically paired with her former father-in-law who she had grown to have a father-daughter relationship with, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden).

But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience."[tpl]cite book|last=McElwain |first=Julie |chapter=Crazy Talk |title=CBS Soaps In Depth |date=October 22, 2012 |pages=55–57[/tpl]
The show's former head writer and executive producer Maria Arena Bell has been highly criticized for the "destruction" of Sharon.

On January 29, 2010, it was announced that Case would unveil her own signature line of fashion jewelry entitled "Pomp". Inspired by her love for fashion, the actress co-created over 50 pieces with her best friend and fashion stylist, Elif Inanc.

I thought I had walked into a room full of treasure", stated Case, speaking about her ongoing passion for accessories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soapcentral.com/yr/news/2010/0801-case_pomp.php |title=Sharon Case launches jewelry line | The Young and the Restless @ |publisher=Soapcentral.com |accessdate=June 15, 2013[/tpl] The line was designed to have a "piece for everybody" which could be worn on any occasion. 20 different designs of jewelry pieces were featured in the line's initial reveal through the shopping cable QVC Network in August 2010; prices ranged from $20–40. Nine more additional pieces were added to the "Pomp" jewelry line on January 15, 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Daugherty|first=Kim|title=Y&R's Sharon Case: Fashion Jewelry that Makes You Sparkle|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/news/y-rs-sharon-case-fashion-jewelry-makes-sparkle-20110115-113300-334.html|work=Yahoo!|accessdate=June 17, 2013|date=January 15, 2011[/tpl] The fashion jewelry which consists of rings, necklaces and earrings among other accessories, features stones such as hematite, simulated pearls and rhinestones as well as crystals. Kim Daugherty of Yahoo! noted that "they are touted to be ideal for a night on the town, giving 'The Young and the Restless' fans an affordable way to sparkle and shine with star-quality by wearing star-designed jewelry". Furthermore, the line has been noted to be "dramatic" and "shiny".
In January 2012, Case spoke with the website Fashion Wrap-Up about her inspiration for the line, stating: "Elif and I came up with the idea for this jewelry line a few years ago. I really love fashion and she is a stylist. We thought it would be fun to be in business together as friends. We like to keep up with the current trends and we also enjoy all of the classics looks—our focus is on both. We deliberated over the name of the line for some time. We both came up with several different names, and in the end POMP is what we both agreed on based on the meaning of the word: splendor, drama, grandeur, etc."[tpl]cite web|last=Pastore|first=Christy|title=Sharon Case Unveils POMP - A Jewelry Collection Filled with Drama|url=http://www.fashionwrapup.com/Sharon-Case-Unveils-POMP-A-Jewelry-Collection-Filled-with-Drama|work=Fashion Wrap-Up|publisher=Fashion Wrap-Up|accessdate=October 1, 2012|date=January 27, 2012[/tpl] Another inspiration was the character of Sharon Newman, who briefly worked in a lucrative beauty line on the show, "Beauty of Nature".[tpl]cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Tommy|title=Sharon Case Premieres Jewelry Line, Exclusive|journal=Canyon News|date=July 25, 2010|url=http://www.canyon-news.com/artman2/publish/Canyon_People_51/Y_R_Superstar_Sharon_Case_Premieres_Jewelry_Line_Exclusive.php|accessdate=June 17, 2013|publisher=Glen Kelly[/tpl]
