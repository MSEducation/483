Baudin had revealed French plans to colonise Van Diemen's Land when drunk in a farewell party organised by the Governor, after sailing into Port Jackson where his crew were treated back to health from scurvy. Governor King would not accept French occupation of Van Diemen's Land and chartered a schooner called the Cumberland to which in 13 December 1802, Robbins used successfully, persuading Baudin to abandon French settlement on Van Diemen's Land. The schooner was chartered as larger ships were away and used for other maritime activities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eprints.utas.edu.au/2679/1/M19_96.pdf |title=The Hobart Circuit, Tasmania - The Founding of Hobart |date=n.d. |publisher=The Spectator/University of Tasmania |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] From there along with Charles Grimes, Robbins sailed to Port Phillip, and actively explored the Yarra River in 1803 before returning to Port Jackson.[tpl]cite web |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=447135 |title=Manuscript, Oral history & pictures - Record Details |author=State Library of New South Wales |year=2007 |work=Collection Record Details |publisher=State Library of New South Wales |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] It was during a subsequent trip to retrieve two Spanish ships which had been captured by a NSW trader's privateering expedition and hidden off the coast of Deal Island that in 1804 Robbins discovered Robbins island, which is named after him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://colsec.records.nsw.gov.au/indexes/colsec/r/F48c_ri-roc-10.htm |title=ROBBINS, Charles (Lieutenant).
