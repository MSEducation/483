Jean-François Hubert, (February 23, 1739 – October 17, 1797), bishop of Quebec, trained at the Sulpician seminary in Montreal. He was taken under the protection of Bishop Dubreil and served for a time as the bishop's secretary. 
After Bishop Dubreil died in 1760, Hubert became secretary to vicar general Jean-Olivier Briand the following year. Briand became bishop of the Diocese of Quebec and, in 1766, Hubert was the first ordination by the bishop.
