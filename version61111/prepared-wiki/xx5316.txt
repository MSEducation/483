===Television===

Alexander is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television sitcom Seinfeld (1989–1998), in which he played George Costanza (Jerry Seinfeld's character's best friend since childhood).
Alexander first found success on television in the commercial for the McDonald's McDLT.
Before Seinfeld, he starred in a short-lived CBS sitcom called Everything's Relative in 1987 which lasted six episodes. Concurrently with his Seinfeld role, Alexander provided the voice of the lead character in the cult animated series Duckman (1994–1997). Alexander also voiced Catbert, the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived Dilbert animated series based on the popular comic strip.
He made cameo appearances in the second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, playing himself. Alexander also appeared in the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, along with the other three principal Seinfeld cast members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/03/seinfeld-cast-t.html |author=Rice, Lynette|title=Exclusive: 'Seinfeld' cast to appear on 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'|publisher=EW.com|date=2009-03-05|accessdate=2009-07-26[/tpl] He also had a part in the ABC sitcom Dinosaurs, as Al "Sexual" Harris (who frequently engaged in sexual harassment) as well as other voices. Despite a relatively successful career in film and stage, Alexander never managed to repeat his Seinfeld-level of success in television. 2001 marked his first post-Seinfeld return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived ABC sitcom Bob Patterson (which was canceled after just 5 episodes). Alexander partially blames the lack of success on the mood of the country after 9/11.[tpl]cite news | title = In Step With: Jason Alexander | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = April 3, 2005 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_04-03-2005/in_step_with_0 [/tpl]
His second chance as a TV series lead, the CBS sitcom Listen Up! (September 20, 2004 to April 25, 2005), also fell short of a second season.

He was featured in the Friends episode "The One Where Rosita Dies" as a suicidal supply manager named Earl.

This is referred to in an episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Alexander appears as a neurotic and critical loner called Leonard. He describes himself as free and mentions that he makes money with a job "selling toner over the phone". Also in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George – his character's name on Seinfeld. Alexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the Broadway musical Bye Bye Birdie, as Conrad Birdie's agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show Muppets Tonight.
