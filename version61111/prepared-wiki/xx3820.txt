[[Heteroatom]]

CATEGORIES: Organic chemistry

In organic chemistry, a heteroatom (from Ancient Greek heteros, different, + atomos) is any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen. Usually, the term is used to indicate that non-carbon atoms have replaced carbon in the backbone of the molecular structure. Typical heteroatoms are nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.[tpl]cite journal |title=Role of the heteroatom o in the complex metal hydride reduction of six-membered cyclic ketones |journal=Chirality |url= |author=Senda Y |year=2002 |volume=14 |issue=2-3 |pages=110–20 |doi=10.1002/chir.10051[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |title=The Role of Heteroatoms in Oxidation, Oxidation of Organic Compounds, Chapter 13 |author=Cheves Wallin |pages=166–173 |doi=10.1021/ba-1968-0075.ch013 |journal=Advances in Chemistry |volume=75[/tpl]
In the description of protein structure, in particular in the Protein Data Bank file format, a heteroatom record (HETATM) describes an atom as belonging to a small molecule cofactor rather than to be part of a biopolymer chain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/format32/v3.2.html |title=Atomic Coordinate Entry Format Version 3.2 |publisher=wwPDB |date=October 2008[/tpl]
