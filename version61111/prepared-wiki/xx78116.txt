CATEGORIES: National symbols of Dominica, National flags

The flag of Dominica was adopted on November 3, 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990.
The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the sisserou parrot, which also appears on the coat of arms granted July 21, 1961. This parrot is unique to Dominica. It is an endangered species, only 250-350 individuals remain.http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/106001690/0 
The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the Trinity and the Christian faith, and its 3 colors recall the native Indians, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 stars stand for the 10 parishes (St. Andrew, St. David, St. George, St. John, St. Joseph, St. Luke, St. Mark, St. Patrick, St. Paul, St. Peter) and the red disk for social justice.
The sisserou parrot is sometimes shown as blue, and sometimes purple. When it is purple (the parrot's colour in real life), the flag of Dominica is the only national flag to include the colour purple.
