Iran did not legislate in favor of a universal social protection, but in 1996, the Center of the Statistics of Iran estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by social security. Membership in the social security system is compulsory for all employees.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/21843/64830/E90IRN01.htm| title = Labour Code| accessdate = 2009-03-01| last = Rouznameh| first = Rasmi| date = November 20, 1990| publisher = International Labour Organization[/tpl]
