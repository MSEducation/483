===Political Campaigns===

Walz decided to run for Congress in 2006. Walz had no opponent in the race for the DFL nomination for the seat in the September 12, 2006 primary election. He beat incumbent Republican Gil Gutknecht in the general election on November 7, and took office on January 3, 2007.  After the election, a Walz profile described him as having caught Gutknecht “off guard” and as having “resolved never to get caught like that himself....He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.”[tpl]cite news |title= Tim Walz confident about survival|author= James Hommann|url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43583.html|newspaper= Politico|date= 14 October 2010|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl]
He was reelected in 2008 with 62 percent of the vote, becoming only the second non-Republican to win a second full term in the district.  He won a third term in 2010, defeating State Representative Randy Demmer with 50 percent of the vote.

====Veterans Issues====

Having served 24 years in the National Guard, Walz is the highest ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.  As a freshman in Congress he was given a rare third committee membership when he was assigned to the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=259152&keyword=veterans&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Timothy J. 'Tim' Walz — Walz Receives Rare Third Committee Appointment |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl] Walz has championed enhanced veterans benefits since taking office in 2007.

====2008 financial crisis====

During 2008, Walz repeatedly spoke out against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=22428&can_id=65443 |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Walz on HR 3997 - Financial Asset Purchase Authority |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl] Walz released a statement after passage of the bill saying, "The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes to recouping the losses taxpayers might suffer. I also regret that this bill does not do enough to help average homeowners, or provide sufficient oversight of Wall Street.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=434133&keyword=bailout&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Timothy J. 'Tim' Walz — Walz Votes Against Bailout Plan |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl]
In December 2008 he used the same reasoning when he voted against the bill that offered $14 billion in government loans to bail out the country’s large automobile manufacturers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=23069&can_id=65443 |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Walz on HR 7321 - Automotive Industry Financing |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12[/tpl] In June 2009 Walz introduced a bi-partisan resolution calling on the federal government to "relinquish its temporary ownership interests in the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Group, LLC, as soon as possible” and stated that the government must not be involved in the management decisions of those companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=478878&keyword=bailout&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Timothy J.

====Jobs/Economy====

Despite his “No” votes on bailout bills which loaned taxpayer money to the large banks and auto manufacturers, Walz did vote with his Democratic colleagues to support the 2009 American Recovery & Reinvestment Act (aka Stimulus bill). As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Walz saw the stimulus bill as an opportunity to work “with his congressional colleagues to make job creation through investment in public infrastructure like roads, bridges and clean energy the cornerstone of the economic recovery plan.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=438895&keyword=economy+and+jobs&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Timothy J.

In July 2009 he voted for the Small Business Research and Innovation Act which he described as "part of our long-term economic blueprint to spur job creation by encouraging America's entrepreneurs to innovate toward breakthrough technological advancements."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=478873&keyword=economy+and+jobs&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart — Representative Timothy J.
