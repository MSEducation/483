==Early life==

Michael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to police officer/Canadian Forces member William Fox and actress/payroll clerk Phyllis Piper.[tpl]cite episode | title = Michael J.

The family finally moved to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/michael-story.html |title=Michael J. Fox Biography |publisher=The Michael J Fox Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010[/tpl] Fox attended Burnaby Central Secondary School, and now has a theatre named for him in Burnaby South Secondary.
Fox, at age 15, starred in the Canadian television series Leo and Me produced by the CBC, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver. Fox is one of four members of the Leo and Me cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/apr/04/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing|title=Can you catch Parkinson's?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/64051_mjfox27ww.shtml|title=Michael J.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film Letters from Frank, credited under the name "Michael Fox". He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild, which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities, he discovered that Michael Fox, a veteran character actor, was already registered under the name. As he explained in his autobiography, Lucky Man: A Memoir and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of "Andrew" or "Andy," so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on "J", as an homage to actor Michael J. Pollard.

==Acting career==

===Early career===

Fox's first feature film roles were Midnight Madness (1980) and Class of 1984 (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing "Young Republican" Alex P. Keaton in the show Family Ties which aired on NBC for seven seasons, 1982-9. Fox received the role only after Matthew Broderick was unavailable. Family Ties had been sold to the television network using the pitch "Hip parents, square kids,"[tpl]cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/03/reagans_favorite_sitcom.single.html |title=Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero |work=Slate |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode. At its peak, the audience for Family Ties drew one-third of America's households every week. Fox won three Emmy awards for Family Ties, in 1986, 1987 and 1988. He also won a Golden Globe Award in 1989.
Brandon Tartikoff, one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your crow in. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.
While filming Family Ties, Fox met his wife, Tracy Pollan, who portrayed his girlfriend, Ellen. When Fox left the TV series Spin City, his final episodes made numerous allusions to Family Ties: Michael Gross (who played Alex's father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty's (Fox's) therapist,[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/20/entertainment/ca-10674 |title=Putting His Own Spin on 'City's' Season Finale |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 20, 2000 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace[/tpl] and there is a reference to an off-screen character named "Mallory".Shales, Tom. "Michael J. Fox, Playing 'Spin City' to a Fare-Thee-Well." Washington Post, May 24, 2000, C1. Also, when Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington, D.C., he meets a conservative senator from Ohio named Alex P. Keaton, and in one episode Meredith Baxter played Mike's mother.
In 1980, Fox auditioned for the role of Conrad Jarrett in the Academy Award winning film "Ordinary People."

===Film career===

In January 1985 Fox was cast to replace Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in Back to the Future.
Robert Zemeckis, the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg the creator of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved."Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)" Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30 a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=backtothefuture.htm |title=Back to the Future Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010[/tpl] Variety applauded the performances, arguing Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin.[tpl]cite news | work = Variety | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788826 | date = July 1, 1985 | title = Back to the Future | accessdate = October 9, 2008[/tpl] The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).
During and immediately after the Back to the Future trilogy, Fox starred in Teen Wolf (1985),  Light of Day (1987), The Secret of My Success (1987), Bright Lights, Big City (1988) and Casualties of War (1989).
In The Secret of My Success, Fox played a recent graduate from Kansas State University who moves to New York City where he has to deal with the downs and ups of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, taking $110 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo|date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl] Roger Ebert in The Chicago Sun Times wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |work=Chicago Sun Times |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl]
In Bright Lights, Big City, Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in The Washington Post criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".[tpl]cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | coauthors = | title = City Blight | work = Washington Post | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate =[/tpl] Meanwhile Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".[tpl]cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = Bright Lights, Big City | work = Chicago Sun-Times | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 [/tpl] During the shooting of Bright Lights, Big City, Michael was reunited with his on-screen girlfriend Tracy Pollan from Family Ties.
Fox then starred in Casualties of War, a war drama about the Vietnam War, alongside Sean Penn. Casualties of War was not a box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in Vietnam, received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic’s website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his Family Ties sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl]
In 1991, he starred in Doc Hollywood, a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. Michael Caton-Jones, from Time Out, described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |work=Time Out |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl] The Hard Way was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer James Woods. Between 1992 and 1996, he continued making several films, such as For Love or Money (1993), Life With Mikey (1993) and Greedy (1994). Fox then played small supporting roles in political drama The American President (1995) and comedy Mars Attacks! (1996).
His last major film role was in The Frighteners (1996). The Frighteners tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his "ghost hunting" business. However, a mass murderer comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times wrote; "The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and Trini Alvarado, who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |title=The Frighteners Review |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 19, 1996 |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
