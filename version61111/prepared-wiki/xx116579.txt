==Life==

From an early age Elisabeth was trained and prepared for her marriage to Sigismund II Augustus. Elisabeth's father had attempted to marry his daughter to the Polish prince when she was one year old. Even though Elisabeth knew of her future marriage she was not taught Polish.
Because Elisabeth was the granddaughter of Vladislas II of Hungary, uncle of Sigismund, Pope Clement VII had to give a papal dispensation so the wedding could take place.http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/katalog/skarb,Brewe_Pawla_III_w_sprawie_dyspensy_malzenskiej_Zygmunta_Augusta_i_Elzbiety_Austriackiej_z_dnia_17_V_1544_roku,gid,164726,cid,1955.htm 16 year old Elisabeth married 22 year old Sigismund on May 6, 1543, in Wawel. Elisabeth's mother-in-law Bona Sforza did not want the wedding to take place because she opposed the Habsburgs.
The marriage deteriorated when Elisabeth was diagnosed with epilepsy. Throughout the duration of their marriage, Sigismund kept Barbara Radziwiłł as his mistress. At the same time Bona openly expressed her dislike of Elisabeth. Her father-in-law, Sigismund I the Old showed sympathy to Elisabeth.
In Autumn 1544, Elisabeth and Sigismund II moved to Lithuania where they lived in Vilnius. Sigismund continued his affair with Radziwill.
In the spring 1545 Elisabeth's health deteriorated and she was tormented by increasingly frequent seizures.Translation from Polish Wikipedia At the beginning of June 1545 Sigismund went to Krakow to receive Elisabeth's dowry, leaving his wife alone in Vilnius. On June 15 the young queen died when she was just 19, exhausted by her many epileptic seizures. She was buried on August 24, 1545, in Vilnius Cathedral next to her husband's uncle, a brother of her grandfather, Alexander the Jagiellonian.
Her quarrel with Queen Bona Sforza over the Parmesan cheese is commonly known in Poland.
After Elisabeth's death Sigismund II married Radziwiłł and, after her death, married Elisabeth's younger sister, Catherine of Austria. Sigismund had no children from his three wives or from any of his mistresses.
