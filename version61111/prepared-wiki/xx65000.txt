[[Foundation for the Advancement of Art]]

CATEGORIES: Arts organizations

The Foundation for the Advancement of Art, founded by painter Michael Newberry, has as its stated purpose "to establish innovative representational painting and sculpture as the alternative to postmodern art in the world's leading contemporary art museums."  The foundation hosts an annual lecture conference.  The foundation's web site complains that although there are very many representational artists, they are discriminated against by art museums.
