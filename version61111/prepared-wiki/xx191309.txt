==History==

The Irish name Muileann Fúca was historically anglicised as Mullinfooky.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) The English name comes from Sir Foulkes Furlong (c.1410-???) who was Seneschall of Bree.
A battle was fought near here on 20 June 1798, during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. It is  known as the Battle of Horetown (or Goff's Bridge, or Foulksmills). A large contingent of United Irishmen armed with pikes engaged in battle a smaller British Crown force armed with rifles and cannon, commanded by General John Moore; both sides withdrew after heavy fighting.

The living is an impropriate curacy, in the diocese of Ferns, and in the patronage of Francis Leigh, Esq., in whom the tithes, amounting to £200, are impropriate, and who contributes towards the performance of the clerical duties of Clongeen and Kilcowanmore, both of which are at present annexed to the impropriate union of Tintern. There are no remains of the church. In the R.

A school for the children of Roman Catholics is supported by subscription; and there are two hedge schools in the parish. There is a dispensary in the village. A house called Abbey Braney, the property of Mr. Cliffe, of Bellevue, is said to occupy the site of a religious establishment, of which there are no particulars on record.[ref]Samuel Lewis, Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, Vol. I. p.364 (1st Edition, 1837)
