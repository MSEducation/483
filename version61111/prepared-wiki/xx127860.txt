Living Blues is a bi-monthly magazine focused on covering the African American blues tradition, and America's oldest blues periodical. The magazine was founded as a quarterly in Chicago in 1970 by Jim O'Neal and Amy van Singel. Alligator Records owner and founder Bruce Iglauer was also one of the magazine's early editors. Howlin' Wolf was featured on the cover of the first issue. In 1983, O'Neal and van Singel donated the publication rights and the magazine's collection of blues memorabilia to the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. At that time the magazine became a bi-monthly. The magazine is currently edited by Brett Bonner, and celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2010.
Each issue contains a variety of features, including artist interviews and profiles, record reviews, and a monthly Top 25 national blues radio chart. Speaking about the magazine for a story by the Associated Press, current editor Brett Bonner "attributes its longevity to a formula from which it rarely strays: allowing the artists to describe how their culture drives the music.""Living Blues Magazine has Four Decades Worth of Blues." 9 September 2010.
The blues singer Deitra Farr was a regular contributor.[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p207251|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography: Deitra Farr|last=Skelly|first=Richard|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=July 13,  2010[/tpl]
