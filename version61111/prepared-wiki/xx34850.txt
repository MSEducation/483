Budawang National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia, located approximately [tpl]convert|200|km[/tpl] southwest of Sydney. It contains part of the Budawang Mountain Range.
Budawang National Park is named after Mount Budawang. The mountain itself derives from the Aboriginal word ‘Buddawong’. The vantage point afforded by the mountain was originally used to make signal fires. 
The Budawang National Park is largely isolated. Its terrain is steep and rugged. The park comprises high-altitude moist forests.[tpl]cite web |title=Budawang National Park |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0045 |publisher=NSW National Park and Wildlife Service |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 September 2013[/tpl]
