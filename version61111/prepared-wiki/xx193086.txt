The Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company Plant, also known as Baptist Student Center, Georgia State University or Baptist Student Union, Georgia State University, is a historic building in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the headquarters of the Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company, and the place where the transition from Coca-Cola as a drink served at a soda fountain to a mass-marketed bottled soft drink took place.
In 1966 the building became the Baptist Student Union for Georgia State University.
It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983.[tpl]Cite journal|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company Plant / Baptist Student Union, Georgia State University|32 KB[/tpl]|date=, 19 |author= |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying eight photos, exterior and interior, from 1901 and 2003|32 KB[/tpl]
