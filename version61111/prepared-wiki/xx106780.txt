The Plaza México, situated in Mexico City, is the world's largest bullring. This 41,262-seatHistoria de la Plaza México facility is usually dedicated to bullfighting, but many boxing fights have been held there as well, including Julio César Chávez's third bout with Frankie Randall.http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=643&docTipo=1&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC The Plaza México replaced the ancient bullbag Toreo de la Condesa in the Condesa neighborhood that was overwhelmed by the rapid development of the Mexican population. It opened on 5 February 1946 and annually since then, that date marks the date of the Corrida de Aniversario. This building was built beside the football stadium Estadio de la Ciudad de los Deportes (now Estadio Azul).
