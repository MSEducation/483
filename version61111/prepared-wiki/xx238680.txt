The group consisted of three young girls: Laura Pisu, Emma Marrone and Colomba Pane. Their debut single "Stile" was presented at Italian Music Awards (IMA), the single was released on December 19, 2003 and entered the Italian Singles Chart at number #24.
After the first single the girls began work on their debut album, But then there began to be several differences between the girls, and so, the girls kept their distance and the group walked away cancelling the release of the album.
Then in 2005, the girls communicated officially a reunion of the group and the releases of another album.
The group recorded the soundtrack of the cartoon W.I.T.C.H, and in May 2006 was finally released their debut album LS3, an English language album with 90s dance influence. The release of the single "Day To Come" was cancelled. The album was a commercial failure for poor promotion.
After the official disbanded Emma Marrone recorded an album with the rock group Mjur, the album was released in 2008. In 2009 Marrone became part of the talent show Amici di Maria De Filippi that relaunched her music career. Emma won the competition and in March 2010 Emma's debut solo EP Oltre with the first single "Calore" was released. The single and EP were both #1 in Italian Charts. In October 2010 her second solo record A me piace cos√¨, also from Universal, was released.   Laura Pisu in 2010 appeared in Ligabue's music video for the single "Un Colpo All'Anima".
