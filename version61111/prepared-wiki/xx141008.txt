In 1931, Lemon Grove Grammar School principal Jerome Green, acting under instructions from school trustees, turned away Mexican children at the schoolhouse door and ordered them to the Mexican only school/barn. Some of the Mexican children turned away spoke   English only and not Spanish. The landmark lawsuit resulting from the "Lemon Grove Incident" became the first successful school desegregation court decision in the history of the United States.The Lemon Grove Incident: The Nation's First Successful Desegregation Court Case by Robert R.
