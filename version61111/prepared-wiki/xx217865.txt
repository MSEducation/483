[tpl]About|the professional American basketball player|other uses|Albert White (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Albert White[/tpl]

Albert White (born [tpl]birth date|mf=yes|1977|06|13[/tpl]) is a professional American basketball player who last played for the London Lightning of the National Basketball League of Canada.  Before joining the Lightning, White had played in a variety of domestic and foreign basketball leagues.  In high school, he was one of the most highly decorated basketball players in the United States.  In college he achieved success after transferring from University of Michigan to University of Missouri, but his success did not lead him to the National Basketball Association (henceforth NBA).  Instead, he went to the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and has since played in various developmental and foreign basketball leagues as a professional.
In high school, he was a Street & Smith,  Parade, and McDonald's All-American and in college he became a first team All-Big 12 Conference player and CNN/Sports Illustrated Big 12 Player of the Year.  White was implicated in the University of Michigan basketball scandal, but was not named in the final indictments.  He transferred from Michigan to Missouri after his freshman year, which included the basketball scandal, for unrelated reasons.  He achieved several firsts for Missouri and led the team to their best season in the Big 12 era in 1998–1999.
He declared himself eligible for the 1999 NBA draft as a redshirt junior and went undrafted.  He was drafted in the 1999 CBA draft. He has had multiple stints in the CBA, United States Basketball League (USBL), International Basketball League (IBL) and various foreign leagues.  As a professional, he once was named to the All-CBA second team.  He was selected as an All-star or All-league player and been part of championship teams in several of the professional leagues he played in.
