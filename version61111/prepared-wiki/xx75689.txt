Anarchist Party of Canada (Groucho-Marxist) was a dadaist political party based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was best known for hitting famous people with pies.[tpl]cite book |author=Antliff, Allan |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Only a Beginning: An Anarchist Anthology |edition= |publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press |location= |year=2004 |pages= 74â€“76|isbn=1-55152-167-9 |oclc= |doi= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Of-9Yjbf5OgC&pg=PA74&dq=%22Anarchist+Party+of+Canada%22#PPA75,M1|accessdate=[/tpl]  Some of the people thus assaulted include U.S. president Jimmy Carter's brother Billy, the federal opposition leader, Joe Clark, future B.C. premier Bill Vander Zalm and Eldridge Cleaver.  The mottoes of the Anarchist Party of Canada were "vote with a pie" and "The whole world Canada".  They were loosely affiliated, or shared many members with, the short-lived Rhinoceros Party of Canada branch in British Columbia.
The reference to Groucho Marx in the party's name is a parody of the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist).
