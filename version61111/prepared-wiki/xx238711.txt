From 2003 - 2007 Nachte Raho was held at the University of Iowa,http://www.uiowa.edu Iowa Memorial Union. Due to the increasing success and popularity of the competition, a larger venue was needed. It was held at Hancher Auditorium in 2008. Due to campus wide catastrophic flooding, Nachte Raho returned to the Iowa Memorial Union in 2009 and will be held there until Hancher reopens or a new facility is built.
The top teams are chosen from a wide range of qualified applicants to come to the University of Iowa in Iowa City and perform a five to ten minute dance routine. Participating teams perform one of three popular styles of Indian dance: Garba-Raas, Bhangra, and Fusion.
There will be a new format for this year's competition. 3 teams from each category will be invited to Nachte Raho. There will be one winner from each category and an overall grand prize winner. $5,000 in total prize money are given out to the top three teams. The winner of each category will receive $1,000 and the overall grand prize winner will receive $2,500 for a total of $3,500.
