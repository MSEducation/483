Canute II the Tall ([tpl]lang-sv|Knut Långe till Sko; Knut Holmgersson[/tpl]), was King of Sweden from 1229 until his death in 1234. His father HolmgerLars O. Lagerqvist & Nils Åberg Litet lexikon över Sveriges regenter Vincent förlag, Boda kyrkby 2004 ISBN: 91-87064-43-X p. 14 was called a "nepos" of King Canute I of Sweden, which usually meant nephew. It can thus be assumed that Canute II was a grandnephew of King Canute I. He would then have been a great-grandson of King Eric the Saint; legends give Philip Ericson, King Eric's youngest son, as the father of Holmger, Canute's father. Canute was closely allied with Folkungs, who wanted to limit the powers of the church and king.
Canute was a member of the council that ruled Sweden from 1222 to 1229, during the early reign of Eric XI. In 1229 Eric was overthrown after the Battle of Olustra in Södermanland. Canute was crowned in 1231, but his time in office was short. After his death Eric returned and ruled until his own death in 1250.
Canute was married to Helena, whose parentage and date of death vary between researchers. One source alleges that she died before 1227, and that she was the daughter of jarl Folke Birgersson. Both of their sons—Holmger (d. 1248) and Philip (d. 1251)—died in the Folkung uprisings fighting against Birger jarl.Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor This source (in Swedish) follows old legends and romantic genealogies without modern criticism.
