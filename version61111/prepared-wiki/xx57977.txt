Alaska Airlines, sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Alaskan Airlines",http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/passenger-alaskan-airlines-flight-berserk-19267162http://www.ninkasibrewing.com/alaskan-airlines-magazine-true-brews/ is an airline based in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac, Washington, in the United States. The airline originated in 1932 as McGee Airways. After many mergers with and acquisitions of other airlines, including Star Air Service, it renamed itself Alaska Airlines in 1944. It now has service throughout the contiguous United States, Canada, Mexico, and four Hawaiian Islands. Alaska Airlines carries more passengers between Alaska and the contiguous United States than any other airline.[tpl]cite web|title= Company Facts|url= http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/newsroom/as-fact-sheet.aspx|date=June 2011|work= Alaska Airlines|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67XePD9Ub|archivedate= May 9, 2012|accessdate= May 9, 2012[/tpl]
Classified as a major carrier, it is the seventh-largest US airline in passenger traffic. Alaska currently operates its largest hub at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.
Alaska Airlines' sister carrier, Horizon Air, is closely integrated into Alaska's operations, with Alaska and Horizon sharing many routes. Both airlines are owned by Alaska Air Group. In 2013, J. D. Power and Associates ranked Alaska Airlines highest in customer satisfaction of traditional North American airlines for the sixth consecutive year.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130515-908673.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=J.D.

Alaska Airlines is not part of any of the three major airline alliances. However, it has codeshare agreements with some members of Oneworld, such as British Airways, LAN Airlines and American Airlines, and with some SkyTeam members, including Air France, Korean Air and Delta Air Lines.
In 2011, Alaska Airlines' parent company, Alaska Air Group, replaced AMR Corporation in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.[tpl]cite news|last= Hwang|first= Inyoung|title= Alaska Air to Replace AMR in Dow Jones Transportation Average|url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-30/alaska-air-to-replace-amr-in-dow-jones-transportation-average.html|work= Bloomberg Businessweek|date= November 30, 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67XesxuHg|archivedate= May 9, 2012|accessdate= May 9, 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years (1932–1945)===

The airline traces its roots to McGee Airways, which was started by Linious "Mac" McGee in 1932. The airline flew its inaugural service between Anchorage and Bristol Bay with a Stinson single-engined, three-passenger aircraft.[tpl]cite web|last= Crowley|first= Walt|url= http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2107|title= HistoryLink Essay: Alaska Airlines|work= Historylink.org|date= February 1, 2000|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67j7wMl05|archivedate= May 17, 2012|accessdate= May 17, 2012[/tpl] At the time, there were no scheduled flights; a flight took place when there were passengers or a load of cargo or mail.[tpl]cite web|title= Alaska Airlines History by Decade|work= Alaska Airlines|url= http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/company/history/Decades.asp|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67j7Lp42Y|archivedate= May 17, 2012|accessdate= May 17, 2012[/tpl]
It was the middle of the Great Depression and the airline was struggling financially. There were also too many airlines in Anchorage and not enough demand to support them. In the next few years the airline performed many mergers and acquisitions that produced changes in the name and saw business expand throughout Alaska. The first of these mergers was in 1934, when McGee sold his namesake airline for US$50,000 to Star Air Service, an airline also located in Anchorage. This allowed McGee to enter the mining industry.[tpl]cite news|last= Glab|first= Jim|title= Alaska Airlines 75th Anniversary|url= http://atwonline.com/it-distribution/article/alaska-airlines-75th-anniversary-0309|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67j6xvY4n|work=Air Transport World|archivedate= May 17, 2012|accessdate= May 17, 2012|date= December 1, 2007[/tpl] With a fleet of fifteen aircraft, Star Air Service was a dominant airline in Alaska. But Star continued to struggle financially because of high maintenance costs for its wooden planes.[tpl]cite web|title=Alaska Air Group, Inc. – Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Alaska-Air-Group-Inc-Company-History.html|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl]
In 1937, McGee came back to the airline and opened a liquor store, and the airline began flying liquor to remote Alaskan communities. That year, Star Air Service purchased Alaska Interior Airlines and was incorporated as Star Air Lines. Star was again sold later that year to a group of miners.
In 1938, federal regulation began when Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The CAB awarded the airline most of the routes that it wanted in Alaska, but the coveted route between Seattle and Anchorage was awarded to Pan American Airways.
In 1941, Star Air Service was purchased by Raymond Marshall, a businessman from New York. In 1942, the airline purchased three other airlines in Alaska, Lavery Air Service, Mirow Air Service, and Pollack Flying Service as well as a hangar at the Anchorage airport. That year, the airline's name was changed to Alaska Star Airlines. The name Alaska Airlines was adopted on May 2, 1944 having narrowly beaten a competitor who was also applying for the name. In the 1940s Alaska's headquarters were in Anchorage.Alaska Airlines Gets New Chief. St. Petersburg Times. June 3, 1947. Section 2, Page 11. Retrieved on Google News (12 of 59) on February 18, 2010.
When the US entered World War II in December 1941, Alaska Airlines faced a shortage of pilots. During the war the airline also lacked funds and equipment, and pilots were often forced to buy fuel for their planes out of their own pockets. The company, which was frequently subjected to lawsuits, also went through many different presidents during this time. In 1943, Alaska Airlines purchased the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, its first multi-engine aircraft. That same year the company's stock was traded for the very first time on the American Stock Exchange.

===Expansion after World War II (1945–1949)===

In 1945, Alaska Airlines hired its first stewardesses. In 1947, James Wooten became president of the airline and he began to expand the airline greatly. Under his leadership, the company purchased many surplus military aircraft from the government that were used during World War II. The airline purchased Douglas DC-3s, Douglas DC-4s, and Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commandos. Alaska Airlines was the first carrier certified to operate DC-3s on skis.
The airline used its new aircraft to expand its charter business, and by 1948, it was the world's largest charter carrier. The airline had charter flights from Anchorage to Honolulu, Hawaii as well as a flight to Chicago with a stop in Seattle. Flights on this route were technically not scheduled, but they were flown regularly. However, these flights would later result in a lawsuit in 1948 by competitor Pacific Northern Airlines because of the fact that they were operated on a regularly scheduled basis yet technically non-scheduled charter flights.
Alaska Airlines also flew in other parts of the world, and participated in airlifts such as the Berlin Airlift in Germany and Operation Magic Carpet in the Middle East. In the 1948 Berlin Airlift, the airline flew supplies to Allied West Berlin after the Soviets imposed a blockade on the city. It also contributed to several other airlifts, including evacuating Chinese Nationalist forces during the 1949 Communist Revolution in China.
The carrier played an important role in organizing an airlift of Jews from Yemen to Israel, in Operation Magic Carpet from 1949 to 1950. Alaska Airlines, along with many other airlines, helped fly Jews to Tel Aviv in the newly created country of Israel. This was not an easy task, however. Airplanes could not land in Arab territory, so they had to be fitted with extra fuel tanks in order to fly nonstop between Yemen and Israel. The airplanes also had to fly over hostile territory and were often shot at by Arabs. The airport in Tel Aviv was frequently bombed, so they could not keep aircraft there overnight. Despite this, there were no aircraft destroyed or lives lost.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/company/history/MagicCarpet.asp|title= Operation Magic Carpet |work= Alaska Airlines|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67j7Z6fCF|archivedate= May 17, 2012|accessdate= May 17, 2012[/tpl]
Alaska Airlines' large charter business made it profitable, and the airline moved its base of operations to Paine Field, an airport north of Seattle. It kept a branch office in Anchorage, however. Despite its success, Alaska Airlines' worldwide charter business was short-lived. In 1949, the CAB tightened its regulations and placed heavy fines on the airline and shut it down completely for safety violations. The airline was prohibited from operating worldwide charter flights, and president James Wooten left the company.

===New leadership (1950s)===

Alaska Airlines started the 1950s without its worldwide charter business and operations restricted to the state of Alaska. In 1950, it purchased two smaller Alaskan airlines, Collins Air Service and Al Jones Airways.
Though the airline had grown much under the ownership of Raymond Marshall, the CAB forced him out in 1951 due to continuing financial troubles. Also, Marshall had owned Alaska Airlines with the intent of getting money for himself, and he was not concerned about the long-term stability of the company. In 1951, the CAB awarded Alaska Airlines with a temporary certificate allowing them to operate on routes from the Alaskan cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks to Seattle and Portland in the contiguous United States; this award would become permanent in 1957.
In 1952, the CAB appointed Nelson David as president, and he began to improve the financial stability of the airline. By 1957, with the carrier in a better financial situation, David left and Charles Willis, Jr. became the company's new president and CEO. A pilot during WWII, Willis introduced several marketing gimmicks that set the airline apart from other ones of the day. Under his leadership, Alaska Airlines became the first to show inflight movies. The company began service of the Douglas DC-6, the airline's first pressurized plane, enabling flights above clouds and weather disturbances. On these DC-6's, the airline introduced "Golden Nugget" service, which included an on-board saloon and piano.

===The jet age (1960s)===

In 1961, competitors began introducing jets on routes Alaska Airlines flew. To counter this competition, Willis negotiated with aircraft manufacturer Convair to purchase a jet Convair 880 with no money down for use on routes between Alaska and the contiguous United States. The company introduced the new jet aircraft the same year, and later leased several more of the same type.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/company/history/Overview.asp|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/67j7k8pFc|archivedate= May 17, 2012|accessdate= May 17, 2012|title= Historical Overview|work= Alaska Airlines[/tpl] The carrier later introduced the Boeing 727, and that airplane became Alaska Airlines' signature aircraft for the next 25 years. It also became the first carrier to fly the Lockheed L-100 Hercules, the civil version of the C-130, which hauled oil drilling rigs to Alaska's North Slope and later to Ecuador. Alaska also owned two Lockheed L-1649A Starliners from 1962 to 1968, which were used for Military Air Transport Service operations.California Classic Propliners – L-1649A Starliners; Gibson, Tom – Retrieved 11/5/10Lockheed Constellation Survivors – N7316C c/n 1018; Petersen, Ralph M. – Retrieved 11/5/10Lockheed Constellation Survivors – N8083H c/n 1038; Petersen, Ralph M. – Retrieved 11/5/10
During this time, Alaska Air faced some tough competition with other airlines such as Pan Am, Northwest Airlines and a regional carrier called Pacific Northern Airlines (later merged with Western Airlines). To set itself apart from the competition, it turned to some cheap but imaginative gimmicks such as having safety instructions read as rhymes, fashion shows in the aisles, as well as bingo games.
In December 1962 Air Guinée signed a contract with Alaska Airlines which saw the latter company providing management expertise, in addition to two Douglas DC-6s. The deal would have seen Alaska Airlines contracting with the airline over a seven-year period but the contract ended after only six months, leading to the United States Agency for International Development paying a US$700,000 debt owed by the Guinean airline to Alaska Airlines.[tpl]cite book |last=Guttery |first=Ben R. |title=Encyclopedia of African airlines |publisher=Ben R. Guttery |year=1998 |location=New York City, New York |pages=78–79 |isbn=0-7864-0495-7[/tpl]
In 1965, Alaska Airlines turned over some routes between small Alaskan communities, as well as some smaller aircraft, to Wien Air Alaska. This allowed Alaska to focus on more heavily traveled routes and allowed them to sell off smaller aircraft.
Throughout the 1960s, Alaska Airlines worked to promote tourism to Alaska by offering charter flights to the continental United States. In an attempt to increase the state's appeal, Alaska Airlines conducted a promotional tour of Japan in 1963. In 1967, as the state of Alaska celebrated its centennial, Alaska Airlines introduced a promotional "Gay Nineties" theme with stewardesses dressed in Edwardian outfits. That year, Alaska Airlines expanded to southeast Alaska with the introduction of service to Sitka. This led to the purchase of two smaller airlines, Alaska Coastal Airlines and Cordova Airlines, in 1968.

===Economic hardship (1970s)===

In the beginning of the 1970s, Alaska Airlines began charter service to Siberia in the Soviet Union. This was the result of three years of secret negotiations between Alaska Airlines and Soviet authorities, in which the US Department of State reluctantly chose not to block the plan for fear of a potentially negative response from the Soviets. The airline gained permission to fly more than two-dozen flights in 1970, 1971, and 1972.
However, the airline was not in good financial shape at that time. Like much of the airline industry, Alaska Airlines was hit with rising fuel and operating costs and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Revenues were significantly reduced when work on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was delayed. The airline's cargo aircraft had played a key role in building the pipeline, but now sat idle. The airline took another blow on September 4, 1971, when a plane crashed on landing in Juneau, killing 111 people and resulting in the worst single-plane crash at the time. Because the airline was struggling financially, the airline's board ousted the president and CEO Charles Willis. Former board member Ronald Cosgrave succeeded him. The airline was [tpl]US$|22[/tpl] million in debt when Cosgrave took over, so Cosgrave began to make major cuts. The airline's cargo business was dropped completely, as well as many flights and employees. Cosgrave also sought to improve the airline's tarnished image of "Elastic Airlines." The logo was changed to an image of a smiling Eskimo, which remains today. As a result of these efforts, the airline made a profit in 1973 and continued to be profitable thereafter.

===Post-deregulation expansion (1978–1990)===

Alaska Airlines was one of only three US carriers that supported the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, knowing that they would reap significant growth and other benefits from deregulation. After deregulation, the company's real-estate division was spun off into its own company, with Cosgrave becoming its chairman. Leadership of the airline was passed to Bruce Kennedy, a close associate of Cosgrave. Cosgrave made an alliance with Alaska Airlines to purchase competitor Wien Air Alaska, but this ultimately failed and resulted in fines for Alaska Air and its leaders for improprieties during the attempted acquisition.
At the time of deregulation, Alaska Airlines served ten cities in Alaska and one in the continental US —the city of Seattle—, and it had only ten planes in its fleet. Immediately after deregulation, the airline began to expand, adding the cities of Portland and San Francisco to its network. Soon later, the airline resumed services to the Alaskan cities Nome and Kotzebue, and it also introduced service to Palm Springs, California. Burbank and Ontario were added in 1981. Other cities in the continental US that were added to the airline's route map by 1985 were Oakland and San Jose in California, Spokane in Washington, Boise in Idaho, and Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona.
Deregulation also brought challenges to the airline, however. The airline was faced with increased competition and inflation that put tremendous pressure on costs, profits, and salaries. There were also tensions with unions, particularly mechanics and flight attendants. In 1985, the company had a three-month-long strike with its machinists. By June the same year, it was able to end the strike by promising to reduce labor costs and maintain peace with unions. In November 1985, the airline introduced a daily air-freight service called Gold Streak with service to and from Alaska.
In the 1980s, Alaska Airlines began acquiring McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to replace their aging 727s. Alaska was the launch customer for the MD-83, taking delivery of their first MD-80s in 1985.[tpl]cite web|title= Alaska Airlines Completes Transition to All-Boeing Fleet|url= http://splash.alaskasworld.com/newsroom/asnews/asstories/AS_20080828_140339.asp|publisher= Alaska Airlines|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68MhGQfPg|archivedate= June 12, 2012|accessdate= August 18, 2012|date= [tpl]date|2008-8-28|fmt=mdy[/tpl][/tpl]
Also in 1985, the Alaska Air Group was formed as a holding company for Alaska Airlines. In 1986 Alaska Air Group acquired regional airline Horizon Air, which remained a separate brand from Alaska Airlines; since then, both airlines have been subsidiaries of Alaska Air Group. In 1987, Alaska Airlines purchased Jet America Airlines.[tpl]cite web|url= http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjY4fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1|title= Alaska Air Group: 2008 Annual Report|work= corporate-ir.net|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68Mh8ZvLy|archivedate= June 12, 2012|accessdate= June 12, 2012[/tpl] Alaska initially operated Jet America as a separate airline, but this proved economically unviable, and Jet America's operations were merged into Alaska's.  Alaska also discontinued all flights to the Midwest and the East coast formerly operated by Jet America.[tpl]cite book|last=Serling|first=Robert J.|title=Character and Characters: The Spirit of Alaska Airlines|year=2008|publisher=Epicenter Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-933245-11-9|page=238[/tpl]   Additional MD-80s entered the fleet via the acquisition of Jet America Airlines in 1987.[tpl]cite book|last=Serling|first=Robert J.|title=Character and Characters: The Spirit of Alaska Airlines|year=2008|publisher=Epicenter Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-933245-11-9|page=237[/tpl]
There was also a big seasonal imbalance in travel to Alaska, which mainly took place in the summer. In an effort to compensate for this, the airline introduced service to Mexican resorts, where most travel takes place in the winter. In 1988, the airline began servicing the Mexican resort cities of Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. By the end of the 1980s, 70 percent of Alaska Airlines' passengers flew south of Seattle and the airline served 30 cities in six states outside Alaska. The airline had successfully used the state of Alaska as a springboard to expand into larger, more profitable markets.

===New competition, new technologies (1990s)===

The airline began the 1990s with plans to lease 24 Boeing 737–400s from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), all of which remain in Alaska's fleet to this day.  The first aircraft was delivered in April 1992.[tpl]cite news|title=Alaska To Get 1st Delivery of Boeing 737-400 order|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920417&slug=1487017|accessdate=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 17, 1992[/tpl]
In 1991, Alaska Airlines added several routes. In the Russian Far East, it added the cities of Magadan and Khabarovsk, as well as service to Toronto, its first Canadian city and the first city east of the Rocky Mountains. However, Toronto was later dropped, in 1992.
As the airline marked its 19th consecutive year of profits in a turbulent industry and racked up many awards for customer service, Bruce Kennedy retired in May 1991 and was succeeded by Raymond J. Vecci.
Alaska Airlines also faced increased competition from low-cost carriers. One carrier that competed with Alaska was MarkAir. Since it began operating in 1984, competition had been reduced because it had worked out feeder agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline in the fall of 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. The airline offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; for the first time in 20 years, it posted a loss of [tpl]US$|121[/tpl] million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth [tpl]US$|2[/tpl] billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.
The cost reductions produced quick results. In 1993, their losses decreased to [tpl]US$|45[/tpl] million, and they made a [tpl]US$|40[/tpl] million profit the next year. Eight percent of these revenues were generated by record-setting cargo operations.
Alaska had more competition in 1993 when low-cost airline Southwest Airlines entered the Pacific Northwest by purchasing Morris Air. Nevertheless, Alaska Airlines was able to keep its costs down, but it maintained its high level of customer service. The airline also promoted itself as "the last great airline" and with the motto "For the same price, you just get more", yet analysts felt that Alaska Air needed deeper cost cuts. At the same time, the company had many strikes by the flight attendants' union.
Alaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to replace its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. Meanwhile, the airline phased out its 727s, retiring their last one in March 1994. The airline's MD-80 fleet peaked at 44 aircraft in 1996.[tpl]cite web|title=World Airline Directory 1996|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1996/1996%20-%200672.html|publisher=Flight International|accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=March 20, 1996[/tpl]
Vecci was dismissed in 1995 and replaced with John Kelly, former Horizon Air CEO. The airline soon expanded West Coast routes to take advantage of an "open skies" agreement between the US and Canada.
Alaska Airlines also pioneered some new technologies through the 1990s. It added a head-up guidance system in 1989 to operate better in foggy conditions, becoming the first airline to use this technology. In 1995, the airline became the first to sell tickets on the Internet. By 2000, all the airline's planes carried automated external defibrillators, for use in in-flight emergencies. The airline also installed self-service kiosks called "Instant Travel Machines" that printed boarding passes, allowing customers to bypass the traditional ticket counter. An X-ray device, an addition to the unit allowing passengers to check their own baggage was being tested in 1999 at Anchorage. This concept, known as "Airport of the Future" by the airline, was first tested in Anchorage and was later brought to its Seattle hub, and it drew attention from other airlines as well. The airline would also become the first airline in the world to integrate GPS and Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) technology, adding a real-time, three-dimensional display of terrain. The system was operational in all the carrier's Boeing 737-400s by April 1999.
The late 1990s also saw the carrier recording much profitability. The airline added new training and maintenance facilities. Also, the airline began buying new 737s, ordering three Boeing 737–700s and ten Boeing 737–900s.[tpl]cite news|last= Lane|first= Polly|title= Boeing Gets $2 Billion In New Orders For Jets|url= http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971110&slug=2571462|accessdate= July 4, 2012|newspaper= The Seattle Times|date= November 10, 1997|archivedate= July 4, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68uicDq2A[/tpl] Alaska Airlines became the launch customer for the 737–900 when it placed an order for it in November 1997.[tpl]cite web|title= Alaska Airlines Order Launches Boeing 737–900 Program|url= http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1997/news_release_971110b.html|publisher= Boeing|accessdate= July 4, 2012|date= November 10, 1997|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/68uip0fhW|archivedate= July 4, 2012[/tpl]

===Introducing flights across the USA (2000s)===

With the delivery of Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft starting in 1999, Alaska began launching more medium-haul flights. In 2000, Alaska started service between Anchorage and Chicago. On May 15, 2001, the airline took delivery of its first 737–900.[tpl]cite web|title=Alaska Airlines Receives First Boeing 737–900|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2001/q2/news_release_010516a.html|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=February 13, 2012|date=May 16, 2001[/tpl] In 2001, the airline was granted slot exemptions by the Department of Transportation to operate a nonstop flight from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Seattle, but it was halted after only a week due to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Service to Washington, DC was relocated to nearby Dulles International Airport, but the airline resumed service to Reagan Airport on December 4, 2001 to meet the demand. Services to Dulles Airport continued, however.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/newsroom/asnews/asstories/as_20011203_140312.asp |title=Alaska Airlines Resumes Daily Service To Reagan National, Continues Daily Service To Dulles International |publisher=Alaskasworld.com |date=December 3, 2001 |accessdate=August 22, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723162947/http://www.alaskasworld.com/newsroom/asnews/asstories/as_20011203_140312.asp| archivedate= July 23, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In January 2002, William Ayer was named CEO of Alaska Airlines, who was replaced by Brad Tilden in 2012. Ayer had been serving as president under Kelly since 1997, having come to Alaska from Horizon two years earlier after spending 13 years with the smaller airline. Ayer took over as chairman and CEO of the Alaska in 2003 upon Kelly's retirement. He led the company through a transformation called Alaska 2010 that was intended to insulate the airline from the traditional boom-bust cycle of the airline industry.

In 2003, Alaska Airlines won the Technology Leadership Award from the magazine Air Transport World for its pioneering of new technologies both in the airport and within the airplane itself.
In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the Boeing 737 Next Generation and rising costs for maintenance, fuel, and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out its remaining 26 MD-80s and trained its pilots to fly the newer Boeing 737–800s that were being ordered to replace them. According to the airline, the MD-80 burned [tpl]convert|1100|gal|l[/tpl] of fuel per hour, while the 737–800 burns just [tpl]convert|850|gal|l[/tpl] per hour. The last MD-80 flights flew on August 25, 2008, with one flight from San Jose, California to Seattle, Washington, and another from Sacramento, California to Seattle, Washington. To mark its transition to an all-Boeing fleet, Alaska Airlines unveiled a 737–800 with Boeing's house colors painted on the fuselage and the airline's Eskimo logo painted on the tail fin. The aircraft, called Spirit of Seattle, shows Alaska's commitment to Boeing and the fact that the airline now has an all-Boeing fleet.[tpl]cite news|last=Wallace|first=James|title=Alaska's newest 737 – in Boeing colors|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/2008/08/26/alaskas-newest-737-in-boeing-colors/|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6AMaJq4rj|archivedate= September 1, 2012|accessdate= September 1, 2012|publisher= Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date= June 26, 2008[/tpl]

The airline also recorded record profits for 2010, as well as record profits for the fourth quarter of 2010. The profit for the entire year was $251.1 million, an increase from $121.6 million a year earlier. Alaska’s 2010 fourth-quarter profit of $64.8 million was up from $24.1 million from the fourth quarter of the previous year.  Also in 2010, Alaska ranked as the most efficient airline operating in The United States.http://www.theicct.org/us-domestic-airline-fuel-efficiency-ranking-2010
Alaska Airlines continues pioneering new technologies today. In 2011 Alaska Airlines partnered with Boeing and Fujitsu to be the first to use a new technology called Component Management Optimization, which will streamline maintenance checks. It will do this by allowing mechanics to point a handheld device at little RFID tags attached to certain parts of the aircraft, which will display information about when parts were last replaced. This will allow mechanics to perform inspections quicker than conventional methods. The program is scheduled to launch in 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Using radio frequency to inspect airplanes (Video)|url=http://www.boeing.com/Features/2011/05/bca_radio_frequency_05_17_11.html|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=May 19, 2011|date=May 17, 2011[/tpl] Also in mid-2011, the airline issued iPads to its pilots to replace 25 pounds of paper flight manuals that pilots are currently required to carry on flights. Alaska Airlines is the first major airline to use iPads on flights; all pilots had iPads by the middle of June 2011.

In January 2011, Alaska Airlines placed an order for 15 737s, worth [tpl]US$|1.3[/tpl] billion at list prices. The order consists of two 737-800s and thirteen 737-900ERs. The 737-900ERs are a new addition to Alaska Airlines' fleet, and will be used on the airline's long-haul routes. Thanks to its increased range, the 737-900ER will be able to fly transcontinental routes with more passengers, such as the Seattle-Orlando route. “Depending on the ultimate configuration, the larger 737-900ER will have between 21 and 27 seats more than our existing B737-800 [tpl]sic[/tpl] aircraft and will be a perfect fit for our longer-haul and high-traffic West Coast markets,” Alaska Airlines President Brad Tilden said in his company’s release. The airline put its first 737-900ER into service on November 8, 2012 on a flight from Seattle to San Diego.  The airline expects to take delivery of the planes between 2012 and 2017.
In [tpl]start date|2012|10[/tpl], a new order was placed by the carrier in a deal worth more than [tpl]US$|5[/tpl] billion, this time for a total 50 Boeing 737s.  The largest single order in the airline's history, it consists of 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 17 Boeing 737 MAX 9s and 13 Boeing 737-900ERs.

===Fleet history===

Ever since the 1960s, Alaska has been using Boeing aircraft for its fleet. Besides the current 737s Alaska has used, the airline had operated the Boeing 727. The last 727 was retired in May 1994.[tpl]cite web|title=Alaska Airlines Accelerates Aircraft Retirement - Charges to be Taken Against 1993 Results|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ALASKA+AIRLINES+ACCELERATES+AIRCRAFT+RETIREMENT+CHARGES+TO+BE+TAKEN...-a014722111|publisher=The Free Library|accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=December 16, 1993[/tpl]
In the 1980s, Alaska began acquiring McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. Alaska acquired additional MD-80s via the acquisition of Jet America Airlines in 1987.  Alaska was the launch customer for the MD-83, and took delivery of the first airplanes in 1985. Alaska continued to take delivery of new MD-83s during the 1990s, both to meet the demands of a growing route system, and to retire its aging and fuel inefficient 727 fleet. In 2005, due to the greater efficiency of the Boeing 737 Next Generation and rising costs for maintenance, fuel, and crew training, Alaska Airlines decided to phase out the remaining 26 MD-80s and trained the pilots to fly the newer 737-800s that were being ordered to replace them. The last MD-80 flights took place on August 25, 2008.
Alaska also used eight Boeing 737–200 Combi/QCs to suit the unique needs of flying in the state of Alaska. These aircraft were valued for their ability to be rapidly reconfigured (hence the moniker QC or "Quick Change") to match the specific cargo and passenger loads for any given flight. In the all-freight configuration, the 737-200 Combis carried up to six cargo containers, known as "igloos." The palletized floor allowed for passenger seating to range from 26 to 72 seats. The 737-200s were also gravel-kitted, which allowed them to be used at airports such as Red Dog, which formerly featured a gravel runway.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.boeing.com/commercial/news/feature/737qc.html|title= The Airplane That Never Sleeps|publisher= Boeing|date= July 15, 2002|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6A0miQx5Y|archivedate= August 18, 2012|accessdate= August 18, 2012[/tpl] Alaska replaced the 737-200s with six reconfigured 737-400s between 2006 and 2007. Five feature a cargo/passenger arrangement, and one is a "freighter" carrying only cargo. Unlike the 737-200 Combi, the 737-400 Combis feature a fixed seating capacity of 72 seats.  The last 737-200 Combi (short for combination) was retired in 2007 and is now displayed at the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum.Flightline Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum.

===Livery===

The airline's livery consists of the word Alaska on the fuselage, with painting of a native Alaskan on the vertical stabilizer.  The "Eskimo face," as it is often called, was introduced in the early 1970s.  In 1988, Alaska considered replacing the Eskimo face with a new logo resembling a mountain, but later decided to keep the Eskimo face logo after many Alaskans were unhappy with plans to remove it.Gapay, Les (January 12, 1988). "Many frown over possible removal of Alaska Airlines' smiling Eskimo face". Seattle Post-Intelligencer: p. B5.
Today most of its aircraft are white with a blue and teal stripe running the length of the left and right sides of the fuselage, with "Alaska" in the company's present-day wordmark displayed prominently on the sides, and the native Alaskan portrait on the vertical stabilizer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/about-us/newsroom/as-fleet.aspx#aircraft-livery |title=Aircraft Livery |publisher=Alaskaair.com |accessdate=September 12, 2012[/tpl] The carrier also has several special liveries:
