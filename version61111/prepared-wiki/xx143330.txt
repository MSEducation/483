HyperScan is a video game console from Mattel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://service.mattel.com/us/results.aspx?Ntt=hyperscan&image1.x=0&image1.y=0 |title=Mattel and Fisher-Price Customer Service |publisher=Service.mattel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-13[/tpl]  It uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology along with traditional video game technology.   It was marketed toward boys between the ages of five and nine who were not ready for high-end video games in terms of maturity or expense, though ironically the included game was rated T by the ESRB.  The console used UDF format CD-ROMs.  The HyperScan has two controller ports, as well as a 13.56 MHz RFID scanner that reads and writes to the "cards" which, in turn, activate features in and save data from the game. Players are able to enhance the  abilities of their characters by scanning cards. Games retailed for $19.99 and the console itself for $69.99 at launch, but at the end of its very short lifespan, prices of the system were down to $9.99, the games $1.99, and booster packs $0.99.
The system was sold in two varieties, a cube, and a 2-player value pack. The cube box version was the version sold in stores. It included the system, controller, an X-Men game disc, and 6 X-Men cards.  Two player value packs were sold online (but may have been liquidated in stores) and included an extra controller and 12 additional X-Men cards.[tpl]cite web|last=Fillip |first=Game |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IZZDAE |title=ConsoleHyperscan Video Game System: Toys & Games |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl]
The system was discontinued in 2007,[tpl]cite web|url=http://service.mattel.com/us/product_detail.asp?id=K4386&Ntt=K4386&Pn=1&Brand=Radica&Cat=Radica+Electronic+Games |title=Mattel Consumer Relations Answer Center - Product Detail >> Radica >> Radica Electronic Games |publisher=Service.mattel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31[/tpl] shortly after its release, and is featured as one of the ten worst systems ever by PC World magazine.[tpl]cite web|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/179472/7_mattel_hyperscan.html |title=The 10 Worst Video Game Systems of All Time - Slide 5:7.

Five games are known to be released for the HyperScan.  The released games are X-Men, Ben 10, Interstellar Wrestling League, Marvel Heroes, and Spider-Man.

The X-Men game is a fighting game in which two characters face off against each other in self-contained matches.  Marvel Heroes, which includes some X-Men characters, is a side-scroller, adventure quest.
The Ben 10 game is similar to "Marvel Heroes", the Spider-Man game is also similar to the Ben 10 and Marvel Heroes game.
Interstellar Wrestling League is a sort of 2v2 Fighting Game similar to Tekken, but with strange, alien-like characters.
