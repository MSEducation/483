==History==

The first inhabitants of the area of Launceston were largely nomadic Tasmanian Aborigines believed to have been part of the North Midlands Tribe. Walter George Arthur, who petitioned Queen Victoria in 1847 while interned with other Tasmanian Aborigines on Flinders Island,Henry Reynolds (1995) Fate of a Free People: A Radical Re-examination of the Tasmanian Wars, Penguin Books, Australia, p.159 ff lived for several years in Launceston as one of numerous homeless children, before being taken into custody by George Augustus Robinson who sent him to the Boy's Orphan School in Hobart in 1832.Henry Reynolds (1995) Fate of a Free People: A Radical Re-examination of the Tasmanian Wars, Penguin Books, Australia, p.16
The first white visitors did not arrive until 1798, when George Bass and Matthew Flinders were sent to explore the possibility that there was a strait between Australia and Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). They originally landed in Port Dalrymple (the mouth of the Tamar River), [tpl]convert|40|km[/tpl] to the north-west of Launceston.[tpl]cite web |title = History of Launceston|publisher=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/93/223/ |accessdate =27 February 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The first significant colonial settlement in the region dates from 1804, when the commandant of the British garrison Lt. Col. William Paterson, and his men set up a camp on the current site of George Town. A few weeks later, the settlement was moved across the river to York Town, and a year later was moved to its definitive position where Launceston stands.[tpl]cite web |title = Logbooks of the Lady Nelson |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7509/7509-h/7509-h.htm#ch10 |accessdate =27 February 2009[/tpl]
Initially the settlement was called Patersonia; however, Paterson later changed the name to Launceston in honour of the New South Wales Governor Captain Philip Gidley King, who was born in Launceston, Cornwall. The name still survives in the tiny hamlet of Patersonia [tpl]convert|18|km[/tpl] north-west of Launceston. Paterson himself also served as Lieutenant-Governor of northern Van Diemen's Land from 1804 to 1808.
By 1827, Launceston's population had climbed to 2,000 and the town had become an export centre, mainly for the colony's northern pastoral industry. Small hotels and breweries began to emerge in the 1820s, before larger, more "substantial" hotels were built in the 1830s. Sporting groups, political groups, churches and schools were often established in these hotels; however, they also hosted plays, musical soirees and readings, until theatres were built.
Newer popular team sports such as cricket and football failed to be sustained in Launceston before the population grew substantially. The sports were initially middle class recreations, as the working class found it difficult to participate after a six-day working week. Nevertheless, a "demand for facilities" lead to the upgrade of the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground (NTCA Ground) amongst other sporting facilities in the 1860s. Not long beforehand, Tasmania played Victoria in Australia's first first-class cricket match at the NTCA Ground in 1851.Green (2006), p. 8–13.
Tin was discovered at Mount Bischoff in 1871 in north-western Tasmania, starting a minerals boom. Gold mining commenced approximately [tpl]convert|50|km[/tpl] away in Beaconsfield in 1877. During the following two decades Launceston grew from a small town into an urban centre. In 1889, Launceston was the second town in Tasmania to be declared a city, after state capital Hobart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tco.asn.au/oac/community_history.cgi?oacID=35|title=Short Launceston History|publisher=Launceston Online Access Centre|accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl]

==Geography==

Launceston is at [tpl]Coord|41|26|31|S|147|8|42|E|type:city_region:AU-TAS|display=inline[/tpl] in the Tamar Valley, Northern Tasmania. The valley was formed by volcanic and glacial forces over 10 million years ago.Wooley and Tatlow, p. 1.[tpl]cite web |title = Geography of Launceston |publisher=Asia Rooms |url = http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/australia/launceston/launceston-overview/geography-of-launceston.html |accessdate =4 January 2009 [/tpl]
The city is approximately [tpl]convert|45|km[/tpl] south of the Bass Strait, with its closest neighbour-city being Devonport, approximately [tpl]convert|99|km[/tpl] to the north west.[tpl]cite web |title = Driving Times |publisher=Tourism Tasmanian |url = http://travelmedia.tourismtasmania.com.au/visit/driving_times.html |accessdate =4 January 2009 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Launceston combines steep (originally heavily wooded) ridges and low-lying areas (originally wetlands – with parts of the suburbs of Inveresk and Invermay below high-tide level).[tpl]cite web |title = LISTmap (Mount Ossa) |publisher=Tasmanian Government Department of Primary Industries and Water|url = http://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/listmap/listmap.jsp?llx=419200&lly=5363700&urx=420100&ury=5364300&layers=17 |accessdate =19 June 2007 [/tpl]
As a result, areas of Launceston are subject to landslip problems, while others are liable to poor drainage and periodic flooding. The topography of the area is not conducive to easy dispersion of airborne pollution, due to the phenomenon of thermal inversion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soer.justice.tas.gov.au/2003/atm/1/issue/6/index.php|title=Launceston topography and meteorology|publisher=State of the Environment (SoE) Tasmania|accessdate=16 September 2008[/tpl]
During recent years the city's air quality has improved. Studies indicate that 73% percent of air pollution in Launceston and surrounding areas during the winter period is caused by wood smoke, while about 8% is from motor vehicle pollution. During the early 1990s about 60% of households used wood heaters, but now only 25–30% of households use wood heating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/airquality.php|title=Air quality for Launceston and the Tamar Valley|publisher=Launceston City Council|accessdate=31 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071010094830/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/airquality.php |archivedate = 10 October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=2405|title=History of Air Quality in Launceston |publisher=Launceston City Council|accessdate=31 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080723205655/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=2405 |archivedate = 23 July 2008[/tpl] The 2008 winter was the first time Launceston's air quality did not exceed PM10, since air quality monitoring began in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.media.tas.gov.au/release.php?id=25002|title=Launceston Air Quality Continues to Improve |publisher=Tasmanian Government|accessdate=31 October 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Launceston is situated at the confluence of the South Esk River and the North Esk River, forming the Tamar River estuary. It is used for commercial and recreational shipping and boating. In earlier years, ocean going shipping used the river to obtain access to the Port of Launceston wharves located in the city centre and Invermay.
The Port for Launceston is now located at the George Town suburb of Bell Bay, some [tpl]convert|40|km[/tpl] downstream on the east bank of the Tamar estuary, close to the river mouth. The South Esk River is the longest river in Tasmania. It starts in the North East Mountains near Roses Tier and flows through the Fingal Valley where it passes through the towns of Fingal and Avoca before flowing into the Northern Midlands where it flows through the towns of Evandale, Perth, Longford and Hadspen before finally reaching Launceston via the Cataract Gorge. The river is dammed at Lake Trevallyn on the upper reaches of the Cataract Gorge, with water being diverted into the Trevallyn Power Station with runoff flowing into the remainder of the Cataract Gorge and eventually merging with the Tamar River. The North Esk River starts in the Northallerton Valley in Tasmania's north-east mountains and winds its way to Launceston via the Corra Linn Gorge at White Hills. The St Patrick's River, the largest tributary of the North Esk, is dammed at Nunamara to provide the majority of Launceston's town water since the mid 1800s.

===Flooding and levee system===

Since the 1960s, parts of Launceston have been protected by a series of flood levees that reach up to [tpl]convert|4|m[/tpl] in height. The reason for this is because large portions of Invermay and Newstead sit within a flood plain. The last major flood occurred in 1929, when Invermay was completely devastated. More than 4,000 people were left homeless after just one night of flooding. Since then, there have been minor floods but nothing as severe.Flood Warning Markers[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl], Launceston City Council Brochure Work is underway on a $59 million flood levee upgrade that should protect the city from 1-in-200-year events, that is expected to take five to six years to construct.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2011/02/21/3144392.htm|author=Tim Walker|title=Flood levee vital for Launceston|publisher=ABC Northern Tasmania|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011[/tpl] The council has acquired land used by eighteen businesses on the south side of Lindsay Street in Invermay, with businesses having until July 2009 to leave.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/01/2233084.htm|title=LCC compulsorily acquires land for flood levee project|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=1 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/human-interest/20m-blowout-in-launceston-levee-costs/1547563.aspx|title=$20m blow-out in Launceston levee costs|publisher=The Examiner|accessdate=3 July 2009[/tpl]

===Climate===

Launceston has a cool, temperate climate,[tpl]cite web |title = Supervising Scientist Report |work=Australian Government |publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |page = 4 |url = http://www.environment.gov.au/ssd/publications/ssr/pubs/ssr128-chap2.pdf |accessdate =31 January 2009 [/tpl]
with four distinct seasons. The city is located in the Tamar Valley and is surrounded by many large hills and mountains. With this type of topography, Launceston's weather patterns can change considerably in a short period of time.
The warmest months are in January and February with an average air temperature range of [tpl]convert|12.2|to|24.4|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Throughout the year there is an average of 4.3 days a year over [tpl]convert|30|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The maximum recorded temperature was [tpl]convert|39|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on 30 January 2009, with Launceston Airport reaching [tpl]convert|40.4|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on that same day, during the 2009 Southeastern Australia heat wave.
Winters are cool with minimum temperatures dropping below [tpl]convert|2|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl] an average of 61 days a year. The coldest month is July, with an average temperature range of [tpl]convert|2.2|to|12.5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The lowest recorded minimum at Launceston's current weather station, Ti Tree Bend was [tpl]convert|-5.2|C|F[/tpl]. Launceston very rarely receives snowfall, the last cases of snow were in 1951 and 1986.
Winter, for Launceston, is also the season with the least amount of wind. Because of this and the topographical affect of the Tamar Valley, Launceston winters are renowned for foggy mornings, with Launceston Airport the most fog-bound commercial airport in Australia. The average annual rainfall, with moderate to low variability, is [tpl]convert|665|mm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl], falling on an average of 88.4 days a year. The most rain Ti Tree Bend has received in a year was [tpl]convert|829.6|mm[/tpl] in 1992, though Launceston Airport received [tpl]convert|953.1|mm|in[/tpl] in 1956. As in most of Tasmania 2006 was the driest year when just [tpl]convert|394.8|mm[/tpl] fell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/tas/20090130.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|title=Tasmania breaks all-time high temperature record again|date=30 January 2009|accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com.au/news/local/news/environmental-issues/422-deg-scamander-sets-states-hottest-record/1420740.aspx|publisher=The Examiner|work=Fairfax Media|title=42.2 deg: Scamander sets State's hottest record!|date=31 January 2009|accessdate=31 January 2009[/tpl]
The Bureau of Meteorology reported that 2007 was the warmest year ever recorded in Launceston since temperatures were first recorded in 1884. Temperatures ranged from a minimum of [tpl]convert|8.1|C|F[/tpl] to a maximum of [tpl]convert|19.2|C|F[/tpl].
During 2006 and 2007, Launceston had the hottest maximums throughout the state. In 2008, Launceston had the highest average maximum temperature out of all Tasmanian cities with [tpl]convert|18.6|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/tas/launceston/climate.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|title=Climate of Launceston|accessdate=26 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_091237_All.shtml|title=Climate of Launceston|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|accessdate=2 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/tas/summary.shtml|title=Tasmania in 2007|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|accessdate=28 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/tas/archive/2006.summary.shtml|title=Tasmania in 2006|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|work=Australian Government|accessdate=1 November 2008[/tpl]

===Architecture===

Many of the buildings in the City's central business district (CBD) were constructed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/02/20/2167593.htm |title=The changing landscape of Launceston documented in oil |publisher=ABC News; Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=21 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Vision 2020 |work=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/images/stories/Vision2020.pdf |accessdate =22 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Major Developments |work=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/313/664/ |accessdate =22 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Launceston's many well preserved Victorian and Georgian buildings (including the Launceston synagogue, a rare example of architecture in Egyptian Revival style) together with its diverse collection of art-deco architecture (such as Holyman House and Lucks Corner in the CBD, the former Star Theatre in Invermay and the former Launceston General Hospital)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ltvtasmania.com.au/content/view/45/151/|title=Launceston City|publisher=Launceston Tamar Valley Tasmania|work=Launceston City Council |accessdate=17 September 2008[/tpl] give the city an unusual period ambience. The "Brutalist" architecture of the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries, that dominates most large modern cities and many smaller ones, is relatively rare. The more interesting exceptions to this include the Government offices of Henty House in Charles Street, the Police Station Building and the ANZ Building on the corner of Brisbane & George Street.
This is at least in part a matter of deliberate policy – concerns that high rise development might compromise the essential character of the city centre have led to strictly enforced building regulations that restrict the height of new structures in the city, so that most buildings in the CBD have fewer than five storeys.

==Governance==

A large portion of Launceston is contained within the City of Launceston local government area, however some outer suburbs are part of adjacent council districts: for instance Riverside and Legana are part of the West Tamar Council; Prospect Vale and Blackstone Heights are included in the Meander Valley Council.
Launceston City Council meetings are held in the Launceston Town Hall. In 2002, Janie Dickenson became the youngest female elected mayor in Australia.[tpl]cite news |title = History of the Mayor |work=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/129/297/ |accessdate =22 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title = Mayor and Alderman Profiles |work=Launceston City Council|url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/content/view/123/285/ |accessdate =22 January 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The current mayor, Albert Van Zetten, who was initially elected in 2007, before being re-elected in 2009, and again in 2011, became Launceston's 91st mayor.
State Upper House seats that incorporate parts of Launceston are the Electoral Divisions of Paterson, Windermere and Rosevears. For federal elections, Launceston falls within the Division of Bass, with the sitting member being Andrew Nikolić for the Liberal Party of Australia who won the seat in the 2013 election. The state Lower House seat is also called the Division of Bass, and is one of the five electorates in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Both federal and state seats share common boundaries.

===Flag===

The Launceston flag design is based on the city's Coat of Arms granted by the College of Arms, London on 11 June 1957.[tpl]cite web |title = Coat of Arms |publisher=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=1283 |accessdate =16 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080722054429/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=1283 |archivedate = 22 July 2008[/tpl] The Brisbane Street Mall, the War memorial at Royal Park, atop the Council Chambers and on top of the Albert Hall are places in the city where the flag is regularly flown. The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city's three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with the jagged edge is green to represent the city's parks, gardens and surrounding countryside. Waratah flowers at the top symbolise all flowers and similar beauties of nature. The ingots are included because Launceston used to be a large tin smelting centre. The little circle at the river junction is Launceston.

==Economy==

Along with being a major retail centre with an average of 75% of market share in surrounding local councils, Launceston is a major service centre for the north of Tasmania.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/upload/3756/chapter5.pdf|format=PDF|title=Planning New Residential Development|publisher=Launceston City Council|accessdate=17 November 2008[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The city is home to a campus of the University of Tasmania including the Australian Maritime College; and has a minor minerals and manufacturing base.
Launceston is a major hub for the regional agricultural and pastoral activities. Historically, this has been connected with the growing of apples – in recent years the stress has moved to viticulture. Superfine wool remains an important part of the rural economy of north-east Tasmania and wool sales in Launceston attract many international buyers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.treasury.tas.gov.au/domino/dtf/dtf.nsf/v-taseconomy/home|publisher=Tasmanian Government|title=Tasmanian Economy Reports|accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl] The various agricultural industries in the district are supported by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research which operates the Mount Pleasant Research Laboratories in the Launceston suburb of Prospect.

===Tourism===

Launceston serves as the commercial hub for the north of Tasmania, and like many parts of the state, is becoming a major tourist centre. Visitors to the city have grown over the past few years, during 2004 Launceston attracted 412,800 visitors, up 51% from 2001. The United Kingdom is the origin of 25% of all international visitors to the city and 17% originate from the USA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/upload/2579/intro.pdf|format=PDF|title=Retail Strategy for Launceston City|publisher=Launceston City Council|accessdate=4 September 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080725080525/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/upload/2579/intro.pdf |archivedate = 25 July 2008[/tpl] The Cataract Gorge is Launceston's largest tourist attraction and is in close proximity to the city.

===Sport===

Sport is a popular recreational and spectator activity in Launceston and like most of the state cricket and Australian rules football are popular sports. The city has been the birthplace of two prominent Australian cricketers; the former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting and the retired cricketer and Australian selector David Boon. The first first-class cricket match played in Australia was at the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association Ground between the Melbourne Cricket Club and the Launceston Cricket Club in 1851.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1850S/1850-51/AUS_LOCAL/TAS_VIC_11-12FEB1851.html|title= Tasmania V Victoria|accessdate=28 August 2008[/tpl]
Australian rules football (commonly known locally as "football" or "footy") is very popular in Launceston, and is often played at York Park (Aurora Stadium). Holding 20,000 people—more than any other stadium in Tasmania—York Park was swampland before becoming Launceston's showgrounds in 1873. Hawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year between 2003 and 2006. In 2007, the Tasmanian Government signed a A$16.4 million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, under which the club will play four regular season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match at the venue each year. Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events, and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $23.6 million. Association football (commonly known in Launceston as "soccer") is also played and watched in Launceston Park—the only place in Tasmania to have hosted national league soccer matches. A National Soccer League game was held at Aurora Stadium in 2002 between Perth Glory and Melbourne Knights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/NSL/20012002/Round20.html|title=NSL 2001–2002, Round 20|publisher=Ozfootball.net|accessdate=10 June 2008[/tpl] A-League's Melbourne Victory have held a pre-season cup game at the venue each year since 2006.

===Tram and rail network===

Launceston operated a suburban tramway system between 1911 and 1952, which consisted of 29 trams. It was first conceived in 1909, after observations of efficiently working systems in Melbourne and Adelaide. A decade before the tram system was abandoned, Launceston had begun converting to trolleybuses, especially for the hilly routes. The Launceston trolleybus system was one of the most extensive of the various trolleybus systems in Australia. The tramway network was finally removed in 1952 to make way for cars and buses. A tramway museum in Inveresk is all that remains of Launceston's trams. Launceston's streets, most of which were planned in the early nineteenth century, were probably always too narrow for trams to be fully successful, in many cases little of the roadway remained for other forms of transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railtasmania.com/pres/trams.php|title= Preserved Tasmanian Tramcars |accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl]
A regional passenger rail system operated in Tasmania, of which Launceston was a major hub; however, after many years of gradual retrenchment it was closed in July 1978.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railtasmania.com/photos/|title= The Tasman Limited|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl]

===Utilities===

Launceston's electricity is primarily generated by renewable hydro electric power plants including the Trevallyn Power Station which is supplied with water from Trevallyn Dam. The major retailer is Aurora Energy.
thumb|right|Launceston Gas Company's 1930s vertical retort from the east Historically, Launceston was powered by gas from the Launceston Gas Company (later Gas Corporation of Tasmania). The first gas plant was built in 1860 as a horizontal retort Gas Works house made from brick and sandstone on the site's SW corner. This was followed by keepers cottages, labs, the Headquarters Building and the iconic 1930s vertical retort recognised by the wording "COOK WITH GAS" written it its brickwork.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boral.com.au/history/Ch5_4.html |title=:: BORAL's First 60 Years :: |publisher=Boral.com.au |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl] The Duck Reach power station replaced gas for street lighting when it was completed in 1895. Until the 1950s when Trevallyn Power Station was built, Duck Reach Supplied Launceston with most of its power needs. Both Gas Works and Hydro facilities have been preserved as interpretive historic sites.
Launceston's water comes from the Launceston Water Catchment. The majority is sourced from St Patricks River, a tributary of the North Esk River which flows through Launceston. The main retailer is Ben Lomond Water. The first reticulated water supply constructed in 1857 still serves the CBD.http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/shadomx/apps/fms/fmsdownload.cfm?file_uuid=ED329DA3-C2B8-C7D5-9CA2-DC9C9440ADAA&siteName=ieaust[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] There were fears that the Tamar Valley Pulp Mill might adversely affect Launceston's water supply.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/19/2368954.htm |title=Gunns answers water supply critics – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]
