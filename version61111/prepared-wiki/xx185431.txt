The Yusufeli Dam is an arch dam under construction on the Çoruh River near Yusufeli in Artvin Province within the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. The Yusufeli Dam will be the second largest dam within the larger Çoruh River Development Plan, which plans to build 13 dams, of which two are operational and another two are under construction. The dam's main purpose is hydroelectric power production and it will support a 540 MW power station. The dam is controversial because of its projected impact on the biodiversity within its reservoir area along with the relocation of locals.
On February 26, 2013, the foundation stone was laid in a ceremony attended by Minister of Forestry and Waterworks Veysel Eroğlu and Minister of Labor and Social Security Faruk Çelik. It is expected that the construction of the dam will cost [tpl]Turkish lira[/tpl]487 million (approx. US$270 million).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-308216-foundation-of-turkeys-tallest-dam-yusufeli-laid-in-artvin.html |newspaper=Today's Zaman |title=Foundation of Turkey's tallest dam, Yusufeli, laid in Artvin |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-27 [/tpl] The dam's opening date is set to May 29, 2018.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/22688708.asp |newspaper=Hürriyet Gündem |title=Canlı yayında ilginç pazarlık |date=2013-02-26 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-27 [/tpl] When completed, Yusufeli Dam will be Turkey's highest.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2013/02/27/turkiyenin-en-yuksek-barajinin-temeli-atildi |newspaper=Sabah |title=Türkiye'nin en yüksek barajının temeli atıldı |date=2013-02-27 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-27 [/tpl]

==History==

The first studies on the Yusufeli Dam were carried out in the 1970s and it was included in the Coruh River Hydropower Development Master Plan in 1982. The feasibility report was completed in 1986 and the project was added to the national plan in 1997.

==Design==

Situated [tpl]convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Artvin, the Yusufeli will be a double-curvature arch dam with a height of [tpl]Convert|270|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from its foundation and [tpl]Convert|223|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the river's thalweg (lowest point of river bed). It will have a crest length of [tpl]Convert|490|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and crest width of [tpl]Convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] while being composed of [tpl]Convert|2900000|m3|ft3|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of concrete.[tpl]cite web|title=YUSUFELİ BARAJI ve HES|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/yusufeli_projesi.pdf|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=15 January 2011|language=Turkish[/tpl]
The dam's crest will sit at an altitude of [tpl]Convert|715|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level while the normal operating level of its reservoir will be [tpl]Convert|710|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], maximum will be [tpl]Convert|712|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the minimum [tpl]Convert|670|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The reservoir surface area of [tpl]Convert|33|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] will have a total storage capacity of [tpl]Convert|2130000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl] and an active or "useful" storage of [tpl]Convert|1080000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl]. The dam's spillway will be a service controlled chute type with a maximum discharge capacity of [tpl]Convert|8000|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The dam will have an underground power station that is [tpl]Convert|110|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, [tpl]Convert|21.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and [tpl]Convert|45.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] high. Within the power station will be 3 x 180 MW vertical shaft Francis turbines.
Design activities will be carried out by Su-Yapi Engineering and Consulting Inc.
Construction is to be carried out by a Limak Holding-Cengiz Holding-Kolin consortium.[tpl]cite web|title=Yusufeli Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant|url=http://www.limak.com.tr/sectors/construction/projects/dams/yusufeli-dam-and-hydroelectric-power-plant|publisher=Limak|accessdate=7 May 2013[/tpl]
