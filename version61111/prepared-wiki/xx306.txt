Copenhagen ([tpl]IPAc-en|IPA|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ən|h|eɪ|ɡ|ən[/tpl] or 
; [tpl]lang-da|København[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-da|kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn|[/tpl] ([tpl]Audio|da-København.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl])) is the capital and most populous city of Denmark, with an urban population of 1,246,611 and a metropolitan population of 1,969,941 ([tpl]As of|2014|01|01|lc=on[/tpl]). It is situated on the eastern coast of Zealand, [tpl]convert|42|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northwest of Malmö, Sweden and [tpl]convert|164|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast of Odense. The city stretches across parts of the island of Amager and also contains the enclave of Frederiksberg, a municipality in its own right.
Originally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of Christian IV, it developed into an important regional centre, consolidating its position as capital of Denmark and Norway with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment which included the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and cultural institutions such as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Danish fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the creation of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.
Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark and one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. In 2012, Copenhagen was third in the ranking of the richest cities in the world in terms of gross earnings, dropping from first place in 2009. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, the metropolitan area of Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, known as the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterized by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, the Little Mermaid Statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. In addition to recent developments in the city service sector and the pharmaceutical industry, there have been a number of initiatives in clean technology, matching the city's aim to be carbon-neutral by 2025.
Copenhagen has over 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions, including the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen Business School,  Metropolitan University College, and the Technical University of Denmark. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark, and has repeatedly been ranked as one of the best universities in Europe. Copenhagen is home to the FC København and Brøndby football clubs and the ice hockey teams Rødovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the largest airport in the Nordic countries.

==Etymology==

The city's origin as a harbour and a place of commerce is reflected in its name. Its original designation, from which the contemporary Danish name is derived, was Køpmannæhafn, meaning "merchants' harbour", often simply Hafn or Havn. The English cognate would be Chapman's haven.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|author=Oluf Nielsen|title=Kjøbenhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl] The English name for the city is derived from its Low German name, Kopenhagen. The chemical element hafnium is also named for Copenhagen, whose Latin name is Hafnia.[tpl]sfn|Cardarelli|2008|p=336[/tpl] The bacterium Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen, being coined in 1954 by Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360275/ |title=The Genus Hafnia: from Soup to Nuts |publisher=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city's metro have revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century, and the remains of an old church with graves dating to the 11th century have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen. These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins go back at least as far as the 11th century, while substantial discoveries of flint tools in the area provide evidence of settlements as far back as the Stone Age.[tpl]cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] Many historians believe the town dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard.[tpl]sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35[/tpl] The natural harbour and good herring stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=København - historie|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] The first habitations were probably centred around Gammel Strand (literally "old shore") in the 11th century or even earlier.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=Københavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl]
The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as Portus Mercatorum, which translates into Merchants' Harbour or in the Danish of the time Købmannahavn.Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14–15 Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today.[tpl]sfn|Davies|1944|p=365[/tpl] The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.[tpl]sfn|Harding|2009|p=38[/tpl] Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, it was replaced by Copenhagen Castle.[tpl]Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78[/tpl]

===Middle Ages===

In 1186, a letter from Pope Urban III states that the castle of Hafn (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands including the town of Hafn were given to Archbishop Absalom of Roskilde by King Valdemar I. On Absalom's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the Bishopric of Roskilde. Around 1200, the Church of Our Lady was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town which began to expand around it.
The town rose in prominence but was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of herring, the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.[tpl]sfn|Harding|2009|p=38[/tpl] In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen[tpl]cite book|last=Copenhagen|first=Dansk turistforening,|title=Copenhagen, the Capital of Denmark|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|year=1898|page=49[/tpl] who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.[tpl]sfn|Booth|2003|p=9[/tpl] In the mid-1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.[tpl]sfn|Booth|2003|p=9[/tpl]
With the establishment of the Kalmar Union (1397–1523) between Denmark, Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle.[tpl]cite book|author=Christine Ingebritsen|title=Scandinavia in World Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=v1VRPBAF9NcC&pg=PA7|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0966-5|pages=7–[/tpl][tpl]Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78[/tpl] The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://introduction.ku.dk/presentation/history/|title=History of the University|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=12 November 2013[/tpl] The university's Christian role in Danish society was forced to change during the Reformation in the late 1530s.

===16th and 17th centuries===

In disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to Christian II was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of Frederik I, who supported Lutheranism. Thereafter, Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536 during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with Malmö and Lübeck, it was finally forced to capitulate to Christian III. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the Baltic supported by Dutch shipping. Christoffer Valkendorff, a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.
During the reign of Christian IV between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen experienced dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important building were completed on Slotsholmen: the  Tøjhus Arsenal and Børsen, the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the East India Company was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of Christianshavn with its canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=Københavns historie efter Reformationen|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] Christian IV was also responsible for sponsoring an array of ambitious building projects including Rosenborg Slot and the Rundetarn.[tpl]sfn|Harding|2009|p=38[/tpl] In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the Swedes under Charles X and successfully repelled a major assault.
By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at Nyholm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|title=Holmen|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl]

===18th century===

Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its 65,000 to the plague in 1711.[tpl]sfn|Woodward|1998|p=10[/tpl] The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure.[tpl]Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78[/tpl] The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the 1795 fire, it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.Raabyemagle, p. 16.[tpl]cite book|last=Lauring|first=Kåre|title=Byen brænder|pages=86–88[/tpl]
A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1921 |title=Frederiksstaden, København|publisher=arkark.dk|accessdate= 14 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavns_historie_1728-1914 |title=Københavns historie 1728–1914|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefitted from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of Højbro Plads while Nytorv and Gammel Torv were converged."Københavns historie 1728–1914", Den Store Danske.

===19th century===

On 2 April 1801, a British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker defeated a Danish-Norwegian fleet anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson led the main attack.[tpl]Sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247[/tpl] He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed.[tpl]sfn|Cowie|1990|p=130[/tpl] Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at Trafalgar.[tpl]Sfn|Pocock|1994|p=229[/tpl] It was during this battle that Lord Nelson famously "put the telescope to the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease fire.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|title=Copenhagen's second battle remembered – 200 years on |work=The Times |first=Peter|last=Davies|date=3 September 2007[/tpl]
The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a preemptive attack on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to seize the Dano-Norwegian fleet.[tpl]Sfn|Smith|1998|p=204[/tpl] But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary Congreve rockets (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, Vor frue kirke, was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first terror attack against a major European city in modern times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/battle-copenhagen.htm |title=The Battle of Copenhagen|publisher=BritishBattles.com|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|title=Københavns bombardement|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

In the background from left to right: Church of the Holy Ghost, Rundetårn, Trinity Church, St. Nicholas Church (before the spire was rebuilt) and Holmen Church The British landed 30,000 men and surrounded Copenhagen. The attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city. The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their longer-range artillery.[tpl]sfn|Hinde|1973|p=168[/tpl]
Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the Danish Golden Age. Painting prospered under C.W. Eckersberg and his students while C.F. Hansen and Gottlieb Bindesbøll brought a Neoclassical look to the city's architecture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guldalder.dk/|title=Guide til Dansk Guldalder|publisher=Golden Days|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around The Lakes ([tpl]lang-da|Søerne[/tpl]) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of Nørrebro and Vesterbro developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad sanitation in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the Freeport of Copenhagen 1892–94.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|title=Københavns Havn|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish |accessdate=24 November 2013[/tpl]  Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.

===20th century===

By the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. New housing developments grew up in Brønshøj and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/Frederiksberg_Kommune/Frederiksberg_Kommune_(Historie)|title=Frederiksberg Kommune - historie|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] The northern part of Amager and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901–02.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1900/1900.html|author=Steffen Linvald|title=Københavns hvornår skete det|publisher=København|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl]
As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the First World War, Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/monumenter/artikel.aspx?xid=denmark_and_southern_jutland |author=Jan Baltzersen|title=Denmark and Southern Jutland during the First World War|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate= November 2013|language=[/tpl]
In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas.[tpl]sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161[/tpl] However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie_siden_1914?highlight=k%C3%B8benhavns%20historie |title=Københavns historie siden 1914|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's  Torvegade in order to build five large blocks of flats.[tpl]sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161[/tpl]

====World War II====

During World War II, Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. The occupation was not a part of the Nazi German expansion, and initially the German authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. A general parliamentary election was allowed in 1943, with only the Communist Party excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were scuttled in Copenhagen Harbour by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis started to arrest Jews, although most managed to escape to Sweden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|title=The Occupation of Denmark|publisher=Denmark.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
After the Normandy Invasion the Germans feared the Danish police could become a problem. In early September 1944, they set about arresting the entire Danish police force. Most of them, however, managed either to hide or to escape to Sweden. Out of 2,000 policemen captured and deported to Germany, fewer than half returned after the war. In the absence of a police force, during the last eight months of occupation Copenhagen suffered a high rate of common criminality.
Ole Lippman, the leader of the Danish resistance movement (SOE), invited the RAF to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building. The attack came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but unfortunately one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg girls school. Because of this crash four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target, and aimed their bombs at the school leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolgirls).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/shell/shell.html |title=The Bombing of the Shellhus on March 21, 1945|author=Klaus Velschow|publisher=Dansk Militærhistorie |date=21 March 1945 |accessdate=9 March 2013[/tpl] 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.

====Post-war decades====

Shortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the Finger Plan was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five "fingers" stretching out from the city centre along the S-train routes.[tpl]cite book|title=Regional Development Policies in OECD Countries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3SK4Pg3zEHUC&pg=PA357|date=4 November 2010|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-08722-4|page=357[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Cervero|1998|p=132[/tpl] With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former Bådsmandsstræde Barracks in Christianshavn was occupied, leading to the establishment of Freetown Christiania in September 1971.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/historie-og-udvikling/koebenhavns-historie|title=Københavns historie|publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/%E2%80%98copenhagenizing%E2%80%99-world-one-city-time|author=Elise Beacom|title='Copenhagenizing' the world, one city at a time|publisher=the Copenhagen post|date=10 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2013 |language=[/tpl] Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen naval base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's Black Diamond building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.danskarkitekturguide.dk/node/6855|title=The Black Diamond|publisher=Danish architecture guide|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

===2000 to present===

Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmö have been connected by the (Øresund Bridge), which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public transport system and has led to the extensive redevelopment of Amager. The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the University of Copenhagen with its 35,000 students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavn/|title=København|publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] Another important development for the city has been the Copenhagen Metro, the underground railway system which opened in 2000 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/copenhagen/|title=Copenhagen Metro, Denmark|publisher=railwaytechnology.com|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=[/tpl]
On the cultural front, the lavish Copenhagen Opera House, a gift to the city from the shipping magnate Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller on behalf of the A.P. Møller foundation, was completed in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.henninglarsen.com/projects/0400-0599/0553-the-opera-copenhagen.aspx |title=The Opera in Copenhagen|publisher=Henning Larsen Architects|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=[/tpl] In December 2009 Copenhagen gained international prominence when it hosted the worldwide climate meeting COP15.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/copenhagen_dec_2009/meeting/6295.php|title=Copenhagen Climate Change Conference - December 2009|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=[/tpl]

==Geography==

Copenhagen is part of the Øresund Region, which consists of Zealand, Lolland-Falster and Bornholm in Denmark and Scania in Sweden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oresundsregionen.org/en/about-the-oeresund-region|title=What is the Øresund Region?|publisher=Øresund|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] It is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand, partly on the island of Amager and on a number of natural and artificial islets between the two. Copenhagen faces the Øresund to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from Sweden, and which connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. The Swedish towns of Malmö and Landskrona lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/copenhagen-19.html|title=Copenhagen (København), Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=[/tpl] By road, Copenhagen is [tpl]convert|42|km[/tpl] northwest of Malmö, Sweden, [tpl]convert|85|km[/tpl] northeast of Næstved, [tpl]convert|164|km[/tpl] northeast of Odense, [tpl]convert|295|km[/tpl] east of Esbjerg and [tpl]convert|188|km[/tpl] southeast of Aarhus by sea and road via Sjaellands Odde.[tpl]Google maps | url =https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF-8&ei=USGSUuWnH_KA7QaTz4CYBA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg  | accessdate =24 November 2013[/tpl]
The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old ramparts that are still referred to as the Fortification Ring (Fæstningsringen) and kept as a partial green band around it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by|title=Parker I Indre By|language=Danish|publisher=Copenhagen Municipality|accessdate=2013-11-25[/tpl]  Then come the late 19th and early 20th century residential neighbourhoods of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro. The outlying areas of Kongens Enghave, Valby, Vigerslev, Vanløse, Brønshøj, Utterslev and Sundby followed from 1920 to 1960. They consist mainly of residential housing and apartments often enhanced with parks and greenery.

===Topography===

The central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by moraines from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to [tpl]convert|50|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The slopes of Valby and Brønshøj reach heights of over [tpl]convert|30|m|abbr=on[/tpl], divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest. Close to the centre are the Copenhagen lakes of Sortedams Sø, Peblinge Sø and Sankt Jørgens Sø.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_geografi|title=København - geografi|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=16 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the Danian period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some greensand from the Selandian is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geocenter.dk/xpdf/geoviden-4-2005.pdf|author=Lars Nielsen, Alexander Lassen, Hans Thybo|title=Carlsbergforkastningen|publisher=Geoviden|issue=4|pages=8–11|year=2005|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to [tpl]convert|15|m|abbr=on[/tpl] thick.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Geologi)|title=København - geologi|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

===Beaches===

Copenhagen and the surrounding areas have three beaches with a total of approx. [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of sandy shores within 30 minutes cycling from the city centre. These include Amager Strandpark, which opened in 2005 with a [tpl]convert|2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long artificial island and a total of [tpl]convert|4.6|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of beaches, located just 15 minutes by bicycle or a few minutes by metro from the city centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amager-strand.dk/content/stranden|title=Stranden|publisher=Amagerstrand|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

===Climate===

Copenhagen is in the oceanic climate zone (Köppen: Cfb ).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=Weather Online|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=[/tpl] Its weather is subject to low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. The Gulf Stream brings warmer water across from the Gulf of Mexico causing average temperatures to be some 5 degrees higher than would be expected for the city's latitude of 55 degrees North. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While there can be snow from late December to early March, there can also be rain with average temperatures around the freezing point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,copenhagen,Denmark|title=Average weather in Copenhagen, Denmark|publisher=World Weather and Climate Information|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July and August are warm too with daytime temperatures around [tpl]convert|20|°C|0[/tpl] although rainfall averages 69 mm per month. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with from four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk/|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut|accessdate=1 February 2014|language=Danish[/tpl] Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50 cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24 hour period during the winter months[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer+afrejse/Vejr+og+flyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt+p%C3%A5+til+vinteren.htm|title=Københavns Lufthavn er klædt på til vinteren|publisher=CPH|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl] while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of [tpl]convert|33|°C|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/varmeste-dag-i-37-aar|title=Exceptionel varm sommerdag i København|publisher=BT|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council (Borgerrepræsentation) is the Copenhagen City Hall (Københavns Rådhus). The council is chaired by the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen, who with two selected vice-presidents overlooks the 55 representatives of the council who are given civic duties to perform.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/politisk-organisation/borgerrepraesentation|title=Borgerrepræsentationen|publisher=Københavns Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=28 November 2013[/tpl] The council usually meets every other week at 17:30 on a Thursday.

All members of the council are elected every four years. In the municipal elections in November 2013, the Social Democrats remained in first place with 27.8% of the vote (down by 2.2% from 2009) while Enhedslisten (the Red-Green Alliance) was in second place with 19.5%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kmdvalg.dk/kv/2013/k84982101.htm|title=Kommunalvalg d. 19. november 2013: København Kommune|publisher=KMD|accessdate=29 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article3189|title=Result of the municipal and regional election in Denmark 19th of November 2013|publisher=International Viewpoint|language=|accessdate=29 November 2013[/tpl] Copenhagen's mayor Frank Jensen retained his position, but was not happy with the result which was the worst ever for his party.

===Law and order===

Most of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style court of justice, Hof- og Stadsretten, was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Retshistorie/Hof-_og_Stadsretten|title=Hof- og Stadsretten|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=28 November 2013[/tpl] Now known as the City Court of Copenhagen (Kobenhavns Byret), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, Dragør and Tårnby.

Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20-30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.Copenhagen's ambitious push to be carbon-neutral by 2025 Guardian 12 April 2013
The city's architectural planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of low-energy standards. Priorities include recycling rainwater, green roofs and efficient waste management solutions. In city planning, streets and squares are to be designed to encourage cycling and walking rather than driving.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_pub2/pdf/961_BLdBaJTGzV.pdf|title=Copenhagen City of Architecture: The architecture policy of the City of Copenhagen|publisher= Technical and Environmental Administation, City of Copenhagen |year=2010|accessdate=2 December 2013 |language=[/tpl]

===Cleantech===

Launched in 2010, the Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster is the focal point of a cooperative effort between public authorities, universities, research institutions and cleantech companies. By 2012, the initiative involved 533 companies in the Greater Copenhagen area, up form 396 in 2010. The service sector, with 44% of companies, was the top sector followed by wholesale and retail trade (22%) and production (20%). The cluster employed more than 85,000 people in 2010, down from 94,000 in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cphcleantech.com/media/2083427/copenhagen%20cleantech%20cluster%20monitor%202012%20samlet.pdf|title=Monitor Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster 2012|publisher=Copenhagen Cleantech Cluster|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The region's most important cleantech research institutions are the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen Business School,[tpl]cite web|title=The win-win ways of Cleantech business |publisher=CBS Observer |date=26 March 2009 |url=http://cbsobserver.dk/win-win-ways-cleantech-business |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl] Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and the Technical University of Denmark (of which Risø is now part).

==Cityscape==

The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/koebenhavn/arkitektur/koebenhavns-forskellige-bydele|title=Københavns forskellige bydele|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=18 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]

===Architecture===

The oldest section of Copenhagen's inner city is often referred to as Middelalderbyen (The Medieval City).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guides.dk/Turforslag/Bytur-i-Koebenhavn.html|title=København - byen ved vandet ... |publisher=Guides.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl]  However, the city's most distinctive district is Frederiksstaden, developed during the reign of Frederick V. It has the Amalienborg Palace at its centre and is dominated by the dome of Frederik's Church (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century Rococo mansions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/|title=Frederiksstad with Amalienborg|publisher=Kultur Styrelsen|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] The inner city of Copenhagen includes Slotsholmen, a little island on which Christiansborg Palace stands and  Christianshavn with its canals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagen-city-centre|title=Copenhagen city centre|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=20 November 2013[/tpl] Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs (Vesterbro, Inner Nørrebro, Inner Østerbro) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.noerrebrolokalhistorie.dk/historie.php|title=Lidt Nørrebro-historie|publisher=Nørrebro Lokalhistoriske Forening og Arkiv|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish[/tpl]
Sometimes referred to as "the City of Spires", Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|title=Vor Frelsers Kirke (København)|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl] Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the "dragon spire" of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.[tpl]cite book|author=Knud Kapper Hansen|title=Tårne, spir og kupler: om Københavns og Frederiksbergs karakteristiske tårnlandskab|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Tårngruppen[/tpl]
Recent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baumeister.de/|title=B1 Kopenhagen entdecken|publisher=Baumeister – Zeitschrift für Architektur|year=2009|language=German[/tpl] both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. At the same time, a number of Danish architects have achieved success in Copenhagen and abroad. Buildings in Copenhagen have won RIBA European Awards four years in a row ("Sampension" in 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/riba_awards_2005.htm|title=RIBA European Awards 2005|publisher=RIBA[/tpl] "Kilen" in 2006,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2006/Kilen/KilenDenmark.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2006|publisher=RIBA[/tpl] "Tietgenkollegiet" in 2007 and the Royal Playhouse in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/2008/RoyalPlayhouse.aspx|title=RIBA European Awards 2009|publisher=RIBA[/tpl]) The last three are all by Lundgaard & Tranberg Architects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ltarkitekter.dk/ |title=Lundgaard & Tranberg Architects |publisher=Ltarkitekter.dk |accessdate=9 March 2013[/tpl] At the 2008 World Architecture Festival in Barcelona, Bjarke Ingels Group won an award for the World's Best Residential Building 2008 for a house in Ørestad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/news-detail.cfm?newsId=33|title=World's Best Residential Building 2008|publisher=World Architecture Festival[/tpl] In 2008 British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=9 June 2008[/tpl]
The boom in urban development and modern architecture has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. Ørestad now has seen most of the recent development. Located near Copenhagen Airport, it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the IT University and a high school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|title=Copenhagen growing|publisher=By&Havn|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=[/tpl]

===Parks===

Copenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. King's Garden (Kongens Have), the garden of Rosenborg Castle, is the oldest and most frequented of them all.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|title=King's Garden|publisher=Slots- og Ejeondomsstyrelsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329224035/http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|archivedate=29 March 2008[/tpl] It was Christian IV who first developed its landscaping in 1606.

It serves as a sculpture garden with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months. Also located in the city centre are the Botanical Gardens noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by Carlsberg founder J. C. Jacobsen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergdanmark.dk/omos/Historie/IJacobsensfodspor/Kobenhavn/Pages/BotaniskHave.aspx|title=Botanisk Have|publisher=Carlsberg[/tpl] Fælledparken at [tpl]convert|58|ha|abbr=on[/tpl] is the largest park in Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/faelledparken |title=Fælledparken|publisher=AOK|author=Af Kasper Olsen|date=Nov 15, 2007[/tpl] It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, carnival and Labour Day celebrations, and the Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix, a race for antique cars. A historical green space in the northeastern part of the city is Kastellet, a well-preserved Renaissance citadel that now serves mainly as a park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kastelletsvenner.dk/index.php?page=kastellet|title=Kastellets historie|publisher=Kastellets Venner & Historiske Sampling|accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl]  Another popular park is the Frederiksberg Garden, a 32-hectare romantic landscape park.

In Copenhagen, many cemeteries double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. Assistens Cemetery, the burial place of Hans Christian Andersen, is an important green space for the district of Inner Nørrebro and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known Vestre Kirkegaard is the largest cemetery in Denmark ([tpl]convert|54|ha|abbr=on[/tpl]) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other garden features.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde|title=Kirkegårde|publisher=Københavns Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl]

===Landmarks by district===

====Indre By====

The historic centre of the city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V in the second half of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|title=Frederiksstaden|publisher=Den Store Danske|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl] Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|author=Charlotte Haase, Susanne Nørgaard|title=Operaen|publisher=Faktalink|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl] To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|title=Nyhavn|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=[/tpl] The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/kings-new-square-gdk428111|title=King's New Square|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=[/tpl] Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundetårn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://travel.usnews.com/Copenhagen_Denmark/Neighborhoods/|title=Copenhagen Neighborhoods and Towns|publisher=U.S. News Travel|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=[/tpl] Closed to traffic since 1964, Strøget, the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the [tpl]convert |3.2|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from Rådhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv.

====Christianshavn====

Christianshavn lies to the southeast of Indre By on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by Christian IV in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of Amsterdam, he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its ramparts which are still well preserved today. The canals themselves, branching off the central Christianshavn Canal and  lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions. Another interesting feature is Freetown Christiania, a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on "Pusher Street" as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the Church of Our Saviour with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo Christian's Church. Once a warehouse, the North Atlantic House now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the Noma restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/maritime-christianshavn-holmen|title=Maritime Christianshavn & Holmen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-christianshavn|title=Guide to Christianshavn|publisher=AOK|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=[/tpl]

====Nørrebro====

Nørrebro to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, ethnic food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred around Sankt Hans Torv.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-noerrebro|title=Guide to: Nørrebro|publisher=AOK|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=[/tpl]  Copenhagen's historic cemetery, Assistens Kirkegård half way up Nørrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including Søren Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr and Hans Christian Andersen but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard|title=Assistens Kirkegård |publisher=Københavns Kommune|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=Danish[/tpl]

====Frederiksberg====

Strictly speaking a separate municipality, Frederiksberg lies to the west of Nørrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include Copenhagen Zoo founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and Frederiksberg Palace built as a summer residence by Charles IV who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped gardens of Frederiksberg Park with its follies, waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/frederiksberg-attractions-360.html|title=Frederiksberg Tourist Attractions|publisher=Danishnet.com|accessdate=1 December 2013 |language=[/tpl] The wide tree-lined avenue of Frederiksberg Allé connecting Vesterbrogade with the Frederiksberg Park has long been associated with theatres and entertainment.

Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to eat on the premises.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk/default.asp?pid=191&show=12 |title=Nyeste artikler fra Bryggeriforeningen |publisher=Dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk|language=Danish |accessdate=9 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nightlife/top-10-beer|title=Top 10 beer|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=22 November 2013 |language=[/tpl]
