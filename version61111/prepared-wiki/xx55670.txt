[[Eurovision Young Dancers 2003]]

CATEGORIES: Eurovision Young Dancers

The 10th Eurovision Young Dancers Competition was held in the Stadsschouwburg Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands between June 29 and July 4, 2003.
A total amount of 17 countries took part in the competition: they were almost the same countries as in 2001, with the only exceptions of Ireland (that withdrew from the contest) and Armenia, who wanted to take part for the first time, but failed to make it to the final.
There were 2 prices given this year: one for contemporary dance and one for classical dance. A special "young jury" award was given as well by a group of young viewers that were in the audience. 
Each country could send one or two dancers, male or female, not older than 20. All countries except the host (Netherlands) had to take part in the Semi Final.
