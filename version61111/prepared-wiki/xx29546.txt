Beverly Hills is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States, surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. Originally a Spanish ranch where lima beans were grown, it was incorporated in 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil, but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town. It is now home to 34,290 inhabitants. Sometimes merely known by one of its primary ZIP codes, "90210", it has been home to actors and celebrities. The city also includes the shopping district Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Hills Oil Field.

==History==

===Early history===

Gaspar de Portolà arrived in the area that would become Beverly Hills on August 3, 1769, travelling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by Maria Rita Quinteros de Valdez and her husband in 1828. They called their [tpl]convert|4500|acre|km2[/tpl] of property the Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas.[tpl]cite book|author=Marc Wanamaker|title=Early Beverly Hills|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gwMyg0wEdDEC|accessdate=August 17, 2012|date=November 16, 2005|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-3068-0[/tpl] However, she was constantly harassed by Native Americans and seriously assaulted in 1852. Two years later, in 1854, she sold the ranch to Benjamin Davis Wilson (1811–1878) and Henry Hancock (1822–1883). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of [tpl]convert|75|acre|km2[/tpl] and was being rapidly bought up  by anglos from Los Angeles and the East coast.
Henry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker acquired most of it and used it for farming lima beans.[tpl]cite book|author=Joy Horowitz|title=Parts Per Million: The Poisoning of Beverly Hills High School|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WjLUcoe5j00C&pg=PA42|accessdate=August 17, 2012|date=July 19, 2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-670-03798-8|page=42[/tpl] At this point, the area was known as the Hammel and Denker Ranch.

Burton Green began construction on The Beverly Hills Hotel in 1911. The hotel was finished in 1912. The visitors drawn by the hotel were inclined to purchase land in Beverly Hills, and by 1914 the subdivision had a high enough population to incorporate as an independent city.  That same year, the Rodeo Land and Water Company decided to separate its water business from its real estate business. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission was split off from the land company and incorporated in September 1914, buying all of the utilities-related assets from the Rodeo Land and Water Company.[tpl]cite book|author=Railroad Commission of the State of California|title=Decisions of the Railroad Commission of the State of California|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kRs4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA897|accessdate=August 18, 2012|year=1919|publisher=Superintendent of State Printing|page=897[/tpl]

In the early 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed Beverly Gardens and was extended to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. The Electric Fountain marks the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Wilshire Blvd. with a small sculpture at the top of a Tongva kneeling in prayer. In April 1931, the new Italian Renaissance-style Beverly Hills City Hall was opened.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl]
In the early 1940s, black actors and businessmen had begun to move into Beverly Hills, despite the covenants allowing only whites to live in the city. A neighborhood improvement association attempted to enforce the covenant in court. The defendants included such luminaries as Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers, and Ethel Waters. Among the white residents supporting the lawsuit against blacks was silent film star Harold Lloyd. The NAACP participated in the defense, which was successful. In his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke said that it was time that "members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment."[tpl]cite book|author=Stephen Grant Meyer|title=As Long As They Don't Move Next Door: Segregation and Racial Conflict in American Neighborhoods|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FCrouSLl3pYC&pg=PA76|accessdate=August 19, 2012|date=October 1, 2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9701-4|page=76[/tpl]  The United States Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants unenforceable in 1948 in Shelley v.

In 2001, LACMTA proposed a bus rapid transit route down Santa Monica Blvd., but this was also opposed by the city and never built. Currently this stretch of road is served by less efficient Metro Rapid buses using pre-existing roadways.

==Geography==

Beverly Hills and the neighboring city of West Hollywood are together entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. Specifically, Beverly Hills is bordered on the northwest by the Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air and the Santa Monica Mountains, on the east by West Hollywood, the Carthay neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, and on the south by the Beverlywood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The area's "Platinum Triangle" is formed by the city of Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Bel Air and Holmby Hills.
In spite of the city's name, most residents live in the "flats" of Beverly Hills, which is a relatively flat land that includes all of Beverly Hills itself. The houses situated in the hillside north of Sunset Boulevard have a much higher value than the average housing price for the rest of the city. Santa Monica Boulevard divides the "flats" into two areas, locally known as "North or South of the tracks," referring to the train tracks that were once used by the old Pacific Electric streetcar line that traversed Beverly Hills along Santa Monica Blvd. Houses south of Wilshire Boulevard have more urban square and rectangular lots, in general smaller than those to the north. There are also more apartment buildings south of Wilshire Blvd. than anywhere else in Beverly Hills, and the average house value south of Wilshire is the lowest in Beverly Hills. Nearly all businesses and government offices in Beverly Hills are located south of Santa Monica Blvd., two notable exceptions being the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Just outside the city limits to the west lies the Los Angeles Country Club. Other locations commonly associated with Beverly Hills include the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the Beverly Center, just outside the city limits to the east.
Beverly Hills Post Office is an area of Los Angeles that the Beverly Hills Post Office serves and carries the "Beverly Hills, CA 90210" mailing address. The other four, less-celebrated ZIP codes for Beverly Hills are: 90209, 90211, 90212 and 90213.[tpl]cite web |url=http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp |title=USPS – ZIP Code Lookup – Search By City |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=June 18, 2010[/tpl]
