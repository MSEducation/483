==Life==

Born at Schloss Prüfening in Regensburg, Bavaria he was the eldest child of the then Hereditary Prince Frederick Christian of Saxony, later Margrave of Meissen, and Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis.
At the age of 18 Emanuel was imprisoned and sentenced to death by the Nazis for being opposed to their rule. After escaping his sentence he next had to escape from the approaching Soviets as his homeland Saxony became a part of communist East Germany as World War II wound down. After the war he moved to Switzerland where he began working in the financial services sector. Also being a talented painter Emanuel had a number of his works exhibited.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh, Burke's Royal Families of the World, vol.1: Europe & Latin America, p.171
Although Marie Vassiltchikov recounts in her book The Berlin Diaries 1940-45 the story of the 16-year-old Hereditary Prince Maria Emanuel paying her a visit to seek her help in finding a bride, as he felt it was his dynastic obligation to start a family early,Marie Vassiltchikov. The Berlin Diaries 1940-1945, Page 71 Emanuel would not in fact marry until the day of 37th birthday. His wife was Princess Anastasia of Anhalt (born 1940) with the couple marrying on 31 January 1963 in Vevey, Switzerland. They had no children.
Maria Emanuel became head of the Royal House of Saxony upon the death of his father on 9 August 1968.

==Succession==

As Maria Emanuel fathered no legitimate children he had acknowledged as his eventual heir Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, the son of his eldest sister Princess Anna and her late husband Prince Robert of Gessaphe (or "Assaphe"/"Afif", descendants of a Lebanese Christian family which ruled a province north of Beirut).de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal.

The royal line of the House of Wettin applies semi-salic law, which allows for inheritance through a female. Since the death of Maria Emanuel, if Albert is the last male dynast then this would lead firstly to the children of their sisters Maria Josepha (unmarried), Maria Anna and Mathilde, but only Mathilde's marriage uncontestedly met equality requirements and her only son died in 1987. Therefore, if the Gessaphe claim is invalid, the succession would pass to the issue of the Margrave's paternal aunts, who are Margarete Karola (1900–1962), Maria Alix (1901–1990) and Anna (1903–1976), all of whom left children. Margaret being the eldest, the heir would be her grandson Karl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern (born 1932), head of the princely line of the House of Hohenzollern.
The Margrave's brother Albert, however, supports discarding equality requirements to allow his cousin Prince Timo of Saxony's morganatic son, Rüdiger (born 1953), to eventually succeed. Rüdiger has with his first wife Astrid Linke (1949–1989) three sons Daniel (born 1975), Arne (born 1977) and Nils (born 1978).
There are several extant lines of the House of Wettin who individually ruled the various Saxon Duchies and the Grand Duchy of Saxony (based at Weimar).  It is possible that the male dynasts of the non-royal lines could claim inclusion in the Saxon royal succession.
