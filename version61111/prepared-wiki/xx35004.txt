==Old Merritt School==

Margaret Elizabeth Merritt of Midway sold two acres for $5 to the State of Alabama in 1921 as a site for an elementary school for African-American children. Built in 1922 with matching Rosenwald funds, the Midway Colored Public School featured oak and pine construction and two classrooms divided by a partition. The building is one of the few surviving of the more than 5,000 rural black schools built with contributions for the Julius Rosenwald Fund. The building was enlarged twice then renovated in 1978. It is now used as a community center. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on November 2, 1990 and the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 1998.[tpl]Citation   | title = Small Town Historic Markers | publisher = Alabama Tourism Department  | url= http://www.alabama.travel/homecoming/ | accessdate =April 13, 2011 [/tpl]
