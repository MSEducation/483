The film depicts the idealistic lifestyle of an old West farmer, his Indian wife and half-breed son, who narrates the tale.  The main character is "Doc" (Pieraccioni), the village doctor, his Indian wife Pearl (Holt) and their son Jeremiah.  Their idyllic life is disrupted when his grandfather, an old gunslinger, shows up on the farm. Doc's father Johnny Lowen (Keitel), a famous gunfighter, suddenly returns. Johnny says he has returned home to find rest and to finally retire. The family is not happy with his return, given his past lifestyle and mistreatment of his family.
After his arrival in the village, Jack Sikora (Bowie), a killer who has been chasing Johnny for years, and his two henchmen hears he has returned. Jack is determined to kill Johnny, and does everything in his power to force his rival to accept a duel to the death. Mary, the Saloon madam tries to kill Sikora, but is killed in the process.
