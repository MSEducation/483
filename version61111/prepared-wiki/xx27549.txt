[[Solar furnace]]

CATEGORIES: Industrial furnaces, Solar thermal energy, Heaters

A solar furnace is a structure that uses concentrated solar power to produce high temperatures, usually for industry. Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point.  The temperature at the focal point may reach [tpl]convert|3500|C|F[/tpl], and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials.
The largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France, opened in 1970.  It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror.

==History==

The ancient Greek / Latin term heliocaminus literally means "solar furnace" and refers to a glass-enclosed sunroom intentionally designed to become hotter than the outside air temperature.MEEF Roman Architectural Glossary
During the Second Punic War (218 - 202 BC), the Greek scientist Archimedes is said to have repelled the attacking Roman ships by setting them on fire with a "burning glass" that may have been an array of mirrors.  An experiment to test this theory was carried out by a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2005.  It concluded that although the theory was sound for stationary objects, the mirrors would not likely have been able to concentrate sufficient solar energy to set a ship on fire under battle conditions.2.009 Product Engineering Processes: Archimedes
The first modern solar furnace is believed to have been built in France in 1949 by Professor Félix Trombe.  It is now still in place at Mont Louis, near Odeillo.  The Pyrenees were chosen as the site because the area experiences clear skies up to 300 days a year.Odeillo Solar Furnace official website, retrieved 12 July 2007
Another solar furnace was built in Uzbekistan as a part of a Soviet Union "Sun" Complex Research Facility impulsed by Academician S.A. Asimov.English Russia's post about the Uzbekistan Soviet Solar Furnace

==Uses==

The rays are focused onto an area the size of a cooking pot and can reach [tpl]convert|4000|C|F[/tpl], depending on the process installed, for example:
It has been suggested that solar furnaces could be used in space to provide energy for manufacturing purposes. 
Their reliance on sunny weather is a limiting factor as a source of renewable energy on Earth but could be tied to thermal energy storage systems for energy production through these periods and into the night.

==Smaller-scale devices==

The solar furnace principle is being used to make inexpensive solar cookers and solar-powered barbecues, and for solar water pasteurization.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.solarcookers.org/basics/water | publisher = Solar Cookers International | title = Solar Water Pasteurization | year = 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/technology/technology.html?in_article_id=449500&in_page_id=1965 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Coming to a garden near you - the solar-powered barbecue | first=James | last=Mills | date=20 April 2007[/tpl]US patent for solar barbecue granted in 1992. A prototype Scheffler reflector is being constructed in India for use in a solar crematorium. This 50 m² reflector will generate temperatures of [tpl]convert|700|C|F[/tpl] and displace 200–300 kg of firewood used per cremation.
