Polyaenus of Lampsacus ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|iː|ˈ|iː|n|ə|s[/tpl];[tpl]USdict|pŏl′·ē·ē′·nəs[/tpl] [tpl]lang-el|Πoλύαινoς Λαμψακηνός, Poluainos Lampsakēnos[/tpl]; c. 340 BCE – c. 285 BCE), also spelled Polyenus, was an ancient Greek mathematician and a friend of Epicurus.

==Life==

He was the son of Athenodorus. His friendship with Epicurus started after the latter's escape from Mytilene in 307 or 306 BC when he opened a philosophical school at Lampsacus associating himself with other citizens of the town, like Pythocles, Colotes, and Idomeneus. With these fellow citizens he moved to Athens, where they founded a school of philosophy with Epicurus as head, or hegemon, while Polyaenus, Hermarchus and Metrodorus were kathegemones.
A man of mild and friendly manners, as Philodemus refers, he adopted fully the philosophical system of his friend, and, although he had previously acquired great reputation as a mathematician, he now maintained with Epicurus the worthlessness of geometry.Cicero, De finibus, i. 6; Academica, ii. 33Diogenes Laertius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, ii.105, x. 12 But the statement may be at least doubted, since it is certain Polyaenus wrote a mathematical work called Puzzles ([tpl]lang-el|Aπoριαι[/tpl]) in which the validity of geometry is maintained. It was against this treatise that another Epicurean, Demetrius Lacon, wrote Unsolved questions of Polyaenus ([tpl]lang-el|Πρὸς τὰς Πoλυαίνoυ ἀπoρίας[/tpl]) in the 2nd century BCE. Like Epicurus, a considerable number of spurious works seem to have been assigned to him; one of these was Against the Orators, whose authenticity was attacked both by Zeno of Sidon and his pupil Philodemus.
