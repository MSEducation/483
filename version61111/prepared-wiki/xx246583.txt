"Parliament Square" is the name given to the upcoming redevelopment of the block directly behind Parliament House in Hobart, Tasmania.  The site is in close proximity to the waterfront and is bounded by Davey Street to the north, Murray Street to the east, Salamanca Place to the west and Parliament House to the south. The block has an approximate area of 7,322 m². The eight buildings that comprise the site in its present form range in height from two to 14 levels and are connected by a number of laneways and car parks. While some of the buildings are used as government offices, major sections of the site are empty.http://www.treasury.tas.gov.au/parliamentsquare
The site includes the former St Mary’s Hospital, the Red Brick Building, 34 West Davey Street, the former Government Printing Office building at 2-4 Salamanca Place and the former PABX building; and Government offices at 10 Murray Street, 12 Murray Street and 34 Davey Street, all of which are occupied by the State Government.

==Future==

In April 2009 the Tasmanian Government shortlisted three proposals for the redevelopment of the area.http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/04/22/68335_todays-news.html
The Government announced Citta Property Group as the preferred company to undertake the project.http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/08/28/93871_todays-news.html Citta plans to give the area a Federation Square feel with the demolition of the State Offices at 10 Murray Street and the opening up of the Murray Street side. The plan will upgrade and maintain the older Davey Street facing buildings, as well as building a new seven-storey building facing Salamanca Place. There will also be shops, cafes and an amphitheatre with a large screen for public events.
Of the three shortlisted proposals, one design would have retained and retrofitted the modernist building at 10 Murray Street, whilst the two other plans required demolition of the building.
The proposal is subject to a planning appeal lodged by members of the "Save 10 Murray" group on the grounds that 10 Murray Street is a historically and culturally significant building.  The group also objects to the demolition of the former Government Printing Office, a heritage-listed art deco building.  10 Murray Street is arguably the best example of high-rise architecture within Tasmania[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl].
