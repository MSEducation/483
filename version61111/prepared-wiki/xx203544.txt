[[Nalakuvara]]

CATEGORIES: Hindu gods

Nalakuvara, also known as Nalakubara and his brother Manigriva were sons of Kubera in Hindu Mythology. Nalakuvara and his brother were cursed by Sage Narada into becoming Trees. Lord Krishna later liberated them. 
Nalakuvara's wife Rambha was raped by Ravana and by some accounts Nalakuvara cursed Ravana that if Ravana violated any other woman, Ravana's heads would burst. This curse protected the chastity of Sita, the wife of Rama when she was kidnapped by Ravana.

==Story==

Nalakuvara and his brother were playing with celestial maidens in the Ganges in nudity, when Narada came by that way. The hermit was returning from visiting Lord Vishnu. When the maidens saw Narada, they covered themselves while Nalakuvara and his brother were too intoxicated to notice Narada and hence remained unclothed. 
By some accounts, Narada felt sorry that the brothers were wasting away their lives by their excessive indulgence in women and wine. Narada took upon the obligation of helping the brothers by cursing them into trees. Narada wanted the brothers to meet Lord Krishna after many years who would be able to liberate them from the curse. This would also buy enough time for the brothers to realize their mistake. 
In other accounts, Narada is said to have been offended by the brother's lack of self dignity and respect and cursed them into trees. Upon the brother's pleas, Narada allows them to be liberated by Lord Krishna. 
When Lord Krishna was in his infancy, his mother Yasoda had tied him to a mortar. Lord Krishna dragged the mortar and got it stuck between two trees, which were Nalakuvara and Manigriva in their cursed state. Upon contact, the trees regained their original form. The brothers paid homage to Lord Krishna, apologized for their mistakes and left.
