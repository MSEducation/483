The Boorabin National Park is situated on top of a plateau. The landscape is primarily sand and the vegetation there is quite distinctive growing is deep sands deposited over 50 million years ago. Today this erosion of this significant landscape is lessening. But as a result of past degradation, the sands are left very weathered, leached and lacking in nutrients.
Despite this, the vegetation is diverse with countless species thriving in this environment. Vegetation ranges from the rich kwongan heaths, woodlands and mallee shrublands. The area is recognised for its unique variety of vegetation. With its own designated plateau vegetation system. Other attributes that the park is known for and the wildflowers, Samphire and Salt Lakes.
Other vegetation that can be found include species of banksia, acacia, hakea, sandalwood, melaleuca and grasstree. Two restricted species found in the heathland include Philotheca pachyphylla and Philotheca coccinea.[tpl]cite AHD|9789|Boorabbin National Park|date=2010|accessdate=17 November 2010[/tpl]
