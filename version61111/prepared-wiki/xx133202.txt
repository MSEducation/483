CATEGORIES: Football leagues in Scotland

The Caledonian Amateur Football League is a football (soccer) league competition for amateur clubs in Scotland.  It was formed in 1983 as an attempt to improve facilities for amateur teams, with high standards being set for admittance to the competition.  Since its formation, the teams competing within the league have been of a good standard, with clubs from the league winning the Scottish Amateur Cup on nine occasions, also providing four losing finalists.
Member clubs are concentrated in the West Central Belt of Scotland, although there is a club from the Isle of Bute, a club from Edinburgh, and a few clubs from Stirlingshire.
