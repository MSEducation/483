[[Interstate 40]]

CATEGORIES: Interstate 40, Interstate Highway System, U.S. Route 66

Interstate 40 (I-40) is the third-longest Interstate Highway in the United States, after I-90 and I-80. Its western end is at Interstate 15 in Barstow, California; its eastern end is at a concurrency of U.S. Route 117 and North Carolina Highway 132 in Wilmington, North Carolina. Much of the western part of I-40, from Oklahoma City to Barstow, parallels or overlays the historic U.S. Route 66. I-40 intersects with eight of the 10 primary north–south interstates (all except I-5 and I-45) and also with I-24, I-30, I-44, I-77, and I-81.

==Route description==

===California===

Interstate 40 is a major east–west route of the Interstate Highway System. Its western end is in Barstow, California. Known as the Needles Freeway, it heads east from Barstow across the Mojave Desert in San Bernardino County to Needles, before it crosses into Arizona southwest of Kingman. I-40 covers [tpl]convert|155|mi|km[/tpl] in California.
A sign in California showing the distance to Wilmington, North Carolina has been stolen several times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20091112/ARTICLES/911129963/1004?Title=I-40-Barstow-Calif-sign-gone-for-good |title=I-40 Barstow, Calif., sign gone for good |publisher=StarNewsOnline.com |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2011-09-19[/tpl]

===Arizona===

Interstate 40 is a main route to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, with the exits leading into Grand Canyon National Park in Williams and Flagstaff. I-40 covers [tpl]convert|359|mi|km[/tpl] in Arizona.
Just west of exit 190, west of Flagstaff, is highest elevation along I-40 in the US, as the road crosses just over 7,320 feet. I-40 also passes through the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian reservation in the US.

===New Mexico===

I-40 covers [tpl]convert|374|mi|km[/tpl] in New Mexico. Notable cities along I-40 include Albuquerque, Santa Rosa, Tucumari, Grants and Gallup. I-40 also travels through several different Indian reservations in the western half of the state.
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas are the only three states where I-40 has a speed limit of 75 mph (120 km/h) instead of 70 mph (112 km/h) which happens in California, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

===Texas===

In the west Texas panhandle area, there are several ranch roads connected directly to the interstate. One of the marked at-grade crossings is shown to the right. The only major city in Texas that is directly served by I-40 is Amarillo, which connects with Interstate 27 that runs south toward Lubbock.  Due to the small amount of territory covered by I-40, only one Texas welcome center is located along this stretch of road, in Amarillo at the exit for Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport, serving both sides of the interstate.

===Oklahoma===

Interstate 40 goes through the heart of the state, passing through many Oklahoma cities and towns, including Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Clinton, Weatherford, El Reno, Yukon, Oklahoma City, Midwest City, Shawnee, Okemah, Henryetta, Checotah, Sallisaw, and Roland.  I-40 covers [tpl]convert|331|mi|km[/tpl] in Oklahoma.
In downtown Oklahoma City  An ongoing project is underway. It will feature 10 lanes (5 in each direction) and allow for the dismantling of the crosstown bridge, which will in turn be replaced by a landscaped boulevard.  Motorists should check ahead for construction updates on ODOT's website as there are frequently lane closures which result in traffic backups on this section, especially at night but also at rush hour since if there is an accident or someone breaks down, there is no place for them to pull off.

===Arkansas===

Interstate 40 enters the west-central part of the state and runs for [tpl]convert|284|mi|km[/tpl] in Arkansas. The route passes through Van Buren, where it intersects the southbound Interstate 540/US 71 to Fort Smith.[tpl]Cite map |publisher=Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department |title=General Highway Map, Crawford County, Arkansas |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/maps/Counties/County%20PDFs/CrawfordCounty.pdf |cartography=Planning and Research Division |format=PDF |year=2011 |scale=1:62500 |accessdate=November 15, 2011[/tpl] The route continues east to Alma to intersect I-540 north to Fayetteville, Arkansas. Running through the Ozark Mountains, I-40 serves Ozark, Clarksville, Russellville, Morrilton and Conway. The route turns south after Conway and enters North Little Rock, which brings high volume interchanges with Interstate 430, I-30/US 65/US 67/US 167, and I-440/AR 440.[tpl]Cite map |publisher=Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department |title=General Highway Map, Pulaski County, Arkansas |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/maps/Counties/County%20PDFs/PulaskiCounty.pdf |cartography=Planning and Research Division |format=PDF |year=2009 |scale=1:62500 |accessdate=November 15, 2011[/tpl] The interstate continues east through Lonoke, Brinkley, and West Memphis on the eastern side. Interstate 40 briefly overlaps Interstate 55 in West Memphis before it crosses the Mississippi River on the Hernando de Soto Bridge and enters Memphis, Tennessee.[tpl]Cite map |publisher=Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department |title=General Highway Map, Crittenden County, Arkansas |url=http://www.arkansashighways.com/maps/Counties/County%20PDFs/CrittendenCounty.pdf |cartography=Planning and Research Division |format=PDF |year=2009 |scale=1:62500 |accessdate=November 15, 2011[/tpl]

===Tennessee===

More of Interstate 40 passes through Tennessee, [tpl]convert|455|mi|km[/tpl], than any other state. The interstate goes through all of the three Grand Divisions of Tennessee and its three largest cities, Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville. Jackson, Lebanon, Cookeville,  Crossville, and Newport are other notable cities and/or towns through which I-40 passes. Before leaving the state, I-40 enters the Great Smoky Mountains.
The section of Interstate 40 which runs between Memphis and Nashville is often referred to as the Music HighwayTennessee public acts 2001 Chapter 100, Senate Bill 916 House Bill 616 Signed into law 18 April 2001  http://www.tennessee.gov/sos/acts/102/pub/pc0100.pdf During reconstruction, a long section of I-40 through downtown Knoxville near the central Malfunction Junction was completely closed to traffic from May 1, 2008 and not reopened until June 12, 2009 with all traffic redirected via Interstate 640, the northern bypass route. The redesigned section now has additional lanes in each direction, is less congested, and has fewer accidents.SmartFix - I-40/James White Parkway/Hall of Fame Drive - Tennessee Department of Transportation[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]SmartFix - I-40/James White Parkway/Hall of Fame Drive - Tennessee Department of Transportation[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===North Carolina===

In North Carolina, I-40 merges with I-85 between Greensboro and Hillsborough, just west of Durham. In Alamance County, the highway is also known as the Sam Hunt Freeway. Due to a recent rerouting of I-85 around Greensboro, I-40 departs from it eight miles (13 km) east of the original split. From February to Mid September 2008 I-40 was moved to a new alignment south of Greensboro, which also carries the new I-85 bypass and will eventually carry Interstate 73 as well, while the old I-40 through Greensboro became a second I-40 freeway Business Loop. However, on September 12, 2008 after complaints from motorists and residents, NCDOT got permission from the FHWA to put I-40 back onto the old alignment through Greensboro. This resulted in the decommissioning of Interstate 40 Business through Greensboro. This was also done to maintain federal funding on the old I-40 route. To make up for the removal of I-40 from the loop, US 421 was rerouted onto I-40's previous alignment. I-40 covers [tpl]convert|421|mi|km[/tpl] in North Carolina.

About eight miles (13 km) from the Tennessee state-line in North Carolina, when going westwards, a sign for "Hurricane Creek Road" appears. Hurricane Creek Road is a local dirt road whose quality is below that of the shoulder, and the intersection is controlled by a stop sign. It is a right-in, right-out entrance. Two other unmarked local roads  directly link onto I-40 in the area, including a private access road for Walters Dam between mile markers 11 and 12 on the westbound side.[tpl]cite web|author=Posted by Adam |url=http://surewhynotnow.blogspot.com/2008/04/street-signs-on-interstate-no-way.html |title=Sure, Why Not? - Street Signs on an Interstate?

A standard distance sign exists near the start of the westbound section of I-40 in Wilmington that indicates the distance to Barstow, California as [tpl]convert|2554|mi|km[/tpl].  Although NCDOT has stated it wouldn't be replaced after frequent thefts, as of August 15, 2013, the sign is present.

==History==

For about [tpl]convert|1000|mi|km[/tpl], I-40 follows the general route of the Beale Wagon Road from Arkansas to California. The Beale Wagon Road was built in 1857-59 by a team led by Lt. Edward Fitzgerald Beale using a team of camels as pack animals.
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, I-40 was originally meant to replace Central Avenue through the center of the city. However, due to development and public opposition, a route running to the north of that one was chosen.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] The freeway intersects Central Ave. at both ends of the city.
In 1957, the California Department of Highways proposed that the route be renumbered to Interstate 30, instead, because of the already existing U.S. Route 40 in the state. Then, U.S. Rte-40 was decommissioned in California in 1964, as a part of a major revamping of California's overall highway numbering system, so the problem disappeared.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cahighways.org/033-040.html#040 |title=California Highways: Interstate 40 |publisher=Cahighways.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl]
The California State government submitted State Route 58 between Barstow and Bakersfield for I-40 extension potential in 1956 and 1968, though those requests were rejected.Waller, Jeff. Interstate 40 Extension and Bakersfield Freeway Network. California Streets. URL accessed 21:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC).  This portion of SR 58 was once signed as the U.S. Route 466.
From 1963 to 1966, the US government considered a plan, part of Operation Plowshare, to use atomic bombs to excavate a path for I-40 through California. The project was scuttled largely due to the cost of developing the explosives and due to the unavailability of a "clean bomb".[tpl]cite news | first=Howard | last=Wilshire | title=Building a Radioactive Highway | publisher=Sierra Club | work=Desert Report | date=Spring 2001 | pages=9, 14 | format=PDF | url=http://www.desertreport.org/media/DR_Spring2001.pdf[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In Memphis, I-40 was originally intended to go through the city's Overton Park toward downtown. Several miles of interstate were actually built within the I-240 loop. That portion of highway still exists, and it is in regular use as the non-Interstate Sam Cooper Boulevard, reaching the eastern end of the Chickasaw Country Club. Environmentalist opposition, combined with a victory in the United States Supreme Court by opponents of the Overton Park route (see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe) forced abandonment of the original plans, and the road never reached the park. For over 20 years, I-40 signs existed on the dead-end route toward Overton Park. Eventually, the northern span of the I-240 loop was redesignated as I-40.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In 1971, the North Carolina State Highway Commission approved a plan to extend I-40 from Research Triangle Park to Interstate 95, a distance of 41 miles, at a cost of $75 million. Most of the highway would be four lanes, though six lanes were likely near Raleigh, where I-40 would extend the Beltline. Several routes were being considered, but at the time, the most likely route would have ended north of Smithfield."SHC Approves I-40 Link in Wake County", Concord Tribune (Associated Press), July 20, 1971.
When the last portion of I-40, connecting Wilmington to Raleigh, was completed in the late 1980s, Charles Kuralt stated:
Originally, I-40 was constructed through downtown Winston-Salem, and it continued to follow that route until a new urban bypass route was built. After the bypass was completed around 1992, I-40 was relocated to the new freeway. The old highway was then redesignated as Interstate 40 Business, creating a business route that is actually an expressway for its entire length, a rarity among business routes. There are arguments that the former I-40 expressway in Winston-Salem should become an interstate again, especially since the road is currently undergoing an upgrade. There are no even loop numbers left for I-40, however, since the NCDOT has plans to use last available one Interstate 840 for the northern loop of a beltway that is being built around nearby Greensboro.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
The I-40 Bridge Disaster occurred on May 26, 2002 when a barge collided with a bridge foundation member near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, causing a 580-foot (177 m) section of the I-40 bridge to plunge into the Arkansas River. Automobiles and semi-trailers fell into the water, killing fourteen people.
The "Big I" I-25 and I-40 interchange in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was given an honorable mention by the United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration for excellence in urban highway design in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/eihd/2002/cat1pic8.htm |title=Excellence in Highway Design - 2002 I-25/I-40 System-to-System Interchange, Albuquerque, New Mexico |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl]
Landslides are common in the Pigeon River Gorge section along the Tennessee and North Carolina border. Here the roadway was cut into the slopes of several steep mountains. Accidents on the winding road are also common especially during bad weather. On October 25, 2009, Interstate 40 was closed at the North Carolina and Tennessee border due to a landslide at Mile Marker 2.6 just east of the Tennessee state line. All Traffic was detoured via Interstates 26 and 81, and non-heavy load traffic via US 25/70.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volunteertv.com/news/headlines/66605652.html |title=HWY 25-70 a scenic, tough rock slide detour |publisher=Volunteertv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27[/tpl] The roadway was reopened on April 25, 2010 with some remaining limitations on westbound traffic.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/apr/25/section-of-i-40-back-open-after-oct-slide/|title=Section of I-40 closed since Oct. rockslide reopens |last=Hickman|first=Hayes|work=Knoxville News Sentinel|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2010-04-26[/tpl]

==Major intersections==

==Auxiliary routes==

In Oklahoma City, the designation I-440 had been given to a stretch of Interstate Highway from I-240 to US-66. It was a part of Grand Boulevard that had been built in compliace with Interstate standards. In 1982, as part of Oklahoma's "Diamond Jubilee", I-44's western terminus was moved from the I-35/I-44 junction to the Texas/Oklahoma state-line via the Belle Isle Freeway (connecting I-440 with I-35); I-440, the H.E. Bailey Turnpike; and the turnpike connector road on the eastern edge of Lawton, Oklahoma. The I-440 number was dropped at the time, but it might return again sometime in the future.
