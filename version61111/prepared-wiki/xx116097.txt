==Club career==

Another product of Sporting Clube de Portugal's prolific youth system, Semedo was born in Setúbal and made his professional debuts with modest Casa Pia AC, in the Lisbon area.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=204238|title=Semedo cedido ao Casa Pia|trans_title=Semedo loaned to Casa Pia|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=19 July 2004|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] In the 2005–06 season he served another loan stint, now with C.D. Feirense in the second division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/arquivo/interior.aspx?content_id=257063|title=Semedo prefere equipa da Liga|trans_title=Semedo prefers Liga team|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=5 January 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl]
For the 2006–07 campaign Semedo was loaned again, moving to Serie A's Cagliari Calcio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/5076/jose-vitor-moreira-semedo-e-del-cagliari.html|title=Josè Vitor Moreira Semedo è del Cagliari|trans_title=Josè Vitor Moreira Semedo is a Cagliari player|publisher=Cagliari's official website|language=Italian|date=14 July 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013[/tpl] He made his club debut in the Italian Cup, but would only appear three times in the league, the first as a late substitute in a 1–3 away loss against A.C. Milan on 21 April 2007; he was sent off in his last match, a 1–2 defeat at Ascoli Calcio 1898, with the Sardinians barely avoiding relegation.
In 2007, Semedo signed a four-year deal with Charlton Athletic on a free transfer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/6238914.stm|title=Charlton sign Portuguese defender|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=19 November 2009[/tpl] Although touted as a central defender when he signed, he played mainly as a defensive midfielder for the Football League Championship club, and scored his first goal for the side in a 4–0 win over Tranmere Rovers on 29 August 2009, with Charlton now in League One.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8220777.stm|title=Tranmere 0–4 Charlton|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=30 August 2009[/tpl] 
In May 2011 Semedo was crowned Charlton's Player of the Year, picking up 43% of the votes in what was the club's worst season for a number of decades.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10267~2350696,00.html|title=Semedo crowned player of the year|publisher=Charlton Athletic FC|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] However, manager Chris Powell could not offer him assurances that he would be a key member in the following season, as he aimed to create a more fluid midfield, and so, on 7 July, the player moved to another club in the English third-tier, Sheffield Wednesday, again as a free agent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10304~2388240,00.html|title=Owls complete Semedo swoop|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday FC|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl]
In his first season with the Owls, which ended in promotion to the Championship after finishing second behind Charlton Athletic, Semedo was voted Player of the Year and League One PFA Fans' Player of the Year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10304~2813082,00.html|title=Owls ace wins PFA award|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday FC|date=15 July 2012|accessdate=15 July 2012[/tpl]

==International career==

Semedo represented the Portuguese under-21 team during the 2006 UEFA European Football Championship. In the only match he played, he was sent off due to an aggressive foul, and the side lost against Serbia and Montenegro, failing to qualify from its group.
