Temple Square is a [tpl]convert|10|acre|sing=on[/tpl] complex located in the center of Salt Lake City, Utah, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In recent years, the usage of the name has gradually changed to include several other church facilities immediately adjacent to Temple Square.  Contained within Temple Square proper are the Salt Lake Temple, Salt Lake Tabernacle, Salt Lake Assembly Hall, the Seagull Monument and two visitors' centers.

==History==

In 1847, when Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, church president Brigham Young selected a plot of the desert ground and proclaimed, "Here we will build a temple to our God." Quoted in The Salt Lake Temple. Gordon B. Hinckley, Ensign, March 1993, 2.  When the city was surveyed, the block enclosing that location was designated for the temple, and became known as Temple Square.Information on Salt Lake Temple Background Temple Square is surrounded by a high wall that was built shortly after the block was designated for the building of the temple.
The square also became the headquarters of the LDS Church. Other buildings were built on the plot, including a tabernacle (prior to the one occupying Temple Square today) and Endowment House, both of which were later torn down. The Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, was built in 1867 to accommodate the church's general conferences, with a seating capacity of 8,000. Another church building, called the Assembly Hall, was later built with a seating capacity of 2,000.
As the church has grown, its headquarters have expanded into the surrounding area. In 1917, an administration building was built on the block east of the temple and in 1972, the twenty-eight story LDS Church Office Building, which was, for many years, the tallest building in the state of Utah. The Hotel Utah, another building on this block, was remodeled in 1995 as additional office space and a large film theater and renamed the Joseph Smith Memorial Building.  In 2000, the church purchased the section of Main Street between this block and Temple Square and connected the two blocks with a plaza called the Main Street Plaza. In 2000, the church completed a new, 21,000 seat Conference Center on the block north of Temple Square.
The Family History Library and the Church History Museum are located on the block west of Temple Square.

===Salt Lake Temple===

The Salt Lake Temple is the largest and best-known of more than 140 operating LDS temples.[tpl]LDS Temple status[/tpl] It is the sixth temple built by the church overall, and the fourth operating temple built following the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois.

===North and South Visitors' Centers===

Today, Temple Square features two visitors' centers, called the North Visitors' Center and the South Visitors' Center. The North Visitors' Center was built first and features a replica of the Christus, a statue of Jesus Christ by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The Christus is located in a domed room with large windows, painted with clouds, stars, planets, and other heavenly bodies. The visitors' centers and grounds are staffed by sister missionaries[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.templesquareworld.com/missionaries.html |title=Sister Missionaries |last=Law |first=Kristina |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-12-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070429103854/http://www.templesquareworld.com/missionaries.html  |archivedate = 2007-04-29[/tpl] and senior missionary couples exclusively; no single male missionaries are called to serve on Temple Square. The sister missionaries serving on Temple Square are called from North America as well as around the world, speaking enough languages to cater to the majority of visitors from around the world.
Sister missionaries come from many different countries, and provide tours and information in their home languages as well as English. Beginning with the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, sisters have been wearing tags with their national flags along with their missionary name tags.

===Conference and assembly buildings===

There are three large assembly buildings housed on Temple Square.
The smallest of the three is the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, which seats approximately 2,000 and is located on the southwest corner of Temple Square.  The Assembly Hall is a Victorian Gothic congregation hall, with a cruciform layout of the interior that is complemented by Stars of David circumscribed high above each entrance.  These symbolize the gathering of the Twelve Tribes of Israel (LDS perspective).  Construction of the hall began on August 11, 1877 and was completed in 1882.Assembly Hall on Temple Square, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is located just south of the Salt Lake Tabernacle and across from the South Visitor Center near the South Gate. Upon entering Temple Square from the South, the Assembly Hall can be seen to the left (west). The Assembly Hall hosts occasional free weekend music concerts and is filled as overflow for the Church's twice-a-year General Conferences.
The second structure is the Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square.  The Tabernacle was built between 1864 and 1867 with an overall seating capacity of 8,000, including the choir area and gallery.  In March 2007, the Tabernacle was rededicated after extensive renovations and restorations were completed.  Spacing between the pews was substantially increased, resulting in a reduced overall seating capacity.  The Tabernacle was rededicated at the Saturday afternoon session of the church's 177th Annual General Conference, in which the First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, other general authorities and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir broadcast the session from the Tabernacle, rather than the Conference Center.  In addition to housing the choir, the tabernacle is also used for other religious and cultural events.
The largest and most recently built assembly building is the LDS Conference Center.  With a capacity of over 21,000, it is used primarily for the LDS Church's general conferences as well as for concerts and other cultural events.  The Conference Center was completed in 2000.  Attached on the northwest corner of the Conference Center is the Conference Center Theater, a comparatively smaller 850-seat theater for dramatic presentations, such as Savior of the World, as well as concerts and other events.Conference Center
