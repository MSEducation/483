The African Geographical Review is a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Africa Specialty Group (Association of American Geographers).
The journal was originally established in 1963 at Makerere University (Uganda) as the East African Geographical Review. Due to political turmoil in Uganda, the journal had to suspend publication for a number of years. It was renamed as the African Geographical Review in 2000.[tpl]Cite web |last=Bakama |first=BakamaNume |title=Brief History of the African Geographical Review |url=http://www.macalester.edu/geography/agr/history.htm |accessdate=2010-01-01[/tpl] Since 2012 it is published by Taylor & Francis.
