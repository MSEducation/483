The Webster's Dictionary of 1913 defined ‘catchup’ as: “table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. written as ketchup.”
Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, the "father" of the Food and Drug Administration in the US, challenged the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. In response, entrepreneurs including Henry J. Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe that eliminated the need for that preservative.
Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin, in part due to the use of unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes[tpl]clarify|reason=What changes?|date=January 2013[/tpl] that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith[tpl]Cite book|author=Andrew F. Smith |title=The Tomato in America: Early History, Culture, and Cookery |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-252-07009-9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=e82QWB89_sIC&printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1[/tpl]) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.

===Later innovations===

In fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small packets. Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the "Dip and Squeeze" packet, which allowed the consumer to either tear the top off the package and squeeze the contents out, as with the traditional packet, or, in the alternative, tear the front off the package and use the package as a dip cup of the type often supplied with certain entreés.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904194604576578691502178606.html|title=Old Ketchup Packet Heads for Trash|last=Nassauer|first=Sarah|date=September 19, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|accessdate=19 October 2012[/tpl]
Previously fast food outlets dispensed ketchup from pumps into paper cups. This method has made a resurgence in the first decade of the 21st century with cost and environmental concerns increasing of individual packets.
In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2003-04-07-blue-ketchup_x.htm |agency=Associated Press  |title=Heinz unveils new blue ketchup |date=April 7, 2003 |work=USA Today[/tpl] These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup.

==Terminology==

The term used for the sauce varies.  Ketchup (sometimes spelled catsup in American English, called "a failed attempt at Anglicization"[tpl]cite web|title=Dictionary.com Unabridged|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ketchup|accessdate=05/02/2013[/tpl]) is the dominant term in American English and Canadian English, with "catsup" being the prominent term in some southern US states.  In these dialects, tomato sauce refers to pasta sauce, and is not a synonym for ketchup.  Tomato sauce is more common in Commonwealth English (e.g., Australia, India, New Zealand and South Africa).  In British English, the two terms are interchangeable.  Red sauce is used in Welsh English, Scottish English, Irish English and some parts of England, such as the Black Country, and in South London, often contrasting with brown sauce with which it is often served but in Canadian and American English, "red sauce" refers to red spicy sauces (or sweet and sour sauce)[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] and is not a synonym for ketchup.
The etymology of the word ketchup is unclear, with multiple competing theories:"The etymological origin of the word ketchup is a matter of confusion."  Pure Ketchup, by Andrew F. Smith, ISBN 1-56098-993-9. Page 4.

===China theory===

The China theory is that the word derives from one of two words from the Fujian region of coastal southern China: "kôe-chiap" (in the Xiamen accent) or "kê-chiap" (in the Zhangzhou accent). Both of these words (鮭汁, kôe-chiap and kê-chiap)  come from the Amoy dialect of China, where it meant the brine of pickled fish (鮭, salmon; 汁, juice) or shellfish.In the Chinese Amoy dialect, "kôe-chiap" (Xiamen accented Amoy) or "kê-chiap" (probably Penang Hokkien, which is based on Zhangzhou accented Amoy) (part of the Ming Na language) signifies "brine of pickled fish or shell-fish" (The Oxford English Dictionary, Douglas Chinese Dict. 46/1, 242/1).  There are citations of "koe-chiap" in the Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of the Amoy (London; Trudner) from 1873, defined as "brine of pickled fish or shell-fish."

===Malay theory===

Ketchup may have entered the English language from the Malay word kicap (pron. "kichap", also spelled kecap, ketjap), originally meaning "fish sauce", which itself may be a loan from Chinese terms above."Ketchup". The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition, published by Houghton Mifflin Company
In Indonesian cuisine, which is similar to Malay, the term kecap or ketjap refers to fermented savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally 'sweet kecap' in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning "fish kecap" is fish sauce similar to the Thai "Nam Pla" or the Philippine "Patis." It is not, however, soy-based.

===European-Arabic theory===

American anthropologist E.N. Anderson relies on Elizabeth David to claim that ketchup is a cognate of the French escaveche, meaning "food in sauce," but gives no further authority.Eugene N. Anderson. The Food of China. (New Haven: Yale University Press,  1988;   ISBN  0300047398), p. 160. The word also exists in Spanish and Portuguese forms as escabeche, "a sauce for pickling", which culinary historian Karen Hess traced back to Arabic Kabees, or "pickling with vinegar". The term was anglicized to caveach, a word first attested in the late 17th century, at the same time as ketchup.

===Early uses in English===

The word entered the English language in Britain during the late 17th century, appearing in print as catchup (1690) and later as ketchup (1711).  The following is a list of early quotations collected by the Oxford English Dictionary.
The spelling catsup seems to have appeared first from the pen of Jonathan Swift, in 1730.

==="Fancy" ketchup===

Some ketchup in the U.S. is labeled "Fancy". This is a USDA grade, relating to specific gravity. Fancy ketchup has a higher tomato solid concentration than other USDA grades.

==Nutrition==

The following table compares the nutritional value of ketchup with raw ripe tomatoes and salsa, based on information from the USDA Food Nutrient Database.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964|title=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference|publisher=USDA|accessdate=2007-12-03[/tpl]
Ketchup has moderate health benefits.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2821781 | title=Ketchup | work=BBC | date=July 27, 2004 | accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl] Ketchup is a source of lycopene, an antioxidant which may help prevent some forms of cancer. This is particularly true of the organic brands of ketchup, which have three times as much lycopene.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Ishida B, Chapman M | title = A comparison of carotenoid content and total antioxidant activity in catsup from several commercial sources in the United States. | journal = J Agric Food Chem | volume = 52 | issue = 26 | pages = 8017–20 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15612790 | doi = 10.1021/jf040154o[/tpl] Ketchup, much like marinara sauce and other cooked tomato foods, yields higher levels of lycopene per serving because cooking increases lycopene bioavailability.
In May 2010, Hunt's stopped using high fructose corn syrup in its ketchup products because of consumer complaints.

==Viscosity==

Tomato ketchup has an additive, usually xanthan gum, which gives the condiment a pseudoplastic or "shear thinning" property. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added - usually 0.5%. - which can make it difficult to pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together).  Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.
