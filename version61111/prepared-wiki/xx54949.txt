This is a list of Governors of New Hampshire, in the United States. The Governor of New Hampshire has a term of two years, and can seek re-election. The original title was "President of New Hampshire." It was changed to Governor of New Hampshire during the term of Josiah Bartlett, though the office itself remained the same. Therefore, Governor Bartlett was technically the first person to be called the Governor of New Hampshire; however, this is generally disregarded because only the title, not the office itself, was changed.
