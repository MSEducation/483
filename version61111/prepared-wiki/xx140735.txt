On 20 July 1983 the New York Times reported that the Horne along with seven other vessels in the Carrier Ranger Battle Group left San Diego on Friday 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer.
The battle group was composed of the carrier Ranger, the cruiser Horne, the guided missile destroyer Lynde McCormick, the destroyers Fletcher and Fife, the frigate Marvin Shields, the oiler Wichita and the support ship Camden.

After more than 26 years of service, Horne was decommissioned on 4 February 1994.

Initially scheduled to be scrapped, she was spared the breakers torch and was sunk as a target on 29 June 2008 as part of RIMPAC 2008.
