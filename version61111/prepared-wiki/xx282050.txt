==History==

What is now Fort Point was settled by English colonists in 1759 when Governor of Massachusetts Thomas Pownall brought 400 men to the area under the command of Jedidiah Preble and built Fort Pownall, which was built during the French and Indian War to defend the area against French adversaries. It was strategically built to protect English interests in the Penobscot River area. The fort saw no action during the war and the French threat was eliminated as a result of the war. 
In 1775, the British seized and destroyed the Fort in the Burning of Falmouth during the initial stages of the American Revolutionary War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.me.us/doc/parks/programs/history/fortpownall/pownall.htm|title=Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands:|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
In 1872, the Fort Point Hotel was built, attracting wealthy guests from across the region, most of whom arrived via steamboat. The hotel burned in the spring of 1898.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/doc/parks/programs/history/fortpownall/history.htm|title=Fort Point State Park|publisher=Maine.gov|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
