The Partridge Family Shopping Bag was released in 1972 by The Partridge Family. The vinyl release of the album contained a novelty plastic shopping bag. The album went gold and is now available on CD and iTunes.
As with most Partridge Family albums, several well-known songwriters contributed songs to the album. Perhaps the most famous were Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, who gave the album the track "Girl, You Make My Day." Tony Romeo, another prolific songwriter, contributed several tracks to the album.
Partridge Family lead vocalist David Cassidy wrote "There'll Come a Time" for the album, which would be his third songwriting effort to appear on a Partridge Family album. It would also be his last, as Cassidy's later songwriting efforts would all be released on his solo albums.
