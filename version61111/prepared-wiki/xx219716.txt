The Quake-Catcher Network is a joint collaborative initiative run by Stanford University and UC Riverside that aims to use computer-based accelerometers to detect earthquakes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://qcn.stanford.edu/ |title=Main project page |publisher=Qcn.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20[/tpl] It uses the BOINC volunteer computing platform (a form of distributed computing, similar to SETI@home).
It currently supports newer Mac laptops which have the built-in accelerometer (used to park hard drive heads if the laptop is dropped), and the newer IBM/Lenovo thinkpads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://qcn.stanford.edu/downloads/ |title=Supported Laptops (Apple Mac and Lenovo Thinkpad) |publisher=Qcn.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20[/tpl]  It also supports three external USB devices currently - the codemercs.com JoyWarrior 24F8, the ONavi sensor, and the MotionNode Accel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://qcn.stanford.edu/downloads/index.php#USB_Drivers |title=Supported USB Sensors |publisher=Qcn.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20[/tpl]
In 2011, project scientist Elizabeth Cochran was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award from US President Barack Obama in large part due to her founding of the Quake-Catcher Network project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121810/ |title=President Obama Names Top U.S. Early Career Scientists and Engineers |publisher=National Science Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-03-03[/tpl]
