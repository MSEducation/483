The National University of Singapore (Abbreviation: NUS; [tpl]lang-ms|Universiti Kebangsaan Singapura[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|s=新加坡国立大学 |p=Xīnjiāpō Guólì Dàxué[/tpl]; Abbreviated 国大; [tpl]indic|lang=ta|indic=சிங்கப்பூர் தேசியப் பல்கலைக்கழகம்|trans=Ciṅkappūr Tēciyap Palkalaikkaḻakam[/tpl]) is a comprehensive research university located in Singapore, being the flagship tertiary institution of the country which has a global approach to education and research. Founded in 1905, it is the oldest higher learning institute in Singapore, as well as the largest university in the country in terms of student enrolment and curriculum offered.
The university's main campus is located in southwest Singapore at Kent Ridge, with an area of approximately [tpl]convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Bukit Timah campus houses the Faculty of Law, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and research institutes, while the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore is located at the Outram campus.

==History==

In September 1904, Tan Jiak Kim led a group of representatives of the Chinese and other non-European communities, and petitioned the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, to establish a medical school in Singapore.[tpl]cite web|author=Loo Lay Yen |url=http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm# |title=National University of Singapore: A Brief Chronological History |publisher=Lib.nus.edu.sg |date=[/tpl] Tan, who was the first president of the Straits Chinese British Association, managed to raise $87,077, of which the largest amount of $12,000 came from himself. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] On 3 July 1905, the medical school was founded, and was known as the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States Government Medical School.
In 1912, the medical school received an endowment of $120,000 from the King Edward VII Memorial Fund, started by Lim Boon Keng. Subsequently on 18 November 1913, the name of the school was changed to the King Edward VII Medical School. In 1921, it was again changed to the King Edward VII College of Medicine to reflect its academic status.
In 1928,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/milestones/1905.php#2 |title=National University of Singapore website – Milestones |publisher=Nus.edu.sg |date=[/tpl] Raffles College was established to promote arts and social sciences at tertiary level for Malayan students.

===Establishment of the university===

Two decades later, Raffles College was merged with the King Edward VII College of Medicine to form the University of Malaya on 8 October 1949. The two institutions were merged to provide for the higher education needs of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.
The growth of UM was very rapid during the first decade of its establishment and resulted in the setting up of two autonomous divisions in 1959, one located in Singapore and the other in Kuala Lumpur.
In 1960, the governments of then Federation of Malaya and Singapore indicated their desire to change the status of the divisions into that of a national university.[tpl]cite web|author=Loo Lay Yen |url=http://www.lib.nus.edu.sg/nusbiodata/history.htm# |title=National University of Singapore: A Brief Chronological History |publisher=Lib.nus.edu.sg |date=[/tpl] Legislation was passed in 1961 establishing the former Kuala Lumpur division as the University of Malaya while the Singapore division was renamed the University of Singapore on 1 January 1962.

===Present form===

The National University of Singapore was formed with the merger of the University of Singapore and Nanyang University in 1980. This was done in part due to the government's desire to pool the two institutions' resources into a single, stronger entity, and promote English as Singapore's only main language. The original crest of Nanyang University with three intertwined rings was incorporated into the new coat-of-arms of NUS.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.nus.edu.sg/corporate/timeline/ | publisher = National University of Singapore | title = Milestones | accessdate =11 August 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015032203/http%3A//www.nus.edu.sg/corporate/timeline/ |archivedate = 15 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
NUS began its entrepreneurial education endeavours in the 1980s, with the setting up of the Centre for Management of Innovation and Technopreneurship in 1988. In 2001, this was renamed the NUS Entrepreneurship Centre (NEC), and became a division of NUS Enterprise. NEC is currently headed by Professor Wong Poh Kamhttp://www2.straitstimes.com/Think/Story/STIStory_800832.html and its activities are organised into 4 areas, including a business incubator, experiential education, entrepreneurship development, and entrepreneurship research.
Today, the National University of Singapore has 16 faculties and schools across three campus locations in Singapore – Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah and Outram – and provides a broad-based curriculum underscored by multi-disciplinary courses and cross-faculty enrichment.

==Education==

NUS has a semester-based modular system for conducting courses. It adopts features of the British system, such as small group teaching (tutorials) and the American system (course credits). Students may transfer between courses within their first two semesters, enroll in cross-faculty modules or take up electives from different faculties (compulsory for most degrees). Other cross-disciplinary initiatives study programmes include double-degree undergraduate degrees in Arts & Social Sciences and Engineering; Arts & Social Sciences and Law; Business and Engineering; and Business and Law.
NUS has 16 faculties and schools, including a Music Conservatory. Currently, it has seven overseas colleges at major entrepreneurial hubs in Shanghai and Beijing (China), Israel, India, Stockholm (Sweden), Silicon Valley and Bio Valley (US).National University of Singapore website – Faculties and Schools 

===NUS Overseas Colleges===

The NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme started in 2001, providing students with an educational experience in entrepreneurial and academic hubs around the world. Students spend 6–12 months overseas, interning at start-up companies and taking entrepreneurship related courses at partner Universities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jackyyapp.com/tag/nus-overseas-college-programme/ |title=NUS Overseas College Programme | Hello I am Jacky Yap |publisher=Jackyyapp.com |date=7 December 2011[/tpl] There are 7 colleges, in the Silicon Valley (US), Philadelphia (US), Shanghai (China), Beijing (China), Stockholm (Sweden), India and Israel.
The local equivalent is the Innovative Local Enterprise Achiever Development (iLEAD) initiative, where students intern at innovative Singapore companies. This is a 7–8-month programme that cultivates an entrepreneurial mindset, and develops leadership and management skills.
NOC set up an entrepreneurial-themed residence,[tpl]cite web|url=http://jackyyapp.com/2011/12/07/why-you-should-stay-in-n-house/ |title=Why you should stay in N-House | Hello I am Jacky Yap |publisher=Jackyyapp.com |date=7 December 2011[/tpl] known as N-House. Located within the NUS Prince George's Park residence, this houses about 90 students, who are graduates of the NOC and iLEAD programmes.  Entrepreneurial activities are also organised by the N-House residents, and these include entrepreneurial sharing sessions, business idea pitching and networking events.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

Tembusu houses mainly undergraduates, in addition to resident faculty, distinguished visiting scholars, and a few graduate fellows.  Freshmen (matriculating first-year students) enrolling in any NUS faculty or programme apply to the College at the same time they apply to NUS.  Entry is competitive (an essay-based application followed by an interview) as only 200–230 students can be enrolled in any given year. Some students from non-modular faculties (whose course requirements may be reduced or waived) and students from overseas exchange programmes add to the residential mix.
