==History==

Originating from the estate of the Chambaud family in the 18th century, the sole heiress to the estate married Louis Garitey in 1875, who remained owners until Garitey's death in 1914 when the property was divided into three parts.[tpl]Cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Chateau Latour à Pomerol |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/bordeaux/latourapomerol.shtml [/tpl]  The estate is first mentioned in the 1890 edition of Cocks & Féret where it was ranked among the best estates of Pomerol.
One part of the estate acquired in 1917 by Madame Edmond Loubat, she bought additions to the property with the estate named Haut-Canton-Guillot adjacent to Trotanoy and Clos des Grandes-Vignes near Pomerol's church, that together form the present Latour-à-Pomerol property.
Mme Loubat was also then proprietor of Château Pétrus, and the two properties have been closely associated since their reputation were established during and after World War II.[tpl]cite book|last =Peppercorn |first =David |title =Bordeaux |publisher = Mitchell Beazley |year =2003 |location =London| isbn= 1-84000-927-6|pages =513–514 [/tpl] The estate was inherited  by her niece, Madame Lily Lacoste, in 1961, who remained the owner for 40 years before she donated the estate to the Fondation de Foyers de Charité de Châteauneuf de Galaure in 2002.
