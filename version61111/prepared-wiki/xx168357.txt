Edward The Bear is a song by The Damned. It was recorded for and released on their album Phantasmagoria. It is one of only a handful of songs by The Damned to not feature Dave Vanian on lead vocals and it is sung by temporary Damned member Roman Jugg. The single and album versions are entirely different recordings, with the single and album versions differing in length, arrangement and band line-up. The single version features Paul Gray on bass guitar while the album version features Bryn Merrick on bass. The song bears a striking resemblance to "Baby Sign Here With Me" by Henry Badowski, who toured with The Damned for a short time in the eighties.
