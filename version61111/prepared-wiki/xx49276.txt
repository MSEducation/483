[[Right to keep and bear arms]]

CATEGORIES: American phraseology, Civil rights and liberties, Gun politics, Human rights by issue

The right to keep and bear arms (often referred to as the right to bear arms or to have arms) is the people's right to have their own arms for their defense as described in the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle, Cicero, John Locke, Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others.[tpl]cite book|author=Halbrook, Stephen P.|title=That Every Man Be Armed: The Evolution of a Constitutional Right (Independent Studies in Political Economy)|publisher=The Independent Institute|location=Oakland, CA|year=1994|page=8|isbn=0-945999-38-0[/tpl] In countries with an English common law tradition, a long standing common law right to keep and bear arms has long been recognized, as pre-existing in common law, prior even to the existence of written national constitutions.[tpl]cite journal|title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, Or Precedent Stand In The Way?|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=March 1997|first=Thomas B.|last=McAffee|coauthors=Michael J.

The concept of the "right of the people to keep and bear arms" is derived from the English Bill of Rights 1689 which states:
This must be read in the context of the grievance being addressed, which reads:
The English Bill of Rights established that regulating the right to bear arms was one of the powers of Parliament, and did not belong to the monarch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1518621|title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar. Sess. 2|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=August 30, 2010[/tpl] In most common law  jurisdictions, this right has since the early 20th century largely been abolished by statute, for example in the United Kingdom (in 1903, and Australia. In all jurisdictions, common law or otherwise, gun laws vary widely.

==Australia==

As there is no right to own firearms that is recognized or upheld by the federal or state and territory governments of Australia, firearms are usually seized when an individual is charged with an offence (a court order is not required). The laws strictly forbid ownership for the purpose of self-defense however the use of a firearm in self-defense is based on the specific characteristics of the case and whether its use represented excessive force. Security Guards may possess weapons for the protection of property and Police for the purposes of public safety and can apply for the firearm to be kept at their residence, this is a separate permit/requirement to being able to use a firearm in the execution of their duties. Carrying Firearms on ones person or in a motor vehicle (if the weapon is being transported it must be rendered inoperative and be taken directly to and from where it is to be used) is illegal without a permit, however such permits are only issued relatively rarely ( e.g. Armoured Car Security) and have stringent qualification requirements. A genuine reason must be given when applying for a license to own a firearm, and several valid categories such as Sport, hunting or collecting are specified, giving self-defence as a reason is specifically prohibited by law in all states and territories. As with most other jurisdictions persons with criminal convictions cannot acquire a permit.
Historically, controls on firearm ownership have usually followed major crimes which resulted in public outcry. This resulted in an incoherent collection of regulations — following the fact that Australia is a federal country. Legality varied wildly between jurisdictions, approaching American latitudes in places like Queensland and Tasmania. The current licensing and permit regime was enacted following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania and has largely converged all jurisdictions to a similar standard. The present pressures on gun law legislation in Australia arise from organised-crime activity, particularly the drug trade. Australia has been an agrarian country for much of its history, and therefore there is a significant population of gun owners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
With the exception of Victoria all states and territories do not require a license to own swords, knifes, bayonets or any other type of blade (with the exception of push daggers).  Folding knives are regulated on the mechanism type or on the manner of opening and is consistent throughout all states and territories, Automatic knives, OTF knives, Centripetal force, balisongs/butterfly knives, are prohibited.  Assisted Opening knives were legal before a change in regulation post 2011 election and are now prohibited for import, and carry but may be kept in a private home/residence if the knife was imported pre-ban.  The carrying of a blade (either folding or fixed, irrespective of length) in public is illegal unless the individual can give a lawful reason (or such reason is clearly evident) to police for why they have a blade, self-defence is not a lawful reason.  If a reason can not be provided then the individual is usually arrested and is then given the opportunity to give a reason to the Judge/Magistrate who may dismiss the charge if such a reason is provided.

==Chile==

Citizens meeting certain requirements may legally acquire firearms that are not automatic or semi-automatic.  The requirements for eligibility include obtaining a certification of mental health, having a fixed address, and having a secure storage method.  Firearm owners also must agree that firearms that are legally acquired, along with the secure storage location, may be inspected at any time between the hours of 8 AM to 10 PM upon a request of the national police.  It is illegal for citizens to acquire ammunition other than what is used in the specific firearms that are registered to them.  Upon the death of a registered gun owner, the person responsible for the estate shall transfer the firearm(s) to a legally eligible and registered owner within 90 days, or else must turn in the firearm(s) to either the closest military facility or the closest national police station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://psm.du.edu/media/documents/national_regulations/countries/americas/chile/chile_law_no17798__control_of_arms_and_similar_articles.pdf | title=Republica de Chile, Ministerio de Defensa Nacional, Dirección General de Movilización Nacional, Control de Armas y Elementos Similares, Ley 17798 |accessdate=2013-02-08 [/tpl]  In practice, single shot and double barrel shotguns, lever action rifles, and revolvers account for the majority of the registered civilian firearms owned by citizens, although any firearms that are not automatic or semi-automatic may be legally owned by citizens.  Firearms may be used for legal hunting, outside of the home or business, or, within one's home or business, for legal defense.

==Czech Republic==

There is no constitutional right to possess firearms in the Czech Republic. According to the Czech Constitutional court, the right to possess firearm is not a basic human right and it may not be derived from the right to own property guaranteed by the Art. 11(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.
The right to have a gun license issued is provided for in the Act No. 119/2002 Coll. Subject to fulfillment of the act's conditions, anyone is entitled to have the license issued and may then obtain a firearm.Firearms Act, Section 8Firearms Act, Section 16(1) Holders of D (exercise of profession) and E (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, may also freely carry a concealed firearm.''Firearms Act, Section 28(3)(B), 28(4)(C)

==Finland==

To possess firearms in Finland, citizens require a valid reason, such as recreation or exhibition, and must be licensed by local police. Permission may be denied if the citizen has a criminal background or a history of substance abuse or mental illness. The right to possess a firearm does not include the right to carry it in public, except while hunting. At home, firearms must be kept behind locks or inoperative. Knives and similar items may not be carried in public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1998/19980001 |title=Firearm Act of Finland |publisher=Finlex.fi |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19930615 |title=Hunting Act of Finland |publisher=Finlex.fi |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intermin.fi/intermin/bulletin.nsf/HeadlinesPublicFin/4271D5FF919AD47EC22574D300458042 |title=A letter by the Ministry of the Interior |publisher=Intermin.fi |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2003/20030612 |title=Public Order Act of Finland |publisher=Finlex.fi |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]

==Israel==

According to the licensing service for a private carry permit, a permit may be issued to a legal resident over the age of 21, that is working or living in dangerous zones defined by the Ministry; an individual who works in  specific professions listed by the Ministry or individuals who served in the Israeli Defense Force or other military agencies, at the rank of Captain or equivalent (currently serving in the standing army or reserves), retired officers at a rank of Lt. Colonel,  or active reserve members of specific special forces units.
The granting of a private weapon permit is neither  an inherent statutory right nor automatically approved. An applicant is vetted medically and by the police, and even then the request can still be denied by the licensing officer, though a denial can be appealed.http://mops.gov.il/Documents/Publications/Firearms/FirearmLicensingCriterion1.pdf

With the exception of law enforcement and defense force personnel, ownership of handguns is prohibited in Japan. Exceptions are made for firearms with cultural/artistic value (i.e. museum pieces) and for class 4 air pistol competitors, such as Olympic athletes.

===Legal right===

Since 1917 Mexican citizens have had the right to possess firearms "except those expressly prohibited by law". However after rioters looted gun stores in Mexico City in the 1960s, the Mexican government began to restrict wholesale gun ownership. By 1995, the government had closed the last private gun stores and given the military a monopoly on gun sales.
The country now only has one official gun store, the "Directorate for Arms and Munitions Sales" in Mexico City. Located near the army's main headquarters, the two-room building is heavily guarded.[tpl]cite news|last=Hawley|first=Chris|title=Mexico: Gun controls undermined by U.S.|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-03-31-mexicoguns_N.htm|accessdate=27 December 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=1 April 2009[/tpl] All Mexican citizens who wish legally possess firearms must abide by regulations and limitations in order to make a weapons purchase at the store. They are as follows:

===Owning a gun===

Gun control laws in Mexico are extremely strict in comparison to the United States, making it difficult for the average citizen to purchase anything larger than a .22 caliber. Article 11 (of the Mexican Constitution) " Ley Federal de Armas de Fuego y Explosivos" lists prohibited "military firearms" in Mexico. They include:

===Purchasing===

Mexico's constitution has a right to keep and bear arms for its citizens:

===Penalties===

Mexico's gun laws are very restrictive, and extremely harsh if you do not follow them.
Where there are prohibitions, there are penalties. The penalties for possession of prohibited "military firearms" include: 3–12 months in prison for bayonets, sabers and lances, 1–7 years for .357 magnum revolvers and any revolver larger than a .38 Special, and 2–12 years for other prohibited weapons.

Per section 149.26 of the Spanish Constitution "The State shall have exclusive competence over ... the regime for the production, trading, holding and use of weapons"
In practice, there is a tight regime over firearms which are regulated by law and administered by the Intervención de Armas unit of the Guardia Civil. The law requires every person carrying or having possession of a firearm to have a licence issued by the Civil Guard Authority. There are separate licence categories for officers of the state (e.g., the armed forces, the police and customs officers), personal use, security guards, game hunters large and small, for collectors, sports users and for minors participating in sports. Licences usually are issued for a limited period and are restrictive regarding the class of weapon that may be held.Licencing categories in Spain Spanish government in Spanish

==Switzerland==

Although the Swiss do not have a constitutional right to bear arms, Switzerland practices universal conscription, which requires that all able-bodied male citizens keep fully automatic firearms at home in case of a call-up. Every male between the ages of 20 and 34 is considered a candidate for conscription into the military, and following a brief period of active duty will commonly be enrolled in the militia until age or an inability to serve ends his service obligation.The Swiss Army at Europeforvisitors.com.

==United Kingdom==

Until recently, English statute was not concerned with absolute rights and rights that were recognized in law, such as the right to life have traditionally been part of the common law.  There is an English common law right to keep and bear arms for self-protection but the possession of certain arms is controlled for the common good.[tpl]cite journal| last =Kopel| first =David| title =It isn't about duck hunting: The British origins of the right to arms| journal =Michigan Law Review| issue =93| pages =1333–1362| publisher =Michigan Law Review Association| year =1995| url =http://www.guncite.com/journals/dk-dhunt.html| accessdate = 7 April 2013[/tpl] The right to bear arms was not specifically made legal until the Bill of Rights 1689. The first serious control on firearms after this was not made until the passing of the Pistols Act 1903 more than 200 years later.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pate |url=http://www.dvc.org.uk/dunblane/pistolsact.html |title=Dunblane Massacre Resource Page — Pistols Act, 1903 |publisher=Dvc.org.uk |date=1903-08-11 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]
Modern-day possession of guns operates as follows: everything that isn't prohibited under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 must be held on a section 1 firearms certificate, unless it is a section 2 shotgun and can thus go on a Shot Gun Certificate. The requirements for a firearms certificate are more demanding than that of a Shot Gun Certificate.Home Office guidelines to Police on granting of a firearms certificate
Police officers in Great Britain do not routinely carry firearms but do typically carry a baton and/or pepper spray. In recent years Tasers have controversially been deployed against citizens, occasionally in error.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2218945/Terror-blind-man-tasered-police-I-thought-theyd-kill-says-stroke-victim-aged-61-white-stick-mistaken-samurai-sword.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Terror of blind man tasered by police: 'I thought they'd kill me', says stroke victim aged 61 whose white stick was mistaken for a samurai sword[/tpl] Police that do carry firearms regularly are typically those guarding national ports of entry, those engaged with diplomatic security, Royal Protection officers, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary or officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Police officers carrying semi-automatic rifles were employed across London during the 2012 Olympics as a deterrent to terrorism and can occasionally be seen year-round at major London rail stations and other areas of high public concentration.

===General===

The Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibited the carrying of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. This is defined as any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1953/cukpga_19530014_en_1 |title=Prevention of Crime Act 1953 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]  The law covers not just firearms but also knives. A person cannot merely carry a knife around with him for self-defence as the courts do not regard this as reasonable excuse. Since 1972, in the Queens Bench court case Evans v. Hughes, the threat has to be believed to be real and imminent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1984/1.html |title=Court of Appeal ruling on the validity of "self defence" as "reasonable excuse" |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] A person with fishing tackle and carrying a knife or on a camping expedition would have a reasonable excuse for carrying a knife. Non locking, folding knives with a blade under 3 inches, may be carried freely without "reasonable excuse", however the police and courts regard them as an offensive weapon if used as such. It was not considered a "reasonable excuse" to carry a weapon for self-defence, unless his job carried a high risk of being attacked by criminals such as people carrying money to a bank, security guards and certain people who worked for the government. Since 1973, security guards and others are not allowed to carry truncheons and other weapons as part of their duties and only police are allowed to carry weapons.

====Firearms====

Pistols with barrels shorter than 9 inches were first controlled by the 1903 Pistols Act, which placed hurdles in the path of those who were not householders. Pistols, revolvers, rifles and ammunition, but not shotguns, were much more tightly controlled by the Firearms Act of 1920, which made it illegal to possess these weapons without first obtaining a certificate from the police and registering each individual firearm. Less stringent provisions were introduced for shotguns in 1967.[ref]

UK legislation often gives considerable powers to ministers to issue regulations that control the way the various acts are applied. In relation to firearms, this power generally falls to the Home Secretary. The Home Office therefore has some control of the conditions under which firearms certificates can be issued. On a few occasions over the years, permits have been granted to private individuals to keep firearms for personal protection, however these are very limited and exceptional cases.
The Firearms Acts 1936/7 placed additional controls on fully automatic firearms, effectively restricting them to the armed forces and police.  The Criminal Justice Act 1967 was passed which introduced Shotgun Certificates. The act was at least in part a response to the murder by criminals of three policemen the previous year, though this had been committed with handguns. The Firearms Act 1968 introduced the concept of compulsory security for rifles and pistols and incorporated the Shotgun Certificate first outlined in the Criminal Justice Act 1967. The Firearms Act 1982 extended the provision of the 1968 Act, including control of imitation firearms. The Hungerford killings in 1987 was followed by the Firearms Act 1988 which banned centre-fire self-loading and pump action rifles and extended compulsory security to shotguns.  The Dunblane massacre in Scotland in 1996 was followed by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997, which effectively banned all but .22 pistols; and then, after the Labour government led by Tony Blair came into power, the Firearms (Amendment) (No.2) Act 1997 was introduced, which effectively banned the private possession of all modern pistols, even for competitive sporting purposes.  Rifles are not limited to smallbore, or to competition use and numerous types of rifles, shotguns and black-powder pistols and longarms, may be owned privately.

The Firearms Act 1968 also forbids the use of "any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing" by the public.  This, for example, covers pepper spray, ammonia, CS gas, and electric shock armaments such as the Taser and Stun gun.

==United States==

In the United States, with a common law tradition and a constitution dating to the 18th century, the "right to keep and bear arms" has been enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, with the text :
United States Citizens have the right to possess firearms, except for convicted felons and those found mentally disabled.  Citizens may carry a handgun or other weapon in public in a concealed or open manner, either on one's person or in proximity.  Some jurisdictions may require a "Concealed carry" permit, for concealed carry, however most jurisdictions do not require a permit for open carry, if allowed. A small number of states and localities may require licenses to own or purchase guns and ammunition. 
Precursory legal wording can also be found in the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Following the American Revolution in 1776, one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of English common law to the extent that American legislation or the Constitution had not explicitly rejected English law.[tpl]cite journal|title=Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws|last1=Lammi|first1=Glenn G.|last2=Chang|first2=James|date=December 17, 2004|journal=Legal Backgrounder|publisher=Washington Legal Foundation |volume=19 |issue=46 |id=Unknown ID:10563059 |url=http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf |ref=harv[/tpl] Many English common law traditions were enshrined in the US Constitution, such as the right to keep and bear arms, habeas corpus, jury trials, and various other civil liberties. Significant principles of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States.Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History.

===English precedent===

The Second Amendment was heavily influenced by the English Bill of Rights 1689, which restricted the right of the English Crown to interfere with the personal right to bear arms. The 1689 Bill of Rights restricted the right of the monarch to have a standing army and to interfere with the personal right to bear arms. It did not create a new right to have arms, but instead rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King James II which extended the right to Catholics and Protestant dissenters in addition to upholding prior legislation that limited the ownership of arms to certain social classes. The English Bill of Rights firmly established that regulating the right to bear arms was one of the powers of Parliament, and did not belong to the monarch.
Sir William Blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]
