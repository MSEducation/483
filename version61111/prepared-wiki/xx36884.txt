==Album information==

Though a collection of "B-sides", the album would ironically feature one of their biggest singles; a collaboration/cover of Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise". Attack of the Killer B's was certified gold by the RIAA. The two live tracks, "Keep It In The Family" and "Belly Of The Beast", were recorded during the 1990-91 Persistence of Time tour. Also included is an updated version of their 1987 single, "I'm the Man", and three songs previously released only in Europe and Japan on the 1989 EP, Penikufesin ("Nise Fukin EP"), recorded during the State of Euphoria sessions. 
Two versions of the album were released: the uncensored version contained full expletives and the song "Startin' up a Posse", and the censored version which excluded the aforementioned track, and in place of the explicit words, a buzzing noise (like bees) is heard. The track "Startin' Up A Posse" is a tongue in cheek attack on the PMRC. The compilation also includes covers of songs by Discharge, Kiss, Trust, and the surf rock staple "Pipeline", originally recorded by The Chantays.
The song "N.F.B. (Dallabnikufesin)" was intended to illustrate the band's disdain for power ballads, which were very fashionable in the commercial metal scene at the time. The band also covers two songs ("Milk (Ode to Billy)" and "Chromatic Death") originally recorded by Stormtroopers of Death, a mid-80s side project by Anthrax members Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, and then-bassist Dan Lilker. The "Billy" referenced in the title is S.O.D. vocalist Billy Milano. 
"Bring the Noise" is a collaboration with rap group Public Enemy, making this song one of the first rap metal collaborations (albeit some years after the Aerosmith/Run DMC 1986 collaboration on "Walk This Way"), although Joey Belladonna and Dan Spitz had collaborated with Untouchable Force Organization on a song called "Lethal" in 1987 that was released as a single[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]. "Bring The Noise" would later appear on the skateboard videogame Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.
