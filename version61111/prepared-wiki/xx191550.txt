Albert Andrew Larmour (born 23 August 1955) is a former Northern Irish professional footballer. He was born in Belfast.
Starting his career at Linfield, he joined Cardiff City in 1972 for £12,000. Initially struggling to establish himself, it wasn't until the 1974-75 season that he began to make an impact on the first team, scoring hisfirst goal for the club during a 5-2 loss to Wrexham in the second leg of the Welsh Cup final. He helped them to promotion the following year before losing his place in the 1978-79 season when Cardiff paid £65,000 to bring Hull City defender Dave Roberts to the club. He joined Torquay United instead, being handed captaincy on his arrival and spending two years at the club before retiring.
