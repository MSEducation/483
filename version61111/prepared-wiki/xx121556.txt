==History==

The 1993 edition was contested by Atlético Mineiro (winners of the 1992 Copa CONMEBOL), Boca Juniors (winners of the 1992 Supercopa Masters), Cruzeiro (winners of the 1992 Supercopa Sudamericana) and São Paulo (winners of the 1992 Copa Libertadores). In the semifinals, Boca Juniors defeated Telê Santana's São Paulo in the mythical La Bombonera 1-0; the Paulistas' golden generation would return the dosage on the return leg and the series went into extra-time. Tied 1-1 on aggregate, Sergio Daniel Martínez made history as he scored the first ever golden goal in a South American competition. In the final, Boca Juniors managed to hold Atlético Mineiro to a 0-0 tie in the Mineirão and win 1-0 in Buenos Aires, with the goal coming from Carlos MacAllister, to become the first ever winners of the competition. In 1994, the tournament was not played because of the scandal last year.
In 1995, 1994 Copa Libertadores champion Vélez Sársfield and 1994 Supercopa Sudamericana champion Independiente declined to play. This only left the 1994 Copa CONMEBOL and 1995 Supercopa Masters champions in the tournament. Cruzeiro faced São Paulo; in the first leg in Belo Horizonte, São Paulo managed to win 0-1 before the game was suspended at the 47th minute due to Cruzeiro having four players sent off in the first half (they had used all the substitutions) and having one injured player leaving just six in the field for the Reposa; in accordance with the regulations, the minimum number of players per team is seven. However, Cruzeiro managed to come back from and win 0-1 in the Morumbi to eventually win the trophy on penalties. Due to scheduling conflicts, this season was played as part of the Supercopa Sudamericana, specifically the quarterfinal stage.
The 1996 Copa de Oro was played entirely in the city of Manaus and the final edition. The four teams were the champions of the 1995 Copa Libertadores, 1995 Copa CONMEBOL and 1996 Copa Masters CONMEBOL in addition to the runner-up of the 1995 Supercopa Sudamericana as the 1995 champion Independiente declined to play. In the semifinals, Flamengo defeated Rosario Central 2-1 and São Paulo 3-1 and become champions of the competition.
