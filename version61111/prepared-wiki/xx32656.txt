George Sylvester Viereck and Paul Eldridge wrote a trilogy of novels My First Two Thousand Years, an Autobiography of the Wandering Jew, (1928), in which Isaac Laquedem is a Roman soldier who, after being told by Jesus that he will "tarry until I return," goes on to influence many of the great events of history; he frequently encounters Solome (described as 'The Wandering Jewess'), and travels with a companion, to whom he has passed on his immortality via a blood transfusion (another attempt to do this for a woman he loved ended in her death). In Ilium by Dan Simmons, (2003), a woman who is addressed as the Wandering Jew plays a central role, though her real name is Savi.
The Wandering Jew is revealed to be Judas Iscariot in George R.R. Martin's distant-future science fiction parable of Christianity, the 1979 short story "The Way of Cross and Dragon".
The Wandering Jew appears as a sympathetic character in Diana Wynne Jones's young adult novel The Homeward Bounders - his fate is tied in with larger plot themes regarding destiny, disobedience, and punishment.  "Ahasver," a cult leader identified with the Wandering Jew, is a central figure in Anthony Boucher's classic mystery novel, Nine Times Nine (originally published 1940 under the name H. Holmes). The Wandering Jew encounters a returned Christ in Deborah Grabien's 1990 novel

"The Wandering Jew" is the title of a short poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson which appears in his book The Three Taverns.The three taverns; a book of poems : Robinson, Edwin Arlington, 1869-1935 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive In the poem, the speaker encounters a mysterious figure with eyes that "remembered everything." He recognizes him from "his image when I was a child" and finds him to be bitter, with "a ringing wealth of old anathemas;" a man for whom the "world around him was a gift of anguish." The speaker does not know what became of him, but believes that "somewhere among men to-day / Those old, unyielding eyes may flash / And flinch - and look the other way."
Hob Gadling, an immortal character in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series is associated with the Wandering Jew, despite not being jewish.

In another artwork, exhibited at Basel in 1901, the legendary figure with the name Der ewige Jude, The Eternal Jew, was shown redemptively bringing the Torah back to the Promised Land.Sculpture by Alfred Nossig.

==In ideology (19c. and after)==

By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the figure of the "Wandering Jew" as a legendary individual had begun to be identified with the fate of the Jewish people as a whole. After the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte at the end of the century and the emancipating reforms in European countries connected with the policy of Napoleon and the Jews, the "Eternal Jew" became an increasingly "symbolic... and universal character" as the continuing struggle for Jewish emancipation in Prussia and elsewhere in Europe in the course of the nineteenth century gave rise to what came to be referred to as "the Jewish Question".[tpl]cite book|last=Bein|first=Alex |title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&pg=PA155|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=30 April 1990|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3252-9|page=155[/tpl]
Before Kaulbach's mural replica of his painting Titus destroying Jerusalem had been commissioned by the King of Prussia in 1842 for the projected Neues Museum, Berlin, Gabriel Riesser's essay "Stellung der Bekenner des mosaischen Glaubens in Deutschland" (On the Position of Confessors of the Jewish Faith in Germany) had been published (1831) and the journal "Der Jude, periodische Blätter für Religions- und Gewissensfreiheit" (The Jew, Periodical for Freedom of Religion and Thought) had been founded (1832). In 1840 Kaulbach himself had published a booklet of Explanations identifying the main figures for his projected painting, including that of the Eternal Jew in flight as an outcast for having rejected Christ. In 1843 Bruno Bauer's book with the title The Jewish Question was published,"Die Judenfrage," Brunswick, 1843 http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2668-bauer-bruno, where Bauer argued that religious allegiance must be renounced by both Jews and Christians as a precondition of juridical equality and political and social freedom.

The caricature which had first appeared in a French publication in 1852, depicting the legendary figure with "a red cross on his forehead, spindly legs and arms, huge nose and blowing hair, and staff in hand", was co-opted by anti-Semites.[tpl]cite book|last=Mosse|first=George L. |title=The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kXd_2_ebSekC&pg=PA57|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=8 October 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512660-0|page=57[/tpl] It was shown at the Nazi exhibition Der Ewige Jude in Germany and Austria in 1937–1938.

The exhibition had been held at the Library of the German Museum in Munich from November 8, 1937 to January 31, 1938 showing works that the Nazis considered to be 'degenerate art'.

The works of art displayed at these exhibitions were generally executed by avant-garde artists who had become recognized and esteemed in the 1920s, but the objective of the exhibitions was not to present the works as worthy of admiration but to deride and condemn them.[tpl]cite book|last=West|first=Shearer |title=The visual arts in Germany 1890-1937: Utopia and despair|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JCSsgp4V7eYC&pg=PA189|accessdate=14 November 2011|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5279-8|page=189[/tpl]

==On stage, and in other media==

Fromental Halévy's opera Le juif errant, based on the novel by Sue, was premiered at the Paris Opera (Salle Le Peletier) on 23 April 1852, and had 48 further performances over two seasons. The music was sufficiently popular to generate a Wandering Jew Mazurka, a Wandering Jew Waltz, and a Wandering Jew Polka.Anderson, (1991), p. 259.
A Hebrew-language play titled "The Eternal Jew" premiered at the Moscow Habimah Theatre in 1919 and was performed at The Habima Theatre in New York in 1926.[tpl]cite book|last=Nahshon|first=Edna |title=Jews and shoes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rx--Mja-DJUC&pg=PA143|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=15 September 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-050-5|page=143[/tpl]
There have been several films on the topic of The Wandering Jew.  In 1933, the Jewish Talking Picture Company released a Yiddish-language film entitled The Eternal Jew. A 1934 British version The Wandering Jew, starring Conrad Veidt in the title role, and entitled The Eternal Jew, is based on the stage play by E. Temple Thurston, and attempts to tell the legend literally, taking the Jew from Biblical times all the way to the Spanish Inquisition. This version was also made as The Wandering Jew a silent film in 1923, starring Matheson Lang in his original stage role. The play had been produced both in London and on Broadway. Co-produced in the U.S. by David Belasco, it had played on Broadway in 1921. The play "Spikenard", (1930) by C.E. Lawrence, has the Jew wander an unhabitanted Earth along
with Judas and the Impenitent thief.  Still another film version of the story, made in Italy in 1948, starred Vittorio Gassman. A propaganda 'documentary' film made in Germany in 1940 and entitled Der Ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew), reflected National Socialist anti-Semitism, linking the legend with alleged Jewish malpractices over the ages. In the 1988 film The Seventh Sign the Wandering Jew appears as a Father Lucci, who identifies himself as the centuries old Cartaphilus, Pilate's porter, who took part in the scourging of Jesus before his crucifixion.
