==Responsibilities and authorities==

The Constitution of India distributes the sovereign powers exercisable with respect to the territory of any State between the Union and that State. "Article 73 broadly stated, provides that the executive power of the Union shall extend to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws. Article 162 similarly provides that the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of a State has power to make laws. The Supreme Court has reiterated this position when it ruled in the Ramanaiah case that the executive power of the Union or of the State broadly speaking, is coextensive and coterminous with its respective legislative power."

==History==

===Pre-1956===

The Indian Subcontinent has been ruled by many different ethnic groups throughout its history, each instituting their own policies of administrative division in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indhistory.com/ |title=Indian History, India History, History of India |publisher=Indhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indohistory.com/ |title=History of India, The Great Indian History |publisher=Indohistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl][tpl]full|date=November 2012[/tpl] During the British Raj, the original administrative structure was mostly kept, and India was divided into provinces that were directly governed by the British and princely states which were nominally controlled by a local prince or raja loyal to the British Empire, who held de facto sovereignty (suzerainty) over the princely states.

===After 1956===

The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 abandoned the British system of provinces and princely states. In its place, new states were drawn based on ethnicity and language.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] 
The former French and Portuguese colonies in India were incorporated into the  Republic as the union territories of Puducherry (Pondicherry), Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Daman and Diu in 1962.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

Ahead of the 2009 General Elections in India, all the major parties in Andhra Pradesh supported statehood for Telangana.[tpl]update after|2013|1|22[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]  
As a result of this unilateral decision by the Government of India, several members of Andhra Pradesh's legislature submitted their resignations to protest the creation of the new state owing to the pressure from the people in their constituencies.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/60-ap-mlas-submit-resignation-to-protest-telangana-creation/80453/on|title=60 AP MLAs submit resignation to protest Telangana creation|last=Press Trust of India |date=  10 December 2009 |work=Business Standard|accessdate=10 December 2009[/tpl] As of 11 December, at least 117 legislators and many Members of Parliament had resigned in protest of the Government's decision to carve out a new state of Telangana.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-11/india/28063245_1_telangana-creation-telangana-state-mlas|title=Telangana: Shutdown in Andhra Pradesh, 117 legislators quit|date=  11 December 2009 |work=Times of India|accessdate=10 December 2009[/tpl]
Due to the unexpected turn of events, after the parties which promised support to the Telangana state formation on 7 December 2009 in a unanimous all-party meeting at the State level, presided by CM, Rosaiah, and later the party members of these parties made a U-turn on their support bowing to the pressure from the people in their constituency following the 9 December statement (in support of Telangana state process initiation), the federal government made another statement on 23 December to clarify its intention on the process that it would consult with all groups, political and non-political, before moving forward. It then formed the Justice Sri Krishna committee which has been touring the state consulting with different sections of the society. A report recommending a solution suitable to all constituents is expected to be submitted before 31 December 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/srikrishna-report-dec-31-897|title=Srikrishna report by Dec. 31|date=  27 October 2010 |work=Deccan Chronicle|accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl]
In November 2011 Mayawati, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, proposed dividing it into four states, Avadh Pradesh, Bundelkhand, Paschim Pradesh, and Purvanchal. On 21 November this movement was backed through a "voice vote" by the state assembly, despite criticism from the opposition and claims that the move was made to gain support for the next state election. It must gain the approval of the federal government, however this may be difficult due to the opposition to the creation of Telangana.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-15814828 |title=India: Uttar Pradesh assembly backs state division |publisher=BBC News |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=21 November 2011[/tpl]
