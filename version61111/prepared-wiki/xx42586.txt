[tpl]About|the dog breed||Pomeranian (disambiguation)[tpl]![/tpl]Pomeranian[/tpl]

The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type, named for the Pomerania region in Central Europe (today part of northern Poland and eastern Germany). Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed, and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (Dwarf Spitz).
The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by 50%. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issue is Luxating patella. Tracheal collapse can also be an issue. More rarely, the breed can suffer from a skin condition colloquially known as "black skin disease", or alopecia ex. This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pommania.co.uk/blackskindisease.htm |title=BSD (Black Skin Disease) Alopecia X, Coat Funk |date= |work= |publisher=Pommania Pomeranains |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl] The breed is currently among the top 15 most popular in the USA, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.

==Appearance==

Pomeranians are small dogs weighing [tpl]convert|1.9|-|3.5|kg|lb[/tpl] and standing [tpl]convert|5.0|-|11|in|cm[/tpl] high at the withers.[tpl]cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds |last=Cunliffe |first=Juliette |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Parragon |location= |isbn=978-0-7525-8018-0 |page=262 |pages= |url=[/tpl] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.[tpl]cite book |title=Dogs: 101 Adorable Breeds |last=Hale|first=Rachael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location= |isbn=978-0-7407-7342-6 |page=197 |pages= |url=[/tpl] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://premierpoms.com/history.html |title=Pomeranian History |date= |work= |publisher=Premier Pomeranians |accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl]
The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.webanswers.com/pets/what-is-a-pomeranian-8a12b7|title=What is a Pomeranian| work=Web Answers| accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors.[tpl]cite book |title=Pomeranians for Dummies |last=Coile |first=D. Caroline |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=For Dummies |location= |isbn=978-0-470-10602-0 |page=29 |pages= |url=[/tpl] The most common colors are orange, black  or cream/white.
The merle Pomeranian is a recent color developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merlepomeranian.com/ |title=Merle Pomeranians |date= |work= |publisher=Merle Pomeranians |accessdate=6 December 2009[/tpl]
Pomeranians have a thick double coat, and while grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.happypomeranians.com/pomeranian-dogs/tips-on-pomeranian-grooming |title=Tips on Pomeranian Grooming |author=Dane Stanton |year=2009 |work=Pomeranian Dogs |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl]

==Temperament==

Pomeranians are typically a very friendly, playful and lively breed of dog.[tpl]cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/breed-selector/dog-breeds/toy/pomeranian.html |title=Pomeranian Guide |date= |work= |publisher=animal.discovery.com |accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl] They love to be around their owners and are known to be protective of them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dogster.com/breeds/pomeranian |title=Pomeranian Dogs |date= |work= |publisher=Dogster.com |accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and will thus bark when they encounter any outside noises.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19741125&id=TNUiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CuUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1089,8333446 | title=A Pup For Christmas | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=25 November 1974 | accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] Pomeranians are intelligent dogs, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention but can become quite aggressive and dominant if not well trained.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dogster.com/breeds/pomeranian |title=Pomeranian Dogs |date= |work= |publisher=Dogster.com |accessdate=26 November 2012[/tpl] The use of toys can be an effective tool in encouraging Poms to spend time alone.

==Health==

===Overall health===

The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.petpom.com/ |title=Pomeranian Information |date= |work= |publisher=PomPom.com |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl] A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems, and if kept trim and fit a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mydogbreed.com/pomeranian/pomeranian-health.php |title=Pomeranian Health Management |work=My Dog Breed: The Pomeranian|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon due to the Pomeranian's lightweight build.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mbfonline.com/pomhealth/ |title=Pomeranian Health Problems |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl] Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming, and teeth, ear and eye cleaning. With routine care these problems can be avoided.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.happypomeranians.com/pomeranian-dogs/pomeranian-health-caring-for-your-pomeranian |title=Pomeranian Health: Caring For Your Pomeranian |date= |work=Pomeranian Dogs |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] They are prone to early tooth loss and feeding them dry food is recommended.[tpl]cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/pomeranian.htm |title=Dogs 101: Pomeranian |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various source giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.[tpl]cite journal|last=Borge|first=Kaja Sverdrup|last2=Tønnessen |first2= Ragnhild |last3= Nødtvedt |first3= Ane |last4= Indrebø |first4= Astrid |title=Litter size at birth in purebred dogs—A retrospective study of 224 breeds|journal=Theriogenology|date=March 2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=911–919 |pmid= 22365700 |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.034|quote="Pomeranian and Toy Poodle had the smallest mean litter size in our study 2.4, which is in line with the results  of previous studies 7–9,15.

===Common problems===

Merle colored dogs may suffer from mild to severe deafness, increased intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles may additionally suffer from abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.genmarkag.com/download/Factsheet_Merle_Gene.pdf |format= PDF |title=Merle Gene |date= |work=GenMark |publisher= |accessdate=6 December 2009[/tpl]
Luxating patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to "luxate" (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1321&aid=457 |title=Luxating Patella |date= |publisher=Drs. Foster & Smith, Inc |work=PetEducation.com |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl] Whilst the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc.
Tracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/tracheal_collapse.htm |title=Tracheal Collapse |last=Degner |first= Daniel A. |year=2004 |publisher=Drs. Foster & Smith, Inc |work=PetEducation.com |accessdate=30 November 2009[/tpl]
In Pomeranians, a condition often called "black skin disease" occurs which is a combination of alopecia (hair loss) and hyperpigmentation (a darkening of the skin).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.vet.utk.edu/hairloss/alopecia.html | title=What is Alopecia X? | publisher=The University of Tennessee- College of Veterinary Medicine | accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] Other names for this condition include wooly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss syndrome. This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic this condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders.
Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism.[tpl]cite web | last = Ward | first = Ernest | title = Cryptorchidism in Dogs | work = Shores Animal Clinic  | publisher = Lifelearn | year = 2009 | url = http://shoresanimalclinic.net/index.php?view=pageView&pageid=802  | accessdate = 21 January 2011 [/tpl] This is when either one or both of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle.

==History==

===Origins===

The forerunners of today's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the Arctic regions. These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or Spitz type, which is German for "sharp point" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th Century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz.[tpl]cite book |title=The Pomeranian Handbook |last=Vanderlip |first=Sharon |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location= |isbn=978-0-7641-3545-3 |page= |pages=2–8 |url=[/tpl]
The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.
An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in James Boswell's Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland. "The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of."[tpl]cite book |title=Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland |last=Boswell |first=James|editor-last=Pottle |editor-first= Frederick A. |authorlink=James Boswell |year=1764 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=1st |isbn= |page=165 |pages= |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/boswellonthegran006270mbp#page/n199/mode/2up |accessdate=29 November 2009[/tpl] The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's A Tour in Scotland from 1769.[tpl]cite book |title=A Tour in Scotland 1769 |last=Pennant|first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Pennant |year=1776 |publisher=Benj White |edition=Fourth |isbn= |page=195 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vk8JAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=thomas+pennant+pomeranian#v=onepage&q=pomeranian&f=false |accessdate=29 November 2009[/tpl]
Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of England, brought two Pomeranians to England. Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as [tpl]convert|30|-|50|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl], but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back.
Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she named "Windor's Marco" and was reported to weigh only [tpl]convert|12|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.puppyreview.com/puppy/pomeranian | title=Pomeranian origin | accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] of different colors from various European countries to add to her breeding program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pomeranian.org/breed-profile |title=Pomeranian Profile |first=Denise |last= Leo |year=2009 |work=Pomeranian.com|publisher= |accessdate=6 January 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101127184123/http://pomeranian.org/breed-profile |archivedate=17 April 2014 |deadurl=yes [/tpl] Royal owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of France, and King George IV of England.
The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19640920&id=zLgqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=o2UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5471,3699631 | title=Annual Dog Work Is In 37th Year | work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune | date=20 September 1964 | accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl] The first member of the breed was registered in America to the American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.
In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic. A Pomeranian called "Lady", owned by Miss Margaret Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat number seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number six.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lostandfond.co.uk/news-features/2010-10/fate-pets-who-sailed-titanic|title=Lost and Fond: Fate of the Pets Who Sailed on the Titanic |publisher=Caittom Publishing |accessdate=2 November 2010[/tpl]
Glen Rose Flashaway won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926, the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian, "Great Elms Prince Charming II", to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel Club.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/biswinners.html |title=Best in Show Winners |date= |publisher=Westminster Kennel Club |accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl]
In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard, along with the Keeshond, by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/097gb98_en.doc |title=FCI-Standard N° 97: German Spitz, Including Keeshond And Pomeranian |date=5 March 1998 |work= |publisher=Fédération Cynologique Internationale |accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] According to the standard "Spitz breeds are captivating" and have a "unique characteristic, cheeky appearance."
