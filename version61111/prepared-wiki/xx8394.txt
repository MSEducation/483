Niue ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|eɪ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|NEW|ay[/tpl]; Niuean: Niuē) is an island country in the South Pacific Ocean, [tpl]convert |2400|km|mi[/tpl] northeast of New Zealand within the triangle formed by Tonga (to the west), Samoa (to the north) and the Cook Islands (to the east). Its land area is [tpl]convert|260|km2|mi2[/tpl] and its population, predominantly Polynesian, is around 1,400. They commonly refer to the island as "the Rock", a reference to the traditional moniker "Rock of Polynesia".[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Niue is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand, and most of its diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand on its behalf. Niueans are New Zealand citizens, and Queen Elizabeth II is head of state in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand. 90–95% of Niuean people live in New Zealand,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/pacific-peoples/pacific-people-population.aspx |title=QuickStats About Pacific Peoples |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |year=2006 |accessdate=28 October 2011[/tpl] along with about 70% of the speakers of the Niuean language.Moseley, Christopher and R. E. Asher, ed. Atlas of the World's Languages (New York: Routelage, 1994) p. 100
Niue is not a member of the United Nations, but its status as a freely-associated state has been accepted by UN organs as equivalent to independence for international law purposes.http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2000/pacific-peoples-constitution-report-september-2000/documents/Bibliography.doc Niue is a member of some UN Specialized Agencies.
In 2003, Niue became the world's first "Wi-Fi nation", in which free wireless Internet access is provided throughout the country by The Internet Users Society-Niue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=35876 |title=Light Reading – Networking the Telecom Industry |publisher=Unstrung.com |accessdate=2012-11-20[/tpl]

==History==

Niue was settled by Polynesians from Samoa around 900 AD.Encyclopædia Britannica, "Niue" Further settlers arrived from Tonga in the 16th century.
Until the beginning of the 18th century, there appears to have been no national government or national leader: chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over segments of the population. Around 1700 the concept and practice of kingship appear to have been introduced through contact with Samoa or Tonga. A succession of patu-iki (kings) ruled, the first of whom was Puni-mata. Tui-toga, who reigned from 1875 to 1887, was the first Christian king.[tpl]cite web | first = S Percy | last = Smith | url = http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-SmiNiu.html | title = Niuē-fekai (or Savage) Island and its People | year = 1903 | pages = 36–44 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]
The first European to sight Niue was Captain James Cook in 1774. He made three attempts to land but was refused permission to do so by the inhabitants. He named the island "Savage Island" because, legend has it, the natives that "greeted" him were painted in what appeared to be blood. The substance on their teeth was hulahula, a native red banana.[tpl]Cite book | first = Anthony 'Tony' | last = Horowitz | title = Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before | year = 2002 | chapter = 8 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl].
For the next couple of centuries Niue was known as Savage Island, until its original name Niuē, which translates as "behold the coconut",[tpl]cite news |first=Kathy|last=Marks|title=World's smallest state aims to become the first smoke-free paradise island |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/worlds-smallest-state-aims-to-become-the-first-smokefree-paradise-island-862977.html|work= The Independent | date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-21 | location= London[/tpl] regained use.
The next notable European visitors were from the London Missionary Society, who arrived in 1846 on the "Messenger of Peace". After many years of trying to land a European missionary, a Niuean named Nukai Peniamina was taken to Samoa and trained as a Pastor at the Malua Theological College.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] Peniamina returned as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua. He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi Mutalau after a number of attempts in other villages had failed. The Chiefs of Mutalau village allowed him to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu.
Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it was spread to all the villages; originally other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina. The people from the village of Hakupu, although the last village to receive Christianity, came and asked for a "word of god"; hence their village was renamed "Ha Kupu Atua" meaning "any word of god", or "Hakupu" for short.
In 1887, King Fata-a-iki, who reigned from 1887 to 1896, offered to cede sovereignty to the British Empire, fearing the consequences of annexation by a less benevolent colonial power. The offer was not accepted until 1900.
Niue was a British protectorate, but the UK's direct involvement ended in 1901 when New Zealand annexed the island. Self-government was granted by the New Zealand parliament with the 1974 constitution, following a referendum in 1974 whereby Niueans were given three options: independence, self-government or continuation as a New Zealand territory.  The majority selected self-government and Niue's written constitution[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/nu/legis/num_act/ca1974188/index.html |title=Constitution Act 1974 |publisher=Paclii.org |accessdate=2012-11-20[/tpl] was promulgated as supreme law. Robert Rex, ethnically part European part native, was appointed the first premier, a position he held until his death 18 years later. Rex was the first Niuean to receive a knighthood, in 1984.
In January 2004, Niue was hit by Cyclone Heta, which killed two people and caused extensive damage to the entire island, including wiping out most of the south of the capital, Alofi.

==Politics==

The Niue Constitution Act vests executive authority in Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand and the Governor-General of New Zealand. The Constitution specifies that in everyday practice sovereignty is exercised by the Niue Cabinet of Ministers, comprising the premier and three other ministers. The premier and ministers are members of the Niue Legislative Assembly, the nation's parliament.
The assembly consists of 20 democratically elected members, 14 of whom are elected by the electors of each village constituency, six by all registered voters in all constituencies. Electors must be New Zealand citizens, resident for at least three months, and candidates must be electors and resident for 12 months. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Everyone born in Niue must register on the electoral roll.
The Speaker is elected by the assembly and is the first official to be elected in the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly following an election. The Speaker calls for nominations for premier; the candidate with the most votes from the 20 members is elected. The premier selects three other members to form the Cabinet of Ministers, the executive arm of government. The other two organs of government, following the Westminster model, are the Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary. General elections take place every three years, most recently on 7 May 2011.
The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. There are a High Court and a Court of Appeal, with appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acclawyers.org/resources/niue/ |title=Niuean criminal court system |publisher=Association of Commonwealth Criminal Lawyers |accessdate=2010-12-29[/tpl]

==Geography==

Niue is a 269 km² raised coral atoll in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of Tonga. The geographic co-ordinates are [tpl]Coord|19|03|48|S|169|52|11|W|[/tpl].Jacobson G, Hill PJ (1980) Hydrogeology of a raised coral atoll, Niue Island, South Pacific Ocean. Journal of Australian Geology and Geophysics, 5 271–278. There are three outlying coral reefs within the Exclusive Economic Zone, with no land area:
Besides these, Albert Meyer Reef, (20°53′S, 172°19′W, almost 5 km long and wide, least depth 3 metres, 326 km southwest) is not officially claimed by Niue, and the existence of Haymet Rocks, (26°S, 160°W, 1273 km ESE) is in doubt.
Niue is one of the world's largest coral islands. The terrain consists of steep limestone cliffs along the coast with a central plateau rising to about 60 metres above sea level. A coral reef surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, Alofi. A notable feature is the number of limestone caves found close to the coast.
The island is roughly oval in shape (with a diameter of about 18 kilometres), with two large bays indenting the western coast, Alofi Bay in the centre and Avatele Bay in the south. Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point. A small peninsula, TePā Point (Blowhole Point), is close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest. Most of the population resides close to the west coast, around the capital, and in the northwest.
Some of the soils are geochemically very unusual. They are extremely highly weathered tropical soils, with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides (oxisol) and mercury, and they contain high levels of natural radioactivity. There is almost no uranium, but the radionucleides Th-230 and Pa-231 head the decay chains. This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme weathering of coral and brief sea submergence 120,000 years ago. Endothermal upwelling, by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral, may also contribute.
No adverse health effects from the radioactivity or the other trace elements have been demonstrated, and calculations show that the level of radioactivity is probably much too low to be detected in the population. These unusual soils are very rich in phosphate, but it is not accessible to plants, being in the very insoluble form of iron phosphate, or crandallite. It is thought that similar radioactive soils may exist on Lifou and Mare near New Caledonia, and Rennell in the Solomon Islands, but no other locations are known.
According to the World Health Organization, residents are evidently very susceptible to skin cancer. In 2002 Niue reported 2,482 deaths per 100,000 people – far higher than any other country.World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository, UV radiation: Burden of disease by country, 2002, http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.165?lang=eng
Niue is separated from New Zealand by the International Date Line. The time difference is 23 hours during the Southern Hemisphere winter and 24 hours when New Zealand uses Daylight Saving Time.

===Climate===

The island has a tropical climate, with most rainfall occurring between November and April.

==Defence and foreign affairs==

Niue has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 3 September 1974 when the people endorsed the Constitution in a plebiscite.Masahiro Igarashi, Associated Statehood in International Law, p 167 Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs. Niue's position concerning its external relations is less clear cut. Section 6 of the Niue Constitution Act provides that: "Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue." Section 8 elaborates but still leaves the position unclear:  Effect shall be given to the provisions of sections 6 and 7 external affairs and defence and economic and administrative assistance respectively of this Act, and to any other aspect of the relationship between New Zealand and Niue which may from time to time call for positive co-operation between New Zealand and Niue after consultation between the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Premier of Niue, and in accordance with the policies of their respective Governments; and, if it appears desirable that any provision be made in the law of Niue to carry out these policies, that provision may be made in the manner prescribed in the Constitution, but not otherwise."Section 8, Niue Constitution Act. 
Niue has a representative mission in Wellington, New Zealand. It is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum and a number of regional and international agencies. It is not a member of the United Nations, but is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Ottawa Treaty and the Treaty of Rarotonga. The country is a member state of UNESCO since 26 October 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://erc.unesco.org/portal/UNESCOMemberStates.asp?language=en |title=UNESCO.ORG | Communities | Member States |publisher=Erc.unesco.org |accessdate=2012-11-20[/tpl]
Traditionally, Niue's foreign relations and defence have been regarded as the responsibility of New Zealand. However, in recent years Niue has begun to follow its own foreign relations, independent of New Zealand, in some spheres. It established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on 12 December 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7236560.htm|title= Full text of joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Niue|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=2008-03-06[/tpl] The Joint Communique signed by Niue and China is different in its treatment of the Taiwan question from that agreed by New Zealand and China. New Zealand "acknowledged" China's position on Taiwan but has never expressly agreed with it, but Niue "recognises that there is only one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of China." Niue established diplomatic relations with India on 30 August 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/mystart.php?id=190019985|title=India establishes Diplomatic Relations with Niue|publisher=Ministry of External Affaairs of India|date=4 September 2012|accessdate=2012-09-04[/tpl] Niue's decision to follow independent foreign policy objectives has been the subject of occasional criticism in the New Zealand press.The Hive, Pacific Watch : Has Niue's Constitutional Status Changed?, 16 December 2007
The people of Niue have fought as part of the New Zealand army. In World War I, Niue sent about 200 soldiers as part of the Maori Battalion under New Zealand forces.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8qDVcnZUCZIC&printsec=frontcover&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Tagi tote e loto haaku – My Heart is Crying a Little: Niue Involvement in the Great War 1914–1918|year=2000|author=Margaret Pointer|isbn=978-982-02-0157-6[/tpl]
Niue is not a republic but its full name was listed as "the Republic of Niue" for a number of years on the ISO list of country names (ISO-3166-1). In its newsletter of 14 July 2011, the ISO acknowledged that this was a mistake and the words "the Republic of" were deleted from the ISO list of country names.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_vi-9_fiji-myanmar_and_other_minor_corrections-incl_bulgaria_corrected_2011-07-14_e_.pdf |title=ISO 3166-1 Newsletter VI-9 "Name changes for Fiji, Myanmar as well as other minor corrections" (Published 14 July 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]

==Economy==

Niue's economy is small, with a GDP of NZ$17 million in 2003,[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Niue.php | title = Country Information Paper | contribution = Niue | publisher = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade | date = 8 April 2009 | accessdate = 17 April 2009 | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] or US$10 million at purchasing power parity.[tpl]cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ne.html#Econ|title= Niue | publisher = CIA | work = World Factbook| accessdate= 2008-10-02[/tpl] Most economic activity revolves around the government, as the government has been in charge of organising and managing the affairs of the country since 1974. However, since the economy has reached a stage where state regulation may now give way to the private sector, there is an ongoing effort to develop the private sector. Following Cyclone Heta, the government made a major commitment towards rehabilitating and developing the private sector.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The government allocated $1 million for the private sector, which was spent on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone, and on the construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park. This industrial park is now completed and some businesses are already operating from it. The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Chamber of Commerce, a not for profit organisation providing advisory services to businesses.
Most families grow their own food crops for subsistence and some are sold at the Niue Makete in Alofi, some exported to their families in New Zealand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] The taro is known in Samoa as "talo Niue" and in international markets as pink taro. Niue exports taro to New Zealand. The Niue taro is a natural variety and is very resistant to pests.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
The government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 involving the development of the fisheries and noni (Morinda citrifolia, a small tree with edible fruit). Niue Fish Processors, Ltd is a joint venture company processing fresh fish, mainly tuna (yellow fin, big eye and albacore), for export to the overseas markets. NFP operates out of their state-of-the-art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South, completed and opened in October 2004.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, suggested that Niue might have the world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic,Yamarna loses passion for Niue's uranium, The Age, 2005-09-06. Retrieved 2007-12-24. and in late October the company cancelled its plans to mine, announcing that exploration drilling had identified nothing of commercial value.NIUE: No Mineable Uranium, Says Exploration Company, Pacific Magazine, 2005-11-03. Retrieved 2007-12-24. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company, now called Mining Projects Group Ltd, alleging that their conduct was deceptive and they engaged in insider trading.[tpl]cite press release|url = http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/07-13+ASIC+takes+action+against+directors+of+melbourne+mining+company?openDocument |title=ASIC takes action against directors of Melbourne mining company|publisher=Australian Securities and Investments Commission |date=23 January 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24[/tpl] This case was settled out of court in July 2008, both sides withdrawing their claims.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/08-148+ASIC+discontinues+proceedings+against+directors+of+Melbourne+mining+company?openDocument |title=ASIC discontinues proceedings against directors of Melbourne mining company|publisher=Australian Securities and Investments Commission|date= 4 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-04[/tpl] There is an Australian company that had been issued a mineral prospecting license in the early 1970s which is still very active in doing research and collecting data on potential mineral deposits on Niue.[tpl]Citation needed| date = December 2007[/tpl]
Remittances from expatriates were a major source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s. Continuous migration to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families there, removing the need to send remittances back home. In the late 1990s, PFTAC conducted studies on the balance of payments,[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.pftac.org |title=Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre |publisher=PFTAC |accessdate=2012-11-20[/tpl] which confirmed that Niueans are receiving little remittances but are sending more money overseas, mainly for paying for imported goods and for the education of students sent to study in New Zealand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
Foreign aid, principally from New Zealand, has been Niue's principal source of income.NZAID. Niue Snapshot. http://www.aid.govt.nz/programmes/c-niue.html Although most aid comes from New Zealand it is currently losing NZ$250,000 a year (i.e. reduction in New Zealand funding) meaning the country will come to rely upon its own economy more.
Government expenses consistently exceed revenue to a substantial degree, with aid from New Zealand subsidising public service payrolls. The government generates some revenue, mainly from income tax, import tax and the lease of phone lines. The government briefly flirted with the creation of "offshore banking", but, under pressure from the US Treasury, agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimise tax in countries like New Zealand. Niue provides automated Companies Registration, administered by the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development. The Niue Legislative Assembly passed the Niue Consumption Tax Act in the first week of February 2009, and the 12.5% tax on good and services was expected to come into effect on 1 April 2009. Income tax has been lowered, and import tax may be reset to zero except for "sin" items like tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks. Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35% to 10%, with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity.[tpl]cite news|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ezPJua5q|archivedate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.niuebusinessnews.com/|title=12.5% Niue Consumption Tax from 1 April|date=26 February 2009|publisher=Niue Business News[/tpl]
In 1997, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), under contract with the US Department of Commerce, assigned the Internet Users Society-Niue (IUS-N), a private charity, as manager of the .nu top-level domain on the Internet. IUS-N's charitable purpose was – and continues to be – to use revenue from registering .nu domain names to fund low-cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue. In a letter to ICANN in 2007, IUS-N's independent auditors reported IUS-N had invested US$3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from .nu domain name registration revenue during that period. In 1999, IUS-N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognised that IUS-N managed the .nu ccTLD under IANA's authority and IUS-N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue's private citizens. A newly elected Government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name, including a requirement for IUS-N to make direct payments of compensation to the Government.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06088/677770-96.stm |title=On a tiny island, catchy Web name sparks a battle |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-26 | first=Christopher | last=Rhoads[/tpl] In 2005, a Government-appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report, which found no merit in the government's claims; the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=36393 |title=Niue government criticised over internet stance |publisher= RNZI | date = 13 November 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-26[/tpl] Starting in 2003, IUS-N began installing WiFi connections throughout the capital village of Alofi and in several nearby villages and schools, and has been expanding WiFi coverage into the outer villages since then, making Niue the first WiFi Nation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wifination.org/ |title=WiFi Nation |publisher=WiFi Nation |accessdate=2012-11-20[/tpl] To assure security for Government departments, IUS-N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS-N's satellite Internet link, at no cost.
In 2003, the government made a commitment to develop and expand vanilla production with the support of NZAID. Vanilla has grown wild for a long time. Despite the setback caused by the devastation of Cyclone Heta in early 2004, there was ongoing work on vanilla production. The expansion plan started with the employment of the unemployed or underemployed labour force to help clear land, plant supporting trees and plant vanilla vines. The approach to accessing land includes planning to have each household plant a small plot of around half to [tpl]convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] to be cleared and planted with vanilla vines. There are a lot of planting materials for supporting trees to meet demand for the expansion of vanilla plantations, however there is a severe shortage of vanilla vines for planting stock. There is of course the existing vanilla vines, but cutting them for planting stock will reduce or stop the vanilla from producing beans. At the moment, the focus is in the areas of harvesting and marketing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Niue's economy suffered from the devastating tropical Cyclone Heta on 4 January 2004. The Niue Integrated Strategic Plan (NISP) is the national development plan, setting national priorities for development. Cyclone Heta took away about two years from the implementation of the NISP, while national efforts concentrate on the recovery efforts. In 2008, Niue had yet to fully recover from the devastation of Cyclone Heta.
In the area of trade, Niue is negotiating with other Pacific countries free trade agreements, PICTA Trade in Services (PICTA TIS), Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union, and PACER Plus with Australia and New Zealand. The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser (OCTA) has been set up to assist Niue and other Pacific countries in the negotiation of the PACER Plus.
Niue uses the New Zealand dollar.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is very important to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy, and around 204 square kilometres of the land area are available for agriculture.Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles: Niue, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, January 2009. Subsistence agriculture is very much part of Niue's agriculture, where nearly all the households have plantations of taro.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Pollock |first1=Nancy J. |last2= |first2= |year=1979 |title=Work, wages, and shifting cultivation on Niue |journal=Journal of Pacific Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=132–143 |publisher=Pacific Institute |doi= |url=[/tpl] Taro is a staple food, and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia is an intellectual property of Niue. This is one of the natural taro varieties on Niue, and has a strong resistance to pests.
Tapioca or cassava, yams and kumaras also grow very well,Agriculture Products, CIA World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency. as do different varieties of bananas. Copra, passionfruit and limes dominated exports in the 1970s, but in 2008 vanilla, noni and taro are the main export crops.
Coconut crab, or uga is also part of the food chain; it lives in the forest and coastal areas.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=10675036 |title=Niue: Hunting the uga |author=Eagles, Jim |date=23 September 2010 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]

===Tourism===

Tourism has been identified as one of the three priority economic sectors (the other two are fisheries and agriculture) for economic development. In 2006, estimated visitor expenditure reached $1.6 million making tourism a major export industry for Niue. Niue will continue to receive direct support from the government and overseas donor agencies. The only airport is Niue International Airport. Air New Zealand is the sole airline, flying once a week. In April 2013 a fortnightly flight was added.[tpl]cite web|title=Niue Tourism – Official Website|url=http://www.niueisland.com/getting-niue|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] It took over after Polynesian Airlines stopped flying in November 2005. There is a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to overseas tourists at a sustainable level. Niue is trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry of Niue by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives.

==Media==

Niue has two broadcast media outlets, Television Niue and Radio Sunshine, managed and operated by the Broadcasting Corporation of Niue, and one newspaper, the Niue Star."Le Programme international pour le développement de la communication de l'UNESCO soutient le journal de Niue", UNESCO, 16 July 2002 The internet also provides opportunity for other news services like http://talanet.okakoa.com.

==Information technology==

The first computers were Apple machines brought in by the University of the South Pacific Extension Centre around the early 1980s. The Treasury Department computerised its general ledger in 1986 using NEC personal computers that were IBM PC XT compatible. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] The Census of Households and Population in 1986 was the first to be processed using a personal computer with the assistance of David Marshall, FAO Adviser on Agricultural Statistics, advising UNFPA Demographer Dr Lawrence Lewis and Niue Government Statistician Bill Vakaafi Motufoou to switch from using manual tabulation cards.
