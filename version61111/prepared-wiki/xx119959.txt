Pilsworth is a small area in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. It was most well known locally for homing Park 66, a leisure park that consisted of a cinema, a ten-pin bowling alley, an Asda superstore and a selection of restaurants such as Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito. However following the closure of the cinema most of the other retail and leisure venues followed suit with only Asda, Pizza Hut and Frankie and Bennies remaining.
Pilsworth was anciently a township, but in 1894 it was divided between Bury, Heywood, and Unsworth.'Townships: Pilsworth', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 5 (1911), pp. 169–170. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53021. Retrieved on 30 August 2008.
