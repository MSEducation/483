The Croatian community of Australia has played an important part in the history of Australian football (soccer). Countless clubs have been formed over the years in every state and territory, except for the Northern Territory. At present there are 34 active Croatian football clubs operating in Australia. 
The first Croatian football/sporting club founded in Australia was HSNK Zora (no longer in existence), which was founded in 1931. Currently the oldest surviving Croatian club in Australia is the Adelaide Raiders, founded in 1952 as Adelaide Croatia. The most successful and largest Croatian clubs in Australia are the Melbourne Knights and Sydney United, both clubs played in the National Soccer League for 21 seasons. 
The Croatian community holds the Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament, which has been held annually since 1974. It is the largest 'ethnic' based football cup competition in Australia as well as the oldest soccer competition in Australia, with clubs from all over the country and even New Zealand competing.
