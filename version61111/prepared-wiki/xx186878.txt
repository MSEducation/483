==Synopsis==

Carrier follows the deployment, from May 7, 2005 to November 8, 2005, of the supercarrier USS Nimitz (commanded by then-Captain Ted N. Branch), along with Carrier Air Wing Eleven, from her home port at North Island in Coronado, California to the Persian Gulf during Operation Iraqi Freedom. This character-driven, dramatic non-fiction series includes extensive footage shot aboard as well as interviews with many of the crew about their various experiences, personal concerns and fears.[tpl]cite news|last=Riveracorrea|first=Alexia M.|date=28 April 2008|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36564|title=Nimitz Highlighted in PBS TV Series and Premiere|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl] During the deployment, the Nimitz makes stops in Pearl Harbor, Hong Kong, Guam, Kuala Lumpur, Bahrain, and Perth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/weta/carrier/the_film_episode_descriptions.htm|title= Carrier: About the Film (Episode Descriptions)|publisher=PBS|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Havrilesky|first=Heather|date=24 April 2008|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/review/2008/04/24/carrier/print.html|title=City of lost children|publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]

==Production==

The miniseries was produced by Icon Productions and Carrier Project, Inc. It was conceived by Mitchell Block, co-created by Block and Maro Chermayeff, and directed by Chermayeff. The executive producers were Block and Chermayeff for Carrier Project, Inc. and Mel Gibson, Bruce Davey and Nancy Cotton, for Icon Productions.[tpl]cite web|last=Behrens|first=Steve|date=29 May 2007|url=http://www.current.org/doc/doc0709carrier.shtml|title=Glimpsed for '08: Carrier Miniseries|publisher=Current Publishing Committee|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]
Seventeen filmmakers, including producers Deborah Dickson and Jeff Dupre as well as field producers Matthew Akers, Michelle Smawley and Pamela Yates, shot 1,600 hours of footage to create the series. The series and its companion film were the first documentaries to ever be produced on a U.S. Naval warship on active duty over an entire mission. This was accomplished by David Kennedy (Captain, US Navy, Retired) and Block who spent two years obtaining permission to embed on the Nimitz. In 2008, the series was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography Reality Programming by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in recognition of the work cinematographers Axel Baumann, Ulli Bonnekamp, Mark Brice, Robert Hanna, and Wolfgang Held did on the episode Rights of Passage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/carrier|title=Outstanding Cinematography For Reality Programming - 2008|publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]

==Another Day In Paradise==

This 90-minute film was created from the same pool of footage used for the series. It covers many of the same themes touched on in the series, but narrows the focus to three men: a pilot, a marine, and a sailor. Not only are all three connected by the fact that they are serving on board the same ship, they are all also struggling with various family issues and the different phases of fatherhood. The film was released in the U.S. on June 16, 2008 and was directed by Deborah Dickson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/weta/carrier/the_film_paradise.htm|title=Another Day In Paradise|publisher=PBS|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243922/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt|title=Another Day In Paradise (2008)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl]
