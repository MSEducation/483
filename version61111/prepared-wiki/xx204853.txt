Club-Mate has a relatively low sugar content (50 g/kg), and low calories (20 per 100 ml of beverage), compared to other beverages such as cola and other energy drinks.
Also available is Club-Mate IceT Kraftstoff, which is an ice-tea variant with slightly higher caffeine content (22 mg/100 ml) and with more sugar than original Club-Mate.
Club-Mate is available in 0.33-litre and 0.5-litre bottles.
Three examples of Club-Mate-based mixed drinks are vodka-mate, Tschunk,[tpl]cite web|url=http://tschunk.org?en|title=Tschunk – Hacker's Cocktail with Club Mate[/tpl] a combination of rum and Club-Mate, and Jaeger-Mate, a mix of Jägermeister and Club-Mate common mainly in Berlin.

==History==

Geola Beverages of Dietenhofen, Germany originally formulated and marketed Club-Mate under the name Sekt-Bronte. The drink was only known regionally until acquired by Loscher and marketed under the name Club-Mate.
In December 2007, Loscher marketed a Club-Mate winter edition. The limited-edition Club-Mate consists of the original formula mixed with cardamom, cinnamon, star anise and citrus extract. It is since sold regularly for a limited time during winter.
In 2009, a Club-Mate-styled cola variety was introduced. Unlike other colas, its recipe includes mate-extract.
In 2013, Club-Mate Granat, a Club-Mate variety with additional pomegranate flavor, was introduced.
As of July 2013, the company listed additional countries like Bulgaria and Luxemburg to reach distributors in 40 countries,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clubmate.de/international-resellers.html|title=Manufacturer – Club-Mate / The Icetea|publisher=clubmate.de[/tpl] primarily in Europe, but also Canada,[tpl]cite web|url=http://sharkybeverageco.com/clubmate_en.php|title=Sharky Beverage Co.: CLUB-MATE[/tpl] Australia, Israel, Turkey and South Africa.
