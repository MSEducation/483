The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae Lindl.[tpl]cite book | last=Lindley | first=J | year=1830 | url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31944#page/21/mode/1up| title=Introduction to the Natural System of Botany | location=London | publisher= Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green | pages=xxxvi | nopp=true [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last= Cantino | first= Philip D. | coauthors= James A.

Angiosperms are seed-producing plants like the gymnosperms and can be distinguished from the gymnosperms by a series of synapomorphies (derived characteristics). These characteristics include flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; they are fruiting plants, although more commonly referred to as flowering plants.
The ancestors of flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms around 245–202 million years ago, and the first flowering plants known to exist are from 160 million years ago. They diversified enormously during the Lower Cretaceous and became widespread around 120 million years ago, but replaced conifers as the dominant trees only around 60–100 million years ago.

==Angiosperm derived characteristics==

These distinguishing characteristics taken together have made the angiosperms the most diverse and numerous land plants and the most commercially important group to humans.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] The major exception to the dominance of terrestrial ecosystems by flowering plants is the coniferous forest.

==Evolution==

Fossilized spores suggest that higher plants (embryophytes) have lived on land for at least 475 million years.[tpl]cite journal|last=Edwards|first=D|title=The role of mid-palaeozoic mesofossils in the detection of early bryophytes|journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2000|volume=355|issue=1398|pages=733–755|pmid=10905607|doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0613|pmc=1692787|ref=harv[/tpl] Early land plants reproduced sexually with flagellated, swimming sperm, like the green algae from which they evolved. An adaptation to terrestrialization was the development of upright meiosporangia for dispersal by spores to new habitats. This feature is lacking in the descendants of their nearest algal relatives, the Charophycean green algae. A later terrestrial adaptation took place with retention of the delicate, avascular sexual stage, the gametophyte, within the tissues of the vascular sporophyte. This occurred by spore germination within sporangia rather than spore release, as in non-seed plants. A current example of how this might have happened can be seen in the precocious spore germination in Sellaginella, the spike-moss. The result for the ancestors of angiosperms was enclosing them in a case, the seed. The first seed bearing plants, like the ginkgo, and conifers (such as pines and firs), did not produce flowers. The pollen grains (males) of Ginkgo and cycads produce a pair of flagellated, mobile sperm cells that "swim" down the developing pollen tube to the female and her eggs.
The apparently sudden appearance of nearly modern flowers in the fossil record initially posed such a problem for the theory of evolution that it was called an "abominable mystery" by Charles Darwin.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0308127100 | title = Darwin's abominable mystery: Insights from a supertree of the angiosperms | year = 2004 | last1 = Davies | first1 = T. J. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 101 | issue = 7 | pages = 1904–9 | pmid=14766971 | pmc=357025[/tpl] However, the fossil record has considerably grown since the time of Darwin, and recently discovered angiosperm fossils such as Archaefructus, along with further discoveries of fossil gymnosperms, suggest how angiosperm characteristics may have been acquired in a series of steps. Several groups of extinct gymnosperms, in particular seed ferns, have been proposed as the ancestors of flowering plants, but there is no continuous fossil evidence showing exactly how flowers evolved. Some older fossils, such as the upper Triassic Sanmiguelia, have been suggested. Based on current evidence, some propose that the ancestors of the angiosperms diverged from an unknown group of gymnosperms during the late Triassic (245–202 million years ago). Fossil angiosperm-like pollen from the Middle Triassic, (247.2–242.0 Ma) suggests an older date for their origin.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hochuli |first=P.

The evolution of seed plants and later angiosperms appears to be the result of two distinct rounds of whole genome duplication events.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature09916 | title = Ancestral polyploidy in seed plants and angiosperms | year = 2011 | last1 = Jiao | first1 = Yuannian | last2 = Wickett | first2 = No4rman J. | last3 = Ayyampalayam | first3 = Saravanaraj | last4 = Chanderbali | first4 = André S. | last5 = Landherr | first5 = Lena | last6 = Ralph | first6 = Paula E. | last7 = Tomsho | first7 = Lynn P. | last8 = Hu | first8 = Yi | last9 = Liang | first9 = Haiying |displayauthors=4| journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7345 | pages = 97–100 | pmid = 21478875 [/tpl] These occurred at [tpl]ma|319[/tpl] and [tpl]ma|192[/tpl].

In 2013 flowers encased in amber were found and dated 100 million years before present. The amber had frozen the act of sexual reproduction in the process of taking place. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma.

The great angiosperm radiation, when a great diversity of angiosperms appears in the fossil record, occurred in the mid-Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago). However, a study in 2007 estimated that the division of the five most recent (the genus Ceratophyllum, the family Chloranthaceae, the eudicots, the magnoliids, and the monocots) of the eight main groups occurred around 140 million years ago.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0708072104 | title = Using plastid genome-scale data to resolve enigmatic relationships among basal angiosperms | year = 2007 | last1 = Moore | first1 = M.

By the late Cretaceous, angiosperms appear to have dominated environments formerly occupied by ferns and cycadophytes, but large canopy-forming trees replaced conifers as the dominant trees only close to the end of the Cretaceous 66 million years ago or even later, at the beginning of the Tertiary.[tpl]cite book|author1=David Sadava|author2=H.

It is generally assumed that the function of flowers, from the start, was to involve mobile animals in their reproduction processes. That is, pollen can be scattered even if the flower is not brightly colored or oddly shaped in a way that attracts animals; however, by expending the energy required to create such traits, angiosperms can enlist the aid of animals and, thus, reproduce more efficiently.
Island genetics provides one proposed explanation for the sudden, fully developed appearance of flowering plants. Island genetics is believed to be a common source of speciation in general, especially when it comes to radical adaptations that seem to have required inferior transitional forms. Flowering plants may have evolved in an isolated setting like an island or island chain, where the plants bearing them were able to develop a highly specialized relationship with some specific animal (a wasp, for example). Such a relationship, with a hypothetical wasp carrying pollen from one plant to another much the way fig wasps do today, could result in the development of a high degree of specialization in both the plant(s) and their partners. Note that the wasp example is not incidental; bees, which, it is postulated, evolved specifically due to mutualistic plant relationships, are descended from wasps.
Animals are also involved in the distribution of seeds. Fruit, which is formed by the enlargement of flower parts, is frequently a seed-dispersal tool that attracts animals to eat or otherwise disturb it, incidentally scattering the seeds it contains (see frugivory). Although many such mutualistic relationships remain too fragile to survive competition and to spread widely, flowering proved to be an unusually effective means of reproduction, spreading (whatever its origin) to become the dominant form of land plant life.
Flower ontogeny uses a combination of genes normally responsible for forming new shoots.Age-Old Question On Evolution Of Flowers Answered — 15-Jun-2001 The most primitive flowers probably had a variable number of flower parts, often separate from (but in contact with) each other. The flowers tended to grow in a spiral pattern, to be bisexual (in plants, this means both male and female parts on the same flower), and to be dominated by the ovary (female part). As flowers evolved, some variations developed parts fused together, with a much more specific number and design, and with either specific sexes per flower or plant or at least "ovary-inferior".
Flower evolution continues to the present day; modern flowers have been so profoundly influenced by humans that some of them cannot be pollinated in nature. Many modern domesticated flower species were formerly simple weeds, which sprouted only when the ground was disturbed. Some of them tended to grow with human crops, perhaps already having symbiotic companion plant relationships with them, and the prettiest did not get plucked because of their beauty, developing a dependence upon and special adaptation to human affection.Human Affection Altered Evolution of Flowers — By Robert Roy Britt, LiveScience Senior Writer (posted: 26 May 2005 06:53 am ET)
A few paleontologists have also proposed that flowering plants, or angiosperms, might have evolved due to interactions with dinosaurs. One of the idea's strongest proponents is Robert T. Bakker. He proposes that herbivorous dinosaurs, with their eating habits, provided a selective pressure on plants, for which adaptations either succeeded in deterring or coping with predation by herbivores.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Robert T.|title=Dinosaur Feeding Behaviour and the Origin of Flowering Plants|journal=Nature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|volume=274|date=17 August 1978|pages=661–663|doi=10.1038/274661a0[/tpl]

==Classification==

There are eight groups of living angiosperms:
The exact relationship between these eight groups is not yet clear, although there is agreement that the first three groups to diverge from the ancestral angiosperm were Amborellales, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1614|title=The origin and diversification of angiosperms|author=Pamela S. Soltis and Douglas E. Soltis|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2004|volume=91|pages=1614–1626|doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1614|issue=10|pmid=21652312|ref=harv[/tpl] The term basal angiosperms refers to these three groups. Among the rest, the relationship between the three broadest of these groups (magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots) remains unclear. Some analyses make the magnoliids the first to diverge, others the monocots. Ceratophyllum seems to group with the eudicots rather than with the monocots.

===History of classification===

The botanical term "Angiosperm", from the Ancient Greek αγγείον, angeíon (bottle, vessel) and σπέρμα, (seed), was coined in the form Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom. This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Carolus Linnaeus with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827, when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae, and applied to them the name Gymnosperms. From that time onward, as long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual, reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers, with varying scope, as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants.
In 1851, Hofmeister discovered the changes occurring in the embryo-sac of flowering plants, and determined the correct relationships of these to the Cryptogamia. This fixed the position of Gymnosperms as a class distinct from Dicotyledons, and the term Angiosperm then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than Gymnosperms, including the classes of Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. This is the sense in which the term is used today.
In most taxonomies, the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group. The most popular descriptive name has been Angiospermae (Angiosperms), with Anthophyta ("flowering plants") a second choice. These names are not linked to any rank. The Wettstein system and the Engler system use the name Angiospermae, at the assigned rank of subdivision. The Reveal system treated flowering plants as subdivision Magnoliophytina (Frohne & U. Jensen ex Reveal, Phytologia 79: 70 1996), but later split it to Magnoliopsida, Liliopsida, and Rosopsida. The Takhtajan system and Cronquist system treat this group at the rank of division, leading to the name Magnoliophyta (from the family name Magnoliaceae). The Dahlgren system and Thorne system (1992) treat this group at the rank of class, leading to the name Magnoliopsida. The APG system of 1998, and the later 2003[tpl]cite journal|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=141|pages=399–436|author=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|year=2003|title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG II|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/full/|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x|issue=4|ref=harv[/tpl] and 2009 revisions, treat the flowering plants as a clade called angiosperms without a formal botanical name. However, a formal classification was published alongside the 2009 revision in which the flowering plants form the Subclass Magnoliidae.[ref][tpl]cite journal|last=Chase|first=Mark W.|last2=Reveal|first2=James L.|year=2009|title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=161|issue=2|pages=122–127|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x|lastauthoramp=yes|ref=harv[/tpl]

The internal classification of this group has undergone considerable revision. The Cronquist system, proposed by Arthur Cronquist in 1968 and published in its full form in 1981, is still widely used but is no longer believed to accurately reflect phylogeny. A consensus about how the flowering plants should be arranged has recently begun to emerge through the work of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), which published an influential reclassification of the angiosperms in 1998. Updates incorporating more recent research were published as APG II in 2003 and as APG III in 2009.[tpl]cite journal|last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|year=2009|title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III|journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=161|issue=2|pages=105–121|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122630309/abstract|accessdate=2010-12-10 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=As easy as APG III - Scientists revise the system of classifying flowering plants|publisher=The Linnean Society of London|url=http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=448|accessdate=2009-10-02|date=2009-10-08|ref=harv[/tpl]
Traditionally, the flowering plants are divided into two groups, which in the Cronquist system are called Magnoliopsida (at the rank of class, formed from the family name Magnoliaceae) and Liliopsida (at the rank of class, formed from the family name Liliaceae). Other descriptive names allowed by Article 16 of the ICBN include Dicotyledones or Dicotyledoneae, and Monocotyledones or Monocotyledoneae, which have a long history of use. In English a member of either group may be called a dicotyledon (plural dicotyledons) and monocotyledon (plural monocotyledons), or abbreviated, as dicot (plural dicots) and monocot (plural monocots). These names derive from the observation that the dicots most often have two cotyledons, or embryonic leaves, within each seed. The monocots usually have only one, but the rule is not absolute either way. From a diagnostic point of view, the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly handy nor a reliable character.
Recent studies, as by the APG, show that the monocots form a monophyletic group (clade) but that the dicots do not (they are paraphyletic). Nevertheless, the majority of dicot species do form a monophyletic group, called the eudicots or tricolpates. Of the remaining dicot species, most belong to a third major clade known as the magnoliids, containing about 9,000 species. The rest include a paraphyletic grouping of primitive species known collectively as the basal angiosperms, plus the families Ceratophyllaceae and Chloranthaceae.

===Flowering plant diversity===

The number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000.[tpl]cite journal|author=Thorne, R.

The number of families in APG (1998) was 462. In APG II (2003) it is not settled; at maximum it is 457, but within this number there are 55 optional segregates, so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402. In APG III (2009) there are 415 families.
The diversity of flowering plants is not evenly distributed. Nearly all species belong to the eudicot (75%), monocot (23%), and magnoliid (2%) clades. The remaining 5 clades contain a little over 250 species in total; i.e. less than 0.1% of flowering plant diversity, divided among 9 families.

Of these, the Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Arecaceae, and Iridaceae are monocot families; Piperaceae, Lauraceae, and Annonaceae are magnoliid (acot); the others are eudicot.
