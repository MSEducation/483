[[Sangria]]

CATEGORIES: Cocktails with brandy or cognac, Cocktails with wine

Sangria  is a typical beverage from Spain and Portugal. It normally consists of wine, chopped fruit, a sweetener, and a small amount of added brandy. Chopped fruit can include orange, lemon, lime, apple, peach, melon, berries, pineapple, grape, kiwifruit and mango. A sweetener such as honey, sugar, syrup, or orange juice is added. Instead of brandy, other liquids such as Seltzer, Sprite or 7 Up may be added. The use of the word sangria in labels is now restricted under European law. Only sangria made in Spain and Portugal will be allowed to be sold under that name after the European Parliament green-lighted new wine labeling in January 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-true-sangria-wine-spain-portugal-21527454|title=EU True sangria wine comes from Portugal and Spain|accessdate=January 2014[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Sangria is named after the Spanish and Portuguese word for "bloodletting" because of its typical dark-red color.

==Variations==

Because of the variation in recipes, sangria's alcoholic content can vary greatly, usually from 4 percent up to about 11 percent. The ingredients in sangria vary, particularly in the type of fruit used, the kind of spirits added (if any), and the presence or lack of carbonation.

==Serving==

Sangria is served throughout Spain and Portugal during summer, and in the southern and eastern parts of the countries year-round. In these places it is a popular drink among tourists at bars, pubs and restaurants where it is often served in 1-litre pitchers or other containers large enough to hold a bottle of wine plus the added ingredients. A lid or other strainer for the container helps prevent the fruit and ice cubes from falling into the glass. Among the Spanish and Portuguese, sangria is most typically served at informal social gatherings, much like punch, from a punchbowl. Sangria is often served with a wooden spoon, used to get fruit out of the bottom of the punchbowl or pitcher.  Sangria is also commonly served in Cuba, Peru, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Chile, and Argentina. 
Bottled sangria can be bought in some countries. In the parlance of EU administrators, such products are referred to as "aromatised wines".
Sangria has become popular in the UK and the U.S., with many supermarkets stocking it during summer months. Sangría Señorial, a sangria-flavored non-alcoholic soft drink distributed by Tipp under the Jarritos family, has become popular in the United States.
