The event was established in 1982, and it was originally called the Ostermann-Pokal. It was initially contested over 1,200 metres at Gelsenkirchen. For a period it was held in June, July or August and open to horses aged three or older.
The Ostermann-Pokal was transferred to Cologne and extended to 1,600 metres in 1988. It was run under various sponsored titles after 1999.
The race moved to Frankfurt and became known as the Grosse Hessen Meile in 2007. It was renamed the Frankfurter Meile, switched to April and closed to three-year-olds in 2010.
The event was relocated to Düsseldorf and registered as the Frühjahrs-Meile in 2011. It is currently Germany's first Group race of the year.
