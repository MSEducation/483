==Baseball career==

After interviewing for positions with the Scott Paper Company and Quaker Oats and being encouraged by Rendell to apply for a job with the Philadelphia 76ers, Montgomery reached out to former Phillies ace Robin Roberts, whose son he coached at Germantown, about a job with the baseball club. Montgomery was hired as a member of the Phillies' sales department in 1971, becoming director of sales and marketing in the mid-1970s and the head of the business department by 1980. During the early 1970s, he was also the team's scoreboard operator.
Montgomery, along with co-owner Bill Giles, purchased the team in 1981 for $30,000,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|30000000|1981|r=-6[/tpl][/tpl] today);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/33/2005/LIR.jhtml?passListId=33&passYear=2005&passListType=Misc&uniqueId=335119&datatype=Misc|title=MLB Team Valuations 2005|last=Ozanian|first=Michael K., ed|date=April 7, 2005|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=August 19, 2008[/tpl] Giles, the primary owner, named Montgomery the executive vice president of the team.
