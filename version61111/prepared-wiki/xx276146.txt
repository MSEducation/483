Henry Friedrich Carl Metelmann (25 December 1922 â€“ 24 July 2011) was a German soldier, peace activist and writer who was best known for a book about his experiences growing up in Nazi Germany and in World War II entitled Through Hell for Hitler.
Metelmann was born in Altona near Hamburg where his father was a railway worker and socialist and his mother a committed Christian. His church scout group was incorporated into the Hitler Youth and in 1941 at the age of 18 he joined the Wehrmacht and was posted to the Crimea with the 11th Army. As a tank driver in the 22nd Panzer Division which was virtually destroyed in 1942, he was briefly captured by Red Army soldiers and was involved in the Battle of Stalingrad. He attained the rank of Obergefreiter  and towards the end of war he was posted to the Rhineland and was captured by the Americans.
After spending time in a prisoner of war camp in the United States, in 1948 he settled in England, living in Hampshire and then Godalming, Surrey, working as a railway signalman and then a groundsman at Charterhouse School. He was a member of the Communist Party and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, becoming a committed peace activist. After the publication of Through Hell for Hitler he was the subject of a 60 minute BBC Two Timewatch documentary broadcast on 5 December 2003. He was also interviewed for other television programmes and lectured to young people in schools and colleges.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1033117.ece  Times on Line.
