(A) A target L-amino acid protein (L-protein) for which an L-peptide inhibitor might be available is selected. The D-enantiomer protein (D-protein) is chemically synthesized from the same sequence using D-amino acids. If the target L-protein does not require a chaperone or co-factor to fold, the D-protein will mirror the conformation and properties of the L-protein, but the L-peptide inhibitor will most likely have little binding affinity towards it. (B) The synthesized D-proteins are fixed to a surface and exposed to phage displaying many different L-peptides. (C) L-peptides that do not bind well to the surface are washed away. The remaining L-peptides are sequenced. (D) The D-enantiomer peptides (D-peptides) of the binding L-peptides are synthesized using the same sequence and tested against the L-proteins. The D-peptide will bind the L-protein but most likely not bind the D-protein mirror.]]

==Examples==

An example of peptidomimetics were those designed and synthesized with the purpose of binding to target proteins in order to induce cancer cells into a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Basically, these work by mimicking key interactions that activate apoptotic pathway in the cell.
All healthy cells in metazoa (multi-celled animals) are subject to programmed cell death when they are no longer wanted; but cancer cells have the ability to evade apoptosis and the body's attempts to get rid of them. So peptidomimetics are part of the wide effort by researchers, research labs and institutions to create cures for cancer by means of restoring or activating apoptotic pathways in specific cells. 
An impressive advance in this effort was reported by Loren D. Walensky and colleagues in the 3 September 2004 issue of the journal Science.[tpl]cite journal |author=Walensky LD, Kung AL, Escher I, et al. |title=Activation of apoptosis in vivo by a hydrocarbon-stapled BH3 helix |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689 |pages=1466–70 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15353804 |pmc=1360987 |doi=10.1126/science.1099191 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15353804[/tpl] This team succeeded in reducing a variety of human leukemic cells that had been xenografted (transplanted) into mice. The peptidomimetic that they succeeded in synthesizing, SAHB (stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains) specifically activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the aforementioned malignant cells (see intrinsic and extrinsic inducers of the apoptotic process), without harming healthy tissues.  
Harran and co-workers reported another impressive advance in the same issue of Science.[tpl]cite journal |author=Li L, Thomas RM, Suzuki H, De Brabander JK, Wang X, Harran PG |title=A small molecule Smac mimic potentiates TRAIL- and TNFalpha-mediated cell death |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689 |pages=1471–4 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15353805 |doi=10.1126/science.1098231 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15353805[/tpl] They were able to synthesize a molecule that mimics the proapoptotic protein called SMAC (whose function is described in biochemical execution of apoptosis).
