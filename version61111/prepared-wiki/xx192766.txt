==History==

The Evans house was the home of Wilson Bruce Evans, a prominent African-American abolitionist and early benefactor of Oberlin College, the first college to admit students of color. Evans rose to national attention after his importance in the 1858 Oberlin-Wellington Rescue, one of the events that challenged the controversial Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.[tpl]cite web|title=Wilson Bruce Evans House|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/oh5.htm|publisher=NPS|accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl]  Although Evans was not an outspoken abolitionist like his colleagues Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass, Evans was cited as a man who "put justice above his own safety." The house was a frequent stop for travelers on the Underground Railroad such as Harriet Tubman.[tpl]cite web|title=Evans House|url=http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/discover_history/vignette_details.htm?ID=10750|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl]
