The Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury crossover manufactured by the German manufacturer Porsche since 2002, with North American sales beginning in 2003. Its platform was developed by Porsche and is shared with the Volkswagen Touareg. It is the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The Cayenne's chassis type numbers are as follows: Type 955 (2002–2006), Type 957 (2007–2010), and Type 958 (2011+).
The second-generation Cayenne (Type 958) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March following an online reveal. Although the Cayenne shares its platform, body frame and doors with the similar Volkswagen Touareg, all other aspects of vehicle design, tuning and production are done in-house at Porsche.

==First generation==

The Porsche Cayenne entered the market with mixed anticipation. However, it soon proved that it was the performance vehicle among SUV's and was praised for its excellent handling and powerful engines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/porsche/cayenne/2004/|title=2004 Porsche Cayenne Review|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=2011-04-03[/tpl] The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo.

==Second generation==

The current Porsche Cayenne went on sale around November 2010 as a 2011 model, with an official debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. In preparation for the unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 in order to commence factory retooling for the new model, a process that took 2–3 months.
The first spy photos of the car were posted on the internet on June 5, 2008.[tpl]cite web|last=Fallah |first=Alborz |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/13303/2010-porsche-cayenne-spy-photos/ |title=2010 Porsche Cayenne spy photos |publisher=CarAdvice |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2010-10-03[/tpl]

At the IAA 2005, Porsche announced it would produce a hybrid version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). Two years later, at the IAA 2007, Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain.
Notable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=121999/First |title=Look: Porsche Cayenne Hybrid |publisher=Edmunds |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2010-10-03[/tpl]

Standard safety features include Porsche Stability Management (PSM), adaptive brake lights, LED daytime running lights and rear light clusters, seven airbags, including a driver side knee bag, rain sensing wipers and four-wheel anti-lock brakes. Options include such niceties as a conventional moonroof or a panoramic roof system, Bi-Xenon headlamps, power memory seats, a Bose surround sound system, auto-dimming mirrors, a power liftgate and self-leveling air suspension.
