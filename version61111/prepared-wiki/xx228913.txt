==History==

The name "Aist" was derived from a Slavic river designation, recorded in ancient documents such as the Wilhelmine deed. Upper Austria, as well as many other parts of Europe were, at that time inhabited by Slavic peoples. The river appeared for the first time in 853 in a deed as "Agasta". In 983 it is called "Agesta". The prefix "ag" means "drive" or "fast".Methoden der Namenforschung: Methodologie, Methodik und Praxis Arne Ziegler, Erika Windberger Heidenkummer - 2011 "Die Aist verzweigt sich bei Hohensteg in die westliche Feldaist und in die östliche Waldaist, 1131 (Kopie nach 1356) Westeragist, Waldaigst. ON. (alle im PB Perg, O.-Ö.): Aisthofen, 983-91 (Kopie 1140-50) de Agesta;" The name of Dietmar von Aist (1140–1171), a Minnesänger may be related to the Aist.
In the August 2002 flood, the entire Aist area was devastated.
