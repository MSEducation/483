"Regrets" is a 1991 song recorded by French singer-songwriter Mylène Farmer as duet with musician Jean-Louis Murat. The song was released on 29 July 1989 and was the second single from her third studio album L'Autre.... The music video was shot in a cemetery in Budapest, as the song deals with a love relationship between two people separated by the death of one of them. This ballad became a top three hit in France and was also successful in Belgium.

==Background and writing==

"Regrets" was Farmer's first duet and was scheduled as the second single from the album L'Autre... since the release of "Désenchantée". According to Farmer, the song was "very long to write".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_super_1991_101.jpg |journal=Super |year=1991 |publisher=Aventures et Voyages Editions |page=28 |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] The idea of the duet started from an "irregular but faithful" correspondence through letters between both singers for a year.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Télé Poche |volume=1338 |title=L'énigme Mylène Farmer: voyage au cœur de son enfance |first=Daniel |last=Beaucourt |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_tele-poche_1991_106.jpg |publisher=Mondadori France |place=Issy-les-Moulineaux |language=French |accessdate=12 May 2011[/tpl]Chuberre, 2007, p. 214.Rigal, 2010, p. 63. Murat explained: "One day, in the box of letters, I have a letter of Mylène. She is asking me if I want to sing with her. This letter is not a legend, I received by the post, simply. I do not believe my eyes, she gives me her phone number." Finally Murat called her and they met in Paris.Royer, 2008, p. 228.
Already in 1989, Farmer confessed that she liked Murat's songs and his album Cheyenne Automne, and his way of writing. Thus, according to Murat, Farmer had the idea to record a duet with him,Reval, 2006 and he accepted after listening to an audiotape of "Regrets" in which Farmer sang the two voices — her own and that of Murat trying to make it deeper —  which French author Julien Rigal deemed a "legend".Rigal, 2010, p. 64. At that time, Farmer said in several interviews that she considered Murat as her "brother", her "double", her "twin" and a "poet";[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer, Jean-Louis Murat: Comme des jumeaux |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_star-image_1991_101.jpg |journal=Star Image |first=Véronica |last=Mella |page=56 |date=December 1991 |language=French |accessdate=14 May 1991[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Discographie du single "Regrets" (duo avec Jean-Louis Murat) |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/discographie/singles/single.php?single=regrets |publisher=Sans-logique |first=Julien |last=Rigal |language=French |accessdate=2 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer (en duo avec Jean-Louis Murat) - "Regrets" - Histoire du single |url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/d_s_regrets_histoire.php |publisher=Mylene.net |language=French |accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] she called her encounter with Murat "fantastic".[tpl]cite journal |title=Sur le tournage du clip de Mylène Farmer et Jean-Louis Murat |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_podium_1991_101.jpg |journal=Podium |first=Jérôme |last=Boudault |year=1991 |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] In the media, Murat said almost the same thing on this matter and on other ones,[tpl]cite journal |title=Jean-Louis Murat: "Ma rencontre avec Mylène Farmer" |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/smashhit_1991_04.jpg |first=Marc |last=Potain |year=1991 |journal=Smash Hits |publisher= |place=France |language=French |accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] so much so that the OK magazine established a comparison of the previous interviews given in the press by both singers.[tpl]cite journal |title=Les liaisons dangereuses de Mylène Farmer et Jean-Louis Murat |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_ok_1991_101.jpg |journal=OK |year=1991 |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] However, as noted by author Erwan Chuberre, it remains impossible to really know if the duet was actually motivated by a genuine friendship or by a business strategy, given that the singers wanted to expand their fans base then. In 2004, Murat said in the French newspaper L'Express that "Regrets" helped him to launch his career.Rajon, 2005, pp. 72-73.
The single was released on 29 July 1991 under various formats, including a CD maxi with a pin's in a limited edition.
In 2000, the recording company scheduled to release the live version of "Regrets" as second single from the album Mylenium Tour, and thus sent a promotional VHS to the radio stations. However, given the differences with Farmer who preferred "Pas le temps de vivre" as single and the disappointing sales of the previous live singles "Ainsi soit je..." and "Dessine-moi un mouton", the song was finally not released.Rigal, 2010, p. 124.

==Lyrics and music==

"Regrets" is a love song in which a couple of lovers are answering tenderly and with melancholy, while they are separated by the death of one of them (Farmer).Cachin, 2006, p. 227. Indeed, Instant-Mag said that the song deals with the "very romantic theme of the loss of lover. This loss leaves an unfathomable lack in the one who remains, which invests the world of dreams to regain the lost happiness. Only memories then allow to savour the well-being of the past relationship".Bee, 2006, pp. 308-09. In his analysis of the song, the psychologist Hugues Royer stated: "Death is a subterfuge to make the impossible love. (...) Is not it easier to romanticize a dead person than a living one who, sooner or later, will show the faces of his faults? It is indeed the fear of everyday life that terrifies the advocates of absolute love."Royer, 2008, pp. 282-83. About the lyrics, Farmer explained that she "does not unit the regret with the notions of disappointment and failure, rather these things that we could do, but that we decide not to do".

==Music video==

The video is a Requiem Publishing and Heathcliff SA production whose length is 6:17. Directed by Laurent Boutonnat who also co-authored the screenplay with Farmer, the video was filmed for two days in February 1991 in a Jewish cemetery abandoned in Budapest,Royer, 2008, p. 48,60. with a budget of about 35,000 euros. The train, which leads to the cemetery was turned on only for the video which features, in addition to the two singers, a deer. It was broadcast on television for the first time on 9 September 1991 in Stars 90 on TF1.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Télé Loisirs |date=9 September 1991 |title=Mylène Farmer, Jean-Louis Murat: Un duo inattendu |first=Véronick |last=Dokan |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_tele-loisirs_1991_101.jpg |publisher=Prisma Press |place=Paris |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] In an interview, Murat explained that he had been very surprised by the extreme severity and great professionalism shown by Boutonnat during the video's shooting.
At the beginning of the video, a tram stops in front of the entrance of a snow-covered cemetery. Murat gets off from the tram and pushes the front gate. He walks in the cemetery, passes a deer and meditates at a grave. When he sits, Farmer comes behind him and puts her hands on his eyes. Murat takes Farmer by the hand, then they run, laugh and huddled one against the other in the cemetery. They doze off on a tombstone, and after a last embrace, they say goodbye to each other and split off. The man then gets on the tram and goes away.
According to the analysis made by magazine Instant-Mag, the video is the "metaphor of a past and regretted love".[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bee |first1=Caroline |last2=Brunet |first2=Océane |last3=Thiry |first3=Benjamin |year=2001 |title="Fuck You" Acte 1 |journal=Instant-Mag |publisher=Tear Prod |location=Pantin |language=French |volume=7 |page=6[/tpl] It "shows the indispensable link between two people, as well as the inevitability of this link : we can be attached to the other person, but also lose her". With this video, Farmer "reached the quintessance of elegant sadness which lives in her work". According to this analysis, the character played by Murat would be alive and would try to meet that played by Farmer who would be dead. To this end, the train would represent the transition from these two worlds. The deer who flees would be "the symbol of the woman's essence", and the bunch of thistles would evoke "the desire to provoke unconditional love with the other person". As for the immaculate snow, it would participate in the gloomy atmosphere of the video and would symbolize "a mild but deadly mask which isolates" the two opposing parties.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Bee |first1=Caroline |last2=Brunet |first2=Océane |last3=Thiry |first3=Benjamin |last4=Delayre |first4=Frédéric |year=2004 |title=Amours infirmes |journal=Instant-Mag |publisher=Tear Prod |location=Pantin |language=French |volume=16 |pages=14–17[/tpl] Biographer Bernard Violet said that Boutonnat simply transposed the song in the video by adding his personal aesthetic, in this case, a stylized, little contrasted and overexposed black and white. Anything that expresses reality was filmed at normal speed, while all which describes dream, hope or regret, was filmed at slower speed.Violet, 2004, pp. 139-41.

==Live performances and cover versions==

Concerning the promotion of the single, a sole performance was recorded, on the television show Stars 90, broadcast on TF1 on 7 October 1991.[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer et Jean-Louis Murat |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_cine-tele-revue_101.jpg |journal=Ciné Télé Revue |publisher=Ciné Revue Edition |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Répertoire des chansons — "Regrets" |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/discographie/repertoire-des-chansons.php?chanson=regrets |publisher=Sans-logique |first=Julien |last=Rigal |language=French |accessdate=3 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Mylène Farmer (en duo avec Jean-Louis Murat) - "Regrets" - TV |url=http://www.mylene.net/mylene/d_s_regrets_tv.php |publisher=Mylene.net |language=French |accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl] It showed Farmer, dressed in white, and lying down a staircase, while Murat, dressed in black, was on the top of the stairs. The performance was actually recorded a few days earlier and the recording lasted approximately six hours as Murat, who was not used to sing on television shows at the time, had some difficulties with his lip sync. As compensation, Farmer sent crates of champagne to technicians the next day.Chuberre, 2008, pp. 141-44. Regarding tours, "Regrets" was sung only during the 1990 Mylenium Tour; on this occasion, Farmer performed the song alone, while a red fire was lighted in the hand of the blue statue of the stage.Rigal, 2010, p. 115.[tpl]cite web |title=Mylenium Tour (2000) - Description du live |url=http://www.sans-logique.com/mylene-farmer/live/mylenium-tour/ |publisher=Sans-logique |first=Julien |last=Rigal |language=French |accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
In December 2003, SitolC participated in the national competition "Télé Poche", then in two castings : "Génération Métis" and "Graine de star". On these occasions, he recorded a cover of "Regrets" which was deemed unsuccessful.Cachin, 2006, p. 228.

==Cricital reception==

The song received positive reviews at the time. French magazine Smash Hits said : "We fall in love. (...) "Regrets" is one of the best tracks on the album. (...) This song, with its elegance, deserves to be number 1 on the Top".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer / Jean-Louis Murat, "Regrets" (Polydor) |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/smashhit_1991_03.jpg |journal=Smash Hits |date=March 1991 |publisher= |language=French |accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] Jeune et Jolie deemed the song a "magical and moving duet".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer et Jean-Louis Murat, "Regrets" (Polydor) |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/jeuneetjolie_1991_01.jpg |journal=Jeune et Jolie |year=1991 |publisher=Hachette Filipacchi Médias |language=French |accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] OK ironically stated the song is "desperately distressed of beauty".[tpl]cite journal |title=Mylène Farmer - Jean-Louis Murat, "Regrets" (Polydor) |url=http://www.mylene.net/img_data/ok_1991_01.jpg |journal=OK |year=1991 |publisher= |language=French |accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] According to Elia Habib, an expert of French charts, "Regrets" is "a slow song, which successfully blends the singer's voice of Farmer, which merges into the melody to that of Murat, which stands out and thus puts her partner off the scent".[tpl]cite book |first=Élia |last=Habib |title=Muz hit.tubes |publisher=Alinéa Bis |year=2002 |page=217 |isbn=2-9518832-0-X |language=French[/tpl] In contrast, French television host Marc Toesca, who presented the singles chart, said in the Best magazine that he did not particularly appreciate the song.[tpl]cite journal |title=Blind taste |url=http://mylene.net/presse/presse1991/mylene-farmer_presse_best_1991_101.jpg |first=Emmanuelle |last=Debaussart |journal=Best |place=Paris |year=1991 |language=French |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl]
