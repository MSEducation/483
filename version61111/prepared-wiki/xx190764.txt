CATEGORIES: Grade II listed buildings in Derbyshire

Butterley Hall is an 18th-century country house near Ripley, Derbyshire which now serves as the headquarters of the Derbyshire Constabulary. It is a Grade II listed building
The manor of Butterley was owned by Darley Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.
The two-storey, attic-gabled eight-bayed house was built in the late 18th century for the Home family but was sold in 1790 to Francis Beresford for occupation by Benjamin Outram founder of the Butterley Company. The Hall was the 1803 birthplace of General Sir James Outram of the Indian Army. Following Benjamin Outram's death in 1805 his business partner William Jessop took residence. His grandson, also William Jessop of Butterley Hall, was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1878.
The house later became the head office of the Butterley Company before it was acquired by Derbyshire Police.
