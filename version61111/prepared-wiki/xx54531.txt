==History==

===Formation===

The origins of the Kinsey Institute lie in the scientific research of Indiana University professor and entomologist turned sexuality researcher, Alfred Kinsey.  The 1947 creation of the nonprofit institute, originally named the Institute for Sex Research (ISR), was supported by both Indiana University president Herman B Wells and the Rockefeller Foundation, a major financial backer of Kinsey’s research. The ISR was established to protect and preserve the confidentiality of Kinsey’s data and research materials by creating a secure, permanent repository for them.Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print.; 249
Alfred Kinsey was director of the institute from 1947 until his death in 1956. Since then, the institute has had five directors: Paul Gebhard PhD (1956–1982), June Reinisch PhD (1982–1993), Stephanie Sanders PhD (interim director, 1993–1995), John Bancroft MD (1994–2004), and Julia Heiman PhD (2004–present).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/previous.html |title=previous directors |publisher=Kinseyinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl]

===Kinsey's directorship (1947-1956)===

Shortly after the ISR’s establishment, Kinsey’s interview based research was published in the 1948 bestsellingBullough, Vern L. Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research. New York: Basic Books, 1994. Print ; 181.  book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male.Kinsey, Alfred C., Wardell B. Pomeroy, and Clyde E. Martin. Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 1948. Print. Its companion Sexual Behavior in the Human Female was published 5 years later.Research, Institute for Sex. Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. Philadelphia: Saunders, 1953. Print. These books were popularly known as the “Kinsey Reports”.Gathorne-Hardy, Jonathon. Sex the Measure of All Things : A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000. Print; 274. Also, in 1950, research materials being shipped to the ISR were seized by U.S. Customs thereby resulting in the federal court case U.S. vs. 31 photographs. This case continued on after Kinsey’s death, until it was finally settled in the institute’s favor in 1957.  The ruling granted ISR permission to import erotic materials for research purposes.Stevens, Kenneth R. "United States V. 31 Photographs: Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey and Obscenity Law." Indiana Magazine of History 71.4 (1975): 299-318. Print ; 299-300.

===Gebhard's directorship (1956-1982)===

==Library, archive, and art gallery==

===Library, archive, and art collection===

The Kinsey Institute is considered to have one of the largest collections of library, archival, and art materials pertaining to sex, gender, and reproduction.Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research. New York: Harper & Row, 1972. Print; 458.  The current collection began as Alfred Kinsey’s private research collection.  To ensure its protection, Kinsey sold it to the institute for one dollar.Harter, Margaret H., and June Machover Reinish. "Kinsey, Alfred C." Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia. Eds. Bullough, Bonnie and Vern Bullough. New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1994. Print; 335. Over the years, neither state nor grant money have been used to build collections.  Instead the institute uses funds obtained from book royalties and fees in addition to donations. A sampling of the broad range of items housed at the institute includes scientific and popular books, pulp magazines, publications from both sexual and anti-sexual organizations, data from Kinsey’s original interview project, films, photos, erotic objects, and artwork by both professionals and amateurs.  Items from all over the world are represented in the collection and some objects even date back to the pre-Columbian era.Pomeroy, Wardell B. Dr. Kinsey and the Insititute for Sex Research. New York: Harper & Row, 1972. Print; 458-460.  However, materials do not circulate and must be studied within the reading room which is open to scholars, professionals, university faculty, and students over eighteen who are researching topics pertaining to sexuality, gender, and reproduction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/use.html |title=Library & Special Collections] |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl]  Due to the highly specialized nature of the collection, holdings are described using subject headings created by The Kinsey Institute and organized using a modified version of the Dewey Decimal System.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/library/kicat-guide.html#what |title=Library & Special Collections] |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15[/tpl]
