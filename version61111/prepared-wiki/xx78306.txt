[[Flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]

CATEGORIES: National symbols of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines culture, National flags, Canadian pale

The flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was adopted on October 21, 1985. It is composed of three vertical bands of blue, yellow and green (the yellow band forming a Canadian pale being half the width of the flag) with three diamonds centered in the yellow band and arranged in a V which stands for Vincent. These diamonds recall Saint Vincent as the "gems of the Antilles". Blue represents the tropical sky and the crystal waters, yellow stands for the golden Grenadine sands, and green stands for the islands' lush vegetation. The diamonds are set low on the yellow band, recalling the nation's location in the Antilles.
The previous flags had a realistic breadfuit leaf, where the gems are now, emblazoned with the coat of arms of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
