After graduation from high school, in 1978 he aimed to enter Musashino Academia Musicae, a conservatory in Tokyo. However, he had never received a formal musical education, and because his father had collapsed when Ken was in junior high school and was unable to work there was difficulty in finding the money for tuition. In part because of these problems, Watanabe gave up entering the conservatory.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
