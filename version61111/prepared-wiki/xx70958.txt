In a 2008 interview, he said: "It was just part of my journey...I think my journey was to spend a while away from acting. And I never lost contact with it - watching movies, reading about it ... so I didn't feel I missed it."[tpl]cite web|author=Jeeves |url=http://tweedlandthegentlemansclub.blogspot.com/2010/11/james-fox.html |title="Tweedland" The Gentlemen's club: JAMES FOX |publisher=Tweedlandthegentlemansclub.blogspot.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-05-13[/tpl]
