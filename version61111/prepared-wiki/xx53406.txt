Christian Bök (born August 10, 1966 in Toronto, Canada) is an experimental Canadian poet. He is the author of Eunoia, which won the Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize, and which has been said to be "Canada's best-selling poetry book ever."Ed Park, "Crystal Method," Village Voice, Dec. 16, 2003.

==Life and work==

He was born "Christian Book", but changed his last name "to avoid unseemly confusion with the Bible."
He began writing seriously in his early twenties, while earning his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Carleton University in Ottawa. He returned to Toronto in the early 1990s to study for a Ph.D. in English literature at York University, where he encountered a burgeoning literary community that included Steve McCaffery, Christopher Dewdney, and Darren Wershler-Henry. [tpl]As of|2005[/tpl] he teaches at the University of Calgary.The Xenotext Experiment: An Interview with Christian Bök
In 1994, Bök published Crystallography, "a pataphysical encyclopaedia that misreads the language of poetics through the conceits of geology." The Village Voice said of it: "Bök's concise reflections on mirrors, fractals, stones, and ice diabolically change the way you think about language — his, yours — so that what begins as description suddenly seems indistinguishable from the thing itself." Crystallography was reissued in 2003, and was  nominated for a Gerald Lampert Award.
Bök is a sound poet and has performed an extremely condensed version of the "Ursonate" by Kurt Schwitters. He has created conceptual art, making artist's books from Rubik's Cubes and Lego bricks. He has also worked in science-fiction television by constructing artistic languages for Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict and Peter Benchley's Amazon.

===Eunoia===

Bök is most famous for Eunoia (2001), a book which took him seven years to write. Eunoia consists of univocalics: The book uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters. In the book's main part, each chapter used just a single vowel, producing sentences such as this: “Enfettered, these sentences repress free speech.”[tpl]cite web|last=Shelburne |first=Curtis K. |url=http://www.cnjonline.com/articles/love_30557___article.html/writes_one.html |title=God writes his love in one word | love, writes, one - Faith and Lifestyles - Clovis News Journal |publisher=Cnjonline.com |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2012-01-14[/tpl] Bök believes "his book proves that each vowel has its own personality, and demonstrates the flexibility of the English language."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7697000/7697762.stm |title=BBC - Today |work=BBC News |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2012-01-14[/tpl] In preparation for the project, Bök read the dictionary a total of five times, compiling an exhaustive list of vocabulary; Bök aimed to use almost all of these words during his work.

===The Xenotext experiment===

On April 4, 2011 Bök announced a significant break-through in his 9-year project to engineer "a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/cprc/news/Bok_at_BBK |title=Contemporary Poetics Research Centre: Christian Bök - 'The Xenotext: A Progress Report' (Thursday 5 May 2011) |publisher=Bbk.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol5-2/editorial.asp |title=The Xenotext Experiment |publisher=Law.ed.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14[/tpl] On the previous day (April 3) Bök said he [tpl]quote|"received confirmation from the laboratory at the University of Calgary that my poetic cipher, gene X-P13, has in fact caused E. coli to fluoresce red in our test-runs—meaning that, when implanted in the genome of this bacterium, my poem (which begins “any style of life/ is prim…”) does in fact cause the bacterium to write, in response, its own poem (which begins “the faery is rosy/ of glow…”)."[tpl]cite web|author=By Christian Bök |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2011/04/the-xenotext-works/ |title=The Xenotext Works : Christian Bök : Harriet the Blog |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |date=2011-04-03 |accessdate=2012-01-14[/tpl][/tpl]
