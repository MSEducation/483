Fort Glover was a fort that existed from 1775 to 1776, 1813-1815, 1863-1865, and 1898 in Marblehead, Massachusetts. It was rebuilt in 1898, and abandoned after that. After this point, it gained the nickname, Cow Fort, after the cattle that resided within its former walls. The fort was demolished in 1917, although a portion of the park became part of Seaside Park in 1895.[tpl]cite web|title=Massachusetts|url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/East/ma.html#glover|publisher=American Forts Network|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
