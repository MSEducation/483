Captured is a platform game for the Commodore 64 from 1986, developed by the first Scandinavian company developing games, Greve Graphics, and published by American Action.

The graphics were by Nils Hård.

==Plot==

Soldier One wakes up with a throbbing bump on the back of his head, finding himself in a mysterious base full of dangerous booby-traps and beasts. He notices dried blood on his right hand which appears not to be his own. He finds a note in his pocket which says "find the security code to the door to escape but beware of the beasts!"

==Objective==

The task of Soldier One is to escape from this large building. He finds pieces of the security code in a room called "The Chamber of Death". He must protect himself from the meanies but grub the digits.[tpl]Clarify me|date=February 2009[/tpl]

==Controls==

The screen displays the soldier walking from left to right and from down to the upper levels[tpl]Clarify me|date=February 2009[/tpl]. Soldier One is directed with a joystick. He jumps by the player pressing the fire button. To fire a laser-power, which annihilates all enemies on-screen, the player must position Soldier One straight forward, pull the joystick down, and press fire. To jump upwards, Soldier One must be placed straight and the fire button pressed.

==Music==

The music for Captured was composed by Lars Hard, written directly in 6502 Assembly Language. It has an unusual tempo (5\4) and structure, resulting in a number of remixes based on the original composition.http://remix.kwed.org/download.php/5168/Dr%20Future%20-%20Captured%20%28Its%20A%20Machines%20World%29.mp3http://remix.kwed.org/download.php/2692/Monty%20-%20Captured.mp3

==Response==

The game was quite famous in Europe in the downing era of the Commodore 64; there was also a version also for the Commodore 128. The game was so popular that people applied nicknames: in England it was "Leaping Man", in Italy "L'Uomo Che Salta" (again the Jumping Man).
