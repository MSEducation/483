La Mare de Carteret Secondary School is a post-11 secondary school on the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, located in the Castel parish.
The school caters for pupils from the age of eleven to sixteen. As of September 2008 La Mare de Carteret Secondary School has been renamed Le Mare de Carteret High School and year 10 pupils previously attending St Peter Port are now among the upper year students. The eldest year (year 11), who previously wore green jumpers in order to distinguish them from the younger years, now wear black jumpers with the new school logo, as do the merged year 10 pupils. However, in order to properly distinguish the two, year 11s also wear badges. 
When the new school year started in September 2009, the last remaining students of St. Peter Port Secondary school started Key Stage 4 at La Mare de Carteret High School. Joining them was the previous Headmaster of St. Peter Port Secondary school, who took the place of the former Headmaster of La Mare de Carteret High School, Mr. Phillip White.
In February 2012, Mr. Ken Wheeler retired from his position as Headmaster. Mr. Geoff Cowley who initially was brought in as School Improvement Adviser became Interim Headmaster. However, as of April 16th 2012 The New Headmistress is Mrs. Vicky Godley.
