The Pepsi Centre is formally known as the Canada Games Centre. The facility is a 3,100-seat multi-purpose arena in Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It was home to the ice hockey, figure skating, judo, and squash events of the 1999 Canada Winter Games. The facility is currently being operated by Grenfell Campus, Memorial University through the Western Sports and Entertainment Board. The Pepsi Centre was the home arena of the Corner Brook Royals before they moved to Deer Lake.
On September 11, 2005, the Pepsi Centre played host to an exhibition game of the then newly formed St. John's Fog Devils (later the Montreal Junior Hockey Club, and now the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada) of the QMJHL versus the Ottawa 67's of the OHL. The arena played host to an AHL exhibition game between the St. John's IceCaps and the Syracuse Crunch on October 4, 2012, in Game 1 of the Mary Brown's Cup three-game series sponsored by Mary Brown's Famous Chicken & Taters, coinciding with the IceCaps' training camp for the 2012-13 AHL season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stjohnsicecaps.com/article/corner-brook-to-host-icecaps-2012-ahl-training-camp/|author=St. John's IceCaps|title=Corner Brook to Host IceCaps' 2012 AHL Training Camp|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=August 26, 2012[/tpl]
