==History==

The Blackall-Tambo Region began as two separate entities: the Shire of Blackall and the Shire of Tambo.
The entire Region was originally part of Kargoolnah Division, which was created on 11 November 1879 as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. On 20 May 1880, a municipal Borough of Blackall was created to cover the town and its first councillors were elected in July 1880. On 1 January 1881, a new Tambo Division was proclaimed and excised from Kargoolnah.
With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, Kargoolnah became a Shire on 31 March 1903, while Blackall became a Town. The latter was abolished on 7 November 1931 and became Division 3 of the Kargoolnah Shire, which had in the meantime shrunk to include only the Blackall region. On 19 November 1932, after representations to the State Government, Kargoolnah was officially renamed Blackall.
In July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that the two areas amalgamate. Both councils opposed the amalgamation.[tpl]cite book|title=Report of the Local Government Reform Commission|author=Queensland Local Government Reform Commission|volume=2|pages=37â€“41|isbn=1-921057-11-4|date=July 2007|url=http://www.dlgp.qld.gov.au/resources/map/reform/blackall-rationale.pdf|accessdate=3 June 2010[/tpl] On 15 March 2008, the two Shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.
