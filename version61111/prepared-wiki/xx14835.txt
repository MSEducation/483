The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. With some males exceeding [tpl]convert|250|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] in weight,[tpl]Cite book|last=Nowak|first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9[/tpl] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times. Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30–50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.
Lions live for 10–14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity.[tpl]Cite book|last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian South Africa |location=Johannesburg |page=231|isbn= 0-86954-122-6[/tpl] They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they scavenge as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are primarily nocturnal, although bordering on crepuscularLions' nocturnal chorus.

Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic subspecies.

==Etymology==

The lion's name, similar in many Romance languages, is derived from the Latin [tpl]lang|la|leo[/tpl],[tpl]Cite book| author=Simpson, D.P. | title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher=Cassell Ltd. | year=1979 | edition=5th | location=London | page=342 | isbn=0-304-52257-0[/tpl] and the Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|λέων[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|grc-Latn|leon[/tpl]).[tpl]Cite book| author=Liddell, Henry George Scott, Robert | year=1980 | title=A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition)|page=411 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-19-910207-4[/tpl] The Hebrew word [tpl]lang|he|לָבִיא[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|he-Latn|lavi[/tpl]) may also be related.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia| title=Lion|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Simpson, John; Weiner, Edmund| year=1989 |edition= 2nd| location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press| isbn=0-19-861186-2[/tpl] It was one of the species originally described by Linnaeus, who gave it the name Felis leo, in his eighteenth-century work, Systema Naturae.[tpl]Cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |page=41 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726936 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |language=Latin |volume=1 |edition=10th[/tpl]

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the jaguar, and the leopard. P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region.[tpl]Cite journal|last1= Yamaguchi |first1=Nobuyuki| last2=Cooper |first2=Alan |last3=Werdelin |first3= Lars |last4= MacDonald |first4=David W.|date=August 2004 |title= Evolution of the mane and group-living in the lion (Panthera leo): a review|journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=263 |issue=4 |pages=329–42 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005242 [/tpl] It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy.

===Subspecies===

Traditionally, 12 recent subspecies of lion were recognised, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Grisham | first= Jack | editor-first = Catherine E | editor-last = Bell |title=Lion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=2: G–P |year=2001 | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chofago |isbn=1-57958-174-9 |pages=733–39[/tpl] Today, only eight subspecies are usually accepted,[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = Joachim |year= 2004 |title= Molecular phylogeny of the extinct cave lion Panthera leo spelaea | journal= Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | pmid= 15012963 | volume = 30 | issue =3 |pages=841–49 |doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.020 | url= http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Biologie/Anthropologie/MolA/Download/Burger%202004.pdf | type = fulltext | accessdate= 20 September 2007 | last3 = Loreille | first3 = Odile | last4 = Hemmer | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Eriksson | first5 = Torsten | last6 = Götherström | first6 = Anders | last7 = Hiller | first7 = Jennifer | last8 = Collins | first8 = Matthew J. | last9 = Wess | first9 = Timothy | last2 = Rosendahl | first2 = Wilfried | last10 = Alt | first10 = Kurt W.[/tpl] although one of these, the Cape lion, formerly described as Panthera leo melanochaita, is probably invalid.  Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many. While the status of the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) as a subspecies is generally accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies, therefore all sub-Saharan lions sometimes have been considered a single subspecies, however, a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, Western African lions are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa and a subsequent recolonization of these parts from Asia.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Bertola | year = 2011 | title = Genetic diversity, evolutionary history and implications for conservation of the lion (Panthera leo) in West and Central Africa | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1356–67 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02500.x | first1 = L.

[/tpl]  Previous studies, which were focused mainly on lions from eastern and southern parts of Africa, already showed these can be possibly divided in two main clades: one to the west of the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions from Tsavo in eastern Kenya are much closer genetically to lions in Transvaal (South Africa), than to those in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Dubach | first =Jean| coauthors= et al |date=January 2005 |title = Molecular genetic variation across the southern and eastern geographic ranges of the African lion, Panthera leo |journal= Conservation Genetics | volume =6 |issue=1 |pages=15–24 |doi = 10.1007/s10592-004-7729-6[/tpl] Another study revealed there are three major types of lions, one North African–Asian, one southern African and one middle African.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Barnett | first1 = Ross | last2 = Yamaguchi | first2 = Nobuyuki | last3 = Barnes | first3 = Ian | last4 = Cooper | first4 = Alan | year = 2006 | title= The origin, current diversity and future conservation of the modern lion (Panthera leo) | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |pmid= 16901830|volume = 273 |issue= 1598 | pmc = 1635511 | pages = 2119–25 | doi= 10.1098/rspb.2006.3555 | url = http://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/publications/papers/Barnett%20PRS%20lions.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate= 4 September 2007[/tpl] Conversely, Per Christiansen found that using skull morphology allowed him to identify the subspecies krugeri, nubica, persica, and senegalensis, while there was overlap between bleyenberghi with senegalensis and krugeri. The Asiatic lion persica was the most distinctive, and the Cape lion had characteristics allying it more with P. l. persica than the other sub-Saharan lions. He had analysed 58 lion skulls in three European museums.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Christiansen |first=Per | year = 2008 |title=On the distinctiveness of the Cape lion (Panthera leo melanochaita Smith, 1842), and a possible new specimen from the Zoological Museum, Copenhagen | journal= Mammalian Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–65 |doi = 10.1016/j.mambio.2007.06.003[/tpl]
The majority of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes which are extinct in the wild, and might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. It is believed that those lions, imported to Europe before the middle of the nineteenth century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Barnett | first1 = Ross | last2 = Yamaguchi | first2 = Nobuyuki | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = Beth | last4 = Nijman | first4 = Vincent | year = 2007 | title = Using ancient DNA techniques to identify the origin of unprovenanced museum specimens, as illustrated by the identification of a 19th century lion from Amsterdam | url = http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/get-pdf?c=ctz;idno=7602a02 | journal = Contributions to Zoology | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 87–94[/tpl]

===Hybrids===

Lions have been known to breed with tigers (most often the Siberian and Bengal subspecies) to create hybrids called ligers and tiglons (or tigons).[tpl]Cite book|last=Guggisberg |first=Charles Albert Walter |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=1975 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-8008-8324-1 [/tpl] They also have been crossed with leopards to produce leopons,[tpl]Cite book|author=Doi H, Reynolds B |title=The Story of Leopons |year=1967 |publisher=Putnam |location=New York |oclc=469041 [/tpl] and jaguars to produce jaglions. The marozi is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.
The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow them, their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.
Ligers are much bigger than normal lions, typically [tpl]convert|3.0|to|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and can weigh [tpl]convert|360|to|450|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[tpl]Cite book| author = Heptner, V.G; Sludskii, A.A.| title = Mammals of the Soviet Union, Volume II, Part 2 | year = 1992| isbn = 90-04-08876-8 | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden u.a.[/tpl] Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown rosettes (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.
Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism – that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5 mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail – the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5½ months of age and is readily identifiable at 7 months.Schaller, p. 28.
The size of adult lions varies across their range with those from the southern African populations in Rhodesia, Kalahari and Kruger Park averaging around [tpl]convert|190|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|130|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in males and females respectively compared to [tpl]convert|175|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] of male and female lions from East Africa.[tpl]cite journal|last=Smuts|first=G.L.|coauthors=Robinson, G.A. and Whyte, I.J.|title=Comparative growth of wild male and female lions (Panthera leo)|journal=Journal of Zoology|year=1980|volume=190|issue=3|pages=365–373|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1980.tb01433.x/abstract[/tpl] Reported body measurements in males are head-body lengths ranging from [tpl]convert|170|to|250|cm|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl], tail lengths of [tpl]convert|90|–|105|cm|ftin|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Mane===

The mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It makes the lion appear larger, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids the lion during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor in Africa, the spotted hyena.[ref]

Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favors males with the densest, darkest mane.[tpl]cite web| last=Trivedi | first =Bijal P. | title=Female Lions Prefer Dark-Maned Males, Study Finds | work=National Geographic News | publisher=National Geographic | date=22 August 2002 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0822_020822_TVlion.html| accessdate=1 September 2007[/tpl] Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.[tpl]Cite journal|last=West |first=Peyton M. |coauthors=Packer, Craig |date=August 2002 |title=Sexual Selection, Temperature, and the Lion's Mane |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages= 1339–43 |doi=10.1126/science.1073257 |pmid=12193785[/tpl] In prides including a coalition of two or three males, it is possible that lionesses solicit mating more actively with the males who are more heavily maned.
Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the colour and size of a lion's mane, such as the ambient temperature. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Barnett |first=Ross |coauthors=Nobuyuki Yamaguchi, Ian Barnes and Alan Cooper |date=August 2006 |title=Lost populations and preserving genetic diversity in the lion Panthera leo: Implications for its ex situ conservation |journal=Conservation Genetics |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=507–14 |doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9062-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last=Yamaguchi |first=Nobuyuki |coauthors=B.

===White lions===

The white lion is not a distinct subspecies, but a special morph with a genetic condition, leucism, that causes paler colouration akin to that of the white tiger; the condition is similar to melanism, which causes black panthers. They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion (Panthera leo krugeri) individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in captivity, where breeders deliberately select them. The unusual cream colour of their coats is due to a recessive gene.[tpl]Cite book|last=McBride |first=Chris |title=The White Lions of Timbavati |year=1977 |publisher=E.

==Behaviour==

Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20 hours per day.Schaller, p. 122. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating.Schaller, pp. 120–21.

===Group organization===

Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature. The lion is a predatory carnivore with two types of social organization. Some lions are residents, living in groups centering around related lionesses, called prides.Schaller, p. 33. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females;Schaller, p. 37. membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses,Schaller, p. 39. although some females do leave and become nomadic.Schaller, p. 44. The pride usually consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a coalition if more than one) who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two, but may increase to four and decrease again over time. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organizational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males, as a rule, live at least some portion of their lives as nomads and some are never able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.
The area a pride occupies is called a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake, however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.
Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride. They are more effective hunters as they are smaller, swifter and more agile than the males, and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills,Schaller, p. 133. although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible. If near the conclusion of the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses, but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves.
Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build.Join the Pride. Lion Conservation Fund.

===Hunting and diet===

The lioness is the one who does the hunting for the pride. The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches its young while waiting for the lionesses to return from the hunt. Typically, several lionesses work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by strangulation,[tpl]cite web | title = About lions—Ecology and behaviour | first = Gus | last = Mills | publisher = African Lion Working Group | url= http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2007[/tpl] which can cause cerebral ischemia or asphyxia (which results in hypoxemic, or "general", hypoxia). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia).
Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina – for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight.Schaller, p. 248. Thus, they only run fast in short bursts,Schaller, pp. 247–48. and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.Schaller, p. 237. They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] or less.
The prey consists mainly of medium-sized mammals, with a preference for wildebeest, zebras, buffalo, and warthogs in Africa and nilgai, wild boar, and several deer species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include ungulates weighing between [tpl]convert|50|and|300|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] such as kudu, hartebeest, gemsbok, and eland. Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as Thomson's gazelle or springbok. Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male giraffes due to the danger of injury.
Extensive statistics collected over various studies show that lions normally feed on mammals in the range [tpl]convert|190|–|550|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. In Africa, wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the Serengeti) followed by zebra.[tpl]Cite book|isbn=88-8095-752-X| title = The Art of Being a Lion | page = 186 | first1 = Christine |  last1 = Denis-Huot | first2 = Michel | last2 = Denis-Huot | publisher = Friedman/Fairfax | year = 2002[/tpl]  Most adult hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, and smaller gazelles, impala, and other agile antelopes are generally excluded. However, giraffes and buffalos are often taken in certain regions. For instance, in Kruger National Park, giraffes are regularly hunted.[tpl]Cite journal| last =Pienaar | first = U de V |year= 1969 |title= Predator–prey relationships amongst the larger mammals of the Kruger National Park |journal=Koedoe |volume=12 |pages=108–76| doi =10.4102/koedoe.v12i1.753[/tpl] In Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet,[tpl]Cite journal | title = Among the Elephants | first1 = Iain | last1 = Douglas-Hamilton | first2 = Oria | last2 = Douglas-Hamilton | year = 1975 [/tpl] due to the high number density of buffaloes.

Lions also attack domestic livestock; in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Lions are capable of killing other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, and wild dogs, though (unlike most felids) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them. They also scavenge animals either dead from natural causes (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress.Schaller, p. 213.  A lion may gorge itself and eat up to [tpl]convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] in one sitting;[tpl]Cite book| last= Guggisberg|first= Charles Albert Walter| title = Simba: the life of the lion. |year=1961 |publisher=Howard Timmins |location=Cape Town[/tpl] if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more. On a hot day, the pride may retreat to shade leaving a male or two to stand guard.Schaller, pp. 270–76. An adult lioness requires an average of about [tpl]convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] of meat per day, a male about [tpl]convert|7|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Schaller, p. 276.
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Stander | first = PE | title= Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445–54|year=1992|doi = 10.1007/BF00170175[/tpl] There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush. Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.Schaller, p. 153.

====Predator competition====

Lions and spotted hyenas occupy the same ecological niche (and hence compete) where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.[tpl]cite journal| url = http://www.zbs.bialowieza.pl/g2/pdf/1598.pdf | format = PDF | title= Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and degree of dietary overlap with the lion (Panthera leo)| last =Hayward | first = Matt W.| journal =Journal of Zoology |year= 2006|volume= 270|pages= 606–14 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00183[/tpl] Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, whether there is food or not. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the Ngorongoro crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate.[tpl]Cite book |chapter = Interactions between Hyenas and other Carnivorous Animals | first = Hans | last = Kruuk | title = The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | place = Chicago | year = 1972|isbn=0-226-45508-4 [/tpl] On the other hand, in Northern Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed: hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills: they obtain food from 63% of all lion kills.[tpl]Cite book | title = Carnivore Conservation |edition=1 |asin=052166232X |editor1-first=John L. |editor1-last=Gittleman |editor2-first=Stephan M. |editor2-last=Funk |editor3-first=David W. |editor3-last=Macdonald |editor4-first=Robert K. |editor4-last=Wayne| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2001|isbn=978-0-521-66232-1|displayeditors=4[/tpl] When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of [tpl]convert|30|–|100|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] until the lions have finished,Schaller, p. 272. but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions, and even force the lions off a kill. The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason.Schaller, p. 273-274.[tpl]cite video|people=Joubert, Dereck and Joubert, Beverley|title= Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas |medium=DVD | publisher = National Geographic|year= 1992[/tpl] Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha.

The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions.
Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators.[tpl]cite journal| last1 =O'Brien | first1 = Stephen J | last2 = Wildt | first2 = David E | last3 = Bush | first3 = Mitchell|year= 1986| title= The Cheetah in Genetic Peril| format = PDF | journal = Scientific American|issue= 254|pages= 68–76| url= http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/05_library/5_3_publications/N_and_O/OBrien_et_al_1986_Cheetah_in_genetic_peril.pdf[/tpl] Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90% of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush. Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.Schaller, p. 293. Similarly, lions dominate African wild dogs, not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant.[tpl]cite journal | title = Conserving the African wild dog Lycaon pictus. I.

The Nile crocodile is the only sympatric predator (besides humans) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other.

====Man-eating====

While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; one well-publicised case includes the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898.[tpl]cite book | author = Patterson, Bruce D. | year = 2004 | title = The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters  | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-136333-5[/tpl] The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J. Neiburger, Ellis J.; Kasiki, Samuel M. |date=February 2003 |title=Tooth Breakage and Dental Disease as Causes of Carnivore–Human Conflicts |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=190–96|doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2003)0842.0.CO;2[/tpl]
In their analysis of Tsavo and general man-eating, Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating, but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.
The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period – a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near Selous National Park in Rufiji District and in Lindi Province near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |date=August 2005 |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927–28 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828[/tpl] Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon (when there was less moonlight) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people.[tpl]cite journal | title=Fear of Darkness, the Full Moon and the Nocturnal Ecology of African Lions | author=Packer, C | journal=PLoS ONE |date=July 2011 | volume=6 | issue=7 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022285 | coauthors=Swanson A, Ikanda D, Kushnir H | editor1-last=Rands | editor1-first=Sean A. | pages=e22285[/tpl]
Author Robert R. Frump wrote in The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.[tpl]Cite book|last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=1-59228-892-8[/tpl]
Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.
A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35 people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region.[tpl]Cite news|title=Toothache 'made lion eat humans' |author=Dickinson, Daniel |date=19 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3756180.stm |accessdate=25 January 2011[/tpl] Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess underneath a molar which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing."[tpl]Cite journal|last=Baldus |first=R |date=March 2006 |title=A man-eating lion (Panthera leo) from Tanzania with a toothache |journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research |volume=52 |issue= 1 |pages= 59–62|doi=10.1007/s10344-005-0008-0[/tpl] GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.
The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but incidents in the early 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then Tanganyika (now Tanzania). George Rushby, game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in what is now Njombe district.[tpl]Cite book|author=Rushby, George.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.Schaller, p. 29. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous.Schaller, p. 174. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.[tpl]Cite book|last=Asdell |first=Sydney A. |title=Patterns of mammalian reproduction |year=1993|origyear= 1964 |publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-1753-5[/tpl] A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat;Schaller, p. 142. during a mating bout, which could last several days, the couple copulates twenty to forty times a day, often forgoing eating. Lions reproduce very well in captivity.
The average gestation period is around 110 days, the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept.Scott, p. 45. The cubs themselves are born blind – their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh [tpl]convert|1.2|–|2.1|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.Schaller, p. 143. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.
Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes – consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.
In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles, and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede toward the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death while warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Packer, C., Pusey, A. E. |date=May 1983 |title= Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males|journal= American Naturalist |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–28 |doi= 10.1086/284097[/tpl] perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die.

When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.Scott, p. 46.
Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4–5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest,[tpl]Cite book|last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916[/tpl] if they have not already been critically injured while defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.
Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted.Scott, p. 68. Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members. One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact homosexually.[tpl]Cite book|last=Bagemihl |first=Bruce |year=1999 |title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-19239-8| pages=302–05[/tpl][ref]

===Health===

Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions.Schaller, p. 183. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill.Schaller, pp. 188–89. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.Schaller, pp. 189–90.

CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Roelke-Parker, M.E. |date=February 1996 |title=A canine distemper epidemic in Serengeti lions (Panthera leo) |journal= Nature|volume=379 |issue= 6564|pages=441–45 |doi=10.1038/379441a0|pmid=8559247|last2=Munson|first2=Linda|last3=Packer|first3=Craig|last4=Kock|first4=Richard|last5=Cleaveland|first5=Sarah|last6=Carpenter|first6=Margaret|last7=O'Brien|first7=Stephen J.|last8=Pospischil|first8=Andreas|last9=Hofmann-Lehmann|first9=Regina |displayauthors=9|first10=Hans|first11=George L.

G.[/tpl] FIV, which is similar to HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and Namibian lions.''

===Communication===

When resting, lion socialization occurs through a number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,Schaller, p. 85. which have been compared with grooming in primates.[tpl]Cite book|editor=Desmond Morris|last=Sparks |first=J |title=Primate Ethology |chapter=Allogrooming in primates:a review |year=1967 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=0-297-74828-9[/tpl] (2007 edition: 0-202-30826-X) Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting,[tpl]de icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book|last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |title=Verhaltensstudien an Katzen|edition= 2nd |year=1960 |publisher=Paul Parey |location=Berlin |isbn=3-489-71836-4 [/tpl] as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.Schaller, pp. 85–88. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.Schaller, pp. 88–91.
Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.Schaller, pp. 92–102. Their repertoire of vocalizations is also large; variations in intensity and pitch, rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Lion sounds include snarling, hissing, coughing, miaowing, woofing, and roaring. Lions tend to roar in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones.

They most often roar at night; the sound, which can be heard from a distance of [tpl]convert|8|km[/tpl], is used to advertise the animal's presence.Schaller, pp. 103–113. Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat.
