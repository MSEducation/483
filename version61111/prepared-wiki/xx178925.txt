Patrick "Paddy" Keaveney (28 October 1929 – 19 July 1995) was an Cooperative manager from County Donegal and a politician of the Independent Fianna Fáil party, who was a Teachta Dála (TD) for one year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=20&MemberID=562&ConstID=50|title=Mr. Paddy Keaveney|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=2 February 2008[/tpl]
He was elected to the 20th Dáil as TD for Donegal North–East at a by-election in June 1976 caused by the death of Fianna Fáil TD Liam Cunningham.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1973B&cons=72%20&ref=99|title=By Election, 10 June 1976: Donegal North–East|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 February 2008[/tpl] His surprise victory gave Independent Fianna Fáil two out of the three seats in Donegal North-East, but the constituency was abolished for the 1977 general election, when he was defeated in the new Donegal constituency. He did not stand again.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3109|title=Patrick Keaveney|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 February 2008[/tpl]
Keaveney was later elected to Donegal County Council, and after his death in 1995, his daughter Cecilia was co-opted to take his place as councillor. The following year, she was elected to Dáil Éireann as the Fianna Fáil candidate in a by-election following the death of Independent Fianna Fáil's founder Neil Blaney.
