Jérôme Alonzo (born 20 November 1972 in Menton, Alpes-Maritimes) is a football (soccer) goalkeeper who played for Paris-Saint Germain and was the back-up keeper to Lionel Letizi, but he signed with Rangers FC. He is a strong keeper who got a lot of playing time but will most likely become the number 2 keeper again because of the arrival of French international Mickaël Landreau. On June 3, 2008 he signed for FC Nantes Atlantique on a free transfer.
His father Pierre Alonzo used to play football for AS Cannes.
