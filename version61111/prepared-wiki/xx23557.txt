Model United Nations (also Model UN or MUN) is a conference similar to the United Nations in which students participate as delegates to various UN Committees. Participants research and formulate political positions based on the actual policies of the countries they represent.[tpl]cite web |last=Yossinger |first=Nili Sarit |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2012/07/2012073142614.html#axzz2lSH4DnI0 |title=What is Model UN?

==History==

The first instances of Model United Nations was the Model League of Nations Assembly. The first recorded meeting of a simulation of a Model League of Nations was run by Harvard University in 1927.[tpl]cite news |last=Parrin |first=Anjli |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/a-new-student-run-breed-crisis-oriented-and-fiercely-competitive.html?_r=0 |title=The Dog-Eat-Dog World of Model U.N. |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=August 2, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] In 1946, the League of Nations was dissolved and the United Nations was established.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/league-of-nations-instituted |title=League of Nations instituted |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] In 1947, the Model League of Nations changed into the Model United Nations Assembly. In the 1980s, the United Nations Association of the United States of America(UNA-USA) was established to coordinate and track the development of MUNs on a global level.
The oldest MUN in the world is a disputed issue. The MUN Project (LfhED) states that the oldest MUN in the world is the Harvard Model United Nations (1951)[tpl]cite web |url=http://lfhmunproject.wordpress.com/mun-history/ |title=MUN History |publisher=the MUN project-LFhED |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] while Best Delegate establishes the Berkeley Model United Nations Conference as the oldest (1952).[tpl]cite web |first=Ryan |url=http://bestdelegate.com/berkeley-bmun-60/ |title=Berkeley Model United Nations Celebrates 60th Year as the First and Oldest MUN Conference in the World |publisher=Best Delegate |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]
As of 2012, there are about 400 MUN conferences worldwide.

===Procedures===

In order to maintain decorum, MUN committees have rules of procedure to guide the procedures of the committee. Since there is no governing body for MUNs, each conference differs in the rules of procedure. Some conferences may directly adapt the UN rules of procedure while others adapt the Robert's Rules of Order.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/rules-of-procedure |title=Rules of Procedure |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] The following rules of procedure apply to general MUNs but may not apply to every MUN:
MUNs are run by a group of administrators known as the dais. A dais is headed by a Secretary-General. Each committee usually has a chair (also known as moderator), a member of the dais that enforces the rules of procedure. A delegate may request the committee as a whole to perform a particular action; this is known as a motion. Documents aiming to address the issue of the committee are known as resolutions and are voted for ratification.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/getting-started/model-un-glossary |title=Model UN Glossary |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl]
MUN committees can be divided into three general sessions: formal debate, moderated caucus, and unmoderated caucus. In a formal debate, the staff maintains a list of speakers and the delegates follow the order written on the 'speaker list'. Speakers may be added to the speaker list by raising their placards or sending a note to the chair. During this time, delegates talk to the entire committee. They make speeches, answer questions, and debate on resolutions and amendments. If there are no other motions, the committee goes back to formal debate by default. There is usually a time limit. In a moderated caucus, the committee goes into a recess and the rules of procedure are suspended. Anyone may speak if recognized by the chair. A vote on a motion is necessary to go into a moderated caucus. There is a comparatively shorter time limit per speech. In an unmoderated caucus, the delegates informally meet with other delegates and the staff for discussions[tpl]cite web |last =Shen |first=Sunny |coauthors=Ryan Bae, Amanda Chen, Geneva Nam, Sarah Wang, Marco Wong, Lance Zhou |title=The MUN Manifesto |publisher=Connect Global Youth Association |year=2012 |url=http://project-connect.ca/resources/MUNManifesto.pdf |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl]
Resolutions are the basis of all debate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.utk.edu/~modelun/resolutions.htm |title=What is a Resolution? |publisher=University of Tennessee |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] They are considered the final results of conversations, writings, and negotiations. Resolutions must go through a draft, approval by the dais, and consequent debate and modification.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/resolutions |title=Resolutions |publisher=United Nations Foundation |accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl]

Many conferences simulate other IGOs including:
A special committee that does not have a parallel in the actual United Nations which deals with a crisis is known as a 'Crisis Committee.' In this committee, a crisis is given to a team of students and the teams must come up with solutions.[tpl]cite news |last=Montero |first=Nicole |url=http://fiusm.com/2013/11/22/model-united-nations-team-hopes-to-rank-first-among-the-country/ |title=Model United Nations Team Hopes to Rank First Among the Country |publisher=FIU Student Media |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013[/tpl] The Crisis Committee focuses on a single historical event. The event may be fictional or non-fictional.

==Organization==

MUNs are usually organized by high school clubs or college clubs. Organizations that coordinate MUNs such as the United Nations Association of the United States of America (UNA-USA) are considered important organizing forces.
The United Nations hosts a site called the UN Cyberschoolbus which contains general information about MUNs such as: advice for researching papers for MUNs, starting MUN conferences, and methods to help finding MUNs. The program also has an international Internet forum in which participants can share information.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unausa.org/global-classrooms-model-un/how-to-participate/model-un-preparation/research/cyberschoolbus |title=Guide to the UN Cyberschoolbus |publisher=BEST DELEGATE |accessdate=November 28, 2013[/tpl] Organizations such as the Osgood Center for International Studies[tpl]cite web |last=Jackson |first=Robert P. |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201310291137.html |title=Africa: U.S. Envoy on Africa at Opening of Model U.N.
