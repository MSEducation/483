The original house was built about 1773 and subsequently enlarged and altered a number of times.  The original structure is a [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl]-story, five-bay brick house, altered by the Van Cortlandt family in the 1830s. It has a gable roof covered in slate. A large [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl]-story frame wing covered in stucco was built in the 1920s. It was built or remodeled in 1773 by Pierre Van Cortlandt.
