Thomson described the work and the character this way: “Scary Godmother is like your fairy godmother, but for Halloween. There’s really nothing scary about the Scary Godmother. She’s fun and macabre; reminiscent of childhood with a little bit of social commentary mixed in."[tpl]cite web |url=http://westfieldcomics.com/wow/low/low_int_050.html |title=Jill Thompson interview |accessdate=2008-11-22 |last=Ash |first=Roger |coauthors= |year=2001 |work= |publisher=Westfield Comics [/tpl] She stated that “comics are so segregated now” and that she wanted to create something that both young readers and adults could enjoy." She decided to create a something with a Halloween theme after looking for a Halloween-themed children's book for her niece and not finding anything that she liked.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.popimage.com/feb00/profile/jillinterview.html |title=ProFile Interview - Jill Thompson. |accessdate=2008-11-22 |last=Butcher |first=Christopher |coauthors= |date=200) |work= |publisher=PopImage [/tpl] The books employ a combination of storybook/comic formats.

Two films have been produced based on the series. The first, Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktacular, premiered on television in Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Canada in 2003. Later, it premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network in 2004. The film was the first one Mainframe Entertainment used its new software/animation pipeline for. Jill Thompson co-wrote the script, and had some creative control over the project. When she was shown early character designs for the film which resembled the watercolor illustrations in her books, she requested that the characters instead be fully computer-generated.Karen Moltenbray, Witch’s Brew: Mainframe Entertainment mixes up a wide range of graphic styles to create a unique look for Scary Godmother, Computer Graphics World, October 2003, Volume 26, Number 10 (In an interview, Thompson stated that she wanted them to go with CGI because "I'm doing 2D. Nobody else should be doing 2D, just me.")[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/9811008001477.htm |title=Interviews Archive: Scary Jill Thompson? |accessdate=2008-11-21 |last=Jozic |first=Mike |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Comics Bulletin [/tpl] However, the mostly static backgrounds used in the film more closely resemble traditional cel animation or the illustrations in Thompson's books. Because of that, the 3D characters often appear to "pop out" from their backgrounds. The visual style of the film has been described as resembling that of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas rather than that of computer-animated films such as Finding Nemo. A review of the film in School Library Journal, however, described the film as "Toy Story meets Tim Burton", and thought that the animation closely resembles Thompson's watercolor illustrations.[tpl]cite journal|last=Reynolds |first=Angela J. |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= September 2004 |title=Muitimedia Review: Video |journal=School Library Journal |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=70 |publisher= |location= |issn=0362-8930 |quote=  [/tpl]
