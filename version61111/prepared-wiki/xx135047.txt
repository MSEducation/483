==Plot==

Charlie (Tori Spelling) works for a company that is taken over by Walcott (played by Greg Germann) who believes family values are a priority.  Career-driven Charlie does a little fibbing when under the pressure of Walcott's standards, and believes she's in the clear.  But when Walcott invites himself over for dinner, she borrows her friend's house and daughter (Abigail Breslin) and hires actor Buck (Jordan Bridges) to play her husband for the evening. The one-night "act" turns into a full-time gig when her boss decides to rent the house next door for the summer, forcing Charlie and Buck to stay together in the fake lifestyle she created.

The movie did fairly well for Hallmark Channel, although reviews were not too favorable. Hal Erickson from All Movie Guide wrote: "Family Plan will probably seem a breath of fresh air to anyone who hasn't seen such movies as Picture Perfect and Good Neighbor Sam, or who can't remember the mid-1960s TV sitcom Occasional Wife."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/family-plan-377140|title=Family Plan Plot Synopsis|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=2009-10-15[/tpl]  The movie premiered with a 1.4 household rating and was viewed by more than 1.9 million unduplicated viewers.
