[[Mimi of Nachtigal]]

CATEGORIES: Maban languages, Languages of Chad

Mimi of Nachtigal, or Mimi-N, is a language of Chad that is attested only in a word list labelled "Mimi" that was collected ca. 1870 by Gustav Nachtigal. Greenberg (1960) classified it as a Maban language, though a distant one. Subsequent researchers have supported a remote relationship, though there is little data to go on.Starostin, George. On Mimi, Journal of Language Relationship, v. 6, 2011, pp. 115-140.
See Mimi of Decorse for some of the attested vocabulary.
