Alfred "Jake" Lingle, Jr. (July 2, 1891 - June 9, 1930) was a reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He was shot dead gangland-style at the Illinois Central commuter train station underpass,[tpl]cite news|title=The Shooting of Jake Lingle|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 9, 1930|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-chicagodays-jakelingle-story,0,3962612.story[/tpl] during rush hour on June 9, 1930, as dozens of people watched. The man convicted of the murder was a German-American mob associate, Leo Vincent Brothers. 
Lingle was initially lionized as a martyred journalist, but it was eventually revealed that he was involved in racketeering with the Capone organization, and that his death had more to do with his own criminal activities than his journalism.[tpl]cite news|title=Martyr Into Racketeer|work=Time|date=July 7, 1930|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846858,00.html[/tpl]

==Media==

The 1931 film The Finger Points was loosely based on Lingle's life and death, and starred Richard Barthelmess as the reporter, Fay Wray as his love interest, and Clark Gable as the gangster who corrupts him.
In 1959, the Jake Lingle murder was dramatized on a television episode of The Untouchables.
The reporter played by Martin Balsam in the 1959 film Al Capone is clearly based on Lingle, although the character's name has been changed to "Mac Keeley".
In the 1979 film, The Lady in Red, Lingle is seen as the reporter harassing John Dillinger's escort/girlfriend, Polly Hamilton (called "Polly Franklin" in this film). But this is fiction, as Dillinger first met Hamilton in 1934, four years after Lingle's murder.John Dillinger's Women
