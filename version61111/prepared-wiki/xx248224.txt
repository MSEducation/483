Supplemental funding for WPI came from the sale of XMRV diagnostic tests by Viral Immune Pathology Diagnostics (VIP Dx), owned by the Whittemore family, with all net proceeds donated to the WPI.XMRV testing, CFIDS.orghttp://www.wpinstitute.org/news/docs/WPI%20Release%20Diagnostic%20Test.pdf In September 2009, WPI announced that Mikovits and collaborator Jonathan Kerr of St. George’s College in London received a $1.6 million, 5-year grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for their proposal to develop new "strategies to decipher the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome". Jonathan Kerr lost his job at Kings College and St George's College in 2011, dissolving the relationship.[ref]

==Contradictory results and controversy==

===Background===

Judy Mikovits was introduced to Annette Whittemore at an HHV-6 Foundation conference in the spring of 2006, and soon after was hired as the research director of WPI.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Annette Whittemore |title=The Whittemore Peterson Institute: Building Bridges through Private and Public Sector Collaboration |journal=Molecular interventions|volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=120–126 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20539029 |doi=10.1124/mi.10.3.1[/tpl]
[/ref] Mikovits had left the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and moved to California to get married in 2001.  As WPI research director, Mikovits attempted to find a connection between CFS and infections. She met Bob Silverman, the co-discoverer of XMRV, at a conference in 2007 and began to look for XMRV using Silverman's reagents. In late 2008, her team had two positive results out of twenty, and adjusted the experimental conditions until all twenty samples tested positive. Mikovits decided to focus all WPI resources on XMRV. She kept the project secret from Peterson and the Whittemores, fearful that skeptics would try to derail her work, but sent test samples to Bob Silverman and to the lab of her mentor at NCI, Frank Ruscetti. Mikovits submitted the first version of the Science paper in May, 2009.

===Science publication and response===

In 2009, Lombardi et al. reported in the journal Science that they had detected XMRV DNA in 68 of 101 (67%) CFS patients, versus 8 of 218 (3.7%) healthy control subjects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lombardi VC |title=Detection of an infectious retrovirus, XMRV, in blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5952 |pages=585–9 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19815723 |doi=10.1126/science.1179052 |url= |bibcode=2009Sci...326..585L |author-separator=, |author2=Ruscetti FW |author3=Das Gupta J |display-authors=3 |last4=Pfost |first4=MA |last5=Hagen |first5=KS |last6=Peterson |first6=DL |last7=Ruscetti |first7=SK|last8=Bagni |first8=RK |last9=Petrow-Sadowski |first9=C|last10=Gold |first10=Bert |last11=Dean |first11=Michael |last12=Silverman |first12=Robert H. |last13=Mikovits |first13=Judy A.
