Earth Moving is the 12th record album by Mike Oldfield, released in  1989. Unlike Oldfield's previous albums at the time this contained only pop and rock songs.

==Album analysis==

Oldfield used several vocalists on the album, including his then girlfriend, Anita Hegerland. The album's music was performed mainly with synthesizers. It was the first time Oldfield recorded an album without an instrumental piece; each track being vocal-based pop and rock songs. Oldfield's only other songs-only album to date is 2014's Man on the Rocks.
The final track, despite appearing to be a lengthier piece, consists of two short, apparently unconnected songs, combined into one track, with a noticeable pause in between. According to Oldfield, the album was made with the full understanding of his recording company, Virgin Records, which demanded he create more commercially-oriented material than his previous albums. After recording Earth Moving Oldfield wanted to move away from 'computerised music' and return to real musicians and instruments; this is evident in his next album, Amarok.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/90_10.shtml |title=Mike Oldfield Turns the clock Back - Computers: Curse of Modern Music |publisher=Dick Speelpenning - Sym-info-Magazine No.91 |date=October 1990 |accessdate=2008-08-14[/tpl]

==Promotion==

According to an interview Mike Oldfield and Anita Hegerland gave on the television programme Good Morning Britain, the song "Innocent" was inspired by their young daughter Greta, who appears in the song's music video. In the programme, Oldfield and Hegerland performed an acoustic version of the song, Hegerland singing and Oldfield playing the guitar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/89_07.shtml |title=TV-AM Interview |publisher=Tubular.net (Transcribed from Good Morning Britain) |date=1989-07-11 |accessdate=2008-09-20[/tpl]
