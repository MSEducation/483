Tianyu falls for Yunxiang and frequently comes between Yunxiang and Liangyu, going as far as plotting to kill Liangyu. Yunxiang thinks Liangyu has perished and tries to kill Tianyu for revenge, but ends up on death row. Wealthy official Shen Shihao also loves Yunxiang and saves her, at which time Yunxiang discovers she's pregnant with Liangyu's child. She marries Shihao in gratitude. Eighteen years later, Liangyu returns as Beijing's most prominent mob ringleader.
