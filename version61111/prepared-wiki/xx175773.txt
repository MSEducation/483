==History==

1090 AM originally signed on in 1973 as WMTY with 1,000 Watts of power.  Throughout its run, it has carried mostly satellite formats, originally Oldies as "Cruisin' Oldies 1090", and the calls were eventually changed to the current WCZZ.  In 2006, the station became "Rejoice! 1090" carrying ABC Radio's Rejoice! Musical Soul Food satellite format.  The station switched to Sports Talk via ESPN Radio in 2007. In June 2009 that station changed to an urban gospel format.
