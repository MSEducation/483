[[Marching Band (band)]]

CATEGORIES: Swedish rock music groups

Marching Band is a musical duo consisting of Erik Sunbring and Jacob Lind from Linköping, Sweden. Marching Band combines eccentric musical elements with mainstay rock sounds, creating a sonic fusion that finds instrumentation of marimba, banjo and vibraphone meshing with guitars, bass, drums and lush vocal harmonies.  The duo’s distinct sound and style can be heard on their first full-length studio album, Spark Large, which was released by U & L Records on August 5, 2008.

==History==

In 2008, Jacob and Erik released Spark Large, their first full-length album on U & L Records.  Upon hearing it, Rolling Stone’s Hype Monitor wrote: The Swedish duo crafts their own brand of pillowy pop, brightened with bands of psychedelia.  They quickly gained early radio support in Los Angeles when tracks from the debut surfaced on KCRW and INDIE 103.1.  In the months to follow their music found fans at NPR where they were featured on World Café, Second Stage and Song of the Day.  Marching Band was also featured in Billboard’s Underground Column and got the attention of one of the most discerning critics – Pitchfork.
In addition, Marching Band earned the attention of music supervisors for both film and TV. Their music has been featured in such films and TV-series as Zombieland, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, 90210, How I Met Your Mother, Scrubs, Cougar Town and Greek.
Marching Band’s second album, Pop Cycle, was released on May 2010 release on U & L Records.
While the Marching Band’s debut album was recorded in sunny Los Angeles, CA with Adam Lasus (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!, Yo La Tengo), Pop Cycle was recorded during the two most miserable winter months of the year in Stockholm with legendary Swedish producer Jari Haapalainen (Ed Harcourt, Camera Obscura, The Concretes).  The ultimate result is a musically darker record.  The lyrics are more personal as well, yet Pop Cycle still has the trademark Marching Band sound – intricate melodies and complex arrangements with an effortless, undeniable pop-feeling.
Marching Band's song 'Aggravate' was included on the indie compilation Indiecater Volume IV in August 2009.
Marching Band's EP, 'Pop Cycle Naked - EP' was released November 9, 2010 on U & L Records.
Marching Band's new EP, "And I've Never Seen Anything Like That", will be released on Jan 15th, 2013.  MTV debuted the bands music video "And I've Never", 
Marching Band's, third full length "So Much Imagine", was released on Feb 21st, 2014 digitally and as a double Vinyl containing 21 new tracks.
