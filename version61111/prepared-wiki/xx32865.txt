Little Cumbrae ([tpl]lang-gd|Cumaradh Beag[/tpl]) is an island in the Firth of Clyde, in North Ayrshire, Scotland. The island is known locally as Wee Cumbrae.

==Etymology==

The Gaelic name Cumaradh means "place of the Cymric people", referring to the Brittonic-speaking inhabitants of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Alternatively, the name Cumbrae may derive from Kil Maura meaning "cell or church of a female saint". 
Little Cumbrae was recorded as Kumbrey circa 1300, Cumbraye circa 1330 and Litill Comeray in 1515Johnston, p. 93 and was also formerly known as Little or Wee Cumray.
The Cumbraes are referred to as the Kumreyiar in  the Norse Saga of Haakon Haakonarson."cömbröɣ" "Brittonic Language in the Old North". Scottish Place-Name Society. Retrieved 14 Sept 2011.

==Geography==

Little Cumbrae lies barely a kilometre to the south of its larger neighbour, Great Cumbrae, a few kilometres distant from the mainland town of Largs.  The islands are collectively referred to as The Cumbraes. In stark contrast to its neighbour, green and fertile Great Cumbrae, Little Cumbrae is a rough and rocky island.  With its many cliffs and rocky outcrops, Little Cumbrae bears more of a resemblance to a Hebridean island than to some of its neighbours in the Clyde.
A number of uninhabited islets skirt the island's east coast, Castle Isle, the Broad Islands and Trail Isle.
Today the island's main settlement is at Little Cumbrae House on the eastern shore, facing the Scottish mainland.

==History==

Robert II is said to have built a castle on the island which was demolished by Cromwell's soldiers in 1653.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst1707.html | publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland| title=Overview of Little Cumbrae| accessdate=2007-11-11[/tpl]
In the early 20th century, under the ownership of Evelyn Stuart Parker, a new ‘mansion house’ was created from the original single storey farmhouse, the gardens were laid out to a plan by Gertrude Jekyll, the renowned garden designer, and substantial repairs were undertaken to the castle and the original lighthouse. The original work commenced in 1913, with subsequent alterations made between 1926 and 1929 when the square tower and top floor were added.
Little Cumbrae is the birthplace of James Archbald, the first mayor of Carbondale, Pennsylvania.

==Cumbrae Lighthouse==

James Ewing built the first Little Cumbrae lighthouse on the top of Lighthouse Hill in 1757. This was the second lighthouse in Scotland.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.secretscotland.org.uk/index.php/Secrets/LittleCumbrae| title=Little Cumbrae| publisher=Secret Scotland| accessdate=17 January 2011[/tpl] An open fire was lit at the top of a circular stone tower. Remains of this old structure can still be seen.
The traditional Cumbrae Lighthouse was built in 1793 by Thomas Smith under commission from the Commissioners of the Northern Lights. The lighthouse lies on a broad raised beach on the western shore of the island looking out into the Firth. It had a foghorn, slipway, jetty, and boathouse. The original oil lamps were replaced by Argand lamps in 1826 and a solar-powered light was installed in 1974. The 1793 tower has been unused since 1997, with the light on 36-foot hexagonal/cylindrical tower adjacent to the old generator house.

==Ownership==

Little Cumbrae was privately purchased in 2003 and there were plans for its development as a memorial park, nature reserve and corporate escape.
The island was sold again in July 2009 for £2 million.[tpl]Cite web| publisher=HLL Humberts Leisure| title=Little Cumbrae| date=10 July 2009| url=http://www.humberts-leisure.com/86/article/81/page.html| accessdate=12 July 2009[/tpl] The buyers of the island, Scottish millionaire couple of Indian extraction, Sarwan and Sunita Poddar, opened there a yoga and meditation centre with the help of yoga guru Swami Baba Ramdev.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-13967.html| publisher=Pink News| title='Gay cure' yoga guru to set up centre on Scottish island| accessdate=2009-09-17[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6825207.ece | publisher=Times Online| title=Yoga guru sets up base on Scottish isle| accessdate=2009-09-27 | location=London | first=Rhys | last=Blakely | date=2009-09-08[/tpl] There have also been rumours of the new owners planning to rename it "Peace Island", but those have been denied.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.brambleandbug.com/our-work/case-studies/little-cumbrae-island/ | publisher=Bramble & Bug Ltd.| title=Plans about Little Cumbrae| accessdate=2009-11-10[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.largsandmillportnews.com/news/weecumbrae/articles/2009/09/16/391901-wee-cumbrae-not-to-be-renamed-peace-island/ | publisher=Largs and Millport News | title=Little Cumbrae not to be renamed | date=2009-09-16 | accessdate=2009-11-10[/tpl]
