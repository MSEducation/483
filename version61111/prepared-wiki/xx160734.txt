HD 11964 c is an extrasolar planet approximately 107 light-years away in the constellation of Cetus.  The planet was discovered in a close-orbit around the yellow subgiant star HD 11964.  The planet has a minimum mass 35 times the mass of Earth and is located in a mildly eccentric orbit which takes almost 38 days to complete. HD 11964 c was a possible planet discovered on the same day as HD 11964 b in 2005. HD 11964 c was first proposed in a paper published in 2007,[tpl]cite journal| url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/657/1/533/65907.html | title=Four New Exoplanets and Hints of Additional Substellar Companions to Exoplanet Host Stars | author=Wright, J.T. et al. | year=2007 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=657 | issue=1 | pages=533–545 | doi=10.1086/510553 | bibcode=2007ApJ...657..533W|arxiv = astro-ph/0611658 [/tpl] and finally confirmed with new data presented in a review of multi-planet systems which appeared on the arXiv preprint website in 2008.
Some sources have used the designation "HD 11964 b" for this planet,[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/646/1/523/64035.html | title=Two Suns in The Sky: Stellar Multiplicity in Exoplanet Systems | author=Raghavan, D. et al. | year=2006 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=646 | issue=1 | pages=523–542 | doi=10.1086/504823 | bibcode=2006ApJ...646..523R|arxiv = astro-ph/0603836 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+11964&p2=b |title=Notes for planet HD 11964 b |accessdate=2008-12-15 |work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia | author=Schneider, J.[/tpl] however in their review of the properties of multi-planet extrasolar planetary systems, the discovery team has stated that the correct designation for this planet is HD 11964 c and the reversed system was due to confusion related to private communications between various groups of astronomers.
