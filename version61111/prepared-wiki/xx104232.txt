[[Chlorocruorin]]

CATEGORIES: Hemoproteins, Respiratory pigments

Chlorocruorin is an oxygen-binding hemeprotein present in the blood plasma of many annelids, particularly certain marine polychaetes. Its affinity for oxygen is weaker than that of most haemoglobins. A dichromatic compound, chlorocruorin is noted for appearing green in dilute solutions, though it appears light red when found in concentrated solutions.
Its structure is very similar to erythrocruorin (which is likewise very similar to multiple subunits of myoglobin) and it contains many 16-17kDa myoglobin-like subunits arranged in a giant complex of over a hundred subunits with interlinking proteins as well with a total weight exceeding 3600kDa. The only significant difference between chlorocruorin and erythrocruorin is that chlorocruorin carries an abnormal heme group structure.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Pallavicini A, Negrisolo E, Barbato R, et al. |title=The primary structure of globin and linker chains from the chlorocruorin of the polychaete Sabella spallanzanii |journal=J.
