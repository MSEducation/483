In Greek mythology, Astraeus, Astræus or Astraeos ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀστραῖος[/tpl]) was an astrological deity and the Titan-god of the dusk. Some also associate him with the winds, as he is the father of the four Anemoi/wind deities.
In Hesiod's Theogony and in the Bibliotheca, Astraeus is a second-generation Titan, descended from Crius and Eurybia.[tpl]cite book|last=Hesiod|title=The Theogony of Hesiod|publisher=Forgotten Books|page=13|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jN6KasrDA04C&pg=PA13&dq=Astraeus| isbn=978-1-60506-325-6[/tpl] However, Hyginus wrote that he was descended directly from Tartarus and Gaia, and referred to him as one of the Gigantes.  
Appropriately, as god of the dusk, Astraeus married Eos, goddess of the dawn. Together as nightfall and daybreak they produced many children who are associated with what occurs in the sky during twilight.  
They had many sons, the four Anemoi ("Winds"): Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus,[tpl]cite book|last=Smith|first=William|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1859|page=389|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H8QPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA389&dq=Astraeus[/tpl] and the five Astra Planeta ("Wandering Stars", i.e. planets): Phainon (Saturn), Phaethon (Jupiter), Pyroeis (Mars), Eosphoros/Hesperos (Venus), and Stilbon (Mercury).[tpl]cite book|last=Barney|first=Stephen et al., transl., ed.|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|publisher=Cambridge U.

Sometimes: "justice"), but most writers considered Astraea the child of Crius and Eurybia.  
He is also sometimes associated with Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, since winds often swell up around dusk.
