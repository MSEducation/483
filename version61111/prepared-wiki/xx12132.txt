Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (born Nomzamo Winifred Zanyiwe Madikizela; 26 September 1936)Winnie Mandela. nndb.com is a South African activist and politician who has held several government positions and headed the African National Congress Women's League. She is a member of the ANC's National Executive Committee.
She was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years, including 27 years during which he was imprisoned. Although they were still married at the time of his becoming president of South Africa in May 1994, the couple had separated two years earlier. Their divorce was finalised on 19 March 1996,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/20/world/south-african-judge-gives-nelson-mandela-a-divorce.html|work=The New York Times|first=Suzanne|last=Daley|title=South African Judge Gives Nelson Mandela a Divorce|date=20 March 1996[/tpl] though Winnie Mandela continued to be a presence in Mandela's life in later years despite his remarriage in 1998. Winnie could be seen almost daily visiting her former husband Nelson Mandela at the Mediclinic heart hospital in Pretoria where he was receiving treatment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/06/nelson-winnie-mandela-marriage|title=Nelson and Winnie Mandela's marriage ended, but the bond was never broken|work=The Guardian|author=Smith, David |date=6 December 2013[/tpl] 
Of all the major figures who came to global prominence during the South African liberation struggle, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was the most glamorous and the most at home in the world of celebrity culture – which is what made her fall from grace all the more startling; and for many of the years just before Mr. Mandela's release from 27 years in prison, she was his public face, bringing word of his thoughts and his state of mind.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/world/africa/in-mandela-legacy-a-place-for-winnie.html?_r=0|title=In Mandela Legacy, a Place for Winnie?|work=New York Times|date=3 August 2013[/tpl] She was offered academic honors abroad.
A controversial activist, she is popular among her supporters, who refer to her as the 'Mother of the Nation', yet reviled by others after the South African Truth and Reconciliation commission found "Ms Winnie Madikizela Mandela politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights", concluding that she had personally been responsible for the murder, torture, abduction and assault of numerous men, women and children, as well as indirectly responsible for an even larger number of such crimes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/report/finalreport/Volume%202.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report, Volume Two, Chapter 6 (pp. 543–82): Special Investigation: Mandela United Football Club|date=29 October 1998|accessdate=10 July 2010[/tpl] In March 2009, the Independent Electoral Commission ruled that Madikizela-Mandela, selected as an ANC candidate, could run in the April 2009 general election, despite her suspended jail sentence for fraud.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7960268.stm|title=Winnie Mandela 'can run in poll'|date=23 March 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 March 2009[/tpl] But Winnie Mandela was the target not only of the government but of politics and the press, speaking her mind and speaking strongly.

==Early life==

Her Xhosa name is Nomzamo ("She who tries"). She was born in the village of eMbongweni,Madikizela-Mandela profile. Sahistory.org.za. Retrieved 30 May 2011.
Bizana, Pondoland, in what is now South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. She held a number of jobs in various parts  of what was then the Bantustan of Transkei, including with the Transkei government, living at various times in Bizana, Shawbury and Johannesburg. Despite restrictions on education of blacks during apartheid, she earned a degree in social work from  the Jan Hofmeyer School in Johannesburg, and several years later earned a Bachelor's degree in international relations from the University of Witwatersrand.

==Marriage/children==

She met lawyer and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in 1957. She was 22 and standing at a bus stop in Soweto when Mandela first saw her and charmed her, securing a lunch date the following week. They married in 1958 and had two daughters, Zenani (born 1959) and Zindzi (born 1960). Nelson Mandela was arrested in 1963 and released in 1990. The couple separated in 1992 and finalized the divorce in 1996 with an unspecified out-of-court settlement. Her attempt to obtain a settlement up to US$5 million, half of what she claimed her ex-husband was worth, was dismissed when she failed to appear in court for a settlement hearing.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n21_v89/ai_18170308|title=Nelson and Winnie Mandela divorce; Winnie fails to win $5 million settlement|date=8 April 1996|work=Jet[/tpl]

==Apartheid==

Winnie Mandela carved her own name in struggle lore. She was regularly detained by the apartheid government. She was tortured, subjected to house arrest, kept under surveillance, held in solitary confinement for a year and banished to a remote town. She emerged as a leading opponent of the white minority rule government during the later years of her husband's imprisonment (August 1963 – February 1990). For many of those years, she was exiled to the town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State and confined to the area, except for the times she was allowed to visit her husband at the prison on Robben Island. Beginning in 1969, she spent eighteen months in solitary confinement at Pretoria Central Prison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=/people/mandela_nw.html|title=Nomzamo Nobandla Winnifred MADIKIZELA-MANDELA|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=24 January 2010|quote=In 1969 she became one of the first detainees under Section 6 of the notorious Terrorism Act. She was detained for 18 months in solitary confinement in the condemned cell at Pretoria Central before being charged under the Suppression of Communism Act.[/tpl] It was at this time that Winnie Mandela became well known in the West. She organised local clinics, campaigned actively for equal rights and was promoted by the ANC as a symbol of its struggle against apartheid.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/the_winnie_mandela_trial/33659.stm|title=The Winnie Mandela Trial|work=BBC|date=29 November 1997[/tpl] In a leaked letter to Jacob Zuma in October 2008, just-resigned President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki alluded to the role the ANC had created for her in its anti-apartheid activism:  In the context of the global struggle for the release of political prisoners in our country, our movement took a deliberate decision to profile Nelson Mandela as the representative personality of these prisoners, and therefore to use his personal political biography, including the persecution of his then wife, Winnie Mandela, dramatically to present to the world and the South African community the brutality of the apartheid system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=108395&sn=Detail|title=Thabo Mbeki's letter to Jacob Zuma|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Politicsweb|accessdate=15 April 2009[/tpl] 
In 1985, Mandela won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award along with fellow activists Allan Boesak and Beyers Naude for their human rights work in South Africa. The Award is given annually by the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights to an individual or group whose courageous activism is at the heart of the human rights movement and in the spirit of Robert F.

==Criminal convictions and findings of criminal behaviour==

Her reputation was damaged by such rhetoric as that displayed in a speech she gave in Munsieville on 13 April 1986, where she endorsed the practice of necklacing (burning people alive using tyres and petrol) by saying: "With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country."[tpl]cite news|url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,,110268,00.html|title=Row over 'mother of the nation' Winnie Mandela|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=27 January 1989[/tpl] Further tarnishing her reputation were accusations by her bodyguard, Jerry Musivuzi Richardson, that she had ordered kidnapping and murder.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/36680.stm|title=Winnie says evidence against her is 'ludicrous'|date=4 December 1997|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 August 2009[/tpl] On 29 December 1988, Richardson, who was coach of the Mandela United Football Club (MUFC), which acted as Mrs. Mandela's personal security detail, abducted 14-year-old James Seipei (also known as Stompie Moeketsi) and three other youths from the home of a Methodist minister, Rev. Paul Verryn, claiming she had the youths taken to her home because she suspected the reverend was sexually abusing them. The four were beaten to get them to admit to having had sex with the minister. Seipei was accused of being an informer, and his body later found in a field with stab wounds to the throat on 6 January 1989.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/26/world/winnie-mandela-aide-guilty-of-murder.html|title=Winnie Mandela Aide Guilty of Murder|work=The New York Times|date=26 May 1990|first=Christopher S.|last=Wren[/tpl]Bodies probably won't bury Winnie M&G. 15 March 2013
In 1991, she was acquitted of all but the kidnapping. Her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine on appeal. The final report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation commission, issued in 1998, found "Ms Winnie Madikizela Mandela politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the MUFC" and that she "was responsible, by omission, for the commission of gross violations of human rights."
 In 1992, she was accused of ordering the murder of Dr. Abu-Baker Asvat, a family friend who had examined Seipei at Mandela's house, after Seipei had been abducted but before he had been killed."South Africa Police Order Full Probe Of Mandela Charge", Christian Science Monitor, 9 April 1992. Mandela's role was later probed as part of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, in 1997."Winnie may face fresh murder charge", The Independent,  28 November 1997 She was said to have paid the equivalent of $8,000 and supplied the firearm used in the killing, which took place on 27 January 1989."Panel Hears Evidence Winnie Mandela Sought Doctor's Death", New York Times, 2 December 1997. The hearings were later adjourned amid claims that witnesses were  being intimidated on Winnie Mandela's orders.Winnie hearing adjourned after intimidation claims. BBC. 1 December 1997.

===Transition to democracy===

During South Africa's transition to democracy, she adopted a far less conciliatory and compromising attitude  than her husband toward the white community. Despite being on her husband's arm when he was released in 1990, the first time the two had been  seen in public for nearly thirty years, the Mandelas' 38-year marriage ended when they separated in April 1992 after it was revealed she had been unfaithful to her husband during his imprisonment. The couple divorced in March 1996. She then adopted the surname Madikizela-Mandela. Appointed  Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in the first post-Apartheid government (May 1994), she was dismissed eleven months later following allegations of corruption.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/winniemandela/Winnie-Mandelas-fall-from-grace.2422138.jp|title=Winnie Mandela's fall from grace|date=26 April 2003|author=Bridgland, Fred |work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|accessdate=24 March 2009[/tpl]
She remained extremely popular among many ANC supporters, however. In December 1993 and April 1997, she was elected president of the ANC Women's League, although she withdrew her candidacy for ANC Deputy President at the movement's Mafikeng conference in December 1997. Earlier in 1997, she appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Archbishop Desmond Tutu  as chairman of the commission recognised her importance in the anti-apartheid struggle, but exhorted her to apologise and to admit her mistakes. In  a guarded response, she admitted "things went horribly wrong".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/july-dec97/mandela_12-4a.html|title=Facing the Past|publisher=PBS NewsHour|date=4 December 1997[/tpl]

===Legal problems===

On 24 April 2003, Winnie Mandela was found guilty on 43 counts of fraud and 25 of theft, and her broker, Addy Moolman, was convicted on 58 counts of fraud and 25 of theft. Both had pleaded not guilty to the charges, which related to money taken from loan applicants' accounts for a funeral  fund, but from which the applicants did not benefit. Madikizela-Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.co.za/2003/04/27/news/news01.asp|title=ANC: We won't dump Winnie|publisher=Sunday Times (South Africa)|date=27 April 2003[/tpl] Shortly after the conviction, she resigned from all leadership positions in the ANC, including her parliamentary seat and the presidency of the ANC Women's League.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/04/25/mandela.sentencing|title=Winnie Mandela resigns ANC posts|publisher=CNN|date=25 April 2003[/tpl] In July 2004, an appeal judge of the Pretoria High Court ruled that "the crimes were not committed for personal gain".

===2010 interview with Nadira Naipaul===

In 2010, Madikizela-Mandela was interviewed by Nadira Naipaul. In the interview, she attacked her ex-husband, claiming that he had "let  blacks down", that he was only "wheeled out to collect money", and that he is "nothing more than a foundation". She further attacked his decision to accept the Nobel Peace Prize with FW De Klerk. Among other things, she reportedly claimed Mandela was no longer "accessible" to her daughters.
