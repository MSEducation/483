The Kelowna Buckaroos were a Tier II Junior "A" ice hockey team from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.  They were a part of the British Columbia Hockey League.

==History==

The Kelowna Buckaroos are one of the original four of the British Columbia Hockey League.  They won two league titles, a British Columbia title (the Mowat Cup), and a Doyle Cup as Alberta/BC Champions.  In 1983, the Buckaroos moved to Summerland, British Columbia.  Their season-to-season success dwindled in Summerland as they were replaced in Kelowna by the Kelowna Packers in 1985.  The Buckaroos played their final game in 1988 after four straight losing records.
