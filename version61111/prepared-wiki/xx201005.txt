==History==

The station was applied for by its current owners, North Alabama Public Service Broadcasters, during August 2000. A Jasper native, Brett Elmore, was selected as station manager under its owners. The station was assigned the WQJJ-LP call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on December 30, 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=135721&Callsign=WQJJ-LP |work=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database |title=Call Sign History[/tpl]
The second-oldest LPFM station in Alabama, WQJJ-LP originally went on the air during January 2005. Elmore managed the station for almost three years and resigned due to FCC regulations preventing his involvement in more than one radio station of different classes. Because of this, WQJJ-LP temporarily went silent in mid-April 2008. WQJJ-LP was completely rebuilt and returned to the air under management of the original owners on June 18, 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bellsouthpwp2.net/c/r/crackedlcd/almediapage/profiles/wqjj.html |title=FM History Profile: WQJJ |work=Alabama Broadcast Media Page |accessdate=September 21, 2008[/tpl]
On December 25, 2012, the station changed frequencies from its original 97.7 MHz to 100.1 MHz.
WQJJ-LP is now known as "100.1 Fox-FM" and airs an Adult Contemporary/Oldies music format, the first in America to be trademarked as "Classic Top-40".[tpl]cite web |title=Station Information Profile |work=Arbitron |url=http://www.arbitron.com/[/tpl][tpl]cite web |work=Alabama Broadcast Media Page |url=http://bellsouthpwp2.net/c/r/crackedlcd/almediapage/lpfm.html |title=Alabama LPFM & Translators |accessdate=May 21, 2008[/tpl]
