==Biography==

Ōtani was born in Kyoto as the son of Ōtani Koson, the 21st hereditary head of the of Jōdo Shinshū branch of Japanese Buddhism. His brother, Ōtani Kōzui was the 22nd head of the sect, and a noted explorer of Central Asia, while his sister was Takeko Kujo, a noted poet and humanitarian.
In 1904, Ōtani was sent by the Jōdo Shinshū to the Liaodong Peninsula, to minister to Japanese forces during the Russo-Japanese War. In December 1905, he was ordered the Qing dynasty China to lay the foundations for a network of Jōdo Shinshū temples and missionary activities. In September 1907, he made a tour through Southeast Asia before returning to Japan to assume his duties as an official at the Higashi Honganji in Kyoto. He travelled to Korea in 1909 to assist in the development of a network of Jōdo Shinshū temples, and departed for London in May 1910. However, due to the financial scandal which enveloped his brother, Ōtani Kōzui, then 22nd head of the sect, he was forced to curtail his trip in July 1910. He became secretary-general of the sect in March 1921.
In October 1925, Ōtani left for a tour of the United States and Canada, returning to Japan at the end of February 1926. On April 4, 1928, he was appointed to a seat in the House of Peers.
