An appeal to pity (also called argumentum ad misericordiam or the Galileo argument)http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/fallacies/appeal_pity.htm[tpl]cite web|title=Appeal to Pity (the Galileo Argument)|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cmcgloth/portfolio/fallacies/appealpity.html|accessdate=6 October 2012[/tpl]  is a fallacy in which someone tries to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting his or her opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. It is a specific kind of appeal to emotion.

==Analysis==

Recognizing an argument as an appeal to pity does not necessarily invalidate the conclusion or the
factual assertions. There may be other reasons to accept the invited conclusion, but an appeal to pity is not one of them (see also, argument from fallacy).
