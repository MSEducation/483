Though the band had utilised the 'D standard' tuning for the recording and subsequent performances of covers such as "Crash Course in Brain Surgery" and "The Small Hours", this was the second instance of the band utilising such a low guitar tuning for an original piece ("The Thing That Should Not Be" was the first).  Bassist Jason Newsted tuned his 5-string bass down to 'A standard' for this song, which is essentially the equivalent of D standard, i.e. one whole step down.
