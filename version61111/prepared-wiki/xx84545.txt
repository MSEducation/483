==History==

Arnold was referred to as ‘Ernehale’ in the Domesday Book; this former name meant ‘place frequented by eagles’ or ‘the valley of eagles’.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/nottinghamshire1.html#arnold |title=The Domesday Book Online - Nottinghamshire A-E |publisher=The Domesday Book Online|date= |accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/notts_ob.html|title=Civic Heraldry Of England And Wales-Nottinghamshire (Obsolete) |publisher=Civic Heraldry of England and Wales|accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl]
‘A History of Arnold’ by Rupert King and James Russell (1913) explains that the etymology of Arnold’s name is thus:
  ‘Heron-hald’, meaning the corner of the forest where Herons (large birds) live.  Which becomes over the centuries since 500 A.D. by ‘lazy’ pronunciation, Eron-ald, thence Ern-old and Arn-old. 
Due to the local topography Arnold can never have been a haunt of eagles, because they inhabit areas of rocky outcrops, which have formed cliffs; the nearest such location being Creswell Crags, some [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] north-west as the eagle flies, although the fish-eating European White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) could have caught fish in the River Trent, which lies a mere 4 miles [tpl]convert|4|mi|km[/tpl] south-east of Arnold, on the other side of the Mapperley Plains ridge.
These eagles would then have flown north-west in the evenings to roost in the ancient woodland area now known as Arnold.
The Anglo-Saxon migrant-invaders, when they arrived along the River Trent from the Humber Estuary [tpl]Circa|500 A.D.[/tpl], would certainly have seen these eagles—which were [tpl]convert|91|cm|in|[/tpl] long—flying north-west in the evenings and appropriately named this roosting location ‘Erne-Halh’ or  ‘Erne-Haugh’, meaning ‘Eagle’s nook’ or ‘Eagle’s corner’.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Arnold is surrounded by a circular ridge from the north-west around to the south-east and raised ground to the west.
The town’s bowl-like topography may have given it the etymological feature ‘-Halh’ or ‘-Haugh’.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Arnold was a centre of the framework knitting industry in the 19th century. It was the site of the first framebreaking incidents of the Luddite riots, in March 1811, when 63 frames were smashed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knittingtogether.org.uk/doc.asp?doc=7361&cat=739|title=Knitting Together|publisher=Knitting Together|date=18 December 2003|accessdate=16 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Luddite riots were a workers’ response to decreasing pay, standard of living and conditions of employment in the industry as a result of changing fashions decreasing demand for their style of hosiery.
1968 saw the opening of Arnold Market in the town centre. Market days are on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

==Railway==

Arnold once had a railway station known as ‘Daybrook and Arnold’. It was closed along with the rest of the line on 4 April 1960.  The station was located on Mansfield Road on what is now a retail park.  There is still evidence of the line in the form of remnants of the embankments on Arnot Hill Park (just behind the B&Q).  The Line was the Great Northern Main Line later nicknamed ‘the back route’, with trains to Gedling and Netherfield with the terminus being Nottingham Victoria. Just after those embankments a later built railway—the Nottingham Suburban—joined it and ran over Thackerays Lane on a bridge on its way to Woodthorpe Park and beyond.[tpl]cite web|last=Swain|first=Simon|title=Nottingham Suburban Railway|url=http://www.forgottenrelics.co.uk/routes/nottsub.html|work=Forgotten Relics|publisher=Four by Three|accessdate=27 March 2014|year=2010[/tpl] 

==Home Brewery==

The town’s most notable landmark is probably the Home Ales building in Daybrook. Founded in 1875 by John Robinson,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Search-new-owner-iconic-brewery-building/story-15130547-detail/story.html|title=Search for a new owner for iconic brewery building|publisher=Nottingham Post|date=4 February 2012|accessdate=22 February 2014[/tpl] the brewery was famous for its Robin Hood logo on beermats. The brewery remained independent until 1986 when it (along with its 450 owned public houses) was purchased by Scottish & Newcastle for £123million. Scottish & Newcastle gradually ran down production, for example by subcontracting Mild brewing to a rival brewery in Mansfield, resulting in the eventual closure of the Daybrook building in 1996. Home Bitter is still brewed under contract at Everards in Leicester, although many of the public houses that used to serve it now sell Theakston’s beers instead.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Dating from 1936,[tpl]cite web|title=Nottinghamshire - Daybrook, Mansfield Road: Home Brewery Co Ltd (closed 1996)|url=http://www.breweryhistory.com/Breweries/NottsDaybrookHomeBrewery.htm|work=Brewery History Society|publisher=Brewery History Society|accessdate=26 March 2014[/tpl]  the current Home Ales building now houses county council offices. The illuminated ‘Home of the Best Ales’ sign was altered to remove the word ‘Ales’ and include the logo of Nottinghamshire County Council. The building has an unusual ‘putti frieze’ by sculptor Charles Doman along the front wall which depicts groups of cherubs involved in the brewing of beer. Three designs are repeated in an ABCABC / CBACBA pattern. The reliefs are in a 2:3 proportion and are white casts. ‘A’ depicts a drinking table; ‘B’ shows barrel-making; and ‘C’ illustrates the stirring of the brew—all allegories of the brewing process. The decorative ironwork gates are contemporaneous.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pmsa.org.uk/pmsa-database/10549/|title=Public Monuments and Sculpture Association|accessdate=24 November 2012[/tpl]
In 1950 the Home Brewery Company Ltd gave the land for Arnold’s King George’s Field, a permanent memorial to King George V and guaranteed for free public access in perpetuity for recreation.  The Charity Commission held an enquiry that closed in December 2005 into restricted public access.Charities Commission Enquiry: King George V Playing Field Arnold - Registered Charity No 700035[tpl]dead link|date=October 2009[/tpl]  Due to this ruling Arnold Town F.C. have relocated away from the town centre.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
As of March 2014, Nottinghamshire County Council has been advertising the building for sale since February 2012 in an effort to save money.[tpl]cite news|title=Home Brewery site in Arnold is put up for sale|url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Home-Brewery-site-Arnold-sale/story-15107364-detail/story.html|accessdate=26 March 2014|newspaper=Nottingham Post|date=2 February 2012[/tpl]
