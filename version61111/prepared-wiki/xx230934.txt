[[1985 Paris–Roubaix]]

CATEGORIES: Paris–Roubaix, 1985 in French sport, 1985 in road cycling

The 1985 Paris–Roubaix took place on 14 April in rainy conditions.
At one point, former three times winner Francesco Moser looked the serious contender, but a crash due to a hole between cobbles and a slow repair of his equipment eliminated Moser from the final. 
About 15 kilometres from Roubaix, Marc Madiot escaped from an eight-man group with among others defending race winner Sean Kelly. Madiot held on and entered the velodrome in Roubaix on his own to win. Bruno Wojtinek, leaving the chase group some two kilometres from the line, finished second, cementing a French double. Sean Kelly and Greg Lemond were the next riders home having avoided a crash just as the chasing group was entering the velodrome in Roubaix. 
Below, the results for the 1985 edition of the Paris–Roubaix cycling classic.
