[[El Sello De Los Tiempos Tour]]

CATEGORIES: WarCry concert tours, 2002 concert tours, 2003 concert tours

El Sello De Los Tiempos Tour was the first concert tour by Asturian power metal band WarCry, supporting their second studio album. The tour consisted of 33 shows performed throughout Spain.
Víctor García decided not to give any tour until they had released a second album, with the idea to have enough songs to perform. The band made their first live-presentation on a concert in Avilés, Asturias, Spain free of charge just by showing the covers of any of their two albums. The second concert, which took place December 17, 2002, at the hall Divino Aqualung in Madrid, also featured the famous Spanish metal band Dark Moor. Throughout March, the band kept touring as a solo act. In the first concert of the next month, which took place in Dos Hermanas, Sevilla, WarCry performed with groups like Darna, SunFire, Snowblind. Metal Mareny, Perversiones, Víctima, and other bands participated as opening acts on some of their concerts. On the metal festival Derrame Rock, which took place June 27, 2003, WarCry played with bands like Moonspell, Saratoga, Avalanch, Hamlet, Sôber. Then on July 11, on the Bike Rock Festival in Cantabria, they shared stage with Sepultura, Rage, Barricada, Hamlet, Lost Horizon, among others. The band kept performing only on festivals the remaining of the tour, as they were working on their upcoming album. On their last performance at Sala Quattro in Avilés, Asturias, bassist Alvaro Jardón left the band, due to musical and personal issues.[tpl]cite web|title=Alvaro Jardón leaves WarCry|author=|publisher=maxmetal.net|date=2003-12-16|url=http://www.maxmetal.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=287|accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl]
