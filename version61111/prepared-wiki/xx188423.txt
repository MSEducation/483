The 1998 United States Open Championship was the 98th U.S. Open, held June 18â€“21 at the Lake Course of the Olympic Club in San Francisco, California. Lee Janzen won his second U.S. Open, one stroke ahead of runner-up Payne Stewart.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1013215/index.htm |magazine=Sports Illustrated |title=Payne Killer |last=Garrity |first=John |date=June 29, 1998 |page=30 |accessdate=June 15, 2012[/tpl] Janzen became the second winner at a U.S. Open at the Olympic Club to come back from seven strokes behind in the final round; Billy Casper also did it in 1966, but on the back nine alone. Stewart rebounded and won the title the next year at Pinehurst, but died four months later in an aviation accident.
Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus, age 58, made the 36-hole cut at the U.S. Open for the final time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VkxWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7esDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6761%2C5749566|work=Eugene Register-Guard|agency=Associated Press|title=Nicklaus still grinding away at 58|date=June 21, 1998|page=9B[/tpl]
This was the fourth U.S. Open at the Lake Course of the Olympic Club; the first two in 1955 and 1966 ended in playoffs, and 1987 was a one-stroke victory. The U.S. Open returned in 2012, also won by one stroke.
