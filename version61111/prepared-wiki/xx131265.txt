Montiel is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. 
The ruined castle on the hilltop above the town was the refuge for Peter of Castile after his defeat by the forces of Henry of Trastamara at the Battle of Montiel. He was lured into a meeting by Bertrand du Guesclin, captured, and executed by his halfbrother Henry in the tent of Bertrand.
