[[Florin]]

CATEGORIES: Guilder

Florin derives from the city of Florence (or Firenze) in Italy and frequently refers to the (fiorino d'oro) gold coin struck in 1252.
This money format was borrowed in other countries and the word florin was used, for example, in relation to the Dutch guilder (abbreviated to Fl) as well as the coin first issued in 1344 by Edward III of England – then valued at six shillings, composed of 108 grains (6.99828 grams) of gold with a purity of 23 carats and 3[tpl]fract|2[/tpl] grains (or 23[tpl]frac|7|8[/tpl] carats)[tpl]cite book|author=John S.

A regional variant of the florin was the Rheingulden, minted by several German states encompassing the commercial centers of the Rhein (Rhine) River valley, under a series of monetary conventions starting in 1354, initially at a standard practically identical to the Florentine florin (98% gold, 3.54 grams).  By 1419, the weight had been slightly reduced (to 3.51 grams) and the alloy was substantially reduced (to 79% gold).  By 1626, the alloy had been slightly reduced again (to 77% gold), while the weight was more substantially reduced (to 3.240 grams).  In 1409, the Rheingulden standard (at the time 91.7% gold) was adopted for the Holy Roman Empire's Reichsgulden.[tpl]cite book |title=The History of Currency 1252-1894 |author=W.A.
