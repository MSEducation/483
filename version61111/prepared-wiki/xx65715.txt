[tpl]Nihongo|Lupin III|ルパン三世|Rupan Sansei[/tpl], also written as Lupin the Third or Lupin the 3rd, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Monkey Punch. It follows the escapades of master thief Arsène Lupin III, the grandson of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief of Maurice Leblanc's series of novels.
The Lupin III manga, which first appeared in Weekly Manga Action on August 10, 1967, spawned a media franchise that includes numerous manga, four anime television series, five animated feature films, two live-action films, three OVAs, yearly television specials since 1989, music CDs, video games, and a musical. Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to various Lupin III properties at various times, with just the first two movies having been released by over 10 companies alone. Tokyopop acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. Funimation Entertainment purchased the rights to several of the television specials and films in 2002, and the fourth television series in 2012. Geneon licensed and dubbed 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim during 2003. Discotek Media licensed the entire first television series and the live-action film, they also own the rights to several other Lupin titles, including some previously released by other companies.
Over forty years after its creation, Lupin III remains popular, with several different manga series currently being published, yearly television specials and a fourth anime series which aired in 2012. For several years, issues relating to the copyright of Maurice Leblanc's intellectual property meant that the Lupin name was removed from its releases outside of Japan, usually changed to "Rupan" or "Wolf". However, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the Lupin name.

==Plot==

Arsène Lupin III, the grandson of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, chasing Lupin across the globe.

==Production==

Monkey Punch's inspiration for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Monkey Punch did not ask permission to use the character's name, at the time Japan did not enforce trade copyrights, however, this led to copyright issues with the Leblanc estate once Lupin's popularity spread to North America and Europe. Several foreign releases of Lupin III media were forced to drop the Lupin name, with the character himself renamed to "Rupan" or "Wolf", or "Edgar de la Cambriole" (Edgar of Burglary) in the French version.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/the-lupin-tapes/2010-06-06 |title=The Lupin Tapes - The Mike Toole Show |publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate=August 27, 2013[/tpl] In 2012, Leblanc's original Arsène Lupin entered the public domain in France.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/01/02-1/original-lupin-character-enters-public-domain-in-2012 |title=Original Lupin Character Enters Public Domain in 2012 |publisher=Crunchyroll |accessdate=August 28, 2013[/tpl]
When Monkey Punch began Lupin III, he was already working on another series, Pinky Punky. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both Lupin III and Pinky Punky made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as Columbo and Agatha Christie novels, and was also inspired by The Three Musketeers. He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and describes them as "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2003-11-13 | title=Interview: Monkey Punch | first=Allen | last=Divers | publisher=Anime News Network | date=November 13, 2003 | accessdate=July 2, 2007[/tpl] Another influence on the manga was Mad magazine.[tpl]cite video| people = Monkey Punch Interview (DVD Extra)| title = Lupin the 3rd: Dead or Alive| medium = DVD| publisher=Funimation Entertainment [/tpl] The appeal of drawing Lupin comes from being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.
At the beginning of the series, many of the women Lupin encounters are all named Fujiko, but are treated different characters from chapter to chapter. This concept was later changed to make Fujiko a single character who changes style frequently.[tpl]cite journal |title=Otaku USA |last=Surat |first=Daryl |volume=6 |issue=4 |issn=19393318 |publisher=Sovereign Media[/tpl]
Monkey Punch has said that he believes the story can never end but that if he had to end it both Zenigata and Lupin would have to end as equals. They would either both fall, both win or both get very old.[tpl]cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Manga |last=Yadao |first=Jason S. |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=978-1-85828-561-0 |pages=154–155[/tpl]

====Pilot film====

Following the success of the manga series, TMS Entertainment and Toho produced a 12-minute Lupin III anime film adaptation featuring Lupin wearing a red jacket outfit. Masaaki Ōsumi directed the movie, which was made in two different versions: a CinemaScope version intended for theatrical release and a 4:3 television version. The animation for the two versions was mainly the same, but the voice cast was different, with only Kiyoshi Kobayashi and Eiko Masuyama, voicing Daisuke Jigen and Fujiko Mine respectively, in both versions. By the time the pilot was completed in 1969, because of budget concerns and a disagreement between Toho and TMS, the film was never released. Masaaki Ōsumi then moved on to direct several episodes of the first Lupin III television series.[tpl]cite web | last=Cruz | first=Luis A|url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime | title=History | publisher=Lupin Encyclopedia| accessdate=September 1, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last=Cruz | first=Luis A | url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/pilot_film|title=Pilot Film | publisher=Lupin Encyclopedia | accessdate=September 1, 2007[/tpl] The two versions of this pilot film were later released in 1989 as a part of the [tpl]nihongo|Lupin III Secret Files|シークレットファイル|Rupan Sansei — Shīkuretto Fairu[/tpl] collection.[tpl]cite web | last=Cruz|first=Luis A  |url=http://www.lupinencyclopedia.com/anime/ova/the_secret_files |title=The Secret Files |publisher=Lupin Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 1, 2009[/tpl] Discotek Media included both versions in their 2012 release of the first TV series.

====Original video animations====

The first Lupin III original video animation (OVA) was The Plot of the Fuma Clan, was shown in theatres in Japan on December 26, 1987 before being released to video on April 5, 1998. Because of budget problems, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast from the television series and theatrical movies; instead, they hired a different cast to save money. Yasuo Yamada, the voice actor for Lupin, had always taken pride in his role as the title character and after the voice cast replacement, he mistakenly thought that Monkey Punch had lobbied the producers for a new voice actor. After the release, Monkey Punch tried to reassure Yamada that he had nothing to do with the producers' decision to use a new cast, and the regulars were reinstated for the first television special, Bye-Bye Liberty Crisis. Despite this, relations between Yamada and Monkey Punch were permanently strained by the affair. AnimEigo owned the North American distribution rights to the OVA until 2006, when it was taken over by Discotek.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-08-30/new-anime-distributor | title=New Anime Distributor | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=June 29, 2007[/tpl]
