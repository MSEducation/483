Sir Owen Willans Richardson, FRS (26 April 1879 â€“ 15 February 1959)  was a British physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission, which led to Richardson's Law.[tpl]cite web | author=Nobel Foundation | title=Owen Willans Richardson: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1928  | url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher= | year=1928 | accessdate=2007-09-17[/tpl]

==Biography==

Richardson was born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, England, the only son of Joshua Henry and Charlotte Maria Richardson.  He was educated at Batley Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained First Class Honours in Natural Sciences.[tpl]acad|id=RCRT897OW|name=Richardson, Owen Willans[/tpl] He then got a DSc from University College London in 1904.[tpl]acad|id=RCRT897OW|name=Richardson, Owen Willans[/tpl]List of Nobel laureates affiliated with University College London
Richardson was professor at Princeton University from 1906 to 1913, and returned to the UK in 1914 to become Wheatstone Professor of Physics at King's College London, where he was later made director of research. He retired in 1944, and died in 1959.
He also researched the photoelectric effect, the gyromagnetic effect, the emission of electrons by chemical reactions, soft X-rays, and the spectrum of hydrogen.
Richardson married Lilian Wilson, sister of his Cavendish colleague Harold Wilson, in 1906, and had two sons and a daughter.  Richardson's own sister married the American physicist (and 1937 Nobel laureate) Clinton Davisson, who was Richardson's PhD student at Princeton.  After Lilian's death in 1945, he was remarried in 1948 to Henriette Rupp, a physicist.
Owen Williams Richardson had a son Harold Owen Richardson who specialized in Nuclear Physics and was also the Chairman, Physics Department, Bedford College, London University and later on became emeritus Professor at London University.

==Honours==

Richardson became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1913, and was awarded its Hughes Medal in 1920. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1928, "for his work on the thermionic phenomenon and especially for the discovery of the law named after him".Nobel prize citation, Nobel foundation website He was knighted in 1939.
