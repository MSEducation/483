==Synopsis==

A man (Rupert Doone) is holding an umbrella in the rain. Then, he starts dancing, and as he does, the backgrounds completely change. Then, he starts dancing near the ocean, with a woman and fish following. Then, he plays tennis with cel-animated circles as another man watches. A colorful array of shapes follow, and the man sits and thinks, as the shapes come back and images come off the score sheet. The music ends, and a man's voice says the following: 'Post Office Savings Bank puts a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for you', followed by 'No deposit is too small for the Post Office Savings Bank'.
