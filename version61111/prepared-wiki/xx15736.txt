Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is strictly followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences[tpl]cite web| url=http://sociology.socialsciencedictionary.com/Sociology-Dictionary/GENDER| title=GENDER | publisher=Social Science Dictionary | accessdate=May 10, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=The Sociology of gender| url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0132448300.pdf[/tpl] and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO). In many other contexts, however, even in some areas of social sciences, the meaning of gender has undergone a usage shift to include sex or even to replace the latter word. Although this gradual change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s, a small acceleration of the process in the scientific literature was observed when, in 1993, the Food and Drug Administration started to use gender instead of sex.Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs Gender is now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.
In the English literature, the trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social sex role first appeared in a feminist paper on transsexualism in 1978.[tpl]cite journal|author=Yudkin, M.|year=1978|jstor=3177542|title=Transsexualism and women: A critical perspective|journal= Feminist Studies|volume=4|issue=3|pages= 97–106|doi=10.2307/3177542[/tpl] Some cultures have specific gender-related social roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the hijra of India and Pakistan.
The social sciences have a branch devoted to gender studies. Other sciences, such as sexology and neuroscience, are also interested in the subject. While the social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly do, research in the natural sciences investigates whether biological differences in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity.

==Etymology and usage==

The modern English word gender comes from the Middle English gendre, a loanword from Norman-conquest-era Old French. This, in turn, came from Latin genus. Both words mean "kind", "type", or "sort". They derive ultimately from a widely attested Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root gen-,[ref]
Julius Pokorny, 'gen', in Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, (Bern: Francke, 1959, reprinted in 1989), pp. 373–75.[/ref][ref]
'genə-', in 'Appendix I: Indo-European Roots', to The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000).[/ref]
which is also the source of kin, kind, king, and many other English words.[ref]
Your Dictionary.com, 'Gen', reformatted from AHD.[/ref]
Most uses of derivatives of this root in Indo-European languages refer either directly to what pertains to birth (for example pre-gn-ant) or, by extension, to natural, innate qualities and their consequent social distinctions
(for example gentry, generation, gentile, genocide, and eugenics).
It appears in Modern French in the word genre (type, kind, also genre sexuel) and is related to the Greek root gen- (to produce), appearing in gene, genesis, and oxygen.
The first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of gender as "kind" had already become obsolete.

The word was still widely attested, however, in the specific sense of grammatical gender (the assignment of nouns to categories such as masculine, feminine and neuter). According to Aristotle, this concept was introduced by the Greek philosopher Protagoras.
[tpl]quote|[tpl]lang|grc|τὰ γένη τῶν ὀνομάτων ἄρρενα καὶ θήλεα καὶ σκεύη[/tpl] The classes (genē) of the nouns are males, females and things. The Technique of Rhetoric III v[tpl]quote|A fourth rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female and inanimate.|Aristotle|Rhetoric, translated by William Rhys Roberts (1858–1929), (reprinted Dover, 2004), p. 297f. ISBN 978-0-486-43793-4[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1926, Henry Watson Fowler recommended that the word be restricted to this grammar-related meaning only:

However examples of the use of gender to refer to masculinity and femininity as types are found throughout the history of Modern English (from about the 14th century).
As a verb, gender means "breed" in the King James Bible:
[tpl]quote|Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind|[tpl]Bibleref|Leviticus|19:19[/tpl]|1616[/tpl]
The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates from the work of John Money (1955), and was popularized and developed by the feminist movement from the 1970s onwards (see [tpl]p/s|Feminism theory and gender studies[/tpl] below). The theory was that human nature is essentially epicene and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed. Matters pertaining to this theoretical process of social construction were labelled matters of gender.
The popular use of gender simply as an alternative to sex (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The American Heritage Dictionary (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction "is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels."Usage note: Gender, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, (2000).
In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of gender in academia increased greatly, outnumbering uses of sex in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a euphemism for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself.

==Gender identity and gender roles==

Gender identity is the gender a person self-identifies as. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and expectations. Judith Butler considers the concept of being a woman to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.Butler (1990) The term "woman" has chronically been used as a reference to and for the female body; this usage has been viewed as controversial by feminists[tpl]weasel-inline|date=December 2012[/tpl], in the definition of "woman". There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; feminists[tpl]who|date=December 2012[/tpl] challenge the dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and sex. Social identity refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned.Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E. (1995). "Social Movements and Collective Behavior: Social Psychological Dimensions and Considerations." In Karen Cook, Gary A.Fine, and James S.House (eds) Sociological Perspectives on Social Psychology, pp. 571–600. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. According to social identity theory,Taifel, H. & Turner, J.C. (1986). The social identity of intergroup relations. In S. Worchel & W.G. Austin (eds), The psychology of intergroup relations, pp. 7–24. Chicago: Nelson-Hall ISBN 0818502789. an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories; this is demonstrated by group processes and how inter-group relationships impact significantly on individuals' self perception and behaviors. The groups people belong to therefore provide members with the definition of who they are and how they should behave in the social sphere.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1177/0146167296228002 |author=Terry, D.J., Hogg, M.A. |title= Group norms and the attitude-behavior relationship: A role for group identification|year=1996|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=22|issue=8|pages=776[/tpl]

Many cultures have different expectations based on gender, but there is no universal standard to a masculine or feminine role across all cultures.Spade, J., Valentine, C. (2011).

Philosopher Michel Foucault claims that as sexual subjects, humans are the object of power, which is not an institution or structure, rather it is a signifier or name attributed to "complex strategical situation".Tong, Rosemarie (2009). Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction / Rosemarie Tong.Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press ISBN 0813343755. Because of this, "power" is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. Such as, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and is incapable of actions attributed to a "man". Judith Butler said that gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited because she is female. "I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly," she said.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] "This is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled. Rather than 'woman' being something one is, it is something one does." More recent criticisms of Judith Butler's theories critique her writing for reinforcing the very conventional dichotomies of gender.Vigo, Julian. 'The Body in Gender Discourse: The Fragmentary Space of the Feminine.' La femme et l’écriture. Meknès, Maroc, 1996.

===Social assignment and the idea of gender fluidity===

According to gender theorist Kate Bornstein, gender can have ambiguity and fluidity.Bornstein, Kate (1995). Gender Outlaw – On Men, Women and the rest of us, Vintage, ISBN 0679757015 pp. 51–52 There are two contrasting ideas regarding the definition of gender, and the intersection of both of them is definable as below:
The World Health Organization defines gender as the result of socially constructed ideas about the behavior, actions, and roles a particular sex performs. The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender. Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term "gender".
The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. The social label of being classified into one or the other sex is obligatory to the medical stamp on the birth certificate. Gender is a term used to exemplify the attributes that a society or culture constitutes as "masculine" or "feminine". Although a person's sex as male or female stands as a biological fact that is identical in any culture, what that specific sex means in reference to a person's gender role as a woman or a man in society varies cross culturally according to what things are considered to be masculine or feminine.Birke, Lynda. "Chapter 24, In Pursuit of Difference." The Gender and Science Reader. New York: Routledge, 2001. 309-22. Print. The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the assignment of gender and the biological differences that play a role in classifying either sex is interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.
In this context, the socially constructed rules are at a cross road with the assignment of a particular gender to a person. Gender ambiguity deals with having the freedom to choose, manipulate and create a personal niche within any defined socially constructed code of conduct while gender fluidity is outlawing all the rules of cultural gender assignment. It does not accept the prevalence of the two rigidly defined genders "man" and "woman" and believes in freedom to choose any kind of gender with no rules, no defined boundaries and no fulfilling of expectations associated with any particular gender.
Both these definitions are facing opposite directionalities with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based.

===Social categories===

Sexologist John Money coined the term gender role in 1955. The term gender role means those things people say or do to disclose their status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to, sexuality in the sense of eroticism.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=14378807|year=1955|last1=Money|first1=J|title=Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings|volume=96|issue=6|pages=253–64|journal=Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital[/tpl]
Elements of such a role include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, gender role is often abbreviated to gender in their literature.
Most societies have only two distinct, broad classes of gender roles, masculine and feminine, that correspond with the biological sexes of male and female. When a baby is born, society allocates the child to one sex or the other, on the basis of what the genitals look like. However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex; for example, the two-spirit people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal female and male roles in those societies. In the language of the sociology of gender, they comprise a third gender,[tpl]Cite book | editor=Gilbert Herdt | title=Third Sex Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History | year=1996 | isbn=0-942299-82-5 | oclc=35293440[/tpl]
more or less distinct from biological sex (sometimes the basis for the role does include intersexuality or incorporates eunuchs).Will Roscoe, Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000. ISBN 0-312-22479-6

===Measurement of gender identity===

Early gender identity research hypothesized a single bipolar dimension of masculinity-femininity—that is masculinity and femininity were opposites on one continuum. As societal stereotypes changed, however, assumptions of the unidimensional model were challenged. This led to the development of a two-dimensional gender identity model, in which masculinity and femininity were conceptualized as two separate, orthogonal dimensions, coexisting in varying degrees within an individual. This conceptualization on femininity and masculinity remains the accepted standard today.
Two instruments incorporating the multidimensional of masculinity and femininity have dominated gender identity research: The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ). Both instruments categorize individuals as either being sex typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits), cross sex-typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits), androgynous (either males or females who report themselves as high on both masculine and feminine traits) or undifferentiated (either males or females who report themselves as low on both masculine and feminine traits).[tpl]cite journal|author=Palan, K. |year=2001|url=http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf|title= Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda|journal=Academy of Marketing Science Review|volume=10[/tpl] Twenge (1997) noted that, although men are generally more masculine than women and women generally more feminine than men, the association between biological sex and masculinity/femininity is waning.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02766650|title=Changes in masculine and feminine traits over time: A meta-analysis|year=1997|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean M.|journal=Sex Roles|volume=36|issue=5–6|pages=305[/tpl]

===Feminism theory and gender studies===

Biologist and feminist academic Anne Fausto-Sterling rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals' capacities.Anne Fausto-Sterling, Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women (New York: Basic Books, 1992), p. 8 ISBN 0465047920. The philosopher and feminist Simone de Beauvoir applied existentialism to women's experience of life: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, 1949, as translated and reprinted 1989." In context, this is a philosophical statement. However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology—a girl must pass puberty to become a woman—and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive.Fausto-Sterling, Anne “Of Gender and Genitals” from Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction  of sexuality New York, NY: Basic Books, 2000, 3, pp. 44-77
Within feminist theory, terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of Masculine/Feminine or Human, the author uses "innate gender" and "learned sex roles",[ref]
Chafetz, JS. Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1974.[/ref]
but in the 1978 edition, the use of sex and gender is reversed.[ref]
Chafetz, JS. Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1978.[/ref]
By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using gender only for socioculturally adapted traits.
In gender studies the term gender refers to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, gender explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.Garrett, Stephanie (1992). Gender, Routledge p. vii ISBN 0422605700. This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, and American feminists such as Judith Butler. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "performative".Butler (1990) p. 9.
Charles E. Hurst states that some people think sex will, "...automatically determine one’s gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one’s sexual orientation (sexual attractions and behavior).C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142 Gender sociologists believe that people have cultural origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender to fill the role properly, and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans "are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas".Schwalbe, M. (2005). The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition.  pp. 22–23 ISBN 0072825790 People do this through everything from clothing and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories to know how we should feel about them.
Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system because of societal prejudices.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that "courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142 This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a man or woman is judged differently because he or she does not present the "correct" gender.

Political scientist Mary Hawkesworth addresses gender and feminist theory, noting that since the 1970s the concept of gender has transformed and been used in significantly different ways within feminist scholarship.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics & Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=141–156|url=http://journals.cambridge.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/download.php?file=%2FPAG%2FPAG1_01%2FS1743923X05001017a.pdf&code=e7068cfae018b1664786ecfec8f757c2|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]  Hawkesworth notes that a transition occurred when several feminist scholars, such as Sandra Harding and Joan Scott, began to conceive of gender "as an analytic category within which humans think about and organize their social activity".[tpl]cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics & Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=144|url=http://journals.cambridge.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/download.php?file=%2FPAG%2FPAG1_01%2FS1743923X05001017a.pdf&code=e7068cfae018b1664786ecfec8f757c2|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]  Feminist scholars in Political Science began employing gender as an analytical category, which highlighted "social and political relations neglected by mainstream accounts".[tpl]cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics & Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=142|url=http://journals.cambridge.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/download.php?file=%2FPAG%2FPAG1_01%2FS1743923X05001017a.pdf&code=e7068cfae018b1664786ecfec8f757c2|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] However, Hawkesworth notes "feminist political science has not become a dominant paradigm within the discipline".
American political scientist Karen Beckwith addresses the concept of gender within political science arguing that a "common language of gender" exists and that it must be explicitly articulated in order to build upon it within the political science discipline. Beckwith describes two ways in which the political scientist may employ 'gender' when conducting empirical research: "gender as a category and as a process." Employing gender as a category allows for political scientists "to delineate specific contexts where behaviours, actions, attitudes and preferences considered masculine or feminine result in particular" political outcomes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Karen|first=Beckwith|title=A Common Language of Gender?|journal=Politics & Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|page=131|url=http://journals.cambridge.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/download.php?file=%2FPAG%2FPAG1_01%2FS1743923X05001017a.pdf&code=e7068cfae018b1664786ecfec8f757c2|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]  It may also demonstrate how gender differences, not necessarily corresponding precisely with sex, may "constrain or facilitate political" actors. Gender as a process has two central manifestations in political science research, firstly in determining "the differential effects of structures and policies upon men and women," and secondly, the ways in which masculine and feminine political actors "actively work to produce favorable gendered outcomes".[tpl]cite journal|last=Karen|first=Beckwith|title=A Common Language of Gender?|journal=Politics & Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|page=132|url=http://journals.cambridge.org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/download.php?file=%2FPAG%2FPAG1_01%2FS1743923X05001017a.pdf&code=e7068cfae018b1664786ecfec8f757c2|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]
With regard to gender studies, Jacquetta Newman states that although sex is determined biologically, the ways in which people express gender is not. Gendering is a socially constructed process based on culture, though often cultural expectations around women and men have a direct relationship to their biology.  Because of this, Newman argues, many privilege sex as being a cause of oppression and ignore other issues like race, ability, poverty, etc. Current gender studies classes seek to move away from that and examine the intersectionality of these factors in determining people's lives. She also points out that other non-Western cultures do not necessarily have the same views of gender and gender roles.[tpl]cite book|last=Newman|first=Jacquetta|last=White|first=Linda|title=Women, Politics, a nd Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed.|year=1964|publisher= Oxford Press|pages=6–7[/tpl] Newman also debates the meaning of equality, which is often considered the goal of feminism; she believes that equality is a problematic term because it can mean many different things, such as people being treated identically, differently, or fairly based on their gender. Newman believes this is problematic because there is no unified definition as to what equality means or looks like, and that this can be significantly important in areas like public policy.[tpl]cite book|last=Newman|first=Jacquetta|last=White|first=Linda|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed.|year=1964|publisher= Oxford Press|pages=11–12[/tpl]

===Social construction of sex hypotheses===

Scholars generally regard gender as a social construct, and various researchers, including some feminists, consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For instance, sexologist John Money suggests the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role. Moreover, Ann Oakley, a professor of sociology and social policy, says "the constancy of sex must be admitted, but so also must the variability of gender."Oakley, Ann (1972). Sex, Gender and Society. London: Temple Smith. p. 16 ISBN 085117020X. The World Health Organization states, "'sex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women," and "'gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women."World Health Organization (2002). "Gender and Reproductive Rights: Working Definitions". Retrieved November 15, 2012. Thus, sex is regarded as a category studied in biology (natural sciences), while gender is studied in humanities and social sciences. Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, maintains "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., The Gender and Science Reader, New York: Routledge. p. 320. Therefore, it is stated that sex is something that does not change, while gender can change according to social structure.
However, there are scholars who argue that sex is also socially constructed. For example, Judith Butler, a professor of rhetoric and comparative literature, states that "perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."Butler (1990) p. 7.

She continues: It would make no sense, then, to define gender as the cultural interpretation of sex, if sex is itself a gendered category. Gender ought not to be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning on a pre-given sex (a juridical conception); gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established. ... This production of sex as the pre-discursive ought to be understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender.Butler (1990) p. 10. 
Moreover, she asserts that "bodies only appear, only endure, only live within the productive constraints of certain highly gendered regulatory schemas,"Butler (1993) p. xi. and sex is "no longer as a bodily given on which the construct of gender is artificially imposed, but as a cultural norm which governs the materialization of bodies."Butler (1993) pp. 2–3.
With regard to history, Linda Nicholson, a professor of history and women's studies, says that the notion of human bodies being separated into two sexes is not historically consistent. She argues that male genitals and female genitals were considered inherently the same in Western society until the 18th century. At that time, female genitals were regarded as incomplete male genitals, and the difference between the two was conceived as a matter of degree. In other words, there was a gradation of physical forms, or a spectrum. Therefore, the current perspective toward sex, which is to consider women and men and their typical genitalia as the only possible natural options, came into existence through historical, not biological roots.[tpl]cite journal|author=Nicholson, Linda |year=1994|title= "Interpreting Gender". Signs|journal= Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=20|issue=1|pages=79–105|jstor=3174928|url=http://www.cscsarchive.org/dataarchive/textfiles/textfile.2010-03-11.2795912944/file|doi=10.1086/494955[/tpl]
In addition, drawing from the empirical research of intersex children, Anne Fausto-Sterling, a professor of biology and gender studies, describes how the doctors address the issues of intersexuality. She starts her argument with an example of the birth of an intersexual individual and maintains "our conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 45. Then she adds how gender assumptions affects the scientific study of sex by presenting the research of intersexuals by John Money et al., and she concludes that "they never questioned the fundamental assumption that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexuals was to find out more about 'normal' development."Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 46. She also mentions the language the doctors use when they talk with the parents of the intersexuals. After describing how the doctors inform parents about the intersexuality, she asserts that because the doctors believe that the intersexuals are actually male or female, they tell the parents of the intersexuals that it will take a little bit more time for the doctors to determine whether the infant is a boy or a girl. That is to say, the doctors' behavior is formulated by the cultural gender assumption that there are only two sexes. Lastly, she maintains that the differences in the ways in which the medical professionals in different regions treat intersexual people also give us a good example of how sex is socially constructed.Fausto-Sterling (2000) In her book, titled Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality, she introduces the following example:  A group of physicians from Saudi Arabia recently reported on several cases of XX intersex children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a genetically inherited malfunction of the enzymes that aid in making steroid hormones. ... In the United States and Europe, such children, because they have the potential to bear children later in life, are usually raised as girls. Saudi doctors trained in this European tradition recommended such a course of action to the Saudi parents of CAH XX children. A number of parents, however, refused to accept the recommendation that their child, initially identified as a son, be raised instead as a daughter. Nor would they accept feminizing surgery for their child. ... This was essentially an expression of local community attitudes with ... the preference for male offspring.Fausto-Sterling (2000) pp. 58–9. 
Thus it may be said that determining the sex of children is actually a cultural act, and the sex of children is in fact socially constructed. Therefore, it is possible that although sex seems fixed and only related to biology, it may be actually deeply related to historical and social factors as well as biology and other natural sciences.

==Biological factors and views==

The biology of gender became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what is now called gender identity disorder (GID). Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by John Money. He stated:
[tpl]quote|The term "gender role" appeared in print first in 1955. The term gender identity was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=7996589|year=1994|last1=Money|first1=J|title=The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years|volume=20|issue=3|pages=163–77|doi=10.1080/00926239408403428|journal=Journal of sex & marital therapy[/tpl][/tpl]
Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of dimorphic features (Money's word is "dipolar") that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to "postnatal" features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "postpubertal hormonal" effects.
Although causation from the biological—genetic and hormonal—to the behavioural has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behaviour in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, the existence of a "gay gene" has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.Michael Abrams, 'The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality—and sexuality itself', Discover June (2007).
There are studies concerning women who have a diagnosis called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which leads to the overproduction of masculinizing sex hormones, androgens. These women usually have normal female appearances (though nearly all girls with CAH have corrective surgery performed on their genitals) but despite of hormone-balancing medication that they are given since birth, they are statistically more likely to be interested in activities traditionally linked to males than females. Psychology professor and CAH researcher Dr. Sheri Berenbaum attributes these differences to exposure to higher levels of male sex hormones in utero.

===Sexual reproduction===

Sexual reproduction is a common method of producing a new individual within various species. In sexually reproducing species, individuals produce special kinds of cells (called gametes) whose function is specifically to fuse with one unlike gamete and thereby to form a new individual. This fusion of two unlike gametes is called fertilization. By convention, where one type of gamete cell is physically larger than the other, it is associated with female sex. Thus an individual that produces exclusively large gametes (ova in humans) is called female, and one that produces exclusively small gametes (spermatozoa in humans) is called male.
An individual that produces both types of gametes is called hermaphrodite (a name applicable also to people with one testis and one ovary). In some species hermaphrodites can self-fertilize (see Selfing), in others they can achieve fertilization with females, males or both. Some species, like the Japanese Ash, Fraxinus lanuginosa, only have males and hermaphrodites, a rare reproductive system called androdioecy. Gynodioecy is also found in several species. Human hermaphrodites are typically, but not always, infertile.
What is considered defining of sexual reproduction is the difference between the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete types within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, of more than 1.5 million living species,'RedList', International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources official website.

A few rare species that push the boundaries of the definitions are the subject of active research for light they may shed on the mechanisms of the evolution of sex. For example, the most toxic insect,Patricia J. Schmidt, Wade C. Sherbrooke, Justin O. Schmidt, 'The Detoxification of Ant (Pogonomyrmex) Venom by a Blood Factor in Horned Lizards (Phrynosoma)', Copeia 198 (1989): 603–607. the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex, has two kinds of female and two kinds of male. One hypothesis is that the species is a hybrid, evolved from two closely related preceding species.
Fossil records indicate that sexual reproduction has been occurring for at least one billion years.[ref]
Leslie E. Orgel, 'The Origin of Life on the Earth', Scientific American October, 1994.[/ref]
However, the reason for the initial evolution of sex, and the reason it has survived to the present are still matters of debate, there are many plausible theories. It appears that the ability to reproduce sexually has evolved independently in various species on many occasions. There are cases where it has also been lost, notably among the Fungi Imperfecti.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1006/mpev.1996.0061|title=Human Pathogeneic Fungi and Their Close Nonpathogenic Relatives|year=1996|last1=Bowman|first1=B|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=6|pages=89–96|pmid=8812309|last2=White|first2=TJ|last3=Taylor|first3=JW|issue=1[/tpl]

===Sex/Gender taxonomy===

The following systematic list (gender taxonomy) illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human life cycle. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly to accommodate the constantly growing knowledge base.

===Sexual/gender dimorphism===

Although sexual reproduction is defined at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate within the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called DNA that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called chromosomes. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called sex chromosomes because of their role in sex determination. Ova always have the same sex chromosome, labelled X. About half of spermatozoa also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a Y-chromosome. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed above.
In humans, the "default" processes of reproduction result in an individual with female characteristics. An intact Y-chromosome contains what is needed to "reprogram" the processes sufficiently to produce male characteristics, leading to sexual differentiation. Part of the Y-chromosome, the Sex-determining Region Y (SRY), causes what would normally become ovaries to become testes. These, in turn, produce male hormones called androgens. However, several points in the processes have been identified where variations can result in people with atypical characteristics, including atypical sexual characteristics. Terminology for atypical sexual characteristics has not stabilized. Disorder of sexual development (DSD) is used by some in preference to intersex, which is used by others in preference to pseudohermaphroditism.
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is an example of a DSD that also illustrates that female development is the default for humans. Although having one X and one Y chromosome, some people are biologically insensitive to the androgens produced by their testes. As a result, they follow the normal human processes that results in a female. Women who are XY report identifying as a woman—feeling and thinking like a woman—and, where their biology is completely insensitive to masculinizing factors, externally they look identical to other women. Unlike other women, however, they cannot produce ova, because they do not have ovaries.
The human XY system is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system—males are ZZ and females ZW.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species.

==Gender studies==

Gender studies is a field of interdisciplinary study and academic field devoted to gender, gender identity and gendered representation as central categories of analysis. This field includes Women's studies (concerning women, feminity, their gender roles and politics, and feminism), Men's studies (concerning men, masculinity, their gender roles, and politics), and LGBT studies.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | title=Gender Studies | publisher=Whitman College | accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl]

==General studies==

===Genes===

Chromosomes were likened to books (above), also like books they have been studied at more detailed levels. They contain "sentences" called genes. In fact, many of these sentences are common to multiple species. Sometimes they are organized in the same order, other times they have been "edited"—deleted, copied, changed, moved, even relocated to another "book", as species evolve. Genes are a particularly important part of understanding biological processes because they are directly associated with observable objects, outside chromosomes, called proteins, whose influence on cell chemistry can be measured. In some cases genes can also be directly associated with differences clear to the naked eye, like eye-color itself. Some of these differences are sex specific, like hairy ears. The "hairy ear" gene might be found on the Y chromosome,Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man, HAIRY EARS, Y-LINKED, although see HAIRY EARS. which explains why only men tend to have hairy ears. However, sex-limited genes on any chromosome can be expressed and "say", for example, "if you are in a male body do X, otherwise do not." The same principle explains why chimpanzees and humans are distinct, despite sharing nearly all their genes.
The study of genetics is particularly inter-disciplinary. It is relevant to almost every biological science. It is investigated in detail by molecular level sciences, and itself contributes details to high level abstractions like evolutionary theory.

===Brain===

"It is well established that men have a larger cerebrum than women by about 8–10% (Filipek et al., 1994; Nopoulos et al.,
2000; Passe et al., 1997a,b; Rabinowicz et al., 1999; Witelson et al., 1995)."[tpl]cite journal|pmid=15734366|year=2005|last1=Haier|first1=RJ|last2=Jung|first2=RE|last3=Yeo|first3=RA|last4=Head|first4=K|last5=Alkire|first5=MT|title=The neuroanatomy of general intelligence: Sex matters|volume=25|issue=1|pages=320–7|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.11.019|journal=NeuroImage[/tpl] Page 324 for cerebrum difference of 8–10%.[tpl]cite journal|author=McDaniel, Michael A. |url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Big-Brained%20article.pdf |title=Big-Brained People are Smarter: A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between In Vivo Brain Volume and Intelligence|journal=Intelligence|volume=33|year=2005|pages=337–346|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.11.005|issue=4[/tpl]
However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring". Richard J. Haier and colleagues at the universities of New Mexico and California (Irvine) found, using brain mapping, that men have more grey matter related to general intelligence than women, and women have more white matter related to intelligence than men – the ratio between grey and white matter is 4% higher for men than women.
Grey matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.[tpl]cite journal|author=Tamminga, Carol A. |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/156/3/352 |title=Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=156|year=1999|pages= 352|pmid=10080547|last2=Kennedy|first2=DN|last3=Caviness Jr|first3=VS|issue=3[/tpl]
Most of these differences are produced by hormonal activity, ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences that arise directly from gene activity have also been observed.
