===Mathematics and formal sciences===

Mathematics is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting measurements, as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus, for example, are all essential to physics. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including "pure" areas such as number theory and topology.
Statistical methods, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.
Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering, SIAM Working Group on CSE Education. Retrieved 2008-04-27.
Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems, rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method. In general, mathematics is classified as formal science, while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences.[tpl]Cite book| title = Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory | author = Bunge, Mario Augusto | year = 1998 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 0-7658-0413-1 | page = 24[/tpl]

===Basic and applied research===

Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when, allegedly in response to the question "what is the use of basic research?" he responded "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".[tpl]cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough — Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2012-02-05[/tpl] For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[tpl]harvnb|Stanovich|2007|pp= 106–110[/tpl]
In a nutshell: Basic research is the search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.

===Research in practice===

Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602–602|doi=10.1038/493602a|year=2013[/tpl] D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.

===Practical impacts of scientific research===

Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing. For example:
|-
| Research || Impact
|-
| [tpl]nowrap|The strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research[/tpl]
leading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916) ||  Satellite-based technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communicationsEvicting Einstein, March 26, 2004, NASA. "Both and quantum mechanics are extremely successful. The Global Positioning System (GPS), for instance, wouldn't be possible without the theory of relativity. Computers, telecommunications, and the Internet, meanwhile, are spin-offs of quantum mechanics."
|-
| Radioactivity (1896) and antimatter (1932) || Cancer treatment (1896), nuclear reactors (1942) and weapons (1945), PET scans (1961), and medical research (via isotopic labeling)
|-
| Germ theory (1700) || Hygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted anticancer therapies.
|-
| Static electricity and magnetism (1600) || All modern electronics, including electric lighting, television, electric heating, magnetic tape, loudspeaker, plus the compass and lightning rod.
|-
| Crystallography and quantum mechanics (1900) ||  Semiconductor devices (1906), hence modern computing and telecommunications including the integration with wireless devices: the mobile phone
|-
| Diffraction (1665) || Optics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet
|-
| Photovoltaic effect (1839) || Solar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar powered watches, calculators and other devices.
|-
| Radio waves (1887) || Radio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio (1906) entertainment. Other uses included – emergency services, radar (navigation and weather prediction), medicine, astronomy, wireless communications, and networking. Radio waves also led researchers to adjacent frequencies such as microwaves, used worldwide for heating and cooking food.
|-
| Vaccination (1798) || Leading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.

==Scientific community==

The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant.

===Branches and fields===

Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: natural sciences, which study natural phenomena (including biological life), and social sciences, which study human behavior and societies. These groupings are empirical sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.[tpl]sfn|Popper|2002|p=20[/tpl] There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences, such as engineering and medicine. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.See: [tpl]cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 [/tpl]
Mathematics, which is classified as a formal science,[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB |author= Tomalin, Marcus |year=2006| title=Linguistics and the Formal Sciences |doi=10.2277/0521854814 |publisher=Cambridge.org |accessdate=2012-02-05[/tpl]Benedikt Löwe (2002) "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity" has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods.[tpl]sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11[/tpl] The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws,[tpl]sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82[/tpl] both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).

===Institutions===

Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance period.[tpl]cite web| last=Parrott | first=Jim | date=August 9, 2007 | url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/1599andearlier.html | title=Chronicle for Societies Founded from 1323 to 1599 | publisher=Scholarly Societies Project | accessdate=2007-09-11[/tpl] The oldest surviving institution is the Italian [tpl]lang|it|Accademia dei Lincei[/tpl] which was established in 1603.[tpl]cite web| year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=2007-09-11[/tpl] The respective National Academies of Science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British Royal Society in 1660[tpl]cite web| url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ | title= History of the Royal Society | publisher=The Royal Society | accessdate=2011-10-16[/tpl] and the French [tpl]lang|fr|Académie des Sciences[/tpl] in 1666.[tpl]cite web| first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=2011-10-13[/tpl]
International scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include, the National Science Foundation in the U.S., the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, the academies of science of many nations, CSIRO in Australia, [tpl]lang|fr|Centre national de la recherche scientifique[/tpl] in France, Max Planck Society and [tpl]lang|de|Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft[/tpl] in Germany, and in Spain, CSIC.
