==History==

The firm was founded in 1984 by Keith Schilling and Nicholas Lom and focused largely on media law, libel, and privacy protection. It soon became known as the scourge of many Fleet Street editors for obtaining anonymised gagging orders to protect celebrity clients' privacy.http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/09/schillings-trollhunters-general/ In the early 2010s, the firm began to move away from pure media and libel work towards reputation protection for a largely corporate, non-celebrity clientele.http://www.thelawyer.com/news/practice-areas/media-entertainment-and-sport-news/schillings-relaunches-as-privacy-and-cyber-security-firm/3009097.article
