The Ford Taurus is an automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in the United States. Originally introduced in the 1986 model year, it has remained in near-continuous production for more than two decades, making it the fourth-oldest nameplate that is currently sold in the North American Ford lineup.The only vehicles in Ford's current North American product line that have been in production longer than the Taurus are the Ford Ranger, Ford Mustang, and Ford F-150. It has had a more-upscale Mercury-branded version entitled the Sable (1986–2005; 2008–2009), as well as a performance variant, the Ford Taurus SHO (1989–1999 and 2010–); in addition, it served as the basis for the first-ever front-wheel drive Lincoln Continental (1988–1994). It was a front-wheel drive mid-size car until 2007, and has been a full-size car since 2008, and available in front- or all-wheel drive since 2008. It has been built on the D3 platform since 2008.
The original Taurus was a milestone design for Ford and the entire American automotive industry, as well as a very influential vehicle that brought many new features and innovations to the marketplace. Since its launch in 1986, Ford had built 7,519,919 Tauruses through the 2007 model year,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specs/Production.php |title=Production Figures |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=2009-09-25[/tpl] making it the fifth-best-selling North American nameplate in Ford's history; only the F-150,[tpl]cite web | last = O'Neil | first = Mike| date = | url = http://www.ford-trucks.com/news/idx/12/247/2005/article/01122005 "Ford's F-Series sets industry truck sales records | title = Ford's F-series sets industry sales truck records| publisher = Ford Trucks.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] Escort,[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | date = 2000-07-21 | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5429 | title = Farewell, Ford Escort | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] Model T,[tpl]cite web | last = O'Neill | first = Mike | date = 2004-05-05 | url = http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015154444/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=17697 | archivedate = 2007-10-15 | title = Ford Nameplates join Five Million Club | publisher = Media.Ford.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] and Mustang have sold more units.

The 2000–2007 Tauruses were built on the D186 which was a modified DN 101 platform.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, sales of the Taurus declined as it lost market share to Japanese midsize sedans and as Ford shifted resources towards developing SUVs. It was discontinued in 2006, with production initially ending on October 27, 2006, and 2007 being the last model year.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,225932,00.html | date = 2006-10-27 | publisher = Fox News | title = Last Taurus Rolls Off Ford Assembly Line | accessdate = 2006-10-27[/tpl] Ford had decided to replace the Taurus with the fullsize Five Hundred and midsize Fusion sedans, as well as replacing the Taurus wagon with the Freestyle crossover SUV. However, Ford revived the Taurus name during the 2007 Chicago Auto Show a few months later by renaming two new models that had been intended to be updated versions of the Five Hundred and the Freestyle, the "2008 Taurus" and "2008 Taurus X", respectively.[tpl]cite web | url = http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25372 | title = 2008 Ford Taurus features more power, style, and more standard safety features | publisher = Media.

The 2013 model was unveiled at the New York Auto Show and received minor exterior changes, and interior technology options.

==First generation (1986–1991)==

The first-generation Taurus was launched in 1985 as a 1986 model to strong fanfare and sales, replacing the slow-selling mid-size Ford Granada-based Ford LTD. (The full-size Ford LTD Crown Victoria remained as part of the Ford line up.) The release of the Ford Taurus was one of the most anticipated ever, mostly because it was a first in car design and also the start of new quality standards for Ford. At the time of the Taurus's debut, Ford had been producing mainly rear-wheel drive cars, and Chrysler and General Motors were offering more front-wheel drive vehicles up to midrange including the Chrysler K platform and A-body Chevrolet Celebrity. With the introduction of the Escort and Tempo, Ford was making a transition to front-wheel drive. The Taurus displayed a rounder shape than its contemporaries, often likened to a 'jelly bean' or 'flying potato',[tpl]cite news | last = Schneiderman | first = R.M. | date = 2006-10-27 | publisher = Forbes | url = http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/27/ford-taurus-demise-cx_rs_1027autofacescan01.html | title = Ford Taurus, R.I.P.| accessdate = 2007-06-29[/tpl] inspired by the design of the Audi 5000 and Ford's own Tempo, an updated appearance of a styling approach used in the late 1940s to early 1960s called "ponton" styling. Instead of a grille, the Taurus mainstreamed the smooth grille-less 'bottom breather' nose. The aerodynamic design of the Taurus made the car more fuel efficient, allowing Ford to meet more stringent corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard applied by the United States government. The Taurus's success ultimately led to an American automobile design revolution; Chrysler and General Motors developed aerodynamic cars in order to capitalize on the Taurus' success.[tpl]Cite book | title = Taurus: The Making of the Car That Saved Ford | first = Eric | last = Taub |date=November 1991 | isbn = 0-525-93372-7 | publisher = E. P. Dutton[/tpl]
The first generation was available with either a V6 or an inline four-cylinder engine and came with either a manual or automatic transmission. (The Taurus's twin, the Mercury Sable, has never offered a manual transmission in either of its incarnations.) Like its exterior, the Taurus's interior was ahead of its time, and many features originating from it are still used in most cars today. Its interior was designed to be extremely user-friendly, with all of its controls designed to be recognizable by touch, allowing drivers to operate them without taking their eyes off the road. For example, the switches to the power windows and power locks were designed with one half of the switch raised up, with the other half recessed, in order for its function to be identified by touch. To further enhance this quality, the car's dashboard had all of the controls in the central area within reach of the driver. The left side of the dash curved slightly around the driver to make controls easily accessible, as well as creating a "cockpit" feel. However, it wasn't curved enough to prevent the passenger from easily identifying and using the vehicle's main controls as well.
The interior of the Taurus was customizable to fit buyers' needs, with a large number of options and three different configurations. This meant that the interior of the Taurus could be spartan or luxurious, depending on the buyer's choice of options. On models with an automatic transmission, the Taurus' interior was available in three different seating configurations.The interior could be ordered with a traditional column-mounted shifter and front bench seat, with bucket seats and a center console with a floor-mounted shifter, or with bucket seats and a console with a column-mounted shifter. (These options were also extended to the Sable and, beginning in 1988, the Lincoln Continental as well.) However, models available with a manual transmission were only available in one configuration: bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter. The interior equipment depended on model. The most basic model, the L (see below), came standard, with just an AM radio and a front cloth bench seat, while the LX, the more luxurious model, came with a greater number of features as standard equipment.
The Taurus was well received by both the public and the press. It won many awards, most notably being named to the 1986 Car and Driver Ten Best List and becoming the 1986 Motor Trend Car of the Year[tpl]Cite journal | last = Hanson | first = John | title = Car of the Year 1986: It is Going To Be a Bull Market For The Ford Taurus | journal = Motor Trend | issue = February 1986 | pages = 23–36 | accessdate = 2007-08-12[/tpl]  Over 200,000 Tauruses were sold during the 1986 model year and the millionth Taurus was sold during the 1989 model year.  When production ended in 1991, more than 2,000,000 first-generation Tauruses had been sold.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Taurus Car Club of America | url = http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/Specs/Production.php | title = 1986–1997 Ford Taurus production numbers| accessdate = 2008-09-12[/tpl]

==Second generation (1992–1995)==

The Taurus received its first cosmetic update in 1991. The second generation dropped the manual transmission and the four-cylinder engine, resulting in all second-generation vehicles (with the exception of the Taurus SHO) with automatic transmissions and V6 engines. Length was increased by a few inches, and weight was up a couple of hundred pounds over the previous generation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G2/index.php |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide: Second Generation (1992–1995) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2008-04-05[/tpl] Every body panel, except for the doors, were redesigned. However, many of the redesigned components closely resembled that of the previous generation, leading many to falsely believe that this generation was just a minor face-lift.
The interior was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, was designed to be user friendly. All of the vehicle's main controls were located near the left side of the dash to be within easy reach of the driver. As in the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch and to be operated by drivers without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed drivers to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. The radio was also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger side airbag, making this the first time that a passenger side airbag was offered in a mainstream sedan. It was optional in 1992 and became standard in 1994, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to offer standard dual front airbags.
This generation sold just as well as the first, and became the best-selling car in the United States, a title it would retain for as long as this generation was sold. When production ended in 1995, more than 1,400,000 second-generation cars had been sold.

==Third generation (1996–1999)==

The 1996 model year saw the first complete redesign of the Taurus. It used a controversial new shape that chief designer Jack Telnack claimed was penned to make the Taurus stand out to sedan buyers, and likened the current Taurus to a pair of slippers.[tpl]cite journal| last =Sedgwick| first =David| title =Taurus for '96 will dare to stand out in competitive sedan market| journal =The Detroit News| issue =| pages =1C–2C| accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] This shape was based upon an oval, which was perhaps inspired by Ford's own logo,[tpl]cite book|title=Car: A Drama of The American Workplace|first=Mary|last=Walton|date=May 1997|publisher=W. W. Norton| isbn = 0-393-04080-1[/tpl] and while the previous Taurus used a flat, streamlined shape, this Taurus used a rounded shape similar to that of the Chrysler Concorde. Station wagons also got new sheet metal, although from the firewall back, the Taurus and Mercury Sable wagons again shared the same panels, with all station-wagon doors being the same as those used on the Sable sedans. As the new-generation Taurus was aimed at a more mature, affluent customer base, its exterior contained many upscale styling touches. For example, the LX offered optional chrome alloy wheels and optional chrome dual-exhaust tips. This newer model also displayed a "Taurus" badge on the back written in script, as opposed to the block letters used in previous generations.
The interior was also completely redesigned for the 1996 model year. Like that of the previous two generations, the interior was designed to be user-friendly. The dashboard wrapped slightly around the driver; all of the main controls were placed within easy reach and were designed to be recognizable by touch. The controls for the radio and climate control were combined into an oval-shaped "Integrated Control Panel" mounted in the center of the dash, which was created in response to many complaints from Taurus owners that they couldn't easily operate the main controls of the radios and climate-control systems without taking their eyes off the road.[tpl]cite journal| last =Pierson| first =John| title =How Ford Added a Dash of Design To Its New Taurus| journal =Chicago Sun-Times| issue =| pages =| accessdate = 2008-04-05[/tpl] Another new innovation was the "Flip-Fold" center console, in which on bench seat-equipped cars, the middle section could be transformed into a console; the seat cushion folded out into a console with a lockable storage bin and cupholders, while the seatback folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped with bucket seats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G3/index.php |title=Taurus/Sable Spotter's Guide Generation 3 |work=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-02-25[/tpl]
Reaction to this new generation of Taurus was mixed. Ford found that customers were turned off by the car's oval shape, and although it managed to retain its title as the best-selling car in the United States, this was only because of heavy sales to rental fleets; 51% of all Taurus sales for 1996 went to rental fleets, in contrast to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, of which most sales were to private customers through retail outlets.[tpl]Cite book | title = Encyclopedia of American Cars | first = The Editors of Consumer Guide | last = | year = 2006 | month = | isbn = 1-4127-1354-4 | publisher = Publications International[/tpl] In 1997, the Taurus would lose its best-selling status to the Camry. This Taurus (sedan only) was sold in Australia as a "Taurus Ghia" alongside the locally produced Ford Falcon, but imports ceased in 1998 due to poor sales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.drive.com.au/drive/used-car-reviews/ford-taurus-19961998-20100824-13o9c.html |title=Ford Taurus 1996–1998|accessdate=2009-10-07[/tpl] Both the sedan and station wagon Taurus were sold in New Zealand and both were quite popular, considering the fact that most New Zealand's Fords were also the imported Australian Falcons.

===NASCAR===

The third-generation Taurus had a presence in NASCAR, replacing the Thunderbird after the 1997 season.  The Taurus became the first sedan to be approved for competition.HowStuffWorks "1998 NASCAR Winston Cup Chronology"  The first Taurus driver to win the Winston Cup (now Sprint Cup) championship was Dale Jarrett, who drove #88 Ford Quality Care/Ford Credit-sponsored cars owned by Robert Yates.  The first Taurus driver to win the Busch Series (now Nationwide Series) championship was Greg Biffle, who drove #60 Grainger Industrial Supply-sponsored cars owned by Jack Roush.  In total, Tauruses have won three Winston Cup championships and two Busch Series championships.

==Fourth generation (2000–2007)==

The Taurus received another redesign for 2000, which replaced many of the oval-derived design elements of the previous model with squarer ones. To reduce the car's price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan rear drum brakes on ABS equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the dual exhaust on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.
Ford designed the fourth generation with much more conservative styling in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, the car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, increasing trunk space by another two cubic feet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2000-to-2006-ford-taurus.htm |title=2000–2006 Ford Taurus overview |publisher=Consumer Guide |accessdate=2007-02-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ford-taurus.org/taurusinfo/G4/index.php |title=Taurus/Sable spotter's guide (Generation 4 2000–2007) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |accessdate=2008-04-06[/tpl] The roof was also given a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be evidenced by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof.
The interior was also completely redesigned with a more conventional shape, although some features from the previous Taurus generations were carried over. The dashboard was given a squarer design instead of curving around the driver as in the previous generation. The "integrated control panel" concept was carried over but redesigned, with a bigger, squarer shape, and it was placed in the center of the dash instead of being angled toward the driver. The flip-fold center console was also carried over from the previous generation, although it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had reworked cup holders and storage areas. In another change from previous versions, the fourth generation offered rear cup holders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with.

==Initial discontinuation and revival==

Taurus ltd sales had slumped significantly in the years prior to its short-lived demise in 2006, losing significant market share to Japanese sedans. Due to waning popularity and customer demand, Ford decided to gradually discontinue the Taurus. The last Chicago, Illinois Ford Taurus Sedan rolled off the assembly line on June 25, 2004.  Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued on December 8, 2004; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to fleets in the United States, while still being sold to retail customers in Canada. Production ended on October 27, 2006, as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of its The Way Forward restructuring plan.

Workers thought Ford had abandoned a car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. An October 25, 2006, USA Today editorial, "How Ford starved its Taurus", noted that the Japanese stuck with their winners and make them better (such as the Toyota Corolla, which has been in continuous production since the 1960s),[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/history.html | title = Toyota Corolla history | publisher = Edmunds.com | accessdate = 2008-04-04[/tpl] while Detroit automakers retire cars and even entire division nameplates in search of "the next big thing".[tpl]cite news | title = How Ford starved its Taurus | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-10-24-ford-taurus_x.htm | publisher = USA Today | date = 2006-10-25 | accessdate = 2006-10-25[/tpl]
But Alan Mulally, Ford's new CEO named in late 2006, wanted to revive the Taurus, saying in an interview with the Associated Press that he was baffled by the Taurus's discontinuation and believed it a mistake, adding that the Five Hundred should have been named "Taurus" from the beginning.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17033668/ | title = CEO insisted in bringing "Taurus" back | publisher = MSNBC | date = 2007-02-07 | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] Rumors of a possible Taurus revival were confirmed in early 2007, when the revamped Five Hundred and Freestyles were unveiled as "Taurus" and "Taurus X" at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show, a decision influenced strongly by Mulally. Later, Mulally explained that the fact that the Taurus's name recognition and positive brand equity strongly influenced his decision to revive the nameplate.[tpl]Cite video | title = Ford CEO Alan Mulally on the new Ford Taurus | publisher = Autoinsider news | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYlNOtqI8tc | date = 2007-07-26[/tpl]

==Fifth generation (2008–2009)==

The fifth generation was developed from the Ford Five Hundred, which was scheduled for a significant styling facelift and power upgrade for the 2008 model year. Ford decided to designate that model as the Taurus to take advantage of its customer recognition and dealer demand.[tpl]cite web |title=Five Hundred To Be Renamed Taurus| url=http://www.stangbangers.com/News_FordFiveHundred.htm|publisher=stangbangers.com|accessdate=2007-07-26[/tpl] The 2008 Ford Taurus went into production in 2007 as a 2008 model. It was determined that Ford's strategy to redesignate new cars in the lineup with new names beginning with the letter F, as in Ford Focus, Ford Fusion, and Ford Freestyle, was not a good marketing move, as some of the renamed cars had highly recognizable iconic names. Car buyers in the U.S. did not associate the new F names with Ford, and were confused by the name changes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/ford-five-hundred-to-be-renamed-taurus.html |title=Five Hundred to be renamed "Taurus" |publisher=MSNBC.com |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2007-02-07[/tpl] Mulally believed that the Taurus had an immediately strong brand equity, and that it would take years for consumers to have a similar recognition of the Five Hundred.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8N48NI80.htm |author=Krisher, Tom |title=Officials say Ford to revive Taurus name |publisher=BusinessWeek.com |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2007-02-07[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]
There were more than 500 changes to the new Taurus from the existing Five Hundred, including a new front end and the 263 hp 3.5 L Duratec 35 V6, which replaces the [tpl]convert|203|hp|abbr=on[/tpl] Duratec 30 3.0 L V6. The Five Hundred/Freestyle's ZF-Batavia CVT, which had a maximum torque rating of [tpl]convert|221|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl], was also replaced with a Ford-GM joint venture six-speed automatic with additional torque of the Duratec 35. The Aisin AW six-speed automatic which was used on FWD Five Hundred and Montegos was also replaced by the new six-speed. The Taurus sedan twin, the Mercury Sable nameplate, was revived from the Mercury Montego.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/like-taurus-mercury-sable-nameplate-to-return.html |title=Like Taurus, Mercury Sable nameplate to return |publisher=Leftlanenews.com |accessdate=2007-02-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=25374 |title=Mercury Sable Returns to Showrooms With More Power, Style and Sophistication |publisher=Media.

The SE sold for $24,125 according to Ford's website and served as the base model for the vehicle.
This generation of the Taurus was sold in the Middle East as the Ford Five Hundred from 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.drivearabia.com/news/2008/02/10/so-we-got-a-ford-five-hundred/ |title=So we got a Ford Five Hundred |publisher=DriveArabia.com |accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl]

===Facelift (2013–present)===

First revealed at the 2011 New York Auto Show, the Taurus received a refresh for the 2013 model year. The body sports a new front fascia and slightly updated rear fascia with LED tail lamps, as well as all-new wheel options. The SHO model looks different from its stablemates, but power is unchanged from its EcoBoost V6, however, refinements have been made to the 3.5 EcoBoost V6. Power in the 3.5L V6, standard in non-SHO models, is up to 288 hp and is gets 19/29 MPG in FWD models, while getting 18/26MPG in AWD models. There is a new engine option for non-SHO models, a 2.0L EcoBoost Inline 4 developing 240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque while delivering a best-in-class 22/32 miles per gallon. All models received upgrades to the steering and braking systems to improve driveability. For example, Torque Vectoring and curve control has been added as standard, and controls the cars ability to glide round corners at higher speeds. Updates to the Instrument dials have been added, they are now fully digital and clearer and more colourful. MyFord Touch will also be part of Taurus's Sync system.[tpl]cite web|author=By  Steven J.
