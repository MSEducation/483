The lightning whelk, scientific name Busycon contrarium, is an edible species of very large predatory sea snail or whelk, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Buccinidae, the busycon whelks. This species has a left-handed or sinistral shell.  It eats mostly bivalves.
There is some confusion about the correct scientific name for this species, which has been called Busycon sinistrum and Busycon contrarium, and has also been confused with Busycon perversum. 

==Distribution==

This species is native to southeastern North America, south to Florida and the Gulf states.

==Habitat==

Lightning whelks can be found in the sandy or muddy substrate of shallow embayments.

==Life habits==

This whelk species feed primarily on marine bivalves, ingesting their soft parts using its proboscis.

==Busycon contrarium and B. carica==

This species shares many characteristics with another species, the knobbed whelk Busycon carica, but there are some important differences:

==Human use==

For thousands of years Native Americans used these animals as food, and used their shells for tools, ornaments, containers and to make jewelry, i.e. shell gorgets.Starr F. 1897. A Shell Gorget from Mexico. Proceeding Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences, volume VI. 173-178. They may have believed the sinistral nature of the lightning whelk shell made it a sacred object.
The lightning whelk is the State Shell of Texas.
