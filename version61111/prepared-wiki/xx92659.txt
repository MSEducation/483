The Pensioners' Party (Partito Pensionati, PP) is a centrist Italian political party. It was founded in 1987 in Milan and its current leader is Carlo Fatuzzo.
In the 2004 European Parliament election it gained 1.1% of the national vote and elected its leader to the European Parliament, where he sits in the European People's Partyâ€“European Democrats group.
On 4 February 2006, the party joined The Union, the centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi, and was decisive for the result of the 2006 general election (the PP scored 0.9% and the centre-left won by a 0.1% margin), but soon after the election the alliance with the centre-left turned to be cold and tense. In the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani (Forza Italia, Vice President of the European People's Party), tried successfully to convince Fatuzzo to return in the centre-right.
Finally, on 20 November 2006, Carlo Fatuzzo, in a press conference alongside with Antonio Tajani and Fabrizio Cicchitto (national deputy-coordinator of Forza Italia), announced that its party was re-joining the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition.
Ithe 2009 European Parliament election the party ran as part of The Autonomy, an electoral coalition inclunding also The Right, the Movement for Autonomies and the Alliance of the Centre.http://www.partitoladestra.com/?costante_pagina=polo_autonomia&id_lingua=2http://www.irispress.it/Iris/page.asp?VisImg=S&Art=33035&Cat=1&I=null&IdTipo=0&TitoloBlocco=Italia&Codi_Cate_Arti=18
