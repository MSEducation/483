Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic drug that acts by inhibiting the ability of the patient to break down complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601079.html |title=Migliotl: MedlinePlus Drug Information |author= |date=1 September 2010 |work=MedlinePlus |publisher=National Institudes of Health |accessdate=13 April 2013[/tpl]
Miglitol inhibits glycoside hydrolase enzymes called alpha-glucosidases.  Since miglitol works by preventing digestion of carbohydrates, it lowers the degree of postprandial hyperglycemia. It must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020682s010lbl.pdf|title=Glyset (miglitol) tablets label - Accessdata FDA|author= |date=August 2012 |work=Drugs@FDA|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=13 April 2013[/tpl]     Its effect will depend on the amount of non-monosaccharide carbohydrates in a person's diet.
In contrast to acarbose (another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor), miglitol is systemically absorbed; however, it is not metabolized and is excreted by the kidneys.
Recent study on rats by shrivastva et al showed that miglitol has antioxidant effect and hypocholesterolemic effect.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11745-012-3753-3 |title=Lipid Lowering and Antioxidant Effect of Miglitol in Triton Treated Hyperlipidemic and High Fat Diet Induced Obese Rats |year=2013 |last1=Shrivastava |first1=Atul |last2=Chaturvedi |first2=Upma |last3=Singh |first3=Shiv Vardan |last4=Saxena |first4=Jitendra Kumar |last5=Bhatia |first5=Gitika |journal=Lipids |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=597â€“607 |pmid=23334955[/tpl]
