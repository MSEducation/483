==The story==

The first recorded account showing a courier running from Marathon to Athens to announce victory is from within Lucian's prose on the first use of the word Joy as a greeting in A Slip of the tongue in Greeting.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vxxOw3FvOgwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+Running&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MMiBT8_iKuuV0QX40KXqBg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Pheidippedes&f=false| author=Edward Seldon Sears |title=Running Through the Ages | year= |publisher=McFarland, 2001|accessdate=2012-04-08[/tpl]
[tpl]quote |... Philippides, the one who acted as courier, is said to have used it first in our sense when he brought the news of victory from Marathon and addressed the magistrates in session when they were anxious how the battle had ended ; "Joy to you, we've won" he said, and there and then he died, breathing his last breath with the words "Joy to you". – Lucian translated by K.Kilburn.[tpl]cite book |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:M10jrgjir60J:www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1976/JSH0302/jsh0302d.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjHnmepsE4XnxVv-8feSO171wbniGsdpcEH7tEcXvrW1xlI-nQke_JOFjNEqwtkNB956Yh1O1smkWr39k0ZOWQZCf1R6yr4y6dqb8wsMDwHmU5WrJ2UlBKrDwBb0enNyWkJ261p&sig=AHIEtbT7sHGX5JO4B_Fry3ZR3MM2zXjWnw&pli=1| author=John A.

Most accounts incorrectly attribute this story to the historian Herodotus, who wrote the history of the Persian Wars in his Histories (composed about 440 BC). However, Magill and Moose (2003) suggest that the story is likely a "romantic invention." They point out that Lucian is the only classical source to which all the elements existed of the story known in modern culture as the "Marathon story of Phillipedes": a messenger running from the fields of Marathon to announce victory, then dying on completion of his mission.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wyKaVFZqbdUC&pg=PA820&dq=Marathon+runner+Philippides+Pheidippides&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-_OBT670MqOt0QXhg93iBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Marathon%20runner%20Philippides%20Pheidippides&f=false |author=Frank Northen Magill, Christina J.

Robert Browning gave a version of the traditional story in his 1879 poem Pheidippides.
("Fennel-field" is a reference to the Greek word for fennel, marathon, the origin of the name of the battlefield.)
It was this poem which inspired Baron Pierre de Coubertin and other founders of the modern Olympic Games to invent a running race of 42 km called the Marathon.
The story is controversial for anyone who suspects that Athenians would more likely have sent the messenger on horseback. However, it may have been possible that they used a runner, as a horse's movements would have been hindered by the rocky, mountainous terrain. Furthermore, humans are unusually good distance runners.  Most animals tend to collapse of hyperthermia (which in humans is called heat exhaustion) after 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 miles).http://phys.org/news95954919.html  Horses are most effectively used as couriers over long distances when they can be switched out at way-points a relatively short distance apart, such as with the American Pony Express mail service.    
In any case, no such story appears in Herodotus. The relevant passage of Herodotus (Histories, Book VI, 105...106 →http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2456/2456-h/book6.htm) is: 
The significance of this story is only understood in the light of the legend that the god Pan returned the favor by fighting with the Athenian troops and against the Persians at Marathon.  This was important because Pan, in addition to his other powers, had the capacity to instill the most extreme sort of fear, an irrational, blind fear that paralysed the mind and suspended all sense of judgment – panic.
Herodotus,  writing about 30 to 40 years after the events he describes, did, according to Miller (2006) in fact base his version of the battle on eyewitness accounts,[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3Wdh6YGXOxMC&pg=PA46&dq=Marathon+runner+Philippides+Pheidippides&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I_2BT67kD6fO0QWNmsz-Bg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Marathon%20runner%20Philippides%20Pheidippides&f=false|author=Stephen G. Miller (professor of classical archaeology at the University of California)|title=Ancient Greek Athletics | year= |publisher=Yale University Press, 1 Aug 2006|accessdate=2012-04-08|isbn=0300115296 [/tpl] so it seems altogether likely that Pheidippides was an actual  historical figure, although the same source claims the classical author didn't ever in fact mention a Marathon-Athens runner in any of his writings. For sure, if someone ran the 246 km over rough roads from Athens to Sparta within two days, it would be an achievement worthy of remembrance. Whether the story is true or not, it has no connection with the Battle of Marathon itself, and Herodotus's silence on the subject of a herald running from Marathon to Athens suggests strongly that no such event occurred.
The first known written account of a run from Marathon to Athens occurs in the works of the Greek writer Plutarch (46–120), in his essay On the Glory of Athens. Plutarch attributes the run to a herald called either Thersippus or Eukles. Lucian, a century later, credits one "Philippides." It seems likely that in the 500 years between Herodotus's time and Plutarch's, the story of Pheidippides had become muddled with that of the Battle of Marathon (particularly the story of the Athenian forces making the march from Marathon to Athens in order to intercept the Persian ships headed there), and some fanciful writer had invented the story of the run from Marathon to Athens.

==Modern times==

===Spartathlon===

Based on this account, British RAF Wing Commander John Foden and four other RAF officers travelled to Greece in 1982 on an official expedition to test whether it was possible to cover the nearly 250 kilometres in a day and a half. Three runners were successful in completing the distance: John Foden (37:37), John Scholtens (34:30) and John McCarthy in (39:00).
Since 1983 it has been an annual footrace from Athens to Sparta, known as the Spartathlon, celebrating Pheidippides's at least semi-historical run across 246 km of Greek countryside.
