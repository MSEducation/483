Admiral Sathiraphan Keyanon (Thai:สถิรพันธุ์ เกยานนท์) is a Thai naval officer, Commander of the Royal Thai Navy, and a deputy in the military junta that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a 2006 military coup.  Sathiraphan graduated from the Royal Thai Naval Academy before receiving a commission as a Captain of the Thai Coast Guard and held many key positions in the Navy.  Prior to becoming Commander of the Navy, he was the Navy's Chief of Staff.  Sathiraphan was reportedly reluctant to support the coup and did not deploy any sailers in the overthrow.
