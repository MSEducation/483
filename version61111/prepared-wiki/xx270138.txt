==History==

===Initial operations===

According to historical documents the first station building was built in 1867, during the construction of the Palatine Ludwig Railway between Homburg and St. Ingbert. For several years the station remained a terminus, and it was not until the 1870s when a line to Saarbrücken was constructed. Because of an increase in passengers a new station building was also necessary. The building which is still in use today is situated on the south side of the platforms opposite its predecessor.

===Interregio services===

From the early 1970s the station was a stop for Interregio fast trains operating to destinations as far as Berlin and Paris as well as semi-fast and stopping regional services. However, after a timetable change in 1991 and the introduction of an Interregio service between Stuttgart and Frankfurt-am-Main the services were cancelled completely.

==Architecture==

St. Ingbert station is a typical example of the style used in Saarland stations at the time. The most prominent aspect of this can be found in the arched windows on the ground floor and the rectangular ones on the first floor. Additionally, the sobriety of the design and the lack of vertical structure are typical. However, the single entrance through an avant-corps is unusual.http://bahnhoefe-im-saarland.2bnew.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=21:st-ingbert-2-eg&catid=3:katalog&Itemid=10
