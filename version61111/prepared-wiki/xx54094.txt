[[Aleutian Range]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of Alaska, Volcanic arcs, Aleutian Range

The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range of southwest Alaska, extending from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the Peninsula. It is especially notable for its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc.  The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation "Aleutian Range" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island.
The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane.
The core Aleutian Range can be divided into three mountain groups. Listed from southwest to northeast, they are:
