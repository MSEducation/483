CATEGORIES: Organisations serving Indigenous Australians, Indigenous Australian media

The Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA) is an organisation founded in 1980 by Freda Glynn, Phillip Batty and John Macumba in order to expose Aboriginal music and culture to the rest of Australia from its Alice Springs media centre through the film-making industry, commencing broadcast in 1988.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.womenaustralia.info/exhib/cal/glynn.html | title = Freda Glynn | accessdate = 2011-08-22 | last = Lemon | first = Barbara | work = National Foundation for Australian Women | publisher = Australian Women's Archives Project[/tpl] CAAMA is Productions is currently the largest indigenous production house in Australia.[tpl]Cite web | title = CAAMA Music | work = Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association  | publisher = CAAMA | url = http://caama.com.au/productions/about-us | accessdate = 22 August 2011 [/tpl]
The organisation is particularly focused on the involvement of the local indigenous community in their production. It has been argued that the establishment of CAAMA and the spread of communications technology could threaten the relationship between generations and the respect for traditional knowledge.Ginsburg, F: "Aboriginal media and the Australian imaginary",page 96.

==History==

===Origins and Imparja===

In 1980, CAAMA originally established itself as a public radio station by two Aboriginal people and one ‘whitefella’. The success of the station quickly grew, leading its content to extend into music (country-western and Aboriginal rock), call-ins, discussion, and news and current affairs. Broadcasts were made in six different languages, alongside English, and operated about fifteen hours every day. Later expansions saw the station move into AM and shortwave broadcasts with educational programmes, live recordings of Aboriginal bands, and commercials for local Aboriginal products and services. In 1984, CAAMA started to produce a video newsletter to circulate to those communities without easy access to radio facilities. 
CAAMA obtained its Regional Commercial Television Services license in 1986 after concern was raised that Australia’s first satellite (AUSSAT), which was set to bring commercial television to regional and remote sections of Australia, would have a detrimental impact on Aboriginal languages and cultures in Central Australia (Bell 2008).[tpl]cite book|last=Bell|first=Wendy|title=A Remote Possibility: The Battle for Imparja Television|year=2008|publisher=IAD Press|location=Alice Springs|isbn=978-1-86465-097-6|chapter=2|month=May[/tpl] As such, CAAMA made a bid to obtain the licence being offered in 1985 via the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Central Zone RCTS licence hearings process. Ginsberg (1993)Ginsburg, Faye (1993) Embedded Aesthetics: Creating A Discursive Space for Indigenous Media," Cultural Anthropology 9(2) notes their bid was a symbolic act that was then taken seriously, as “the tribunal provided the arena for the articulation of national media policies at least nominally in support of the concerns of remote-living Aboriginal people.” (1993:n.p.) In January, 1988 the private commercial television station they owned, Imparja, began broadcasting, servicing at least 100,000 viewers in Central Australia (Batty 1992).Batty, Philip (1992). “Singing the Electric: Aboriginal Television in Australia.” Unpublished Manuscript 
Imparja had contributed to a visible increase of Aboriginal identity in the Australian media landscape. The station was crucial in developing content which attempted to maintain and sustain Aboriginal culture. One example included "Nganampa-Anwernekenbe" Ours, the first entirely indigenous language television programme sub-titled in English produced in Australia, which reflected Aboriginal culture through story telling and unique performing and visual arts content. Another were the "Bath Time Good Time" cleanliness and "Cus Congress" anti alcohol community service advertisements which aimed to promote better life style and health in a culturally appropriate and effective manner. 1991 saw a turn to independently created films about, or created by, Aboriginal people. The series of films lasted several months and aired every Saturday during its production season. 
During the first few years of Imparja, CAAMA faced growing concerns from media activists that commercial programming would consume local content (Michaels 1984). Other concerns were raised of the lack of Aboriginal presence in Imparja’s programming (Batty 1992) that, although Imparja was the largest television enterprise owned by Aboriginal people in Australia, only 10% its staff were Aboriginal (Ginsburg 1993); that some broadcasts reflected a lack of sufficient Aboriginal programming content; and others raised issues of broadcast quality (Molnar 1989).Molnar, Helen (1989). “Aboriginal Broadcasting in Australia: Challenges and Promises.” Paper presented at the International Communication Association Conference, March 1989 In saying this, the importance of CAAMA’s multi-media based approached has ensured that Aboriginal media is an important part to the Australian media landscape and to the social, cultural, and economic development of Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia, as seen by CAAMA’s recent employment policies. American anthropologist Faye Ginsburg who has written extensively on Indigenous/Aboriginal media in Australia writes:
"Aboriginal media products are as various as Aboriginal life itself, ranging from low-budget videos made by community-based media associations for both traditional people in remote settlements and groups throughout Central Australia by organisations such as the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA); to legal or instructional videos (often quite creative) made by land councils as well as health and other service groups; to documentaries and current affairs for national broadcasting; to independent features directed by cosmopolitan Aboriginal artists such as Tracey Moffatt whose first feature film, Bedevil, premiered at Cannes in 1993." (1994:366)[ref]Ginsburg, Faye (1991). "Indigenous Media:  Faustian Contract or Global Village?" Cultural Anthropology, 6(1): 92–112.

CAAMA works in a broader landscape of Aboriginal/Indigenous media organisations based in Australia. Some other organisations include Gadigal Information Service, Goolarri Media Enterprise/Broome Aboriginal Media Association, Top End Aboriginal Bush Broadcasting Association, and the National Indigenous Times.

===Recent History and Employment Initiatives===

In 2005 CAAMA submitted a report to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs’ inquiry into Indigenous employment.http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/atsia/indigenousemployment/subs/sub032.pdf The report outlined several ways government leaders could access future policy in regards to Indigenous employment, using CAAMA as a case study. Some key issues CAAMA raised included: skills training; funding; recruitment; increase in Indigenous population; youth employment; strengthening links between education and training; establish and sustain networks between the private and public sectors, alongside the community; and collaborate with pre-existing organisations in training Aboriginal people. 
The second section of the report outlined how CAAMA has contributed to the training and employment of Aboriginal people in Central Australia. In their twenty-five years of operations CAAMA has an active ‘aboriginalisation policy,’ which means 65% of employees are Aboriginal.  CAAMA has also assisted in the education of over 100 Indigenous people, of whom a majority of their trainees were part of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy (1988–1993). CAAMA suggest that their success has been afforded by the commitment of government; implementation of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy; an understanding of social, cultural, and economic issues impacting Aboriginal people; and their flexible learning environment. 
Since 2009 CAAMA has development a business plan to identity ways to enhance their viability and sustainability with less reliance on government funding, and to increase new opportunities in New Media products and other related services and products.
