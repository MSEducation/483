Come Walk With Me is an album by the American vocalist, pianist and songwriter Oleta Adams and was released in 1997. 

==History==

Come Walk With Me is Adams' first gospel music album. Adams, being the daughter of a minister, had been trained in singing gospel music since she was a child, and sang at her local church choir. Gospel music was always a strong influence in her previous recordings, but it was never fully explored as in this album.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
It was her first album after leaving Mercury Records, which had released her previous three studio albums and a compilation. Adams signed to Christian music label Harmony Records to release the album. The record was co-produced by Adams and Michael J. Powell, who had also produced some songs on Adams' previous album Moving On.
The album was well-received critically, and charted in the top 10 of the US Billboard Gospel and Christian charts. The songs "Holy Is The Lamb" and "This Love Won't Fail" were released as radio-only singles.
Adams contributed the Christmas song "A Child Was Born Into My Life" for a compilation album titled Christmas Harmony in 1998, after which she left Harmony Records.
