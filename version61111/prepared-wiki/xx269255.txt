==History==

The old church site for Fosnes was located here from 1250 until 1896 when the church burned down.  After that there was much debate about where the church should be rebuilt. It was determined that the new parish church, Dun Church, should be set up in Dun, in the middle of the island of Jøa.  This little chapel was built at the site of the old Fosnes church, next to the cemetery which is still in use.
