==Biography==

A two-year letterman at Fresno State, Setencich graduated with a degree in biological sciences in 1969 and served in the U.S. Army. He began his coaching career as a high school assistant coach at Mount Diablo High School in Concord, and was later the head coach at Albany High School and San Ramon High School, all in northern California.  He moved to collegiate coaching in 1979 as the defensive coordinator at Boise State under head coach Jim Criner. He held the position for four seasons and helped lead the team to the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship in 1980 and the semifinals in 1981.  When Criner departed after the 1982 season for Iowa State, Setencich was promoted to head coach of Boise State.  Setencich posted a 24–20 record in four seasons at Boise State.  His final season in 1986 was the first losing campaign (5–6) for the program in four decades.  He resigned following the season and immediately became head coach at Cal Poly, where he led the Division II program to a 41–29–2 mark in seven seasons (1987–1993). He later coached at Pacific (1994) under Chuck Shelton, Arizona State (1995–1996) under Bruce Snyder, and California (1997–2001) under Tom Holmoe.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.calbears.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/setencich_lyle00.html |title=Player Bio: Lyle Setencich |author= |date= |work=The University of California Official Athletic Site |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=October 13, 2011 [/tpl] In 2003, he became defensive coordinator at Texas Tech under head coach Mike Leach.
