Lucy Eldine Gonzalez Parsons (c. 1853 – March 7, 1942) was an American labor organizer, radical socialist and anarchist communist. She is remembered as a powerful orator. Parsons entered the radical movement following her marriage to newspaper editor Albert Parsons and moved with him from Texas to Chicago, where she contributed to the newspaper he famously edited, The Alarm. Following her husband's 1887 execution in conjunction with the Haymarket Affair, Parsons remained a leading American radical activist as a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and other political organizations.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Lucy (or Lucia) Eldine Gonzalez was born around 1853 in Texas, probably as a slave, to parents of Native American, African American and Mexican ancestry.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lucyparsonsproject.org/about_lucyparsons.html |title=About Lucy Parsons |publisher= The Lucy Parsons Project |accessdate=August 10, 2010|quote=Born in Texas, 1853, probably as a slave, Lucy Parsons was an African-, Native- and Mexican-American anarchist labor activist who fought against the injustices of poverty, racism, capitalism and the state her entire life.[/tpl] In 1871 she married Albert Parsons, a former Confederate soldier. They were forced to flee north from Texas due to intolerant reactions to their interracial marriage. They settled in Chicago, Illinois.
Lucy Parsons' origins are not documented, and she told different stories about her background so it's difficult to sort fact from myth. Lucy was probably born a slave, though she denied any African heritage, claiming only Native American and Mexican ancestry. Her name before marriage to Albert Parsons was Lucy Gonzalez. She may have been married before 1871 to Oliver Gathing.[tpl]cite web|title=About Lucy Parsons|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/socialism/p/lucy_parsons.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=15 May 2013[/tpl]

===Career as activist===

Described by the Chicago Police Department as "more dangerous than a thousand rioters" in the 1920s, Parsons and her husband had become highly effective anarchist organizers primarily involved in the labor movement in the late 19th century, but also participating in revolutionary activism on behalf of political prisoners, people of color, the homeless and women. She began writing for The Socialist and The Alarm, the journal of the International Working People's Association (IWPA) that she and Parsons, among others, founded in 1883. In 1886 her husband, who had been heavily involved in campaigning for the eight-hour day, was arrested, tried and executed on November 11, 1887, by the state of Illinois on charges that he had conspired in the Haymarket Riot — an event which was widely regarded as a political frame-up and which marked the beginning of May Day labor rallies in protest.[tpl]cite book |last=Trachtenberg |first=Alexander |title=The History of May Day |origyear=1932 |url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/mayday/articles/tracht.html |accessdate=2008-01-19 |date=March 2002 |publisher=Marxists.org [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Foner |first=Philip S. |authorlink=Philip Foner |title=May Day: A Short History of the International Workers' Holiday, 1886-1986 |year=1986 |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 |pages=27–39 |chapter= The First May Day and the Haymarket Affair[/tpl]
Parsons was invited to write for the French anarchist journal Les Temps Nouveaux[tpl]cite web|title=Lucy Parsons: American Anarchist|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/lucy-parsons-american-anarchist|publisher=Anarchist Writers|accessdate=Aug 14, 2013[/tpl] and shared a stage with Peter Kropotkin during a visit to London in 1888.
In 1892 she briefly published a periodical, Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly. She was often arrested for giving public speeches or distributing anarchist literature. While she continued championing the anarchist cause, she came into ideological conflict with some of her contemporaries, including Emma Goldman, over her focus on class politics over gender and sexual struggles."Lucy Parsons: Woman Of Will." Industrial Workers of the World.
In 1905 she participated in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and began editing the Liberator, an anarchist newspaper that supported the IWW in Chicago. Lucy's focus shifted somewhat to class struggles around poverty and unemployment, and she organized the Chicago Hunger Demonstrations in January 1915, which pushed the American Federation of Labor, the Socialist Party, and Jane Addams' Hull House to participate in a huge demonstration on February 12. Parsons was also quoted as saying: "My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in and take possession of the necessary property of production."Wobblies! 14 Parsons anticipated the sit-down strikes in the US and, later, workers' factory takeovers in Argentina.
In 1925 she began working with the National Committee of the International Labor Defense in 1927, a communist-led organization that defended labor activists and unjustly-accused African Americans such as the Scottsboro Nine and Angelo Herndon. While it is commonly accepted by nearly all biographical accounts (including those of the Lucy Parsons Center, the IWW, and Joe Knowles) that Parsons joined the Communist Party in 1939, there is some dispute, notably in Gale Ahrens' essay "Lucy Parsons: Mystery Revolutionist, More Dangerous Than A Thousand Rioters", which can be found in the anthology Lucy Parsons: Freedom, Equality, Solidarity. Ahrens also points out, in "Lucy Parsons: Freedom, Equality and Solidarity: Writings and Speeches, 1878 - 1937", that the obituary the Communist Party had published on her death made no claim that she had been a member.

===Conflict with Emma Goldman===

Emma Goldman and Lucy Parsons represented different generations of anarchism. This resulted in ideological and personal conflict. Carolyn Ashbaugh has explained their disagreements in depth:[tpl]bquote|Lucy Parsons' feminism, which analyzed women's oppression as a function of capitalism, was founded on working class values. Emma Goldman’s feminism took on an abstract character of freedom for women in all things, in all times, and in all places; her feminism became separate from its working class origins. Goldman represented the feminism being advocated in the anarchist movement of the 1890s after. The intellectual anarchists questioned Lucy Parsons about her attitudes on the women's question.[tpl]Cite book| last=Ashbaugh |first= Carolyn |title=Lucy Parsons: American Revolutionary|publisher=Charles H. Kerr Publishing |location= Chicago| year=1976 |isbn=0-88286-005-4[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1908, after Captain Mahoney (of the New York City Police Department) crashed one of Goldman’s lectures in Chicago, newspaper headlines read that every popular anarchist had been present for the spectacle, “with the single exception of Lucy Parsons, with whom Emma Goldman is not on the best of terms.”Daily Tribune (March 17, 1908); quoted in Falk, Love…, p. 65 Goldman reciprocated Parsons’s absence by endorsing Frank Harris' book The Bomb, which was a largely fictional account of the Haymarket Affair and its martyrs road to death.[tpl]Cite book|last=Falk|first=Candace|title=Anarchy, Love, and Emma Goldman|page=66|isbn=0-03-043626-5[/tpl] (Parsons had published The Famous Speeches of the Haymarket Martyrs, a non-fictional, first-hand recounting of the Haymarket martyrs' final speeches in court.)
Parsons was solely dedicated to working class liberation, condemning Goldman for “addressing large middle-class audiences”; Goldman accused Parsons of riding upon the cape of her husband’s martyrdom. “No doubt,” Candace Falk wrote (Love, Anarchy, and Emma Goldman), “there was an undercurrent of competitiveness between the two women. Emma generally preferred center stage.” Goldman planned on preserving her place in the spotlight as an American anarchist laureate by shoving risqué sexual and kinship discourse into “the center of a perennial debate among anarchists about the relative importance of such personal issues”.
In The Firebrand, Parsons wrote, “Mr. Oscar Rotter free love advocate attempts to dig up the hideous ‘Variety’ grub and bind it to the beautiful unfolding blossom of labor's emancipation from wage-slavery and call them one and the same. Variety in sex relations and economic freedom have nothing in common.”Parsons, Lucy. “On Variety”, The Firebrand, 27 September 1896, Free Society; also in Ashbaugh, 204. Goldman responded: [tpl]bquote|The success of the meeting was unfortunately weakened by Lucy Parsons who, instead of condemning the unjustified Comstock attacks and arrest of anarchists… took a stand against the editor of the Firebrand, Henry Addis, because he tolerated articles about free love… Apart from the fact that anarchism not only teaches freedom from the economic and political areas, but also in social and sexual life, L. Parsons has the least cause to object to treatises on free love…  I spoke after Parsons and had a hard time changing the unpleasant mood that her remarks elicited, and I also succeeded in gaining the sympathy and the material support of the people present…Goldman, Emma. Emma Goldman: A Documentary…, pp. 312-313; originally featured in Part IV, “Letters from A Tour”, Sturmvogel, 15 November 1897.[/tpl]
Parsons responded: "The line will be drawn sharply at personalities as we know these enlighten no one and do infinitely more harm than good."Parsons, Lucy. "Salutation to the Friends of Liberty", The Liberator Chicago, 3 September 1905; Lucy Parsons, Ahrens, ed., p. 88.
Goldman, in her autobiography, Living My Life, briefly mentioned the presence of "Mrs. Lucy Parsons, widow of our martyred Albert Parsons", at a Chicago labor convention, noting that she "took an active part in the proceedings". Goldman later would acknowledge Albert Parsons for becoming a socialist and anarchist, proceeding to praise him for having "married a young mulatto"; there was no further mention of Lucy Parsons.[tpl]Cite book| last=Goldman |first= Emma |title=Living My Life|publisher=Alfred A Knopf|year=1931|isbn=0-486-22544-5[/tpl]

===Death===

Parsons continued to give fiery speeches in Chicago's Bughouse Square into her 80s, where she inspired Studs Terkel.[tpl]cite news|last=Watkins|first=Nancy|title=Who Loves Lucy?|work=Chicago Tribune Magazine|pages=23|publisher=Tribune Co.|date=2008-11-09|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-11-09/features/0811030324_1_anarchists-haymarket-leo-tolstoy|accessdate=2013-09-07[/tpl] One of her last major appearances was at the International Harvester in February 1941.

===Legacy, tributes and memorials===

In 2004, the City of Chicago named a park for Lucy Parsons.
On July 16, 2007, a book that purportedly belonged to Lucy Parsons was featured on a segment of the PBS television series, History Detectives. During the segment it was determined that the book, which was a biography of Albert Parsons' co-defendant August Spies' life and trial, was most likely a copy published and sold by Parsons as a means of raising money to prevent her husband's execution. The segment also provided background on Parsons' life and the Haymarket affair.
