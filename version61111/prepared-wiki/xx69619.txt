Levin joined the Armed Services Committee upon joining the Senate.  Recalling when he was assigned the committee seat, he said that he wanted to learn more about the armed services. "I had never served, and I thought there was a big gap in terms of my background and, frankly, felt it was a way of providing service."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_137/ci_senate_armed_services/46570-1.html |title=Chairman Offers Tough Scrutiny of Military |publisher=Roll Call |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]

During the 2009 MDA/AIAA Annual Missile Defense Conference, Levin spoke in favor of the U.S.-Russian cooperation on missile defense:Remarks of Senator Carl Levin at the MDA/AIAA Annual Missile Defense Conference, March 23, 2009 "Leaders in both the U.S. and Russia have recently expressed interest in exploring missile defense cooperation. Did you ever believe that some of our missile defense engineers and experts might be working together with their Russian counterparts? It could happen and if it does, it could help address a major threat. The bottom line is simple: We have a new opportunity to seek a cooperative approach with Russia on missile defense, and we should seize it. The upside potential of such an effort is huge — a geopolitical game changer. The downside is minimal."

====Afghanistan war====

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Levin voted in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 23, authorizing President George W. Bush the use of "necessary and appropriate force" against those who "planned, authorized, committed or aided" al-Qaeda and it affiliates.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=1&vote=00281 | title =U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 107th Congress - 1st Session On the Joint Resolution (S.J.

Levin grew critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Afghanistan War, saying in 2005 that they "took their eye off the ball when we decided to go after Iraq instead of al-Qaeda, the people who had attacked us on 9/11, and their leader.[tpl]cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2006-04-23/politics/binladen.reax_1_tora-bora-bin-audiotape?_s=PM:POLITICS | title =Democrats rip failure to find bin Laden | publisher =cnn.com | date =April 23, 2006[/tpl] In 2008, Levin became concerned that the United States and the international community lacked a strategy for success in Afghanistan, and that NATO failed to supply troops and equipment needed in emergency situations.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/07/usa.afghanistan | title =Congress demands testimony from Nato commander in Afghanistan | author =Elana Schor | publisher =guardian.co.uk | date =March 7, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.levin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=3998f5c2-9aa8-43da-9cac-9cb3b1c53479 | title =Report of Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) and Senator Bob Casey (D-PA)Travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan | publisher =levin.senate.gov | date =June 3, 2008[/tpl]

He questioned top Obama administration officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Bob Gates during a senate hearing on the Afghanistan surge, saying that, "Where I have questions is whether the rapid deployment of a large number of U.S. combat forces, without an adequate number of Afghan security forces for our troops to partner with, serves that mission."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/03/world/asia/03policy.html | title =Obama Team Defends Policy on Afghanistan | author =Elizabeth Bumiller | publisher =New York Times | date =December 2, 2009[/tpl] Levin opposed setting a timetable for Afghanistan, voting against Senate Amendment 4204, requiring the President to submit a safe and orderly redeployment plan for combat troops and a plan to set a date for withdrawal, saying that, "I don't think we know enough about how these events are gonna unfold, for there to be a deadline."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00168 | title =U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress - 2nd Session On the Amendment (Feingold Amdt.

====Iraq war====

On CNN on November 14, 2005, Levin said that "before the war, the President was saying that you cannot distinguish between Saddam Hussein and Iraq. As a matter of fact, he said that so often that he tried to connect Saddam Hussein with the attackers on us, on 9/11, so often, so frequently and so successfully, even though it was wrong, that the American people overwhelmingly thought, because of the President's misstatements that as a matter of fact, Saddam Hussein had participated in the attack on us on 9/11. That was a deception. That was clearly misinformation. It had a huge effect on the American people."[tpl]cite web | url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051114-1.html | title =Setting the Record Straight: Sen.
