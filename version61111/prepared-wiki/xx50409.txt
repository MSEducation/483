In mathematics, Lawson's conjecture states that the Clifford torus is the only minimally embedded torus in the 3-sphere S3.[tpl]cite journal |first=H.

In March 2012, Simon Brendle gave a proof of this conjecture, based on maximum principle techniques.[tpl]cite paper |last=Brendle |first=Simon |year=2012 |title=Embedded minimal tori in S3 and the Lawson conjecture | journal = Acta Mathematica | volume = 211 | pages = 177-190 | year = 2013 [/tpl]
