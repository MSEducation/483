The National Independence Party (NIP) is a defunct political party in Ghana. It was formed in 1992 in the run up to the inauguration of the Fourth Republic of Ghana. The party came to an end in 1993 following a merger with another Nkrumahist party.

The NIP was founded in 1992 after the ban on political parties was lifted in May, 1992 by the Provisional National Defence Council government of Jerry Rawlings. The party was one of many that professed to follow the Nkrumah ideology. Other parties who also claimed Nkrumah heritage include the People's National Convention, the People's Heritage Party[tpl]cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/ghana/98.htm |title=Presidential Elections |accessdate=2007-05-31 |work=Ghana: A Country Study |year=1994 |editor=La Verle Berry (ed) |publisher=[/tpl] and the National Convention Party.
