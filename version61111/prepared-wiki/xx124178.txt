Rosedale Heights School of the Arts is an arts-based high school in downtown Toronto.

==History==

Formerly Castle Frank, the school has been reinvented and re-purposed by Principal Barrie Sketchley. A vibrant non-semestered school in the heart of the city, Rosedale Heights School of the Arts (RHSA) provides its students an opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills required to succeed through an emphasis on the arts. Students can take dance, dramatic arts, music instrumental (band or strings), vocals, visual and media arts. In 2005, Maclean's Magazine named RHSA one of the best arts-focus high schools in Canada, as well as one of the three best special-focus schools in Canada. http://www.macleans.ca/education/universities/article.jsp?content=20050829_110985_110985

==Overview==

RHSA accepts students from all over the Greater Toronto Area.  It is the only arts school in the Toronto District School Board that does not use auditions for acceptance.  It is also the only arts school that encourages students to explore interdisciplinary arts by not expecting students to choose a "major" in one art and making students select a variety of arts courses in their first two years at the school.

==Facilities==

By having a dual, they thrust programs in both the academics and the arts and require suitable facilities for both. Alongside having great classrooms for the academics, RHSA has many designed spaces for the arts including a 670 seat auditorium, three fully equipped dance studios, two drama rooms, a dark room which is the largest in the TDSB and various visual art studios used for print making, graphic design etc.
