Bislama ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|b|ɪ|s|l|ə|m|ɑː|[/tpl];Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh [tpl]IPA-all|bislaˈma|Bislama:[/tpl]), also called Bichelamar,Bislama, Ethnologue.  Accessed Jan. 2, 2014. is a creole language, one of the official languages of Vanuatu.  It is the first language of many of the "Urban ni-Vanuatu" (those who live in Port Vila and Luganville), and the second language of much of the rest of the country's residents. "Yumi, Yumi, Yumi", the Vanuatu national anthem, is in Bislama. 
More than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin; the remainder combines a few dozen words from French, as well as some vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu, essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology.See Charpentier (1979). While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. Bislama can be basically described as a language with an English vocabulary and an Oceanic grammar.See Camden (1979).

==History==

During the period known as Blackbirding, in the 1870s and 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Pacific islanders (many of them from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) archipelago) were enslaved and forced to work on plantations, mainly in Queensland, Australia and Fiji.Emma Christopher, Cassandra Pybus and Marcus Buford Rediker (2007).  Many Middle Passages: Forced Migration and the Making of the Modern World, University of California Press, pp 188-190. ISBN 0-520-25206-3. With several languages being spoken in these plantations, a pidgin was formed, combining English vocabularyIn addition, whaling captains who picked up workforce from Africa and the Pacific Islands had already developed some sort of pidginized English. Modern Bislama bears a striking resemblance to Pidgin Englishes of West Africa[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] (where the slave trade was also active at one time); it is possible that Bislama is one branch of an evolution of pidgins from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] when the first truly global trading system began. See Monogenetic theory of pidgins. with grammatical structures typical of languages in the region.For this whole section, see: Tryon & Charpentier (2004), and Crowley (1990). This early plantation pidgin is the origin not only of Bislama, but also of Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea and Pijin of the Solomon Islands, though not of Torres Strait Creole north of Australia.
This pidgin started spreading over the Vanuatu archipelago at the turn of the 20th century, as the survivors of Blackbirding began to come back to their native islands: knowledge of this pidgin would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations of remote islands within the archipelago. This is how Bislama was born, progressively evolving separately from other related pidgins from the Pacific.
Because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at 113 languages for a population of 225,000),See Crowley (2000:50); François (2012:86). Bislama usefully serves as a lingua franca for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and even between foreigners. Besides Bislama, most ni-Vanuatu also know their local language, the local language of their father and that of their mother, and their spouse, and formal schools are taught in English or in French. 
Over the past century or so, Bislama has evolved to what is currently spoken and written. Only recently (1995, with second edition in 2004) has the first dictionary of BislamaSee Crowley (1995). been published, and this has helped to create a uniform spelling of Bislama.

==Name==

The name of Bislama (also referred to, especially in French, as "Bichelamar") comes via the early 19th century word "Beach-la-Mar" from pseudo-French "biche de mer" or "bêche de mer", sea cucumber, which itself comes from an alteration of the Portuguese "bicho do mar"."bêche-de-mer", American Heritage Dictionary, 2000  In the early 1840s, sea cucumbers were also harvested and dried at the same time that sandalwood was gathered. The names biche-la-mar and 'Sandalwood English' came to be associated with the kind of pidgin that came to be used by the local laborers between themselves, as well as their English-speaking overseers.See Crowley (1990).
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in an account of his travels through the Pacific in 1888 and 1889, “the natives themselves have often scraped up a little English,... or an efficient pidgin, what is called to the westward 'Beach-la-Mar'.”'.[tpl]cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Robert Louis|title=In the South Seas|year=2004|publisher=1st World Publishing|location=Fairfield, IA|isbn=1-59540-504-6|pages=15|url=http://www.1stworldlibrary.org|edition=1st edition[/tpl] In Jack London's story "Yah! Yah! Yah!", one of his "South Sea Tales", there is repeated a reference to “a bastard lingo called bech-de-mer”, and much of the story's dialogue is conducted in it.
Today, the word "bislama" itself is seldom used by younger speakers of Bislama to refer to sea slugs, as a new re-borrowing from pseudo-French "bêche de mer", which has taken the form "besdemea", has become more popular.[tpl]cite book|last=Crowley|first=Terry|title=Beach-la-Mar to Bislama: The Emergence of a National Language in Vanuatu|year=1990|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=33|chapter=1[/tpl]

==Grammar==

Two frequent words in Bislama are "long" and "blong", which take the place of many prepositions in English or French.

==="Long"===

Long as 'next to', 'by', 'beside' etc... 
Stoa long haos: The store next to the house.
long as 'at' or 'to' 
Mi bin stap long ples ia bifo: I have been to this place before. 
Mi stap long stoa: I am at the store.
long as 'in' 
Jea long haos: The chair in the house.
Long holds many other related meanings, and is sometimes used in improvisation.

==="Blong"===

Originally from Eng. "belong", blong takes the place of 'of' or the genitive case in other languages. Just like Eng. of, it is one of the most widely used and versatile words in the language, and can indicate possession, country of origin, defining characteristics, intention, and others. 

===Verbs===

Verbs in Bislama usually consist of a stem word (borrowed from English, French or indigenous languages); most transitive verbs add to this a transitive suffix.Examples of transitive verbs which exceptionally don't take this suffix include: kakae ‘eat, bite’; trink ‘drink’; save ‘know’; se ‘say’.
The form of that suffix is /-em/, /-im/, or /-um/, depending on vowel harmony. If the last vowel of the verb’s stem is either -u- or -i-, then that vowel will be copied into the transitive suffix. For all other stem vowels, the transitive suffix has its default form /-em/:
Verbs do not conjugate. There is a past tense and a future tense marker that usually goes at the beginning of the sentence or next to the verb. For example:

===Nouns===

The plural is formed by putting "ol" before the word: bia=beer. Ol bia = "beers". "Ol" comes from the English "all". When used with numbers, the singular form is used. 2 bia, 3 bia, etc...

===Pronouns===

Bislama features dual, trial, and plural personal pronouns as well as an inclusive and exclusive we (inclusive meaning I + you, exclusive meaning I + he/she/it/they, not you). Following are the Bislama plural personal pronouns, in italics the English transliteration where useful to understand/remember, and the grammatical category.

====Singular====

====Dual====

====Trial====

====Plural====

Pronouns do not decline.

===Aspect markers===

no : not
nomo : no/any more (placed before the predicate)
nomo : only / doesn't but
neva : never
jes : shows an action that has just occurred
stat : start, commencement of a process
stap : ongoing or habitual action
gogo : continual action
bin : (been) - completed action
finis : finished, past tense (when before object)
finis : already (when after object)
mas : must
traem : try
wantem :  want
save : can, know; from French savoir
sapos :  (suppose) if

==Internal variation==

Dialects exist, based mainly on different pronunciations in different areas which stem from the different sounds of the native languages. The future tense marker can be heard to be said as: Bambae, Mbae, Nambae, or Bae. There are also preferences for using Bislama or native words that vary from place to place, and most people insert English, French, or local language words to fill out Bislama. So in the capital city it is common to hear 'computer'; in other places you might hear 'ordinateur'.
