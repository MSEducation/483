==Biography==

===Early career===

Binks was raised in the Mornington Peninsula suburb of Mount Eliza on the outskirts of Melbourne and educated at The Peninsula School.
Spiff Rouch was a band formed in 1976, it included  Binks and fellow locals James Reyne, Bill McDonough, Guy McDonough, Paul Williams, and Robert Walker. By early 1978, Spiff Rouch had separated and Australian Crawl was formed with Binks (lead guitar), Reyne (lead vocals, piano, harmonica), and Williams (bass guitar), they were joined by James Reyne's younger brother David Reyne (drums) and schoolmate Brad Robinson (rhythm guitar, backing vocals).

===Australian Crawl===

Australian Crawl performed their first live gig in October 1978.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/australiancrawl.htm |title=Nostalgia Central entry on Australian Crawl |accessdate=2008-03-01 [/tpl] Bill McDonough (drums) replaced David Reyne within the first year.
Binks wrote or co-wrote four tracks for Australian Crawl's 1980 debut album The Boys Light Up as well as guitars (lead, slide, acoustic) and vocals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://music.msn.com/album/?album=10197163|title=MSN entry on The Boys Light Up |publisher=MSN|accessdate=4 March 2008[/tpl] Bill's brother, Guy McDonough (guitars, singer-songwriting) joined Australian Crawl later that year. For their second album Sirocco in 1981, Binks supplied two tracks, and guitar work;[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/album/?album=10197164|title=MSN entry on Sirocco|publisher=MSN|accessdate=4 March 2008[/tpl] the third album, Sons of Beaches in 1982, had Binks providing guitars but no songwriting credits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/album/?album=10028868 |title=MSN entry on Sons of Beaches|publisher=MSN|accessdate=5 March 2008[/tpl]
Drummer Bill McDonough left early in 1983, the Crawl recorded an EP Semantics with Graham Bidstrup on drums. Of the four tracks, Binks wrote "White Limbo" which was also the B-side of the European single release "Reckless". Mountain climber, Lincoln Hall, quotes lyrics from Binks' song in his book, White Limbo: The first Australian climb of Mt Everest (1985).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?client=firefox-a&id=wf-BAAAAMAAJ&dq=White+Limbo+First+Australian+climb+of+Mount+Everest&q=simon+binks#search_anchor|title=White Limbo: The first Australian climb of Mt.

Phalanx released late in 1983 was a live album which saw Binks and sound engineer Ross Cockle[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ross+Cockle |title=Discogs entry on Ross Cockle |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=3 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168342/|title=Internet Movie Database entry on Ross Cockle|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=3 April 2008[/tpl] as producers. Australian Crawl toured England supporting Duran Duran in late 1983 but they returned to Australia with Guy McDonough seriously ill and subsequently dying in June 1984. During recording sessions for Between a Rock and a Hard Place Binks resigned, he was replaced by session musicians on guitar and by Simon Hussey (ex Cats Under Pressure) who provided keyboards and songwriting. Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive and had less chart success than previous albums; to recoup his investment, Binks returned to the band for their final national tour, recorded in the live album The Final Wave, which was released in 1986.

===Later career===

Binks played guitar in the Broderick Smith Band in 1988.[tpl]cite web | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130929135701/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/s/smithbroderick.html | url = http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/s/smithbroderick.html | last1 = Holmgren | first1 = | title = Broderick Smith | publisher = Australian Rock Database. Passagen.se (Magnus Holmgren) | archivedate = 29 September 2013 | accessdate = 23 March 2014 [/tpl] He signed with Blue Pie Productions, in July 2004[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluepie.com.au/v4/nooze.html|title=Blue Pie Productions Archived Nooze|publisher=Damien Reilly [/tpl] but didn't produce any recorded materials and subsequently left.
An injury in a 1995 car crash at a North Sydney Council roadworks left Binks slightly brain-damaged with some sensory loss and restriction of finer movements of his right hand, which had prevented him from regaining the high level of skill he had previously shown.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/home-james/2007/06/07/1181089236518.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Home, James|last=Wilmoth|first=Peter|date=10 June 2007|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|accessdate=5 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.news.com.au/index.php/news/comments/newsdesk_update_guitarist_wins_compo_claim |title=Guitarist wins compo claim|last=Temple|first=Will|date=26 May 2005|publisher=news.com.au |accessdate=5 March 2008[/tpl] A court in 2006 awarded him $330,253 in damages, down from an estimated $750,000 because lawyers for North Sydney Council provided evidence that Binks was speeding and over the legal alcohol limit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=55936 |title=Case Note: North Sydney Council v Binks |publisher=DLA Phillips Fox |last=Gallagher|first=Patrick|date=24 January 2008|accessdate=24 April 2008[/tpl] Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to his lawyers. During the court case media also reported that he fell out with Crawl co-founder James Reyne after claiming to have written "The Boys Light Up", one of Australian Crawl's early hits. Binks denied this also, claiming that although he wrote the introductory musical theme from "The Boys Light Up" such work was not usually credited, and that the basic chords and lyrics were written by Reyne. After an appeal by the Council, in September 2007, the amount Binks was awarded was reduced to $304,750.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=91517|title=Less damages for Australian Crawl member|work=National Nine News|publisher=news.ninemsn.com.au|date=18 September 2007|accessdate=9 April 2008[/tpl]
