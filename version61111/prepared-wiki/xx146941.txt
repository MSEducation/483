Controlled Conversations (Polish: Rozmowy kontrolowane) is a Polish film released in 1991, directed by Sylwester Checinski.
This very black comedy finds humor in what was otherwise a terrifying time: the outbreak of Martial Law in Poland in 1981. Starring Stanis≈Çaw Tym as Ryszard, a gullible and mildly corrupt government functionary, and Krzysztof Kowalewski as Colonel Zygmunt Molibden, a member of the Polish secret police, Controlled Conversations is a brilliantly funny but extremely hermetic (for non-Poles) examination of the rise of an accidental hero.
