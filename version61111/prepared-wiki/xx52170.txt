The Danes attacked Chippenham "in midwinter after Twelfth Night",<ref name=G74/> probably during the night of January 6â€“7, 878. They captured Chippenham (barely missing Alfred) and forced Alfred to retreat "with a small force" into the wilderness.<ref name=G74/> It is to this period that the story of King Alfred burning the cakes belongs.<ref name=horspool2>Horspool. Why Alfred burnt the cakes. pp. 2 &ndash; 3. Although there may have been an early oral tradition about the burning of the cakes there is no contemporary evidence for the cake story. The first time it appears is one hundred years later and may have been invented to make an obscure saint [St Neots] look good. </ref>
Alfred seems at this time to have chased ineffectually around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is "a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control", although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in "an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare" casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.
