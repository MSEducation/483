Yoruba [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɒr|ʊ|b|ə[/tpl]Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh (natively [tpl]lang|yo|èdè Yorùbá[/tpl]) is a Niger–Congo language spoken in West Africa.
The number of speakers of Yoruba was estimated at around 20 million in the 1990s.[ref]Ethnologue 2009, with figures from 1993. No reliable estimate of more recent date is known. 
Metzler Lexikon Sprache (4th ed. 2010) estimates roughly 30 million based on population growth figures during the 1990s and 2000s. The population of Nigeria (where the majority of Yoruba live) has grown by 44% between 1995 and 2010, so that the Metzler estimate for 2010 appears plausible.[/ref] The native tongue of the Yoruba people is spoken principally in Nigeria and Benin, with communities in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americas. A variety of the language, Lucumi, is the liturgical language of the Santería religion of the Caribbean.  Yoruba is most closely related to the Owo and Itsekiri languages (spoken in the Niger Delta) and to Igala (spoken in central Nigeria).[tpl]e16|yor[/tpl]

==History==

Yoruba is  classified within the Edekiri languages, which together with Itsekiri and the isolate Igala form the Yoruboid group of languages within the Volta-Niger branch of the Niger-Congo family.
The linguistic unity of the Niger-Congo family dates to deep prehistory, estimates ranging around 15 kya (the end of the Upper Paleolithic).Bernd Heine, Derek Nurse (eds.), African Languages: An Introduction, Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 9780521666299, p. 294
The Yoruba group is assumed to have developed out of undifferentiated Volta–Niger populations by the 1st millennium BC. Settlements of early Yoruba speakers are assumed to correspond to those found in the wider Niger area from about the 4th century BC, especially at Ife. 
As the North-West Yoruba dialects show more linguistic innovation, combined with the fact that Southeast and Central Yoruba areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date of immigration for Northwest Yoruba.Adetugbọ 1973:192-3. (See also the section Dialects.)

==Varieties==

The Yoruba dialect continuum itself consists of several dialects. The various Yoruba dialects in the Yorubaland of Nigeria can be classified into three major dialect areas: Northwest, Central, and Southeast.This widely followed classification is based on Adetugbọ’s (1982) dialectological study — the classification originated in his 1967 PhD thesis The Yoruba Language in Western Nigeria: Its Major Dialect Areas. See also Adetugbọ 1973:183-193. Of course, clear boundaries can never be drawn and peripheral areas of dialectal regions often have some similarities to adjoining dialects.
North-West Yoruba is historically a part of the Ọyọ empire. In NWY dialects, Proto-Yoruba /gh/ (the velar fricative [tpl]IPA|ɣ[/tpl]) and /gw/ have merged into /w/; the upper vowels /i ̣/ and /ụ/ were raised and merged with /i/ and /u/, just as their nasal counterparts, resulting in a vowel system with seven oral and three nasal vowels. Ethnographically, traditional government is based on a division of power between civil and war chiefs; lineage and descent are unilineal and agnatic.
South-East Yoruba was probably associated with the expansion of the Benin Empire after c. 1450 AD.Adetugbọ 1973:185. In contrast to NWY, lineage and descent are largely multilineal and cognatic, and the division of titles into war and civil is unknown. Linguistically, SEY has retained the /gh/ and /gw/ contrast, while it has lowered the nasal vowels /ịn/ and /ụn/ to /ẹn/ and /ọn/, respectively. SEY has collapsed the second and third person plural pronominal forms; thus, àn án wá can mean either 'you (pl.) came' or 'they came' in SEY dialects, whereas NWY for example has ẹ wá 'you (pl.) came' and wọ́n wá 'they came', respectively. The emergence of a plural of respect may have prevented coalescence of the two in NWY dialects.
Central Yoruba forms a transitional area in that the lexicon has much in common with NWY, whereas it shares many ethnographical features with SEY. Its vowel system is the least innovating (most stable) of the three dialect groups, having retained nine oral-vowel contrasts and six or seven nasal vowels, and an extensive vowel harmony system.

==Literary Yoruba==

Literary Yoruba, also known as Standard Yoruba, Yoruba koiné, and common Yoruba, is a separate member of the dialect cluster. It is the written form of the language, the standard variety learned at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, the first African Bishop, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugbọ (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): "While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Abẹokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the Ọyọ-Ibadan dialects". It also has some features peculiar to itself, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English which originated in early translations of religious works.
Because the use of Standard Yoruba did not result from some deliberate linguistic policy, much controversy exists as to what constitutes 'genuine Yoruba', with some writers holding the opinion that the Ọyọ dialect is the most "pure" form, and others stating that there is no such thing as genuine Yoruba at all. Standard Yoruba, the variety learnt at school and used in the media, has nonetheless been a powerful consolidating factor in the emergence of a common Yoruba identity.

==Writing system==

In the 17th century[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Yoruba was written in the Ajami script, a form of Arabic."Yoruba...written in a version of the Arabic script known as Ajami (or Ajamiyya)."http://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/afs/NigerianSurveyTour2007/NigerianSurveyTour.html Modern Yoruba orthography originated in the early work of CMS missionaries working among the Aku (Yoruba) of Freetown. One of their informants was Crowther, who later would proceed to work on his native language himself. In early grammar primers and translations of portions of the English Bible, Crowther used the Latin alphabet largely without tone markings. The only diacritic used was a dot below certain vowels to signify their open variants [tpl]IPA|ɛ[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ɔ[/tpl], viz. [tpl]angbr|ẹ[/tpl] and [tpl]angbr|ọ[/tpl]. Over the years the orthography was revised to represent tone among other things. In 1875 the Church Missionary Society (CMS) organised a conference on Yoruba Orthography; the standard devised there was the basis for the orthography of the steady flow of religious and educational literature over the next seventy years.
The current orthography of Yoruba derives from a 1966 report of the Yoruba Orthography Committee, along with Ayọ Bamgboṣe's 1965 Yoruba Orthography, a study of the earlier orthographies and an attempt to bring Yoruba orthography in line with actual speech as much as possible. Still largely similar to the older orthography, it employs the Latin alphabet modified by the use of the digraph [tpl]angbr|gb[/tpl] and certain diacritics, including the traditional vertical line set under the letters [tpl]unicode|[tpl]angbr|e̩[/tpl][/tpl], [tpl]unicode|[tpl]angbr|o̩[/tpl][/tpl], and [tpl]unicode|[tpl]angbr|s̩[/tpl][/tpl]. In many publications the line is replaced by a dot [tpl]angbr|ẹ[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|ọ[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|ṣ[/tpl]. The vertical line had been used to avoid the mark being fully covered by an underline.
The Latin letters [tpl]angbr|c[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|q[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|v[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|x[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|z[/tpl] are not used.
The pronunciation of the letters without diacritics corresponds more or less to their International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents, except for the labial-velar stops [tpl]IPA|k͡p[/tpl] (written [tpl]angbr|p[/tpl]) and [tpl]IPA|ɡ͡b[/tpl] (written [tpl]angbr|gb[/tpl]), in which both consonants are pronounced simultaneously rather than sequentially. The diacritic underneath vowels indicates an open vowel, pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted (so [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]angbr|ẹ[/tpl][/tpl] is pronounced [tpl]IPA|ɛ̙[/tpl] and [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]angbr|ọ[/tpl][/tpl] is [tpl]IPA|ɔ̙[/tpl]). [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]angbr|ṣ[/tpl][/tpl] represents a postalveolar consonant [tpl]IPA|ʃ[/tpl] like the English [tpl]angbr|sh[/tpl], [tpl]angbr|y[/tpl] represents a palatal approximant like English [tpl]angbr|y[/tpl], and [tpl]angbr|j[/tpl] a voiced palatal plosive, as is common in many African orthographies.
In addition to the vertical bars, three further diacritics are used on vowels and syllabic nasal consonants to indicate the language's tones: an acute accent [tpl]angbr|´[/tpl] for the high tone, a grave accent [tpl]angbr|`[/tpl] for the low tone, and an optional macron [tpl]angbr|¯[/tpl] for the middle tone. These are used in addition to the line in [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]angbr|ẹ[/tpl][/tpl] and [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]angbr|ọ[/tpl][/tpl]. When more than one tone is used in one syllable, the vowel can either be written once for each tone (for example, *[tpl]angbr|òó[/tpl] for a vowel [tpl]IPA|o[/tpl] with tone rising from low to high) or, more rarely in current usage, combined into a single accent. In this case, a caron [tpl]angbr|ˇ[/tpl] is used for the rising tone (so the previous example would be written [tpl]angbr|ǒ[/tpl]) and a circumflex [tpl]angbr|ˆ[/tpl] for a the falling tone.
In Benin, Yoruba uses a different orthography. The Yoruba alphabet was standardized along with other Benin languages in the National Languages Alphabet by the National Language Commission in 1975, and revised in 1990 by the National Center for Applied Linguistics.

==Linguistic features==

===Phonology===

The three possible syllable structures of Yoruba are consonant+vowel (CV), vowel alone (V), and syllabic nasal (N). Every syllable bears one of the three tones: high [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|◌́[/tpl][/tpl], mid  [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|◌̄[/tpl][/tpl] (generally left unmarked), and low [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]unicode|◌̀[/tpl][/tpl]. The sentence '[tpl]unicode|n̄ ò lọ[/tpl]' I didn't go provides examples of the three syllable types:

====Vowels====

Standard Yoruba has seven oral and five nasal vowels. There are no diphthongs in Yoruba; sequences of vowels are pronounced as separate syllables. Dialects differ in the number of vowels they have; see above.
The status of a fifth nasal vowel, [tpl]IPA|ã[/tpl], is controversial. Although the sound does occur in speech, several authors have argued it to be not phonemically contrastive; often, it is in free variation with [tpl]IPA|ɔ̃[/tpl].Notably, Ayọ Bamgboṣe (1966:8). Orthographically, nasal vowels are normally represented by an oral vowel symbol followed by [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl] (i.e., [tpl]angle bracket|in[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|un[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ẹn[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ọn[/tpl]), except in case of the [tpl]IPA|n[/tpl] allophone of [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl] (see below) preceding a nasal vowel, i.e. inú 'inside, belly' is actually pronounced [tpl]IPA|īnṹ[/tpl].Abraham in his Dictionary of Modern Yoruba deviates from this custom, explicitly indicating the nasality of the vowel; thus, inú is found under inún, etc.

====Consonants====

The voiceless plosives [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] are slightly aspirated; in some Yoruba varieties, [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/d/[/tpl] are more dental. The rhotic consonant is realized as a flap [tpl]IPA|ɾ[/tpl], or in some varieties (notably Lagos Yoruba) as the alveolar approximant [tpl]IPA|ɹ[/tpl]. Like many other languages of the region, Yoruba has the labial-velar stops [tpl]IPA|/k͡p/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɡ͡b/[/tpl], e.g. pápá [tpl]IPA|k͡pák͡pá[/tpl] 'field', [tpl]lang|yo|gbọ̄gbọ̄[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|ɡ͡bɔɡ͡bɔ[/tpl] 'all'. Notably, it lacks the common voiceless bilabial plosive [tpl]IPA|/p/[/tpl], which is why [tpl]IPA|/k͡p/[/tpl] is written as [tpl]angle bracket|p[/tpl]. It also lacks a phoneme [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl]; though the letter [tpl]angle bracket|n[/tpl] is used for the sound in the orthography, it strictly speaking refers to an allophone of [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl] which immediately precedes a nasal vowel.
There is also a syllabic nasal which forms a syllable nucleus by itself. When it precedes a vowel it is a velar nasal [tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl], e.g. n ò lọ [tpl]IPA|ò lɔ[/tpl] 'I didn't go'. In other cases its place of articulation is homorganic with the following consonant, for example ó ń lọ [tpl]IPA|ń lɔ[/tpl] 'he is going', ó ń fò [tpl]IPA|ḿ fò[/tpl] 'he is jumping'.

====Tone====

Yoruba is a tonal language with three level tones: high, low, and mid (the default tone.Several authors have argued that the mid-tone is not specified underlyingly, but rather is assigned by a default rule (Pulleyblank 1986, Fọlarin 1987, Akinlabi 1985). Evidence includes examples like the following:  rí 'see'   aṣọ 'clothing' → ráṣọ 'see clothing', contrasted with rí 'see'   ọ̀bẹ 'knife' → rọ́!bẹ 'see a knife' In the first example, the final vowel of the verb rí is deleted but its high tone easily attaches to the first syllable of aṣọ, the mid tone of which disappears without a trace. In the second example, the Low tone of the first syllable of ọ̀bẹ is not as easily deleted; it causes a downstep (marked by [tpl]angle bracket|![/tpl], i.e., a lowering of subsequent tones. The ease with which the Mid tone gives way is attributed to it not being specified underlyingly. Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:9 (who calls the downstep effect 'the assimilated low tone').) Every syllable must have at least one tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Contour tones (i.e. rising or falling tone melodies) are usually analysed as separate tones occurring on adjacent tone bearing units (morae) and thus have no phonemic status.Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:6: The so-called glides … are treated in this system as separate tones occurring on a sequence of two syllables. Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone ([tpl]angle bracket|á[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ń[/tpl]), the grave accent for low tone ([tpl]angle bracket|à[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|ǹ[/tpl]); Mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron ([tpl]angle bracket|a[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|n̄[/tpl]); 
see below). Examples:

====Assimilation and elision====

When a word precedes another word beginning with a vowel, assimilation or deletion ('elision') of one of the vowels often takes place.See Bamgboṣe 1965a for more details. See also Ward 1952:123–133 ('Chapter XI: Abbreviations and Elisions'). In fact, since syllables in Yoruba normally end in a vowel, and most nouns start with one, this is a very common phenomenon, and indeed only is absent in very slow, unnatural speech. The orthography here follows speech in that word divisions are normally not indicated in words that are contracted as a result of assimilation or elision: ra ẹja → rẹja 'buy fish'. Sometimes however, authors may choose to use an inverted comma to indicate an elided vowel as in ní ilé → n’ílé 'in the house'.
Long vowels within words usually signal that a consonant has been elided word-internally. In such cases, the tone of the elided vowel is retained, e.g. àdìrò → ààrò 'hearth'; koríko → koóko 'grass'; òtító → òótó 'truth'.

===Grammar===

Yoruba is a highly isolating language.Karlsson, F. Yleinen kielitiede. ("General linguistics") Helsinki: Helsinki University Press, 1998. Its basic constituent order is subject–verb–object (SVO),Rowlands, Evan Colyn. (1969). Teach Yourself Yoruba. English Universities Press: London. as in ó nà Adé 'he beat Adé'. The bare verb stem denotes a completed action (often called perfect); tense and aspect are marked by preverbal particles such as ń 'imperfect/present continuous', ti 'past'. Negation is expressed by a preverbal particle kò. Serial verb constructions are common, as in many other languages of West Africa.
Although Yoruba has no grammatical gender,Ogunbowale, P. O. (1970). The Essentials of the Yoruba Language. University of London Press: London. it does have a distinction between human and non-human nouns; probably a remainder of the noun class system of proto-Niger–Congo, the distinction is only apparent in the fact that the two groups require different interrogative particles: tani for human nouns (‘who?’) and kini for non-human nouns (‘what?’). The associative construction (covering possessive/genitive and related notions) consists of juxtaposing nouns in the order modified-modifier as in inú àpótí {inside box} 'the inside of the box', fìlà Àkàndé 'Akande’s cap' or àpótí aṣọ 'box for clothes' (Bamgboṣe 1966:110, Rowlands 1969:45-6). More than two nouns can be juxtaposed: rélùweè abẹ́ ilẹ̀ (railway under ground) ‘underground railway’, inú àpótí aṣọ 'the inside of the clothes box'. In the rare case where this results in two possible readings, disambiguation is left to the context.  Plural nouns are indicated by a plural word.
There are two ‘prepositions’: ní ‘on, at, in’ and sí ‘onto, towards’. The former indicates location and absence of movement, the latter encodes location/direction with movement (Sachnine 1997:19). Position and direction are expressed by these prepositions in combination with spatial relational nouns like orí ‘top’, apá ‘side’, inú ‘inside’, etí ‘edge’, abẹ́ ‘under’, ilẹ̀ ‘down’, etc. Many of these spatial relational terms are historically related to body-part terms.

==Arabic influence==

In his works such as Islam in Africa - West African in Particular, and Missionary and Colonization in Africa,Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu at Awqaf Africa Damascus titled: Islam in Africa - West African in Particular, and Missionary and Colonization in Africa see Al-Arab Daily Newspaper, London July, 1998 [tpl]ISSN search link|01 40-010X[/tpl] Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu used assertions like these to argue that Islam had reached Sub-Sahara Africa, including the Yoruba Lands in West Africa, as early as the first century of Hijrah through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of the Arab conqueror, Uqba ibn al Nafia (622–683) whose Islamic conquests under the Umayyad dynasty, in Amir Muavia and Yazid periods, spread all Northern Africa or the Maghrib Al-Arabi, including present-day Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.
The wide adoption of imported religions and civilizations such as Islam and Christianity has managed to lay impacts both on written and spoken Yoruba. In his Arabic-English Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Quran and Sunnah, the Nigerian Muslim academic Sheikh Dr. Adelabu argued Islam has enriched African languages by providing them with technical and cultural augmentations with Ki-Swahili and Af-Somaali in East Africa and Turanci Hausa and Fula-Nyami in West Africa the most beneficiaries. Sheikh Adelabu, a Ph D graduate from Damascus cited - among many other common usages - the following words to be Yoruba's derivatives of Arabic vocabularies:DELAB International Newsmagazine, November 2005 [tpl]ISSN search link|1465-4814[/tpl]

===Some loan words===

Meanwhile, among commonly Arabic words used in Yoruba Language are names of the days such as Atalata (Ar. Ath-Thulatha الثلاثاء) for Tuesday, Alaruba (Ar. Al-Arbi'a الأربعاء) for Wednesday, Alamisi (Ar. Al-Khamis الخميس) for Thursday, and Jimoh (Ar. Al-Jum'ah الجمعة) for Friday. By far Ojo Jimoh is the most favourably used. It's usually preferred to the unpleasant word for Friday, Eti, which means failure, laziness or abandonment.A lecture by Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu of Awqaf Africa London titled: The History Of Islam in 'The Black History' DELAB International Newsmagazine, April 2003 [tpl]ISSN search link|1465-4814[/tpl]
