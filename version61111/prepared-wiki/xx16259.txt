It changed its name and address to arXiv.org in 1999 for greater flexibility.
Its existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access. Mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peer-reviewed journals.
The annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013-17, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the Simons Foundation (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions.https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/127116484/arXiv+Business+Model.pdf  This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution.  Annual donations were envisaged to vary in size between $2,300 to $4,000, based on each institution’s usage. [tpl]As of|2014|01|14[/tpl], 174 institutions have pledged support for the period 2013-17 on this basis, with a projected revenue from this source of approximately $340,000.https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/Initial+Five-Year+Support+Pledges+%282012%29
In September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for ArXiv's operation and development.  Ginsparg was quoted in the Chronicle of Higher Education as saying it "was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence".[tpl]cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-first-free-research-sharing-site-arxiv-turns-20/32778?sid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en | title=The First Free Research-Sharing Site, arXiv, Turns 20 With an Uncertain Future | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2011 | author=Fischman, Joah[/tpl]  However, Ginsparg remains on the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and on the arXiv Physics Advisory Committee.

==Peer review==

Although the arXiv is not peer reviewed, a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions and may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic. The lists of moderators for many sections of the arXiv are publicly available,[ref]Computing Research Repository Subject Areas and Moderators; Mathematics categories;
Statistics archive; Quantitative Biology archive; Physics archive[/ref] but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.
Additionally, an "endorsement" system was introduced in January 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content that is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.  The new system has attracted its own share of criticism for allegedly restricting inquiry.  Under the system, an author must first get endorsed.  Endorsement comes from either another arXiv author who is an endorser or is automatic, depending on various evolving criteria, which are not publicly spelled out.  Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area. New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all.
A majority of the e-prints are also submitted to journals for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal.  A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture, including the Poincaré conjecture as a particular case, uploaded by Grigori Perelman in November 2002. Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: "If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there the arXiv – let them go and read about it."Nadejda Lobastova and Michael Hirst, "Maths genius living in poverty", Sydney Morning Herald, August 21, 2006
While the arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as Fermat's last theorem using only high-school mathematics, they are "surprisingly rare".[ref]
</ref>  The arXiv generally re-classifies these works, e.g. in "General mathematics", rather than deleting them.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ifaq#7.1 |title=Front: (In)frequently asked questions |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl]</ref>

==Submission formats==

Papers can be submitted in any of several formats, including LaTeX, and PDF printed from a word processor other than TeX or LaTeX. The submission is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large.  arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.

==Access==

The standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the University of California, Davis's front, a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front.[tpl]cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ |title=Front for the arXiv |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date=2007-09-10 |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl] A similar function is offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the Institute of Physics. Google Scholar and Windows Live Academic can also be used to search for items in arXiv.[tpl]cite web|author=Andy Stevens (andy.stevens@iop.org) |url=http://eprintweb.org |title=eprintweb |publisher=eprintweb |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl] Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or RSS feeds of all submissions in them.

==Copyright==

Files on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:[tpl]cite web|url=http://arxiv.org/help/license |title=arXiv License Information |publisher=Arxiv.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl]
