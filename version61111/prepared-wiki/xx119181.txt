The 2006–07 Scottish Premier League season was the ninth season of the Scottish Premier League. It began on July 29, 2006.
The league champions, Celtic and runners-up, Rangers,  qualified for the UEFA Champions League on the return of Walter Smith as manager following a brief and disastrous reign by Frenchman Paul Le Guen. The team finishing third, Aberdeen qualified for the UEFA Cup, as did the Scottish Cup finalists Dunfermline Athletic.
