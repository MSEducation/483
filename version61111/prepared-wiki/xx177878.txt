Solomon Bush was an American soldier, born in Philadelphia; son of Matthias Bush, one of the signers of the non-importation agreement (October 25, 1765).
Solomon was an officer in the Pennsylvania militia, 1777-87. On July 5, 1777, he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the state militia by the supreme council of Pennsylvania. In September, 1777, he was dangerously wounded in the thigh during a skirmish, and had to be taken to Philadelphia. When the British captured the city in December, 1777, he was taken prisoner, but released on parole. As he could not earn his living, being kept, on account of his wound, at his father's home (Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia), the council passed a series of resolutions, October 20, 1779, respecting him, and on October 27 of that year he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, with pay in accordance with the rank. Bush was in destitute circumstances in later years, and on November 5, 1785, the council of Pennsylvania, under the presidency of Benjamin Franklin, ordered that a pension be paid him for his meritorious services. His brother, Jonas Bush, was on the roll of Revolutionary soldiers.
