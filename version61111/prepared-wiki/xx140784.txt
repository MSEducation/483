[[Mindspawn]]

CATEGORIES: Industrial music groups, Dark ambient music groups

Mindspawn is the name given to the soundscape, dark ambient, ambient industrial act formed and fronted by Gene Williams. The first "official" Mindspawn release was the album Null Infinite, which was released in 2001, although two CDR releases Darkness Weaves and Conversing With Zardoz were released in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although still "active" as Mindspawn, Gene Williams currently produces and composes for film and television with Steve Smith of Dirty Vegas fame. Recent work includes divergent subjects that range from the theme for the TV series "Standoff (TV series)" to the feature film "The Boys & Girls Guide to Getting Down" by Paul Sapiano. Mindspawn is still performing live as of 2010.
The Mindspawn name was chosen as an ambiguous play on words, the two "meanings" being Mind's Pawn and Mind Spawn. Beyond the obvious no further meaning has ever been intended. The sound composed/created by Mindspawn varies from soundscapes and industrial ambience to so-called dark ambient, including claustrophobic film music and sound categorized as space music. Mindspawn sound has been aptly referred to as sound sculptures or sonic tapestries. In addition to releasing audio CDs, Mindspawn has also designed sound for use by other artists and film composers.
