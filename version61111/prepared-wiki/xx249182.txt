As part of a consortium, the Greater Wellington Regional Council purchased a 284.6 hectare property near the Baring Head lighthouse in June 2010 for addition to the East Harbour Regional Park. The purchase was made with financial contributions from the New Zealand Government's Nature Heritage Fund, Department of Conservation, Hutt City Council and a private benefactor.  The purchase will protect a wide range of landscape, scientific, historical, ecological, cultural and recreational values.  The area will be opened to the general public on 13 February 2011.
A community group, the Friends of Baring Head Head, was formed in December 2010 to help the Regional Council in its management of the property.
