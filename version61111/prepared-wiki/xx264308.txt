==Life and career==

===Early life===

Raynoma Mayberry was born on March 8, 1937, in Detroit, Michigan. She was her mother Lucille’s eighth child, but her first by her marriage to Ashby Mayberry. Although her father worked as a janitor for Cadillac, he did well enough to purchase a house on Detroit’s Blaine Street in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy Singleton  |first1=Raynoma |title=Berry, Me and Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8092-4340-7 |pages=4–22 |chapter=Detroit [/tpl]
In the mid 1950s, Raynoma met and married Charles Liles, an aspiring musician. They had one son, Cliff Liles, born in December 1955. Burdened by financial pressures, the marriage soon folded.

===Early association with Berry Gordy===

In 1958, Raynoma and her younger sister, Alice, auditioned as a duo for a young songwriter named Berry Gordy. Sensing that Gordy was not excited about their singing, Raynoma told him that she could also write and arrange music. Before long, she was doing just that, becoming a vital part of his budding operation.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy  |first1=Berry |title=To Be Loved: The Music, The Magic, The Memories of Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1994 |month= |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7472-1417-4 |pages=84–108 |chapter=The Songwriting Years: 1957-1959 |quote=Soon she was writing out little lead sheets, chord arrangements and helping with background singing. She made life easier for me. I liked it, and before long I was used to it.[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy Singleton  |first1=Raynoma |title=Berry, Me and Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8092-4340-7 |pages=23–59 |chapter=Rayber:1958 [/tpl]
Later, Gordy had her put together a backup vocal group, which was composed of singers that had been hanging around the studio. Gordy, who loved contractions, decided to call the group the Rayber Voices after their given names, Raynoma and Berry. In addition to Ray, the singers in the group were Brian Holland, Robert Bateman, Sonny Sanders and later, Gwendolyn Murray  and Louvain Demps.[tpl]cite book |title=Motown - From the Background |last=Wright |first=Vickie |year=2007 |publisher=Bank House Books[/tpl] Together, Ray and Berry also formed a music producing and publishing firm, Rayber Music Writing Company.

===Motown===

Tired of the paltry royalty checks that he was receiving, Gordy was encouraged by Ray and Smokey Robinson to start his own record company.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy Singleton  |first1=Raynoma |title=Berry, Me and Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8092-4340-7 |pages=65–79 |chapter=Tamla |quote=You know, we aren’t some mom-and-pop fly-by-night operation. What we have to do now is start our own label. [/tpl] Ray located a two-story house at 2648 West Grand Boulevard as the headquarters for the new enterprise. Gordy placed her in charge of the company's publishing operations (now known as Jobete) with the assistance of her brother, Mike Ossman, and Janie Bradford, the company's first receptionist.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy  |first1=Berry |title=To Be Loved: The Music, The Magic, The Memories of Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1994 |month= |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7472-1417-4 |pages=109–137 |chapter=Motown: 1959-1960 |quote=Because of her knowledge of music and lead sheets, I put her in charge of the publishing operation, where she got tremendous help from her mother, Mike Ossman, and Janie Bradford, our first receptionist.[/tpl]
After the birth of their child, Kerry, and his divorce from his previous wife was final, Ray and Berry Gordy were married. Not long after the marriage, Gordy began having an affair with Margaret Norton, which he once described as "the most beautiful woman in Detroit." However, by the time he finally decided to end the affair, his marriage with Ray was over.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy  |first1=Berry |title=To Be Loved: The Music, The Magic, The Memories of Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1994 |month= |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7472-1417-4 |pages=138–195 |chapter=Survival of the Fittest: 1960-1964 |quote=Both wanting the breakup to be quick and painless, we got a Mexican divorce by mail. Ray wanted to continue working for the company. She wanted to take Kerry, our son, and move to New York and open a Jobete office there. I said okay.[/tpl]
As the details of their separation were being worked out, Ray indicated that she still wanted to work for Motown. Gordy accepted her proposal to establish an office of Jobete in New York City.
However, with the cost of living being much higher in New York than Detroit, Ray struggled to get proper funding to maintain her office. After repeated attempts to obtain additional funding had failed, Ray decided to take desperate measures. Against the advice of Eddie Singleton (her partner and future husband) she arranged to bootleg five thousand copies of the Motown single, "My Guy" by Mary Wells to keep the office open.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy Singleton  |first1=Raynoma |title=Berry, Me and Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8092-4340-7 |pages=149–164 |chapter=Busted:1963-1967 |quote=Bootlegging came with the territory in the music business. By-passing distributors and artists' and writers' royalties for direct payment to one individual was as routine as the sun coming up in the morning. [/tpl]
When Berry Gordy found out what happened, he was furious. He did not however, press charges. After their divorce was finalized, they remained on amicable terms. So much so that after Ray married Eddie Singleton, Gordy loaned the couple money so that they could start their own record label in the nation's capital, Washington, DC.

===Shrine Records===

Ray and Eddie Singleton formed a record label, Shrine, which was based in Washington, DC. When the label proved unsuccessful, Ray returned to Motown in 1968.

===Super Three===

Raynoma formed a partnership with Motown under the Super Three banner. One of the most successful projects under that arrangement was Rockwell’s Top 10 album, Somebody’s Watching Me, in which she served as executive producer.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gordy Singleton  |first1=Raynoma |title=Berry, Me and Motown |accessdate= |edition=First |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Contemporary Books |location=Chicago |isbn=0-8092-4340-7 |pages=288–301 |chapter=Super Three |quote=It wasn’t exactly a full partnership, since the money was Berry’s. We were still Motown, but we had an independent budget, which he controlled as chairman of the board, and with which we sought to produce artists who were the cream of the crop.
