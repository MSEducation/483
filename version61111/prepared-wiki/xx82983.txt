[/ref] Near fall points are also known as "back points." Much of the criteria for the near fall were used in a former scoring opportunity known as predicament in collegiate wrestling.Webster's Sports Dictionary, pp. 279-280, (Springfield, MA: G. & C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976). When near fall points are given after the opponent is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively, it is a consequence of what is sometimes referred to as the scream rule.
