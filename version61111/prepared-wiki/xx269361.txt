Lynwood Senior High School  is a public co-educational high school in Perth, Western Australia. The school is located on Metcalfe Road in the Perth suburb of Parkwood.

==History==

The school was established in 1974[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/schoolsonline/main_page.do?displayURL=overview.do&schoolID=4113|title=Department of Education Schools online|year=2010|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl] and caters for students in Year 8 to 12. The school began as a set of eight demountable classrooms located on the Cannington Senior High School campus in 1974 then opened its doors to Year 8 and 9 students at the current location in 1975. The inaugural principal was Bill Goulding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lynwood.wa.edu.au/index.php?page=history-of-lynwood-shs|title=Lynwood SHS - History|year=2010|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl]
Throughout the 1970s the school colours were mauve but was changed to blue and yellow in the 1980s.
In 1981, the school's gymnasium was burnt down in an arson attack by a student, making the gym unusable for 12 months.
In 1986 the school produced its first Beazley medallist, Sherwant Singh Gill.
Throughout the 1980s, the school had a poor reputation due to wide spread bullying, vandalism, truancy and poor graduation rates.  This has now largely been rectified due to changing demographics of the surrounding areas.
$40,000 worth of damage occurred to the school in February 2011 when a fire broke out in a classroom. Leaves ignited in an air-conditioning unit but a fast response from 20 fire-fighters prevented any damage to adjoining classes.

==Enrolments==

The number of student enrolments has remained reasonably stable over the last five years. The school enrolled 1030 students in 2007, then 1032 in 2008, to 1029 in 2009, then fell to 911 in 2010 and to 900 in 2011. The fall in student numbers from 2010 is a result of the enrolment age changing for students entering high school in Western Australia.
The school offers a specialty soccer program as part of their soccer academy, a specialist science and mathematics academy with many students being offered extension experiences.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.det.wa.edu.au/schoolsonline/school_file_download?schoolID=4113&fileType=SCH_RPT&yearID=2009|title=Annual School Report 2009|year=2009|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl]
