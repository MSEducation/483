Chinatown bus lines are discount intercity bus services often run by Chinese Americans that have been established primarily in the Chinatown communities of the East Coast of the United States since 1998, although similar services have cropped up on the West Coast. The buses have been subject to controversy because of safety issues with two fatal accidents in March 2011.

==History==

===Early history===

The first company to offer such intercity bus services was the Fung Wah Bus, which began routes between New York City and Boston in 1998.[tpl]cite news|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06228/713771-37.stm|title='Chinatown bus services' have grown quickly since 1998|first=Mackenzie|last=Carpenter | date=August 16, 2006[/tpl], Aug. 16, 2006 The bus services originally transported workers in Chinese restaurants to and from jobs in Boston, Atlantic City, Washington, D.C., and other cities. As word of them spread, they became more popular with non-Chinese bargain-hunting travelers, many of them young.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/nyregion/collateral-damage-in-the-chinatown-bus-wars.html|title=Crime Scene: Collateral Damage in the Chinatown Bus Wars|last=Wilson|first=Michael|date=7 October 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 October 2011[/tpl] Now, some bus lines are also used to transport large groups of mainly Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants to and from casinos such as Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun, which are located in Connecticut.  These gambling buses built upon the popularity of older bus routes to Atlantic City that also targeted Asian American customers.[tpl]cite news|first=Karin |last=Brulliard |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/23/AR2006112301065_pf.html |title=For Many Asians, an Atlantic City Pilgrimage |work=Washington Post |date=November 24, 2006[/tpl]
Because of their low fares, they became popular among non-Chinese customers as well. Between 1997 and 2007, Chinatown buses took 60% of Greyhound Lines' market share in the northeast United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-08/business/41171232_1_megabus-boltbus-greyhound-express | title=Bus travel is picking up, aided by discount operators | work=Philadelphia Inquirer | date=2013-08-08 | accessdate=25 August 2013 | author=Schliefer, Theodore[/tpl] Recently, competition has come from Megabus, BoltBus, Washington Deluxe and Vamoose Bus, along with other companies. Incidentally, two of the operations were recently brought under Megabus operation, with the purchase of Eastern Shuttle and Today's Bus.
Increasing popularity has also led to increasing regulatory interest. In September 2004, the city of Boston required all regularly scheduled intercity bus services to operate exclusively to and from the South Station transportation terminal. Steven Bailey of The Boston Globe suggested that the move was motivated by Peter Pan's and Greyhound's interest in maintaining their monopoly on the New York-Boston bus route, and Timothy Shevlin, executive director of the state Department of Telecommunications and Energy, said, "The big dog out there, Peter Pan, is dead set against Chinatown bus lines. They don't want that kind of competition." A complication with this arrangement was that the South Station bus terminal has only 25 gates (along with two departure gates), all of which were used at the time until other companies left.

===Possible organized crime ties===

The bus lines have drawn scrutiny from law enforcement authorities for possible connections to Chinese organized crime gangs. In 2003 and 2004, a number of bus arsons, driver assaults, and murders in New York City were linked to the possible infiltration of Asian organized crime gangs into the industry.[ref]

Among the crimes believed to have been associated with gang activity were a fatal stabbing and shooting incident in 2003. The shooting, on a busy street, may have been in retaliation for a driver having backed his bus into a rival. In retaliation for the shooting, two buses were set ablaze in 2004. There was another stabbing in 2004.
In another incident tied to criminal gangs, one man tied to the Chinatown bus lines was shot dead in a Flushing Chinatown bar in the New York City borough of Queens in June 2004. A bystander was killed and another was shot in the leg. The accused shooter was arrested in Toronto in 2011 and extradited to the United States.
In 2008, the New York Post linked the "Banya Organization" gang with Chinatown buses.  The gang allegedly inflicted brutal beatings to muscle in on private bus and van companies.  The companies involved were not identified.

==Operation==

In addition to Boston and the various Chinatowns within New York City and Long Island, New York, several bus line companies also link to the Chinatowns of Edison, New Jersey; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Doraville, in the Atlanta, Georgia area; and to the casinos of Atlantic City.  On the West Coast, buses link the Chinatowns of the San Francisco Bay Area; Los Angeles Chinatown and the San Gabriel Valley; and Las Vegas' Chinatown and casinos. In the I-5 corridor in California, similar services are found in the Hispanic community and provide transportation to/from Baja California, Mexico.
Many competitors offer discount prices that undercut the major bus lines. Typical fares between East Coast cities range from $10 to $20. The industry has become highly competitive with companies offering hourly service between major cities.
The Appalachian extensions of these lines tend to offer less of a price advantage: In August 2006, one-way fares from New York to Pittsburgh on the Chinese-owned All State were $35 compared with $45 advance through Greyhound Lines, while tickets from State College, Pennsylvania, to New York were $35, compared to $46 for Greyhound.
The bus routes have expanded with five bus companies now running between Manhattan Chinatown and Hampton Roads, Virginia, and two buses running to Richmond.

==Fleet==

The fleet used by various Chinabus companies can vary greatly from new coaches to older, pre-owned coaches, and with a few notable exceptions such as Eastern Shuttle and routes to Boston, not all units are branded with the operator name other than required USDOT markings, as shown to the right.
With the exception of Eastern Shuttle and services to Boston (all of which use clearly marked buses), many Chinatown bus companies use wet leases to provide overflow capacity during the weekend. Some smaller companies use wet leases to provide their core capacity.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl][/ref]  Typically, a bus (and a driver) would be chartered from a tour bus operator, a practice also used by mainstream companies such as Greyhound Lines during peak service.

==Service==

===Patterns===

Chinatown buses run express service, usually making no stops between the departure and destination points. This typically results in shorter travel times. The trip from State College, Pennsylvania, to New York City takes about four hours on the Chinatown bus, compared to more than seven hours on Greyhound.
Often, ticket booths are walk-up windows on the street, or are located inside restaurants and bakeries throughout a given Chinatown community.  Some lines even simply collect cash-payment after passengers have boarded the bus. However, tickets are often sold online, either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print-outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]
Except in Boston, the lines rarely use stations of their own. Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus, although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points.  Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets. In New York, several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown. Since 1998, when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area, the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses.

===Routing===

The majority of Chinatown buses have their base of operation in New York City. New York to Boston Chinatown buses generally use the Massachusetts Turnpike from Boston to I-84, and then follow I-84 to I-91 to I-95.  As I-95 approaches New York, several routings are possible depending on the traffic situation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]  Some drivers use the Throgs Neck Bridge to reach the Long Island Expressway, then to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and then Manhattan Bridge to Canal St.  Other drivers use the Whitestone Bridge.[tpl]Or|date=March 2010[/tpl]  Most drivers use the Triborough Bridge when traffic is not congested, and reach the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway via Astoria Boulevard.
Besides the routes within the major North Eastern cities, several Chinatown buses have daily routes that runs from New York City to Miami, Florida. The majority of the trip uses I-95 and stops are made near major cities in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and Florida. In order to save time, the buses never go into the city, instead they stop at gas stations and rest stops along I-95.
Some 'Casino Buses' use I-395 to make an intermediate stop at Foxwoods Resort Casino between the Massachusetts Turnpike and I-95.

==Safety==

Chinatown buses have been involved in numerous accidents over the years. In March 2011, a crash on Interstate 95 in the Bronx in March 2011 left 15 persons killed and more than 20 injured. The New York Police Department  cracked down on mechanically defective buses after this crash and another fatal crash on the New Jersey Turnpike in March 2011, taking six off the road for inadequate brake air pressure, steering violations and missing driver paperwork.[tpl]cite news|last=El-Ghobashy|first=Tamer|title=NYPD Cracks Down on Buses|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704662604576202891359271496.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|accessdate=16 March 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 March 2011[/tpl]

After the August 2005 incident, the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy instituted a policy of holding three surprise inspections per month on all bus companies that leave South Station in Boston. New York senator Chuck Schumer proposed a four-point federal plan that includes surprise inspections and creating a national safety standard for bus operators.  New York may institute a similar policy; however, inspections would be difficult in New York because the buses do not all leave the city from the same location.

===Shutdowns===

In 2012 the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration began a crackdown on Chinatown bus lines.[tpl]r|schleifer20130808[/tpl]
On May 31, 2012, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced that it had ordered the shutdown of Apex Bus, Inc., I-95 Coach Inc., New Century Travel Inc., and 23 other related entities due to safety violations.
On March 2, 2013, US Federal transportation officials shut down Fung Wah bus operations.  "The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration pulled Fung Wah’s operating license based on a new law that gives it the authority to shut down any company that fails to hand over safety records."Feds close Fung Wah's doorsRaw Signal coverage of Fung Wah shutdown, including other stories
On June 5, 2013, Lucky Star was shut down as well.  "Investigation uncovered egregious regulatory violations demonstrating Lucky Star’s flagrant disregard for motor coach passenger safety," said the letter from the Department of Transportation.CBS's Boston Local blog, June 6, 2013 Lucky Star engaged in an extensive bus upgrade and driver program over the next five months, passed required inspections, and resumed operations in November, 2013.Boston Globe: Lucky Star buses will roll once more
