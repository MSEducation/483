==History==

The predecessor to WIPO was the BIRPI (Bureaux Internationaux Réunis pour la Protection de la Propriété Intellectuelle, French acronym for United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property), which had been established in 1893 to administer the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.
WIPO was formally created by the Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, which entered into force on April 26, 1970. Under Article 3 of this Convention, WIPO seeks to "promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world." WIPO became a specialized agency of the UN in 1974. The Agreement between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization[tpl]cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/agreement/index.html |title=Agreement between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] notes in Article 1 that WIPO is responsible
The Agreement marked a transition for WIPO from the mandate it inherited in 1967 from BIRPI, to promote the protection of intellectual property, to one that involved the more complex task of promoting technology transfer and economic development.[tpl]cite web |page=12 |title=Shabalala et al.

Unlike other branches of the United Nations, WIPO has significant financial resources independent of the contributions from its Member States. In 2006, over 90% of its income of just over CHF 250 million[tpl]cite web |title=WO/PBC/8/3 -  Proposed program and budget 2006/2007 estimates 456m fee income out of total 531m income for the biennium |url= http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/govbody/en/wo_pbc_8/wo_pbc_8_3_pub.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Wipo.int[/tpl] was expected to be generated from the collection of fees by the International Bureau (IB) under the intellectual property application and registration systems which it administers (the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Madrid system for trade marks and the Hague system for industrial designs).
In October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a proposal offered by Argentina and Brazil, the "Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO" - from the Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html |title=Consumer Project on Technology web site, Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] This proposal was well supported by developing countries. The agreed "WIPO Development Agenda" [tpl]cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/ip-development/en/agenda/recommendations.html |title=The 45 Adopted Recommendations under the WIPO Development Agenda |publisher=Wipo.int |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] (composed of over 45 recommendations) was the culmination of a long process of transformation for the organization from one that had historically been primarily aimed at protecting the interests of rightholders, to one that has increasingly incorporated the interests of other stakeholders in the international intellectual property system as well as integrating into the broader corpus of international law on human rights, environment and economic cooperation.
A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge (A2K)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Consumer Project on Technology web site, ''Access to Knowledge (A2K) |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] treaty which they would like to see introduced.
In December 2011, WIPO published its first World Intellectual Property Report on the Changing Face of Innovation, the first such report of the new Office of the Chief Economist.[tpl]cite web|author=WIPO |url=http://www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/wipr/ |title=World Intellectual Property Report |publisher=Wipo.int |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2013-10-18[/tpl] WIPO is also a co-publisher of the Global Innovation Index.http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii/

==Information network==

WIPO has established WIPOnet, a global information network. The project seeks to link over 300 intellectual property offices (IP offices) in all WIPO Member States. In addition to providing a means of secure communication among all connected parties, WIPOnet is the foundation for WIPO's intellectual property services.[tpl]cite web |url=http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/30B12B9BA34FE27B852569FA0000EDC6?OpenDocument |publisher=United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database,  |title=World Intellectual Property Organization |accessdate= February 24, 2008[/tpl]
