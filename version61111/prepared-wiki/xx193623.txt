FDML (Flow Description Markup Language) is a now obsolete XML language from IBM used for making executable business process models for WebSphere Application Server (WAS).
FDML is node-based and weakly related to WSFL. As of version 6.0 of the WAS, it has been replaced by BPEL (a block-based language) and is no longer supported.
