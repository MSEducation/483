HIV/AIDS denialism is the view held by a loosely connected group of people and organizations who deny that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).[tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009|p= 205[/tpl] Some denialists reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but say that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, haemophilia, or the effects of the drugs used to treat HIV infection.[tpl]cite pmid | 7992044[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009[/tpl]
The scientific consensus is that the evidence showing HIV to be the cause of AIDS is conclusive and that AIDS-denialist claims are pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories,[tpl]cite pmid | 7992043 [/tpl] faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.[tpl]cite journal |title=Denying science |journal=Nat.

[/tpl] With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, AIDS-denialist material is now targeted at less scientifically sophisticated audiences and spread mainly through the Internet.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227131.500-aids-denial-a-lethal-delusion.html | title = AIDS denial: A lethal delusion | first = J | last = Steinberg | journal = New Scientist | accessdate =14 October 2009 | date = 17 June 2009 | volume = 2713 [/tpl]
Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki. Scientists and physicians have raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism, which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx | title = The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS | accessdate =14 October 2009 | publisher = National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease | date = 4 September 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen J |title=The Duesberg phenomenon |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5191 |pages=1642–4 |date=December 1994 |pmid=7992043 |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.7992043 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/cohen/266-5191-1642a.pdf |accessdate=22 June 2009 |bibcode=1994Sci...266.1642C[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Watson J. | title = Scientists, activists sue South Africa's AIDS 'denialists' | journal = Nat Med. | volume = 12| issue =  1 | page = 6| year = 2006 | pmid = 16397537  | doi = 10.1038/nm0106-6a [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1483792,00.html | title = Discredited doctor's 'cure' for Aids ignites life-and-death struggle in South Africa | first = S | last = Boseley |work=The Guardian  | date = 14 May 2005 | accessdate =14 October 2009 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= ,|title=The Durban Declaration |journal=Nature |volume=406 |issue=6791 |pages=15–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10894520 |doi=10.1038/35017662 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6791/full/406015a0.html[/tpl] Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS deaths, along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections, to the South African government's former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chigwedere P, Seage GR, Gruskin S, Lee TH, Essex M |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999) |volume= 49|issue= 4|pages= 410–415|date=October 2008 |pmid=19186354 |doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31818a6cd5 |laysummary=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Nattrass N |title=Estimating the Lost Benefits of Antiretroviral Drug Use in South Africa |journal=African Affairs |volume=107 |issue=427 |pages=157–76 |date=February 2008 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adm087 [/tpl]

==History==

In 1983, a group of scientists and doctors at the Pasteur Institute in France, led by Luc Montagnier, discovered a new virus in a patient with signs and symptoms that often preceded AIDS.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Barré-Sinoussi |first1= F |last2= Chermann |first2= J |last3= Rey |first3= F |last4= Nugeyre |first4= M |last5= Chamaret |first5= S |last6= Gruest |first6= J |last7= Dauguet |first7= C |last8= Axler-Blin |first8= C |last9= Vézinet-Brun |first9= F |last10= Rouzioux |first10= C |last11= Rozenbaum |first11= W |last12= Montagnier |first12= L |title= Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) |journal= Science |volume= 220 |issue= 4599 |pages= 868–71 |year= 1983 |pmid= 6189183 |doi= 10.1126/science.6189183 |bibcode= 1983Sci...220..868B[/tpl] They named the virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus, or LAV, and sent samples to Robert Gallo's team in the United States. Their findings were peer reviewed and slated for publication in Science.
At a 23 April 1984 press conference in Washington, D.C., Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced that Gallo and his co-workers had discovered a virus that is the "probable" cause of AIDS. This virus was initially named HTLV-III.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Sarngadharan |first1=MG |last2= DeVico |first2= AL |last3= Bruch |first3= L |last4=  Schüpbach |first4= J |last5= Gallo |first5= RC |title= HTLV-III: The etiologic agent of AIDS |journal= Int. Symp. Princess Takamatsu Cancer Res. Fund |volume= 15 |pages= 301–8 |year= 1984 |pmid= 6100648 |url=[/tpl] That same year, Casper Schmidt responded to Gallo's papers with "The Group-Fantasy Origins of AIDS", Journal of Psychohistory.[tpl]cite journal |last= Schmidt |first= C |title= The group-fantasy origins of AIDS |journal = Journal of Psychohistory |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= 37–78 |year= 1984 |pmid= 11611586[/tpl] Schmidt posited that AIDS was not an actual disease, but rather an example of "epidemic hysteria" in which groups of people are subconsciously acting out social conflicts. Schmidt compared AIDS to documented cases of epidemic hysteria in the past which were mistakenly thought to be infectious. (Schmidt himself would later die of AIDS in 1994.)[tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009|p= 26[/tpl][tpl]cite web |work= aidstruth.org |url= http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/dead_denialists |title= AIDS Denialists Who Have Died |accessdate= 15 June 2009[/tpl]
In 1986, the viruses discovered by Montagnier and Gallo, found to be genetically indistinguishable, were renamed HIV.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Coffin |first1= J |last2= Haase |first2= A |last3= Levy |first3= J |last4= Montagnier |first4= L |last5= Oroszlan |first5= S |last6= Teich |first6= N |last7= Temin |first7= H |last8= Toyoshima |first8= K |last9= Varmus |first9= H |last10= Vogt |first10= P |title= What to call the AIDS virus? |journal= Nature |volume= 321 |issue= 6065 |page= 10 |year= 1986 |pmid= 3010128 |doi= 10.1038/321010a0 |bibcode = 1986Natur.321...10.[/tpl]
In 1987, Peter Duesberg questioned the link between HIV and AIDS in the journal Cancer Research.[tpl]cite journal |last= Duesberg |first= P |title= Retroviruses as carcinogens and pathogens: Expectations and reality |journal= Cancer Research |volume= 47 |issue= 5 |pages= 1199–220 |year= 1987 |pmid= 3028606[/tpl] Duesberg's publication coincided with the start of major public health campaigns and the development of zidovudine (AZT) as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.
In 1988, a panel of the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found that "the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive."[tpl]cite web | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&page=2 | title = Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 | publisher = Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences | year = 1988 | quote = …the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.[/tpl] That same year, Science published Blattner, Gallo, and Temin's HIV causes AIDS,[tpl]cite journal |last1= Blattner |first1= W |last2= Gallo |first2= RC |last3= Temin |first3= HM |title= HIV causes AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 241 |issue= 4865 |pages= 515–6 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3399881 |doi= 10.1126/science.3399881 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/515 |bibcode= 1988Sci...241..515B[/tpl] and Peter Duesberg's HIV is not the cause of AIDS.[tpl]cite journal |last= Duesberg |first= P |title= HIV is not the cause of AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 241 |issue= 4865 |page= 514 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3399880 |doi= 10.1126/science.3399880 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/514|bibcode = 1988Sci...241..514D[/tpl] Also that same year, The Perth Group, a group of denialists based in Perth, Western Australia led by Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos,  published in the non-peer-reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses their first article questioning aspects of HIV/AIDS research,[tpl]cite journal |last= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first= E |title= Reappraisal of AIDS – Is the oxidation induced by the risk factors the primary cause? |journal= Medical Hypotheses |volume= 25 |issue= 3 |pages= 151–62 |year=1988 |pmid= 3285143 |doi= 10.1016/0306-9877(88)90053-9 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/reappraisalofaids.html[/tpl] arguing that there was "no compelling reason for preferring the viral hypothesis of AIDS to one based on the activity of oxidising agents."
In 1989, Duesberg exercised his right, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, to bypass the peer review process and publish his arguments in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) unreviewed. The editor of PNAS initially resisted, but ultimately allowed Duesberg to publish, saying: "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."
In 1990, Robert Root-Bernstein published his first peer-reviewed article detailing his objections to the mainstream view of AIDS and HIV.[tpl]cite journal |last= Root-Bernstein |first= R |title= Do we know the cause(s) of AIDS? |journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 480–500 |year= 1990 |pmid= 2216658[/tpl] In it, he questioned both the mainstream view and the "dissident" view as potentially inaccurate.
In 1991, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, comprising twelve scientists, doctors, and activists, submitted a short letter to various journals, but the letter was rejected.
In 1993, Nature published an editorial arguing that Duesberg had forfeited his right of reply by engaging in disingenuous rhetorical techniques and ignoring any evidence that conflicted with his claims.[tpl]cite journal |last= Maddox |first= J |title= Has Duesberg a right of reply? |journal= Nature |volume= 363 |issue= 6425 |page= 109 |year= 1993 |pmid= 8483492 |doi= 10.1038/363109a0 |bibcode= 1993Natur.363..109M[/tpl] That same year, Papadopulos-Eleopulos et al. of the Perth Group, alleged in the journal Nature Biotechnology (then edited by fellow denialist Harvey Bialy) that the Western blot test for HIV was not standardized, non-reproducible, and of unknown specificity due to a claimed lack of a "gold standard".[tpl]cite journal |last1= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first1= E |last2= Turner |first2= VF |last3= Papadimitriou |first3= JM |title= Is a positive western blot proof of HIV infection? |journal= Nature Biotechnology |volume= 11 |issue= 6 |pages= 696–707 |year= 1993 |pmid= 7763673 |doi= 10.1038/nbt0693-696 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/biotek8.html[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009|p= 170[/tpl]
On 28 October 1994, Robert Willner, a physician whose medical license had been revoked for, among other things, treating an AIDS patient with ozone therapy, publicly jabbed his finger with blood he said was from an HIV-infected patient. Willner died in 1995 of a heart attack.[tpl]cite web  |last= Bugl |first= P |title= The Rise of HIV/AIDS |publisher= Department of Mathematics, University of Hartford |url= http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm |accessdate= 22 January 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070204142451/http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm |archivedate= 4 February 2007  |deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 1995, a letter, similar to the one submitted by The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis in 1991, was published in Science.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Baumann |first1= E |last2= Bethell |first2= T |last3= Bialy |first3= H |last4= Duesberg |first4= P |last5= Farber |first5= C |last6= Geshekter |first6= C |last7= Johnson |first7= P |last8= Maver |first8= R |last9= Schoch |first9= R |last10= Stewart |first10= G |title= AIDS proposal.

In 1996, the British Medical Journal published Response: arguments contradict the "foreign protein-zidovudine" hypothesis[tpl]cite journal |last1= Sabin |first1= CA |last2= Phillips |first2= AN |last3= Lee |first3= CA |title= Response: Arguments contradict the "foreign protein-zidovudine" hypothesis |journal= BMJ |volume= 312 |issue= 7025 |pages= 211–2 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8563584 |pmc= 2350000 |url= http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/312/7025/211 |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7025.211[/tpl] as a response to a petition by Peter Duesberg: "In 1991 Duesberg challenged researchers… We and Darby et al. have provided that evidence". The paper argued that Duesberg was wrong regarding the cause of AIDS in haemophiliacs. 
In 1997, The Perth Group questioned the existence of HIV, and speculated that the production of antibodies recognizing HIV proteins can be caused by allogenic stimuli and autoimmune disorders.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first1= E |last2= Turner |first2= VF |last3= Papadimitriou |first3= JM |last4= Stewart |first4= G |last5= Causer |first5= D |title= HIV antibodies: Further questions and a plea for clarification |journal= Current Medical Research and Opinion |volume= 13 |issue= 10 |pages= 627–34 |year= 1997 |pmid= 9327197 |doi= 10.1185/03007999709113336 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/epcurmedres97.html[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first1= E |last2= Turner |first2= VF |last3= Papadimitriou |first3= JM |last4= Causer |first4= D |last5= Page |first5= BA |title= HIV antibody tests and viral load — More unanswered questions and a further plea for clarification |journal= Current Medical Research and Opinion |volume= 14 |issue= 3 |pages= 185–6 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9787984 |doi= 10.1185/03007999809113358 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/furtherplea.html[/tpl] They continued to repeat this speculation through at least 2006.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first1= E |last2= Turner |first2= VF |last3= Page |first3= BA |last4= Papadimitriou |first4= J |last5= Causer |first5= D |title= No proof HIV antibodies are caused by a retroviral infection |journal= Emergency Medicine Australasia |department= Letters to the Editor |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 308–10 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16712545 |doi= 10.1111/j.1742-6723.2006.00859.x |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/EMAHIVLetterandReply.pdf[/tpl]
In 2006, Celia Farber, a journalist and prominent HIV/AIDS denialist, published an essay in the March issue of Harper's Magazine entitled "Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science", in which she summarized a number of arguments for HIV/AIDS denialism and alleged incompetence, conspiracy, and fraud on the part of the medical community.[tpl]cite news |first= C |last= Farber |title= Out of control: AIDS and the corruption of medical science |magazine =Harper's Magazine |date=March 2006 |url= http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/03/0080961 |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090504174126/http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/03/0080961 |archivedate= 4 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Scientists and AIDS activists extensively criticized the article as inaccurate, misleading, and poorly fact-checked.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/business/media/13harpers.html |title= An article in Harper's ignites a controversy over HIV |last= Miller |first= L |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 13 March 2006 |accessdate= 25 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/ErrorsInFarberArticle.pdf |last1= Gallo |first1= R |last2= Geffen |first2= N |last3= Gonsalves |first3=G |last4= Jefferys |first4= R |last5= Kuritzkes |first5= DR |last6= Mirken |first6= B |last7= Moore |first7= JP |last8= Safrit |first8= JT |title= Errors in Celia Farber's March 2006 article in Harper's Magazine |publisher= Treatment Action Campaign |date= 25 March 2006 |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090616194132/http://tac.org.za/Documents/ErrorsInFarberArticle.pdf |archivedate= 16 June 2009  |deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 2007, members of the Perth Group testified at an appeals hearing for Andre Chad Parenzee, asserting that HIV could not be transmitted by heterosexual sex.

===In U.S. courts===

In 1998, HIV/AIDS denialism and parental rights clashed with the medical establishment in court when Maine resident Valerie Emerson fought for the right to refuse to give AZT to her four-year-old son, Nikolas Emerson, after she witnessed the death of her daughter Tia, who died at the age of three in 1996. Her right to stop treatment was upheld by the court in light of "her unique experience."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/20/us/boy-is-healthy-without-drug-for-hiv-mother-says.html |title= Boy is healthy without drug for HIV, mother says |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 20 September 1998 |accessdate= 11 June 2009[/tpl] Nikolas Emerson died eight years later.

===In South Africa===

In 2000, South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki invited several HIV/AIDS denialists to join his Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs2,16283,1.html |title= Debating the obvious: Inside the South African government's controversial AIDS panel |last= Schoofs |first= M |newspaper= Village Voice |date= 5 July 2000 |accessdate= 11 June 2009[/tpl] A response named the Durban Declaration was issued affirming the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS:
In 2008, University of Cape Town researcher Nicoli Nattrass, and later that year a group of Harvard scientists led by Zimbabwean physician Pride Chigwedere each independently estimated that Thabo Mbeki's denialist policies led to the early deaths of more than 330,000 South Africans. Barbara Hogan, the health minister appointed by Mbeki's successor, voiced shame over the studies' findings and stated: "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa."

==HIV/AIDS denialists' claims and scientific evidence==

Although members of the HIV/AIDS denialist community are united by their disagreement with the concept that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the specific positions taken by various groups differ.

Such claims have been examined extensively in the peer-reviewed medical and scientific literature; a scientific consensus has arisen that denialist claims have been convincingly disproved, and that HIV does indeed cause AIDS.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx | title = The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS | publisher = National Institutes of Health | date = 14 January 2010 | accessdate =4 February 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110320185946/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx| archivedate= 20 March 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html | title = Basic Information about HIV and AIDS | publisher  =Centers for Disease Control | date = 11 August 2010  | accessdate =4 February 2011 [/tpl] In the cases cited by Duesberg where HIV "cannot be isolated", PCR or other techniques demonstrate the presence of the virus,[tpl]cite journal |last1= O'Brien |first1= SJ |last2= Goedert |first2= JJ |title= HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled |journal=  Current Opinion in Immunology |volume= 8 |issue=  5 |pages= 613–8 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8902385 |doi= 10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6[/tpl] and denialist claims of HIV test inaccuracy result from an incorrect or outdated understanding of how HIV antibody testing is performed and interpreted.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf |title=HIV Science and Responsible Journalism |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2008 |publisher=XVI International AIDS Conference[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/denialists/giraldo-immunoassays |title=How Immunoassays Work: The Curious Case of AIDS Denialist Roberto Giraldo and his Ignorance of the Basics |last=Moore |first=John |publisher=Aidstruth.org |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=17 December 2008[/tpl]  Regarding Koch's postulates, New Scientist reported: "It is debatable how appropriate it is to focus on a set of principles devised for bacterial infections in a century when viruses had not yet been discovered. HIV does, however, meet Koch's postulates as long as they are not applied in a ridiculously stringent way".  The author then demonstrated how each postulate has been met –  the suspected cause is strongly associated with the disease, the suspected pathogen can be both isolated and spread outside the host, and when the suspected pathogen is transmitted to a new and uninfected host, that host develops the disease.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17326-five-myths-about-hiv-and-aids.html | title =  Five myths about HIV and AIDS | first = J | last = Steinberg | authorlink = Jonny Steinberg | work= New Scientist | date = 23 June 2009 | accessdate =4 February 2011[/tpl] The latter was proven in a number of tragic accidents, including an instance when multiple scientific technicians with no other known risk factors were exposed to concentrated HIV virus in a laboratory accident, and transmission by a dentist to patients, the majority of whom had no other known risk factor or source of exposure except the same dentist in common.
Early denialist arguments held that the HIV/AIDS paradigm was flawed because it had not led to effective treatments. However, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the mid-1990s and dramatic improvements in survival of HIV/AIDS patients reversed this argument, as these treatments were based directly on anti-viral activity and the HIV/AIDS paradigm.[ref]Major studies confirming the benefits and effectiveness of modern anti-HIV therapy include, but are not limited to:
In a 2010 article on conspiracy theories in science, Ted Goertzel lists HIV/AIDS denialism as an example where scientific findings are being disputed on irrational grounds. He describes proponents as relying on rhetoric, appeal to fairness, and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence.  They frequently invoke the meme of a "courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy", invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei.[tpl]cite pmid | 20539311[/tpl]  Regarding this comparison, Goertzel states:

==The HIV/AIDS denialist community==

Denialists often use their critique of the link between HIV and AIDS to promote alternative medicine as a cure, and attempt to convince HIV-infected individuals to avoid ARV therapy in favour of vitamins, massage, yoga and other unproven treatments.  Despite this promotion, denialists will often downplay any association with alternative therapies, and attempt to portray themselves as "dissidents".  An article in the Skeptical Inquirer stated:
[tpl]quote|AIDS denialists prefer to characterize themselves as brave "dissidents" attempting to engage a hostile medical/industrial establishment in genuine scientific "debate." They complain that their attempts to raise questions and pose alternative hypotheses have been unjustly rejected or ignored at the cost of scientific progress itself...Given their resistance to all evidence to the contrary, today’s AIDS dissidents are more aptly referred to as AIDS denialists.[tpl]cite journal | last = Nattrass | first = N | year = 2007 | title = AIDS Denialism vs. Science | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aids_denialism_vs._science/ | journal = Skeptical Inquirer[/tpl][/tpl]
Several scientists have been associated with HIV/AIDS denialism, although they have not themselves studied AIDS or HIV. One of the most famous and influential is Peter Duesberg, professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, who since 1987 has disputed that the scientific evidence shows that HIV causes AIDS. Other scientists associated with HIV/AIDS denialism include biochemists David Rasnick and Harvey Bialy. Kary Mullis, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his role in the development of PCR, has expressed sympathy for denialist theories.[tpl]cite book | title = Dancing Naked in the Mind Field | last = Mullis | first = K | year = 1998 | publisher = Vintage Books | pages = 171–182 | isbn = 0679442553[/tpl] Biologist Lynn Margulis argued that "there's no evidence that HIV is an infectious virus" and that AIDS symptoms "overlap...completely" with those of syphilis.[tpl]cite news |url= http://discover.coverleaf.com/discovermagazine/201104?pg=68#pg72 |title= Lynn Margulis: Q & A |magazine= Discover Magazine |date=April 2011 |last= Teresi |first= D |pages= 66–70 |accessdate= 14 April 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110421233929/http://discover.coverleaf.com/discovermagazine/201104?pg=68 |archivedate= 21 April 2011  |deadurl= no[/tpl] Pathologist Etienne de Harven also expressed sympathy for HIV/AIDS denial.[tpl]Cite book |title= HIV/AIDS in South Africa 25 years On: Psychosocial Perspectives |first1= P |last1= Rohleder |first2= L | last2= Swartz |first3= SC |last3= Kalichman |publisher= Springer |year= 2009 |isbn= 9781441903051 |page= 125[/tpl].[tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009|pages=61, 128, 180[/tpl]

In a follow-up article in Skeptical Inquirer,[tpl]cite journal |last1= Nattrass |first1= N |title= The social and symbolic power of AIDS denialism |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 36 |date=July–August 2012 |pages=34–8 |publisher= Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_social_and_symbolic_power_of_aids_denialism[/tpl] Nattrass overviewed the prominent members of the HIV/AIDS denialist community and discussed the reasons of the intractable staying power of HIV/AIDS denialism in spite of scientific and medical consensus supported by over two decades of evidence. She observed that despite being a disparate group of people with very different background and professions, the HIV/AIDS denialists self-organize to fill four important roles:
Some of them had overlapping roles as board members of Rethinking AIDS and Alive and Well AIDS Alternatives, were involved in the film House of Numbers, The Other Side of AIDS or on Thabo Mbeki's AIDS Advisory Panel.
Nattrass argued that HIV/AIDS denialism gains social traction through powerful community-building effects where these four organized characters form "a symbiotic connection between AIDS denialism and alternative healing modalities" and they are "facilitated by a shared conspiratorial stance toward HIV science".

===Former denialists===

Several of the few prominent scientists who once voiced doubts about HIV/AIDS have since changed their views and accepted the fact that HIV plays a role in causing AIDS, in response to an accumulation of newer studies and data.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html |title= HIV, AIDS, and the distortion of science |first= M |last= Delaney |accessdate= 9 June 2011 |year= 2005 |magazine= Focus |volume= 15 |issue= 6 |pages= 1–6 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604155409/http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html |archivedate= 4 June 2011  |deadurl= no[/tpl] Robert Root-Bernstein, author of Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus and formerly a critic of the causative role of HIV in AIDS, has since distanced himself from the HIV/AIDS denialist movement, saying, "Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong...The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml |title= Dead Certain? |last= Lederer |first= B |magazine= POZ |date= 1 April 2006 |accessdate= 31 October 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061113150749/http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml |archivedate= 13 November 2006  | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Joseph Sonnabend, who until the late 1990s regarded the issue of AIDS causation as unresolved, has reconsidered in light of the success of newer antiretroviral drugs, stating, "The evidence now strongly supports a role for HIV… Drugs that can save your life can also under different circumstances kill you. This is a distinction that denialists do not seem to understand." Sonnabend has also criticized HIV/AIDS denialists for falsely implying that he supports their position, saying:
[tpl]Quotation|Some individuals who believe that HIV plays no role at all in AIDS have implied that I support their misguided views on AIDS causation by including inappropriate references to me in their literature and on their web sites. Before HIV was discovered and its association with AIDS established, I held the entirely appropriate view that the cause of AIDS was then unknown. I have successfully treated hundreds of AIDS patients with antiretroviral medications, and have no doubt that HIV plays a necessary role in this disease.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/sonnabend |title= Statement by Joseph Sonnabend, M.D. |work= aidstruth.org |accessdate = 15 February 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Both Sonnabend and Root-Bernstein now favor a less controversial hypothesis, suggesting that while HIV is necessary for AIDS, cofactors may also contribute.
A former denialist wrote in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2004:
[tpl]Quotation|The group denialists regularly points to a substantial number of scientists supportive of its agenda to re-evaluate the HIV/AIDS hypothesis. Some of those members still listed are people who have been dead for a number of years. While it is correct that these people supported the objective of a scientific re-evaluation of the HIV/AIDS link when they were alive, it is clearly difficult to ascertain what these people would have made of the scientific developments and the accumulation of evidence for HIV as the crucial causative agent in AIDS, which has occurred in the years after their deaths.[tpl]cite journal |last=Schüklenk |first= U |title= Professional responsibilities of biomedical scientists in public discourse |journal= J Med Ethics |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages=53–60; discussion 61–2 |year= 2004 |pmid= 14872076 |pmc= 1757140 |url= http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14872076 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.002980[/tpl][/tpl]

For example, the editors of the magazine Continuum consistently denied the existence of HIV/AIDS.

Similarly, several HIV-positive former dissidents have reported being ostracized by the AIDS-denialist community after they developed AIDS and decided to pursue effective antiretroviral treatment.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.aegis.org/news/misc/2000/bg000201.html |title= Bad science: They once thought HIV was harmless.

In 2008, activist Christine Maggiore died at the age of 52 while under a doctor's care for pneumonia. Maggiore, mother of two children, had founded an organisation to help other HIV-positive mothers avoid taking antiretroviral drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child.[tpl]cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24 |title= A mother's denial, a daughter's death |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date= 24 September 2005 |accessdate= 29 December 2008 |last1= Ornstein |first1=C |first2=D |last2= Costello | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081222041314/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24 |archivedate= 22 December 2008  |deadurl= no[/tpl] After her three-year-old daughter died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 2005, Maggiore continued to believe that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, and she and her husband Robin Scovill sued Los Angeles County and others on behalf of their daughter's estate, for allegedly violating Eliza Scovill's civil rights by releasing an autopsy report that listed her cause of death as AIDS-related pneumonia. The litigants settled out of court, with the county paying Scovill $15,000 in March 2009, with no admission of wrongdoing. The L.A. coroner's ruling that Eliza Jane Scovill died of AIDS remains standing as the official verdict.[tpl]cite news |title= Suit settled on autopsy of HIV skeptics' child |date= 6 March 2009 |first= M |last= Hennessy-Fiske |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/06/local/me-briefs6 |newspaper= The Los Angeles Times[/tpl]

==Impact beyond the scientific community==

AIDS-denialist claims have failed to attract support in the scientific community, where the evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS is considered conclusive. However, the movement has had a significant impact in the political sphere, culminating with former South African President Thabo Mbeki's embrace of AIDS-denialist claims.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] The resulting governmental refusal to provide effective anti-HIV treatment in South Africa has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature AIDS-related deaths in South Africa.[tpl]cite news |newspaper= The New York Times |first= C |last= Dugger |date= 25 November 2008 |accessdate= 17 December 2008 |title= Study cites toll of AIDS policy in South Africa |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html[/tpl]

===Impact in North America and Europe===

Skepticism about HIV being the cause of AIDS began almost immediately after the discovery of HIV was announced. One of the earliest prominent skeptics was the journalist John Lauritsen, who argued in his writings for the New York Native that AIDS was in fact caused by amyl nitrite poppers, and that the government had conspired to hide the truth.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/data2/jlbio.htm |title= Biography of John Lauritsen |work= virusmyth.com |accessdate= 7 September 2006[/tpl]

====In the scientific literature====

The publication of Peter Duesberg's first AIDS paper in 1987 provided visibility for denialist claims. Shortly afterwards, the journal Science reported that Duesberg's remarks had won him "a large amount of media attention, particularly in the gay press where he is something of a hero."[tpl]cite journal |last=Booth |first= W |title= A rebel without a cause of AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 239 |issue= 4847 |pages= 1485–8 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3281251 |doi= 10.1126/science.3281251 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/239/4847/1485 |bibcode= 1988Sci...239.1485B[/tpl] However, Duesberg's support in the gay community dried up as he made a series of statements perceived as homophobic; in an interview with the Village Voice in 1988, Duesberg stated his belief that the AIDS epidemic was "caused by a lifestyle that was criminal twenty years ago."[tpl]cite book |last= Epstein |first= S |title= Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge |publisher= University of California Press |location= Berkeley |year= 1996 |isbn=0520202333 |page= 118 |ref= [tpl]Harvid|Epstein|1996[/tpl][/tpl]
In the following few years, others became skeptical of the HIV theory as researchers initially failed to produce an effective treatment or vaccine for AIDS.Burkett, E (1996) The Gravest Show on Earth (Chapter 2) ISBN 0-312-14607-8 Journalists such as Neville Hodgkinson and Celia Farber regularly promoted denialist ideas in the American and British media; several television documentaries were also produced to increase awareness of the alternative viewpoint.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/censorship.htm |title= Censorship |work= virusmyth.com |accessdate= 2 June 2006[/tpl] In 1992–1993, The Sunday Times, where Hodgkinson served as scientific editor, ran a series of articles arguing that the AIDS epidemic in Africa was a myth. These articles stressed Duesberg's claims and argued that antiviral therapy was ineffective, HIV testing unreliable, and that AIDS was not a threat to heterosexuals. The Sunday Times coverage was heavily criticized as slanted, misleading, and potentially dangerous; the scientific journal Nature took the unusual step of printing a 1993 editorial calling the paper's coverage of HIV/AIDS "seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/world/british-paper-and-science-journal-clash-on-aids.html |title= British paper and science journal clash on AIDS |last= Schmidt |first= WE |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 10 December 1993 |accessdate= 25 April 2008[/tpl]
Finding difficulty in publishing his arguments in the scientific literature, Duesberg exercised his right as a member of the National Academy of Sciences to publish in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) without going through the peer review process. However, Duesberg's paper raised a "red flag" at the journal and was submitted by the editor for non-binding review. All of the reviewers found major flaws in Duesberg's paper; the reviewer specifically chosen by Duesberg noted the presence of "misleading arguments", "nonlogical statements", "misrepresentations", and political overtones.[tpl]cite journal |last=Booth |first= W |title= AIDS paper raises red flag at PNAS |journal= Science |volume= 243 |issue= 4892 |page= 733 |year=1989 |pmid=2916121|doi=10.1126/science.2916121|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..733B [/tpl] Ultimately, the editor of PNAS acquiesced to publication,[tpl]cite journal |last=Duesberg |first= PH |title=Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: Correlation but not causation |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 86 |issue= 3 |pages= 755–64 |year= 1989 |pmid= 2644642 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc= 286556 |bibcode= 1989PNAS...86..755D[/tpl] writing to Duesberg: "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."
HIV/AIDS denialists often resort to special pleading to support their assertion, arguing for different causes of AIDS in different locations and subpopulations. In North America, AIDS is blamed on the health effects of unprotected anal sex and poppers on homosexual men, an argument which does not account for AIDS in drug-free heterosexual women who deny participating in anal sex.  In this case, HIV/AIDS denialists claim the women are having anal sex but refuse to disclose it. In haemophiliac North American children who contracted AIDS from blood transfusions, the haemophilia itself or its treatment is claimed to cause AIDS.  In Africa, AIDS is blamed on poor nutrition and sanitation due to poverty.  For wealthy populations in South Africa with adequate nutrition and sanitation, it is claimed that the antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS cause the condition.  In each case, the most parsimonious explanation and uniting factor – HIV positive status – is ignored, as are the thousands of studies that converge on the common conclusion that AIDS is caused by HIV infection.[tpl]sfn|Kalichman|2009[/tpl]
Haemophilia is considered the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and scientists.  While Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a harmless passenger virus, this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood.  A comparison of groups receiving high, medium and low levels of contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status.  Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died.  The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors.  A comparison of individuals receiving blood donations also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions.  Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).

====In lay press and on the Internet====

With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996–1997, the survival and general health of people with HIV improved significantly.[tpl]cite pmid|16890831[/tpl] The positive response to treatment with anti-HIV medication cemented the scientific acceptance of the HIV/AIDS paradigm, and led several prominent HIV/AIDS denialists to accept the causative role of HIV. Finding their arguments increasingly discredited by the scientific community, denialists took their message to the popular press. A former denialist wrote:[tpl]Quotation|Scientists among the HIV dissidents used their academic credentials and academic affiliations to generate interest, sympathy, and allegiances in lay audiences. They were not professionally troubled about recruiting lay people—who were clearly unable to evaluate the scientific validity or otherwise of their views—to their cause.[/tpl]
In addition to elements of the popular and alternative press, AIDS denialist ideas are propagated largely via the Internet.[tpl]cite news |last= Deer |first= B |date= 21 February 2012 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/21/death-denial-hiv-aids?INTCMP=SRCH |title= Death by denial: The campaigners who continue to deny HIV causes Aids |newspaper= The Guardian[/tpl]
A 2007 article in PLoS Medicine noted:

AIDS activists have expressed concern that denialist arguments about HIV's harmlessness may be responsible for an upsurge in HIV infections. Denialist claims continue to exert a significant influence in some communities; a survey conducted at minority gay pride events in four American cities in 2005 found that 33% of attendees doubted that HIV caused AIDS.[tpl]cite journal |last1= Hutchinson |first1= AB |last2= Begley |first2= EB |last3= et al. |year= 2005 |url= http://www.aegis.org/conferences/nhivpc/2005/TP-011.html |title= Mistrust and conspiracy beliefs about HIV/AIDS among participants in minority gay pride events |journal= 2005 National HIV Prevention Conference |page= Abstract TP-011 |nopp=y[/tpl] According to Stephen Thomas, director of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Minority Health, "people are focusing on the wrong thing. They’re focusing on conspiracies rather than protecting themselves, rather than getting tested and seeking out appropriate care and treatment."[tpl]cite news |last= France |first= D |date= 19 August 2000 |title= The HIV Disbelievers |magazine= Newsweek[/tpl]

===Impact in South Africa===

HIV/AIDS denialist claims have had a major political, social, and public health impact in South Africa. The government of then President Thabo Mbeki was sympathetic to the views of HIV/AIDS denialists, with critics charging that denialist influence was responsible for the slow and ineffective governmental response to the country's massive AIDS epidemic.
Independent studies have arrived at almost identical estimates of the human costs of HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa. According to a paper written by researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health, between 2000 and 2005, more than 330,000 deaths and an estimated 35,000 infant HIV infections occurred "because of a failure to accept the use of available drugs to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in a timely manner." Nicoli Nattrass of the University of Cape Town estimates that 343,000 excess AIDS deaths and 171,000 infections resulted from the Mbeki administration's policies, an outcome she refers to in the words of Peter Mandelson as "genocide by sloth".

====Durban Declaration====

In 2000, when the International AIDS Conference was held in Durban, Mbeki convened a Presidential Advisory Panel containing a number of HIV/AIDS denialists, including Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.journaids.org/politicsofhiv.php |title= The Politics of HIV/AIDS in South Africa |accessdate= 26 February 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070702083352/http://journaids.org/politicsofhiv.php |archivedate= 2 July 2007 |work= JournAIDS |publisher= HIV & AIDS Media Project[/tpl] The Advisory Panel meetings were closed to the general press; an invited reporter from the Village Voice wrote that Rasnick advocated that HIV testing be legally banned and denied that he had seen "any evidence" of an AIDS catastrophe in South Africa, while Duesberg "gave a presentation so removed from African medical reality that it left several local doctors shaking their heads."
In his address to the International AIDS Conference, Mbeki reiterated his view that HIV was not wholly responsible for AIDS, leading hundreds of delegates to walk out on his speech.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm |title= Controversy dogs AIDS forum |work= BBC News |date= 10 July 2000 |accessdate= 26 February 2007[/tpl] Mbeki also sent a letter to a number of world leaders likening the mainstream AIDS research community to supporters of the apartheid regime. The tone and content of Mbeki's letter led diplomats in the U.S. to initially question whether it was a hoax.[tpl]cite news |last= Schoof |first= M |date= 5–11 July 2000 |url= http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs,16189,1.html |title= Proof positive: How African science has demonstrated that HIV causes AIDS |newspaper= Village Voice |accessdate= 20 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/52730299.html?dids=52730299:52730299&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+19%2C+2000&author=Barton+Gellman&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=A.01&desc=S.+African+President+Escalates+AIDS+Feud |title= South African president escalates AIDS feud |first= B |last= Gellman |newspaper= Washington Post |date= 19 April 2000 |accessdate= 26 February 2007 |subscription=yes[/tpl]
AIDS scientists and activists were dismayed at the president's behavior and responded with the Durban Declaration, a document affirming that HIV causes AIDS, signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians.

====Criticism of governmental response====

The former South African health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang also attracted heavy criticism, as she often promoted nutritional remedies such as garlic, lemons, beetroot and olive oil, to people suffering from AIDS,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.health-e.org.za/news/article.php?uid=20031487 |title= Beetroot battle at world AIDS conference |first= A |last= Thom |work= Health-e |date= 21 August 2006 |accessdate= 9 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/&articleid=280903 |title= 'Dr Beetroot' hits back at media over Aids exhibition |newspaper= Mail & Guardian |accessdate= 20 September 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2005/sa050604.html |title= Manto again angers AIDS activists |work= AEGIS.com |accessdate= 20 September 2006[/tpl] while emphasizing possible toxicities of antiretroviral drugs, which she has referred to as "poison".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.aidstruth.org/nattrass.pdf |title= AIDS, science and governance |first= N |last= Nattrass |work= aidstruth.org[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The South African Medical Association has accused Tshabalala-Msimang of "confusing a vulnerable public".[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.samedical.org/article.asp?ArticleID=1844 |title= SAMA calls for end to misrepresentation on treatment of AIDS |date= 29 August 2006 |publisher= South African Medical Association |accessdate= 12 March 2007[/tpl] In September 2006, a group of over 80 scientists and academics called for "the immediate removal of Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang as minister of health and for an end to the disastrous, pseudoscientific policies that have characterized the South African government's response to HIV/AIDS."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090600586.html |title= Scientists rip S.

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki's government was widely criticized for delaying the rollout of programs to provide antiretroviral drugs to people with advanced HIV disease and to HIV-positive pregnant women. The national treatment program began only after the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) brought a legal case against Government ministers, claiming they were responsible for the deaths of 600 HIV-positive people a day who could not access medication.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/MTCTCourtCase/MTCTCourtCase.htm |title= Current Developments Preventing Mother-To-Child HIV Transmission In South Africa: Background, Strategies And Outcomes Of The Treatment Action Campaign Case Against The Minister Of Health[/tpl] South Africa was one of the last countries in the region to begin such a treatment program, and roll-out has been much slower than planned.
At the XVI International AIDS Conference, Stephen Lewis, UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, attacked Mbeki's government for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic and reliance on denialist claims:
In 2002, Mbeki requested that HIV/AIDS denialists no longer use his name in denialist literature, and requested that denialists stop signing documents with "Member of President Mbeki's AIDS Advisory Panel". This coincided with the South African government's statement accompanying its 2002 AIDS campaign, that "...in conducting this campaign, government’s starting point is based on the premise that HIV causes AIDS".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.avert.org/aids-south-africa.htm |title= AIDS in South Africa: Treatment, transmission and the government |work= avert.org[/tpl] Nonetheless, Mbeki himself continued to promote and defend AIDS-denialist claims. His loyalists attacked former President Nelson Mandela in 2002 when Mandela questioned the government's AIDS policy, and Mbeki attacked Malegapuru Makgoba, one of South Africa's leading scientists, as a racist defender of "Western science" for opposing HIV/AIDS denialism.
In early 2005, former South African president Nelson Mandela announced that his son had died of complications of AIDS. Mandela's public announcement was seen as both an effort to combat the stigma associated with AIDS, and as a "political statement designed to… force the President Mbeki out of his denial."[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015842,00.html |title= No place for denial |first= S |last= Robinson |magazine= Time |date= 9 January 2005 |accessdate= 26 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/southafrica/story/0,13262,1384732,00.html?gusrc=rss |title= Mandela's eldest son dies of AIDS |first= T |last= Happold |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 6 January 2005 |accessdate= 9 March 2007[/tpl]

====Post Mbeki government in South Africa====

In 2008, Mbeki was ousted from power and replaced as President of South Africa by Kgalema Motlanthe. On Motlanthe's first day in office, he removed Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the controversial health minister who had promoted AIDS-denialist claims and recommended garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS. Barbara Hogan, newly appointed as health minister, voiced shame at the Mbeki government's embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism and vowed a new course, stating: "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa."
