Baywatch is an American action drama series about the Los Angeles County Lifeguards who patrol the beaches of Los Angeles County, California, starring David Hasselhoff.  The show was canceled after its first season on NBC, but survived and later became one of the most watched television shows in the world. The show ran in its original title and format from 1989 to 1999, except for the 1990–1991 season, during which it was not in production. From 1999 to 2001, with a setting change and large cast overhaul, it was known as Baywatch Hawaii.
Baywatch premiered on NBC in 1989, but was canceled after only one season when it placed 73rd out of 103 shows in the seasonal ratings and also because the studio, GTG, went out of business. Feeling the series still had potential, Hasselhoff along with creators and Executive Producers Michael Berk, Douglas Schwartz and Greg Bonann revived it for the first-run syndication market in 1991.  Hasselhoff was given the title of Executive Producer for his work on bringing the show back.  The series was hugely successful, especially internationally.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-20/entertainment/ca-919_1_london-weekend | title=Baywatch Has a Cow, Man, London Style | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=November 20, 1996 | accessdate=2010-10-15 | author=Gritten, David[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-28/entertainment/ca-207_1_baywatch-production | title=Surf's Up Again for Baywatch | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=November 28, 1991 | accessdate=2010-10-15 | author=McDougal, Dennis[/tpl] The show led to a spin-off: Baywatch Nights, and a reunion movie, Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding.
In 1999, with production costs rising in Los Angeles, and the syndication market shrinking, the plan was to move the show to Australia and launch Baywatch Down Under. A pilot was filmed but the series was stopped when residents of Avalon put forth strong objections, including potential damage to a fragile ecosystem. Pittwater Council permanently barred all future filming.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-03-01/lifestyle/9903010281_1_baywatch-show-avalon | title=Aussie Town Boos Baywatch | work=Sun Sentinel | date=March 1, 1999 | accessdate=2010-10-16 | author=Huff, Richard[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/286274.stm | title=Wave of protest over Baywatch move | work=BBC | date=February 26, 1999 | accessdate=2010-10-15[/tpl] This pilot finally aired as a two-part episode of Baywatch.
As an alternative to Australia, Hawaii offered the producers large financial incentives to move the show to the islands instead, and in Season 10, Baywatch Hawaii was launched.
Baywatch filmed for two seasons in Hawaii, from 1999 until 2001.[tpl]cite web|title=Film and television in Hawaii|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_and_television_in_Hawaii|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl] The proposal to relocate Baywatch to Hawaii rather than Australia was initiated by April Masini in a telephone call to Executive Producer Greg Bonann. The deal to provide the incentives necessary to secure the series was presented to Governor Ben Cayetano by Al Masini and April Masini; Tony Vericella, president of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau; and Cayetano's executive assistant, Joe Blanco. The agreement required the production to change its name from Baywatch to Baywatch Hawaii, hire local leads, and film in the state for at least two years, guaranteeing 44 episodes, each at a cost of about $870,000, 60 percent of which was to be spent in Hawaii.[tpl]cite news|last=Ryan|first=Tim|title='Baywatch' May Relocate to Hawaii|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/03/04/news/story1.html|newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=March 4, 1999[/tpl]

==Plot==

The show starred David Hasselhoff, of Knight Rider fame, as Mitch Buchannon, who was the only mainstay on the show, besides Michael Newman, for 10 of the 11 seasons. Baywatch revolved around the work of a team of lifeguards and their interpersonal relationships, with plots usually centering on dangers related to beach and other activities pertinent to the California (later Hawaii) beach lifestyle. Everything from earthquakes and shark attacks to serial killers and even nuclear bombs served as plot conflicts on the show. Saving people from drowning tended to be one of the most typical situations used in the shows. Thus a trademark of the show was slow motion shots of the lifeguards running, most notably done by Erika Eleniak, Pamela Anderson, Yasmine Bleeth, Alexandra Paul, and David Charvet along with Hasselhoff during the height of the show. Each show would feature one or two montages, often only superficially related to the plot.
