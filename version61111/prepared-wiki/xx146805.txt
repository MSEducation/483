Farley Wood is a suburb in the civil parish of Binfield, approximately [tpl]convert|1.2|mi|km[/tpl] west of Bracknell, in the English county of Berkshire. Farley Wood is dominated by Farley Copse (sometimes known as Farley Moor Copse), a large woodland on the slopes falling away from Farley Hall and Farley Moor, two large Victorian houses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/binfield_ham.html |title=History of the Hamlets of Binfield, Berkshire|publisher=David Nash Ford|accessdate=18 October 2012[/tpl]
Following the building in the 1980s of a small housing estate either side of the Turnpike Road, the remaining copse was adopted by Bracknell Forest Borough Council providing a large woodland space full of oak, beech and ash trees; it is also home to a large Wellingtonia pine as well as various Roe Deer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/farleycopse |title=Farley Copse, Leisure and Culture, Bracknell Forest Council|publisher=Bracknell Forest Council|accessdate=18 October 2012[/tpl] Farley Wood Community Centre is nearbyhttp://www.bracknell-forest.gov.uk/farleywoodcommunitycentre.
To the south of the wood is Farley Moor Lake in the vicinity of which are many of Bracknell's big employers, such as Cable & Wireless, 3M, Fujitsu, HP and Dell in the near-by Amen Corner Business Park.
