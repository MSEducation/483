==History==

The institute was founded in 1971 as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS) by a loan of US$6 million (US$33 million[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.westegg.com/inflation/infl.cgi |title=The Inflation Calculator |date=11 July 2013 |website=Westegg.com |accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] 2012) from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and supported by President Park Chung-Hee.  The institute's academic scheme was mainly designed by Frederick E. Terman, vice president of Stanford University, and Chung Geum-mo, a professor at the Polytechnic Institution of Brooklyn.[tpl]cite web |url=http://40th.kaist.edu/history/kaist_history.do |title=KAIST's history and vision |website=KAIST.edu |publisher=KAIST |accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl] The institute's two main functions were to train advanced scientists and engineers and develop a structure of graduate education in the country.  Research studies began by 1973 and undergraduates studied for bachelor's degrees by 1984.
In 1981 the government merged the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) to form the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, or KAIST.  Due to differing research philosophies, KIST and KAIST split in 1989. In the same year KAIST and the Korea Institute of Technology (KIT) combined and moved from Seoul to the Daedeok Science Town in Daejeon. 
The first act of President Suh upon his inauguration in July 2006 was to lay out the KAIST Development Plan. The ‘KAIST Development Five-Year Plan’ was finalized on February 5, 2007 by KAIST Steering Committee. The goals of KAIST set by Suh were to become one of the best science and technology universities in the world, and to become one of the top-10 universities by 2011. 
In January 2008, the university dropped its full name, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, and changed its official name to only KAIST.'KAIST' Decides Not to Use Original Full Name, KAIST announcement, January 10, 2008.

In terms of ownership of intellectual property rights, KAIST holds 2,694 domestic patents and 723 international patents so far.KAIST Institute (KI)
Unusually for a mainstream scientific institute, KAIST has an active creation science presence: it has had a creation science display on campus since 1993, and has a creationist group, the Research Association for Creation Science;[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/486014a[/tpl] see creationism in South Korea for context and details.

===Electric vehicles===

Researchers at KAIST have developed an electric transport system called Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV),  where the vehicles get their power from cables underneath the surface of the road via non-contact magnetic charging (a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself). As a possible solution to traffic congestion and to improve overall efficiency by minimizing air resistance and so reduce energy consumption, the test vehicles followed the power track in a convoy. In July 2009 the researchers successfully supplied up to 60% power to a bus over a gap of [tpl]convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] from a power line embedded in the ground using power supply and pick up technology developed in-house.Gizmag.com
