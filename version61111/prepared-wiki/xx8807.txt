After Fard disappeared in June 1934, the Nation of Islam was led by Elijah Muhammad, who established places of worship (Temples), a school named Muhammad University of Islam, businesses, farms and real estate holdings in the United States and abroad.[tpl]cite book|title=Black Muslims in America|author=C. Eric Lincoln|year=1994|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.|pages=88, 89 218|ISBN=0-8028-0703-8[/tpl] There were a number of splits and splinter groups during Elijah Muhammad's leadership, most notably the departure of senior leader Malcolm X to become Sunni Muslim. After Elijah Muhammad's death, his son Warith Deen Mohammed changed the name of the organization several times and brought it into line with mainstream Sunni Islam.
In 1977, Louis Farrakhan rejected Warith Deen Mohammed's leadership and re-established the Nation of Islam on the original model. He took over the Nation of Islam's headquarter Temple, Mosque Maryam (Mosque #2), which is located in Chicago. Its official newspaper is The Final Call. The Nation of Islam does not publish its membership numbers; in 2007, the core membership was estimated between 20,000 and 50,000, but their following was believed to be larger.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/26/us/26farrakhan.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=Nation of Islam at a Crossroad as Leader Exits | date=February 26, 2007[/tpl]  Most of the members are in the United States, but there are minority communities in other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Jamaica, and Trinidad & Tobago.
Since 2010, under Farrakhan, members have been strongly encouraged to study Dianetics, and the Nation currently claims it has trained 1055 Auditors.[tpl]cite web|title=Nation of Islam Auditors graduation held for third Saviours’ Day in a row |first=Asahed |last=Mohammed |url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/National_News_2/article_9651.shtml|publisher=Final Call |date=February 28, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2013[/tpl]
There has been much speculation over the years about who will succeed Farrakhan as the national leader of the NOI. Most recently, Farrakhan's selection of Assistant Minister Ishmael Muhammad to deliver the 2013 Holy Day of Atonement key note address in his place may shed some light on that question.[tpl]cite web|title=Farrakhan’s Absence From NOI Event Spotlights Possible Successor, Ishmael Muhammad|url=http://blog.adl.org/anti-semitism/farrakhans-noi-event-spotlights-possible-successor-ishmael-muhammad|work=Access ADL|accessdate=24 October 2013[/tpl] Farrakhan was absent from the event due to suffering a heart attack, he later announced in Indianapolis in December 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=In First Appearance After Heart Attack, Farrakhan Continues Anti-Semitism|url=http://blog.adl.org/anti-semitism/farrakhans-first-appearance-after-heart-attack-features-anti-semitism|accessdate=6 December 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The Nation of Islam (NOI) was founded in Detroit, Michigan, on July 4th, 1930, by Wallace Fard Muhammad, also known as W. D. Fard Muhammad.[tpl]cite web|last=Muhammad|first=Tynetta|title=Nation of Islam History|url=http://www.noi.org/noi-history/|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] As the Nation of Islam website states, “His mission was to teach the downtrodden and defenseless Black people a thorough Knowledge of God and of themselves, and to put them on the road to Self-Independence with a superior culture and higher civilization than they had previously experienced.” The NOI teaches that W. Fard Muhammad was both the "Messiah" of Judaism and the Mahdi of Islam.
Fard chose his assistant minister, Elijah Muhammad, in 1931 to succeeded him as head of the movement, calling Muhammad “His Devine Representative.” Fard trained Muhammad night and day for 3 ½ years before he took over NOI in 1934. Muhammad and the movement itself was widely rejected during his 44 years as the NOI leader. However, Muhammad tried to do a lot as a leader, including establishing a newspaper titled “The Final Call to Islam” and attempting to create schools founded upon Muslim teachings.[tpl]cite web|title=Honorable Elijah Muhammad|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-elijah-muhammad/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]
Muslim parents agreed with the foundation of these new schools, but the Michigan State Board of Education did not. Muslim teachers were charged with contributing to the delinquency of minors and subsequently jailed. The charges were later dropped and the teachers were freed; Muhammad was given six months probation to relocate the children to a standard state school, but he refused because the classes were predominately taught by white Christians. Muhammad left for Chicago in September of that year. He was soon joined by W. D. Fard Muhammad, who was run out of Detroit by the police.[tpl]cite web|title=Honorable Elijah Muhammad|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-elijah-muhammad/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]
Shortly after in 1942, during World War II, Elijah Muhammad was charged and convicted of violating the Selective Service Act and jailed. Many other Nation of Islam members were charged for the same thing, as NOI opposes serving in the United States Military. Upon his release years later, Elijah Muhammad slowly built up the membership of his movement through recruitment in the postwar decades. His program called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of Allah and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.[tpl]cite web|title=Honorable Elijah Muhammad|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-elijah-muhammad/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] "Elijah Muhammad", Biography website/
During this time, the Nation of Islam attracted Malcolm Little. While in prison for burglary from 1946 to 1952, Little joined the Nation of Islam. He was influenced by his brother, Reginald, who had become a member in Detroit. Little quit smoking, gambling and eating pork, in keeping with the Nation's practices and dietary restrictions. He spent long hours reading books in the prison library. He also sharpened his oratory skills by participating in debate classes. Following Nation tradition, Elijah Muhammad ordered him to replace his surname, "Little", with an "X", a custom among Nation of Islam followers who considered their surnames to have been imposed by white slaveholders after their African names were taken from them.[tpl]cite web|title=Malcolm X|url=http://www.malcolmx.com/about/bio.html|publisher=The Estate of Malcolm X|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] 
Malcolm X rose rapidly to become the minister and national spokesperson for the NOI. Highly influenced by Malcolm X's membership, the Nation claimed a membership of 30,000. In March 1964, Malcolm X was excommunicated from the Nation due to disagreements with Elijah Muhammad; among other things, Malcolm X found issues with Muhammad's adherence to Muslim teachings, and Malcolm X's fame had led to media attention and an FBI infiltration into the Nation of Islam.[tpl]cite web|title=Malcolm X|url=http://www.malcolmx.com/about/bio.html|publisher=The Estate of Malcolm X|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]  In the next month, Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque Inc., stating, "I never left the Nation of Islam of my own free will. It was they who conspired with Captain Joseph here in New York to pressure me out of the Nation."http://www.brothermalcolm.net/mxwords/letters/lettertoelijah.gif
In 1955, Louis Walcott had joined the Nation of Islam. Following custom, he also replaced his surname with an "X". He was given his new name, "Farrakhan", by Elijah Muhammad. In 1965, following the assassination of Malcolm X, Farrakhan emerged as the protege of Malcolm. Like his predecessor, Farrakhan was a dynamic, charismatic leader and a powerful speaker with the ability to appeal to the African-American masses.http://www.biography.com/articles/Louis-Farrakhan-9291850?part=1
By the time Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, there were 75 NOI centers across America."Muhammad's Temple of Islam", Muhammad Speaks, 4 Oct 1974 The Nation's leadership chose Wallace Muhammad, also known as Warith Deen Mohammad, the fifth of Elijah's sons - not Farrakhan - as the new Supreme Minister. At the time, Nation of Islam was founded upon the principals of self-reliance and black supremacy, a belief that mainstream Muslims consider heretical.[tpl]cite web|last=Associated Press|title=Former Nation of Islam Leader Dies at 74|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26630405/ns/us_news-faith/t/former-nation-islam-leader-dies/#.U07QtPldWqE|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]  He shunned his father's theology and black pride views, forging closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities in an attempt to transition the Nation of Islam into orthodoxy more similar to Sunni Islam."Nation of Islam", Oxford Islamic Studies Online Under W.D. Mohammed's leadership, the Nation of Islam decentralized into many bodies of followers led by many different leaders. This made it hard to track the exact number of NOI members, but it’s estimated to be in the tens of thousands.[tpl]cite web|last=NBC News|title=Former Nation of Islam Leader Dies at 74|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26630405/ns/us_news-faith/t/former-nation-islam-leader-dies/#.U07QtPldWqE|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] 
In 1977, Farrakhan resigned from Wallace Muhammad's reformed organization. He worked to rebuild the Nation of Islam upon the original foundation established by Wallace Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad.Farrakhan traveled across America speaking in city after city gaining new followers. Over time, Farrakhan regained many of the Nation of Islam's original properties. Currently, there are mosques and study groups in over 120 American cities attributed to Farrakhan’s work as a leader.[tpl]cite web|title=Minister Louis Farrakhan|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-minister-farrakhan/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] 
In 1995, the Nation of Islam sponsored the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., to promote African-American unity and family values. Estimates of the number of marchers were given between 400 and 840 thousand. Under Farrakhan's leadership, the Nation of Islam tried to redefine the standard “black male stereotype” of drug and gang violence. Meanwhile, the Nation continued to promote social reform in African-American communities according to its traditional goals of self-reliance and economic independence.[tpl]cite web|title=Minister Louis Farrakhan|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-minister-farrakhan/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] 
Under Farrakhan's leadership, the Nation was one of the fastest growing of the various political movements in the country. Foreign branches of the Nation were formed in Ghana, London, Paris, and the Caribbean islands. In order to strengthen the international influence of the Nation, Farrakhan attempted to establish relations with Muslim countries. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991 and experienced a near-death experience in 2000 due to complications. After such experience, Farrakhan toned down the politics of NOI and attempted to strengthen relations with other minority communities, including Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.[tpl]cite web|title=Minister Louis Farrakhan|url=http://www.noi.org/hon-minister-farrakhan/|publisher=Nation of Islam|accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl]  
On May 8, 2010, Farrakhan publicly announced his embrace of Dianetics and has actively encouraged Nation of Islam members to undergo auditing from the Church of Scientology.[tpl]cite news |title=The Mothership of All Alliances |first=Eliza |last=Gray |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/108205/scientology-joins-forces-with-nation-of-islam |newspaper=The New Republic |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Louis Farrakhan renews call for self-determination among Nation of Islam followers |first1=Shelley |last1=Rossetter |first2=Thomas C. |last2=Tobin |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/religion/louis-farrakhan-renews-call-for-self-determination-among-nation-of-islam/1128781 |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=October 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 19, 2012[/tpl]  Since the announcement in 2010, the Nation Of Islam has been hosting its own Dianetics courses and its own graduation ceremonies. At the third such ceremony, which was  held on Saviours' Day 2013, it was announced that nearly 8500 members of the organisation had undergone Dianetics auditing. The Organisation announced it had graduated 1,055 auditors and had delivered 82,424 hours of auditing. The graduation ceremony was certified by the Church of Scientology, and the Nation of Islam members received official certification. The ceremony was attended by Shane Woodruff, vice-president of the Church of Scientology’s Celebrity Centre International. He stated that "The unfolding story of the Nation of Islam and Dianetics is bold, It is determined and it is absolutely committed to restoring freedom and wiping hell from the face of this planet.” 

==Beliefs and theology==

The Nation of Islam (NOI) preaches adherence to the Five Pillars of the Islamic Faith. The NOI also teaches morality and personal decorum, emphasizing modesty, mutual respect, and discipline in dress and comportment. NOI adherents stress a healthy diet and physical fitness, do not consume pork, shellfish, or alcohol, and do not use drugs or tobacco. They also refrain from premarital sex, as well as recreational sex while married, except for the sole purposes of producing children. Abortions are strongly discouraged except in the cases where the mother's life is in danger. However, the Nation of Islam argues that because of the unique experience of the oppression and degradation of slavery, Elijah Muhammad used unique methods for introducing Islam to his people.
The main belief of The Nation of Islam and its followers is that there is no other God but Allah. They teach that their founder, Master Fard Muhammad is the Mahdi.http://noi.org/about_beliefs_and_wants.shtml and that "Allah, came in the person of W. D. Fard."
The official beliefs of the Nation of Islam have been outlined in books, documents, and articles published by the organization, as well as speeches by Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, Farrakhan, and other ministers. Many of Elijah Muhammad's teachings may be found in Message to the Blackman in America and The True History of Jesus as Taught by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.Chicago: Coalition for the Remembrance of Elijah Muhammad, 1992
Written lessons from 1930 to 1934 were passed from W. Fard Muhammad to his student, Elijah Muhammad.  These were collected and entitled The Supreme Wisdom.  The Nation of Islam continues to teach its followers that the present world society is segmented into three distinct categories. They teach that from a general perspective, 85% of the population are the "deaf, dumb and blind" masses of the people who "are easily led in the wrong direction and hard to lead in the right direction".  Those 85% of the masses are said to be manipulated by 10% of the people.  Those 10% rich "slave-makers" are said to manipulate the 85% masses of the people through ignorance, the skillful use of religious doctrine, and the mass media.
The third group is referred to as the 5% "poor righteous teachers" of the people of the world, who know the truth of the manipulation of the 85% masses of the people by the 10%.  The 5% "righteous teachers" are at constant struggle and war with the 10% to reach and "free the minds" of the masses of the people."Assignment of Mr. Elijah Muhammad, The Supreme Wisdom", February 20, 1934; "Power at Last Forever", Louis Farrakhan, Madison Square Garden, New York, October, 1985

===Official platform===

An official Nation of Islam platform referred to as "The Muslim Program" was written by Elijah Muhammad in his book Message to the Blackman in America (1965). The itemized platform contains two sections; "What The Muslims Want", consisting of 10 points; and "What The Muslims Believe", consisting of 12 points.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.noi.org/muslim_program.htm |title=The Muslim Program |publisher=The Nation of Islam |accessdate=2008-04-22 [/tpl]

===Cosmology===

The NOI teaches that the Moon was once a part of the Earth, and that the Earth is over 76 trillion years old.Elijah Muhammad's 1961 "Atlanta Speech", quoted in Louis E. Lomax's When The Word Is Given...  The entire land mass on the Earth was called "Asia". This was, Elijah Muhammad claims, long before Adam.Message to the Blackman, Elijah Muhammad, 1965]

===Black experience of slavery was Bible prophecy===

The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the Atlantic slave trade they were systematically denied knowledge of their history, language, culture, and religion and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Central to this doctrine, NOI theology asserts that black people’s experience of slavery was the fulfillment of Bible prophecy and therefore, black people are the seed of Abraham referred to in the Bible, in Genesis 15:13–14:

===Separatism===

In an April 13, 1997, interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Tim Russert asked Farrakhan to explain the Nation of Islam's view on separation:

===Teachings on race===

Wallace Fard Muhammad taught that the original peoples of the world were black and that white people were a race of "devils" created by a scientist named Yakub (the Biblical and Qur'anic Jacob) on the Greek island of Patmos. According to the supreme wisdom lessons, Fard taught that whites were devils because of a culture of lies and murder that the black man Yakub instituted on the island to ensure the creation of his new people. Fard taught that Yakub established a secret birth control policy among the ruling class on the island. They were to kill all dark babies at birth and lie to the parents about the child's fate. Further, they were to make sure that the lighter-skinned children thrived in society. This policy encouraged a general preference for light skin. This was the establishment of the idea of White Supremacy. It was necessary to allow the process of grafting or making of a lighter skinned race of people who would be different. The idea was that if the light skinned people were allowed to mate freely with the dark skinned people, the population would remain dark-skinned due to the genetic dominance of the original dark-skinned people. This process took approximately 600 years to produce a blond-haired, blue-eyed group of people. As they migrated into the mainland they were greeted and welcomed by the indigenous people wherever they went. But according to the supreme wisdom lessons, they started making trouble among the righteous people, telling lies and causing confusion and mischief. This is when the ruling class of the Middle East decided to round up all the troublemakers that they could find and march them out, over the hot desert sands, into the caves and hillsides of Europe. Elijah claimed that this history is well-known and preserved, and is ritualized or re-enacted within many fraternal organizations and secret societies. Also, Fard taught that much of the savage ways of white people came from living in the caves and hillsides of Europe for over 2,000 years without any divine revelation or knowledge of civilization.Supreme Wisdom Lessons, Lost found muslim lesson 1 & 2
The writings of Elijah Muhammad advise a student must learn that the white man is “Yacub's grafted Devil” and “the Skunk of the planet Earth”.http://www.thenationofislam.org/
The Nation of Islam teaches that black people are the aboriginal people, and that all other people come from them. Farrakhan has stated, regarding spiritual ascension, "If you look at the human family — now, I'm talking about black, brown, red, yellow and white — we all seem to be frozen on a subhuman level of existence. In Islam and, I believe, in Christian theology and Jewish theology as well, there are three stages of human development. The first stage is called the animalistic stage of development. But when we submit to animal passions, then we can do evil things to one another in that animalistic stage of development. But when moral consciousness comes and we have a self-accusing spirit, it is then that we become human beings. Right now, we have the potential for humanity, but we have not reached that potential, because we are functioning on the animalistic plane of existence."Million Family March Transcript, 10/16/00
In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Farrakhan said the following in response to host Tim Russert's question on the Nation of Islam's teachings on race:
Pressed by Russert on whether he agreed with Elijah Muhammad's preaching that whites are "blue-eyed devils", Farrakhan responded:
During the time when Malcolm X was a member and leader of the Nation of Islam, he preached that black people were genetically dominant to white people but were dominated by a system of white supremacy:
After Malcolm X made his pilgrimage to Mecca,  he stated that seeing Muslims of "all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans", interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.  He credits his evolving views on Islam and race as a reason for leaving the Nation of Islam and his decision to convert to Sunni IslamMalcolm X, Autobiography, pp. 388–393; quote from pp. 390–391.
The Nation of Islam teaches that intermarriage or race mixing should be prohibited.  This is point 10 of the official platform, "What the Muslims Want", published 1965."What The Muslims Want". Nation of Islam website. Farrakhan nevertheless stated in the Tim Russert interview: [tpl]Quote|The mother of the Leader who came to North America to teach us, Fard Muhammad, His mother was a white woman. His father was a black man. So where there is love, love transcends our racial denomination or ethnicity. Love is the great power of transformation. I don't think that we can say when two people are in love that they shouldn't marry one another. But I would prefer that the black man and the black woman marry into their own kind.Farrakhan Meets The Press[/tpl]

===The Mother Plane and Ezekiel's Wheel[tpl]anchor|The Mother Plane and Ezekiel's Wheel[/tpl][tpl]anchor|The Mother Plane[/tpl][tpl]anchor|Ezekiel's Wheel[/tpl]===

Elijah Muhammad taught his followers about a Mother Plane or Wheel, a UFO that was seen and described in the visions of the prophet Ezekiel in the "Book of Ezekiel", in the Hebrew Bible.
Farrakhan, commenting on his teacher's description said the following:

==Criticism==

The first book analyzing the Nation of Islam was The Black Muslims in America (1961) by C. Eric Lincoln. Lincoln describes the use of doctrines during religious services.
In recent years, the embrace of Dianetics under Farrakhan has drawn much criticism that the Nation of Islam is becoming too close to the Church of Scientology and the ideas of its founder L. Ron Hubbard, whom Farrakhan has said he respects. Farrakhan has praised Hubbard, saying he was "exceedingly valuable to every Caucasian person on this Earth". Of followers of Scientology, he stated "You can still be a Christian; you just won't be a devil Christian. You'll still be a Jew, but you won't be a satanic Jew!".[tpl]cite web|title=Preparation of the Mind and Qualifications to Act for Christ |first=Louis |last=Farrakhan |url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Minister_Louis_Farrakhan_9/article_7648.shtml|work=The Final Call |date=March 11, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2012[/tpl]

===Antisemitism===

The Nation of Islam has repeatedly denied charges of anti-Semitism.Farrakhan and the Jewish Rift; A Historic Reference Farrakhan has stated, "The ADL ... uses the term 'anti-Semitism' to stifle all criticism of Zionism and the Zionist policies of the State of Israel and also to stifle all legitimate criticism of the errant behavior of some Jewish people toward the non-Jewish population of the earth."The Final Call. February 16, 1994 However, he has also stated:[tpl]Quote|Jews have been conclusively linked to the greatest criminal endeavor ever undertaken against an entire race of people ... the black African Holocaust.[/tpl][tpl]Quote|Who are the slumlords in the Black community? The so-called Jews ... Who is it sucking our blood in the Black community?

Professor David W. Leinweber of Emory University asserts that the Nation of Islam has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and that they exaggerate the role of Jews in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Leinweber and others use the original statements of Farrakhan and others as the basis for their evaluation.H-ANTISEMITISM OCCASIONAL PAPERS, NO. 1M NOI Health Minister Abdul Alim Muhammad has accused Jewish doctors of injecting Blacks with the AIDS virus.Nation of Islam[tpl]cite book|title=Judaism and Genocide: Psychological Undercurrents of History Volume IV|author=Piven, Jerry S.|year=2002|page=10|publisher=Writers Club Press|ISBN=0-595-24086-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eFFsEYvBEZgC[/tpl]

==Comparison with traditional Islam==

The Nation of Islam resembles traditional Islam in many ways, however some differences are present. For instance, Nation of Islam preaches the following of the Five Pillars of the Islamic Faith, though somewhat different, it is important to note that interpretation of the Five Pillars differs among many different Islamic schools of thought, as well as different Islamic cultures. 
The NOI mosques have lecture rooms that contain seats for the worshipers during sermons (males on one side and females on the other) with the prayer hall, also known as the musalla, in another room for the 5 daily Muslim prayers prostration.
Other doctrines of the Nation of Islam are also disputed, specifically:

===Divide between NOI and the Italian Muslim Association===

On March 7, 1998 the Board of Ulema of the Italian Muslim Association (AMI) issued a fatwa against the Nation of Islam. According to the AMI, "the obligatory daily five prayers of Islam are not imposed upon the members of the Nation, and the ritual bowings and prostrations have been removed from prayers. Friday service consists of a sermon by a minister with an invocation, but the congregational prayer of two Raka'ahs is not held. The Islamic fast in Ramadan has been made optional and Hajj is not required of the followers."http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=83361

==Foreign affiliations==

The Nation of Islam's links to Libya are well known. The Muslim group obtained substantial funds from Gaddafi, notably a $5 million loan used to pay back-taxes and costs for the home of the movement’s former leader Elijah Muhammad and a $3 million loan from Libya in the 1970s to acquire its opulent headquarters on Chicago’s South Side."Nation of Islam leader slams Gaddafi's 'assassination', says rejoicing will turn to sorrow". Associated Press The Washington Post. October 25, 2011 Libya channeled funds through the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) based in Canada to a Libyan intelligence front in Washington. The money was funneled for the purpose of financing trips to Tripoli by the NOI and American radicals, according to a Canadian parliamentary investigation and a prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in northern Virginia.Carlyle Murphy, "US Alleges Plot by Libyans; Col. North Said to be Target". The Washington Post, July 21, 1988 "At least one gathering attended by Farrakhan in Libya – in violation of a travel ban imposed on Americans by President Reagan after Libya was linked to terrorist attacks in Europe – offered training seminars on weapons and explosives."Warren Strobel, "Farrakhan aide threatens to kill whites in the street". The Washington Times, April 21, 1996.

The Washington Post. July 1988.
In 1994, the NOI leader visited Khartoum, where he met with Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, the Sudanese head of state and Dr. Hassan Abdullah al-Turabi, who headed Sudan’s ruling party.
Farrakhan's National Assistant Khalid Abdul Muhammed attended the 1995 PAIC meeting.  Upon meeting Sheikh Naim Qassem of Hezbollah after a news conference at a Khartoum hotel, Muhammed found a translator to convey his greetings.
In 1996, Farrakhan traveled to Iran and Iraq, as well as Libya, at which time Gaddafi offered him an additional $1 billion.http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-nation-of-islam-and-violence/  Farrakhan insisted that the money would not be used to arm his followers, despite a report from Iran that Farrakhan had said there that one day Allah will destroy Americans at the hands of Muslims. The full statement attributed to Farrakhan was, [tpl]Quote|God will not give Japan and Europe the honor of bringing down the United States. This is an honor God will bestow upon Muslims.[/tpl]
As of 2011, Farrakhan continued to portray Gaddafi as a fellow revolutionary who has lent millions of dollars to the Nation of Islam over the years.

===The Final Call===

The Final Call is a newspaper distributed by NOI in Chicago, publishing news stories on a variety of topics, primarily related to Blacks in America.
"The Muslim Program" is published in every issue of the newspaper stating the demands of the Nation of Islam.
NOI journalists have written about a range of topics, including conspiracy theories on the murder of John F. Kennedy and a CIA conspiracy to disrupt rule in Libya.http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_7783.shtml Harold Muhammad, minister of an NOI New Orleans mosque, wrote in the paper that there is enough evidence that AIDS is a man-made disease being used by the U.S. government against Blacks.Harold Muhammad, Minister of New Orleans Mosque Interview with the Times Picayune April 11, 1994: http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/adl/nation-of-islam/noi-10.html[tpl]Verify credibility|date=September 2012[/tpl]

===Videos===

The NOI has produced a number of videos promoting anti-American sentiments. NOI video titles include "Conspiracy of the International Bankers", "Conspiracy of the U.S. Government", "Controversy with Jews", and "Which One Will You Choose, the Flag of Islam or the Flag of America?" In one video Farrakhan is said to state, "I hasten to tell you that the precious lives that were lost in the World Trade Center was a cover, a cover for a war that had been planned to bring a pipeline through Afghanistan to bring oil from that region, oil owned by Unocal, of which Dick Cheney is a stock holder."Bedard, Paul (July 5, 2011). "Farrakhan's Hate Sermons to Prisoners Slammed". U.S. News and World Report. Retrieved September 5, 2012.
Farrakhan's videos also address the U.S. military. During the Millions March in Harlem, Farrakhan discussed the Fort Hood shootings as he addressed the crowd. [tpl]Quote|You don't join the armed forces to become nation builders. You join the armed forces and they train you to kill. They're killers. So why did Army major Nidal Malik Hassan, a Muslim psychologist at Fort Hood go on a shooting spree after being assigned to debrief soldiers who came back from the theater of war.  He couldn't take it any more so he shot up the soldiers. They want you to think he was a terrorist. But he was debriefing terrorists. And unfortunately, it took his balance.[tpl]YouTube|2n9rjC5unO4|"Millions March in Harlem"[/tpl] speech: August 13, 2011[/tpl]
Controversy over the availability of NOI videos and writings surfaced on June 15, 2011, when Representative Peter King, Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security hosted a hearing titled "The Threat of Muslim-American Radicalization in U.S. Prisons". During the hearing, former Bureau of Prisons director Harley Lappin testified on the extreme susceptibility of radicalization of inmates through propaganda efforts of groups like NOI.  Testimony included discussion of an incident in which two radicalized converts planned a terrorist attack on a military facility in Seattle.  The suspects had met in prison and had converted to Islam while there.
In July 2011, King and Representative Frank Wolf, worried that prisoners were being radicalized by Farrakhan, asked U.S. Bureau of Prisons Acting Director Thomas Kane to remove Nation of Islam material from prisons and to audit all other Islamic texts and sermons made available to inmates as well as bureau procedures for approving such materials.
