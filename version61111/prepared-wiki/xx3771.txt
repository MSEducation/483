Hans Christian Andersen ([tpl]IPA-da|ˈhanˀs ˈkʁæsdjan ˈɑnɐsn̩|lang[/tpl]; often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; April 2, 1805[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]August 4, 1875) was a Danish author and poet. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called [tpl]lang|da|eventyr[/tpl] in Danish, or "fairy-tales" in English, express themes that transcend age and nationality.
Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages,[tpl]cite news|last=Wenande|first=Christian|title=Unknown Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale discovered|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/international/unknown-hans-christian-andersen-fairy-tale-discovered|accessdate=15 December 2012|newspaper=The Copenhagen Post|date=13 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.[tpl]harvnb|Wullschläger|2002[/tpl] Some of his most famous  fairy tales include "The Little Mermaid", "The Ugly Duckling", "The Nightingale", "The Emperor's New Clothes" and many more.
His stories have inspired plays, ballets, and both live-action and animated films.[tpl]harvnb|Bredsdorff|1975[/tpl]

==Early life==

Hans Christian Andersen was born in the town of Odense, Denmark, on Tuesday, April 2, 1805. He was an only child. Andersen's father, also Hans, considered himself related to nobility. His paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had in the past belonged to a higher social class,[tpl]harvnb|Rossel|1996|p=6[/tpl] but investigations prove these stories unfounded.[tpl]cite web|last=Askgaard|first=Ejnar Stig|title=The Lineage of Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://museum.odense.dk/knowledge/knowledge-hans-christian-andersen/publications-on-hca-/the-lineage-of-hca.aspx|publisher=Odense City Museums|accessdate=17 December 2012[/tpl] Theories that Andersen may have been an illegitimate son of King Christian VII persist.
Andersen's father, who had received an elementary education, introduced Andersen to literature, reading him Arabian Nights.[tpl]harvnb|Rossel|1996|p=7[/tpl] Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was uneducated and worked as a washerwoman following his father's death in 1816, remarrying in 1818. Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and was forced to support himself, working as a weaver's apprentice and, later, for a tailor. At 14, he moved to Copenhagen to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the Royal Danish Theatre, but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.
Jonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, felt a great affection for him, and sent him to a grammar school in Slagelse, persuading King Frederick VI to pay part of his education.Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education. Danishnet. Andersen had already published his first story, The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave, in 1822. Though not a keen student, he also attended school at Elsinore until 1827.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3257 |title=H.C. Andersens skolegang i Helsingør Latinskole |publisher=Hcandersen-homepage.dk |date= |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]
He later said his years in school were the darkest and most bitter of his life. At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused in order "to improve his character," he was told. He later said the faculty had discouraged him from writing in general, causing him to enter a state of depression.

==Career==

===Early work===

A very early fairy tale by Andersen called The Tallow Candle ([tpl]lang-da|Tællelyset[/tpl]) was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, was about a candle who did not feel appreciated. It was written while he was still in school and dedicated to a benefactor, in whose family's possession it remained until it turned up among other family papers in a suitcase in a local archive.[tpl]cite web|title=Local historian finds Hans Christian Andersen’s first fairy tale|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1841147/local-historian-finds-hans-christian-andersens-first-fairy-tale/|publisher=Politiken.dk|accessdate=2 June 2013[/tpl]
In 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with a short story titled A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager. In the book, the protagonist meets characters ranging from Saint Peter to a talking cat. He followed this success with a theatrical piece, Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower and a short volume of poems. Though he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small traveling grant from the King, enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At Jura, near Le Locle, Switzerland, he wrote the story, Agnete and the Merman. He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of Sestri Levante the same year, inspiring the name, The Bay of Fables.[tpl]cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013[/tpl] In October 1834, he arrived in Rome. Andersen's travels in Italy would be reflected in his first novel; an autobiography titled The Improvisatore ([tpl]lang|da|Improvisatoren[/tpl]) which was published in 1835, receiving  instant acclaim.

===Fairy tales and poetry===

His initial attempts at writing fairy tales were revisions of stories that he heard as a child. Andersen brought this genre to a new level by writing a vast number of fairy tales that were both bold and original. Initially they were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty in translating them and capturing his genius for humor and dark pathos.
It was during 1835 that Andersen published the first two installments of his immortal Fairy Tales ([tpl]lang-da|Eventyr[/tpl]; lit. "fantastic tales"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection consists of nine tales that includes The Tinderbox, The Princess and the Pea, Thumbelina, The Little Mermaid and The Emperor's New Clothes. The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, O.T. (1836) and Only a Fiddler (1837); the latter was reviewed by the young Søren Kierkegaard.
After a visit to Sweden in 1837, Andersen became inspired by Scandinavism and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians.[tpl]cite web|work=Hans Christian Andersen and Music|url=http://www.kb.dk/elib/noder/hcamusik/skandinav/index_en.htm|title=I am a Scandinavian|accessdate=2007-01-12[/tpl] It was in July 1839 during a visit to the island of Funen that Andersen first wrote the text of his poem, Jeg er en Skandinav ("I am a Scandinavian"). Andersen composed the poem to capture "the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together," as part of a Scandinavian national anthem. Composer Otto Lindblad set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung. Andersen spent two weeks at the Augustenborg Palace in the autumn of 1844.[tpl]harvnb|Bredsdorff|1975|p=169[/tpl]
Andersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet ([tpl]lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling[/tpl]), which consists of The Daisy, The Steadfast Tin Soldier and The Wild Swans.
The year 1845 heralded a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four different translations of his fairy tales. The Little Mermaid appeared in the periodical Bentley's Miscellany. It was followed by a second volume, Wonderful Stories for Children. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were A Danish Story Book and Danish Fairy Tales and Legends. A review that appeared in the London journal The Athenæum (February 1846) said of Wonderful Stories, "This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand."
Andersen would continue to write fairy tales, and he published them in installments until 1872.

===Travelogues===

In 1851, he published to wide acclaim In Sweden, a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveler, Andersen published several other long travelogues: Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831, A Poet's Bazaar, In Spain, and A Visit to Portugal in 1866. (The latter describes his visit with his Portuguese friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as In Sweden, even contain fairy-tales.
In the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the Picture-Book without Pictures (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.
Between 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at 67 Nyhavn, Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen  |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |date= |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl]

==Personal life==

===Meetings with Dickens===

In June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The Countess of Blessington invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one party that he met Charles Dickens for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda which was of much joy to Andersen. He wrote in his diary, "We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now living writer, whom I love the most."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C. Andersen og Charles Dickens 1857 |publisher=Hcandersen-homepage.dk |date=30 December 2001 |accessdate=2 April 2010 (dead link as of December 2012)[/tpl]
The two authors respected each other's work and had something important in common as writers: Depictions of the poor and the underclass, who often had difficult lives affected both by the Industrial Revolution and by abject poverty. In the Victorian era there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealization of the innocence of childhood.
Ten years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to visit Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at Gads Hill Place into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Anderson was told to leave, Dickens stopped all correspondence between them, much to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.

===Love life===

In Andersen's early life, his private journal records his refusal to have sexual relations.[tpl]cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | publisher = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 [/tpl]Recorded using "special Greek symbols".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 | format=PDF[/tpl]
Andersen often fell in love with unattainable women and many of his stories are interpreted as references.[tpl]cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=April 4, 2003[/tpl]  At one point, he wrote in his diary: "Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee! Give me a livelihood! Give me a bride! My blood wants love, as my heart does!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://scandinavian.wisc.edu/mellor/hca_summer/glossary/bachelor.html |title=The Tales of Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=Scandinavian.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2 April 2010[/tpl] A girl named Riborg Voigt was the unrequited love of Andersen's youth. A small pouch containing a long letter from Riborg was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he supposedly fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted, the daughter of the physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin.  One of his stories, The Nightingale, was a written expression of his passion for Jenny Lind, and became the inspiration for her nickname, the "Swedish Nightingale". Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to take her to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844 "farewell... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=22484 |title=H.C.

Andersen wrote to Edvard Collin:Hans Christian Andersen's correspondence, ed Frederick Crawford6, London. 1891 "I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery." Collin, who preferred women, wrote in his own memoir: "I found myself unable to respond to this love, and this caused the author much suffering." Likewise, the infatuations of the author for the Danish dancer Harald Scharff[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/liv/tidstavle/vis_e.html?date=1862-00-00 |title=The Life of Hans Christian Andersen.

==Death==

In the spring of 1872, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt, never recovering.  Soon after he started to show signs of liver cancer, and died on August 4, 1875, in a house called Rolighed (literally: calmness), near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the  banker Moritz Melchior and his wife.Bryant, Mark: Private Lives, 2001, p.12 Shortly before his death, he had consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: "Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps." His body was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro area of Copenhagen.
At the time of his death, Andersen was internationally treasured. The Danish Government paid him an annual stipend as a "national treasure". Even before his death, steps had already been taken to erect a large statue in his honor by sculptor August Saabye, which can now be seen in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens in Copenhagen.

==Legacy==

The "Hans Christian Andersen Awards" are given biennially by the International Board on Books for Young People to an author and illustrator whose complete works have made lasting contributions to children's literature."Hans Christian Andersen Awards", International Board on Books for Young People
Andersen's stories laid the groundwork for other children's classics, such as Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame and Winnie the Pooh by A.A. Milne. The technique of making inanimate objects, such as toys, come to life (Little Ida's Flowers) would later be used by Lewis Carroll and Beatrix Potter.
April 2, Andersen's birthday, is celebrated as International Children's Book Day.[tpl]cite web |title=International Children's Book Day |accessdate=17 December 2012 |publisher=International Board on Books for Young People |url=http://www.ibby.org/index.php?id=269 |quote=Since 1967, on or around Hans Christian Andersen's birthday, 2 April, International Children's Book Day (ICBD) is celebrated to inspire a love of reading and to call attention to children's books.[/tpl] The year 2005, designated "Andersen Year" in Denmark,[tpl]cite web|last=Brabant|first=Malcolm|title=Enduring legacy of author Andersen|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4351829.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=1 April 2005[/tpl]  was the bicentenary of Andersen's birth, and his life and work was celebrated around the world.

===Film===

The 1952 film Hans Christian Andersen, though inspired by Andersen's life and literary legacy, was meant to be neither historically nor biographically accurate; it begins by saying, "This is not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about this great spinner of fairy tales." A more accurate biographical treatment was attempted in Hans Christian Andersen: My Life as a Fairytale in 2003.
Andersen is a vital character in the Disney TV series The Little Mermaid's episode, "Metal Fish". Here, his inspiration for writing his tale The Little Mermaid is shown to have been granted by an encounter with the show's protagonists.
In 1966, Rankin/Bass Productions produced a fantasy film called The Daydreamer, which depicts the young Hans Christian Andersen imaginatively conceiving the stories he would later write.
