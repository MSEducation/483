==Overview==

IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliances is a family pre-built, pre-configured rack mountable network devices (XML appliances) that can help accelerate XML and Web Services deployments while extending SOA infrastructure. Originally these devices were created by DataPower Technology Inc., which was acquired by IBM in October 2005.Press release about IBM's acquisition of DataPower Technology Inc.
This family consists of rack-mountable network devices and also blade devices.

==Technical Specifications==

DataPower Appliances contain many specialized hardware components, including ASIC-based IPS, custom encrypted RAID drives, and (optional) hardware security modules.
DataPower Appliances operate a single digitally signed firmware containing an operating system and application stack.  DataPower's firmware runs on a flash storage device.  IBM refreshes and enhances the DataPower firmware image every 10â€“20 weeks. Users cannot run 3rd party applications on DataPower as they would need a traditional server and operating system.  Instead of a traditional filesystem, DataPower runs with a collection of isolated virtual file systems called 'Application Domains'.  As a result, DataPower can appear to its client connections be any type of network file system with any type of folders and links.
DataPower firmware is mostly used to perform electronic messaging functions. It can perform transformation and routing of messages as an enterprise service bus or protects web services interfaces and the architecture behind them from attacks. It helps to integrate any two applications by considering them as services. It is platform and language independent.
