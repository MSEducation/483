[[Citizenship]]

CATEGORIES: Citizenship, Human migration, Nationality, Government, Political concepts

Citizenship is the status of a person recognised under the custom or law of a state that bestows on that person (called a citizen) the rights and the duties of citizenship. That may include the right to vote, work and live in the country, the right to return to the country, the right to own real estate, legal protections against the country's government, and protection through the military or diplomacy. A citizen may also be subject to certain duties, such as a duty to follow the country's law, to pay taxes, or to serve in the military. A person may have multiple citizenships and a person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless.
Nationality is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh[/tpl] – notably in international law – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a nation (a large ethnic group).[tpl]cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff & Noordhoff |page=3[/tpl] In some countries, e.g. the United States, Israel, Philippines, and the United Kingdom, "nationality" and "citizenship" have different meanings.

==Determining factors==

A person can be a citizen for several reasons. Usually citizenship of the place of birth is automatic; in other cases an application may be required.

==History==

===Polis===

Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early city-states of ancient Greece, although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for mankind, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first laws. Polis meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32[/tpl] Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.[tpl]sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4[/tpl] There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny. The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician Solon made reforms in the early Athenian state.[ref]

Historian Geoffrey Hosking in his 2005 Modern Scholar lecture course suggested that citizenship in ancient Greece arose from an appreciation for the importance of freedom.[ref]
</ref> Hosking explained:
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life. Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves or barbarians.[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33[/tpl] The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the ancient Greek times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between public and private life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one’s everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: “To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!” This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===

In the Roman Empire, citizenship expanded from small scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency; it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.See Civis romanus sum. Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of equality under the law, civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",[ref]
</ref> but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.<ref name=twsffujfk/> If Greek citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things",[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35[/tpl] the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:
[tpl]Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|J. G. A. Pocock, 1988[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36[/tpl][/tpl]
Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class patrician interests against the lower-order working groups known as the plebeian class. A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37[/tpl] Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37[/tpl] And the law, itself, was a kind of bond uniting people.[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38[/tpl] Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.[tpl]sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38[/tpl]

===Middle Ages===

During European Middle Ages, citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns, see burgher, Grand Burgher (German Großbürger) and Bourgeoisie. Nobility used to have privileges above commoners (see aristocracy), but the French Revolution and other revolutions revoked these privileges and made citizens.

===Renaissance===

During the Renaissance, people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.[tpl]rp|p.161[/tpl] Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.[tpl]sfn|Weber|1998|p=44[/tpl] And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.[tpl]sfn|Weber|1998|p=44[/tpl] City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.[tpl]sfn|Weber|1998|p=46[/tpl] Membership in guilds was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.[tpl]sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47[/tpl] The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.[tpl]sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3[/tpl] Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept, and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having rights and duties.

===Modern times===

The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as representative democracy. Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act. Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.

==Different senses==

Citizenship status, under social contract theory, carries with it both rights and responsibilities. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."[tpl]cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.
