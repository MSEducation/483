Combustion [tpl]IPAc-en|k|əm|ˈ|b|ʌ|s|.|tʃ|ən[/tpl] or burningcolloquial meaning of burning is combustion accompanied by flames is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can produce light in the form of either glowing or a flame.
In a complete combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing element, such as oxygen or fluorine, and the products are compounds of each element in the fuel with the oxidizing element. For example:
The standard enthalpy of reaction for methane combustion at [tpl]val|298.15|ul=K[/tpl] and [tpl]val|1|ul=atm[/tpl] is [tpl]val|-802|ul=kJ|upl=mol[/tpl].Reaction-Web
A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines:
The result is water vapor, with a standard enthalpy of reaction at [tpl]val|298.15|ul=K[/tpl] and [tpl]val|1|ul=atm[/tpl] of [tpl]val|-242|ul=kJ|upl=mol[/tpl].
Complete combustion is almost impossible to achieve. As actual combustion reactions come to equilibrium, a wide variety of major and minor species will be present, such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen and even carbon (soot or ash).  Additionally, any combustion at high temperatures in atmospheric air, which is 78 percent nitrogen, will also create small amounts of several nitrogen oxides, commonly referred to as [tpl]chem|NO|x[/tpl].
Combustion need not always involve oxygen; e.g., hydrogen burns in chlorine to form hydrogen chloride with the liberation of heat and light characteristic of combustion.
