The Minister-President of the Brussels Capital-Region ([tpl]lang-fr|Région de Bruxelles-Capitale[/tpl], [tpl]lang-nl|Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest[/tpl]) is the person leading the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.[tpl]cite web |title=The Belgian Constitution (English version) |url=http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/pdf_sections/publications/constitution/grondwetEN.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Belgian House of Representatives |date=January 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-05 |quote=Article 3: Belgium comprises three Regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region and the Brussels region. Article 4: Belgium comprises four linguistic regions: the Dutch-speaking region, the French speaking region, the bilingual region of Brussels-Capital and the German-speaking region.[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Brussels-Capital Region: Creation |url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/creation.shtml |publisher=Centre d'Informatique pour la Région Bruxelloise (Brussels Regional Informatics Center) |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-05 |quote=Since 18 June 1989, the date of the first regional elections, the Brussels-Capital Region has been an autonomous region comparable to the Flemish and Walloon Regions.[/tpl] (All text and all but one graphic show the English name as Brussels-Capital Region.) The post is appointed for 5 years along with 4 ministers and 3 "state" secretaries. While being the leader of the Government, the Minister-President also is the president of the College of the Common Community Commission of Brussels.
The Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region should neither be confused with the Governor of Brussels-Capital nor with the mayor of the City of Brussels, which is one of the 19 municipalities of Brussels.
The Minister-President is not counted in the ratio of French-speaking to Dutch-speaking ministers.  In practice every Minister-President has been a francophone, though bilingual.
