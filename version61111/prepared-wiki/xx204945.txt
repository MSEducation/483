==History==

The centre was opened in 1963 by the Metropolitan Railway Surplus Land company as an open air precinct, but by 1980 it was in decline, with consistent vandalism combined with poor construction materials and appearance deterring retailers from locating within it. In 1990 the freeholders of the precinct, the local council (TMBC) and other organisations stepped in to sort out the centre and initiate a redevelopment strategy. In 1994 that plan was made a reality with the centre extended and made undercover, along with a new market hall and increased retail space. It is now extremely popular within the catchment area and it boasts a number of well-known chain stores such as B&M, O2, Argos and Gamestation. It is now owned by Manchester based property group, MCR Property Group.
