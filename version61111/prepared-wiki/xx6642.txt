Liverpool [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|v|ər|p|uː|l[/tpl] is a city and metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England, United Kingdom along the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. It was founded as a borough in 1207 and was granted city status in 1880. In 2011 the population administered by Liverpool City Council was 466,415[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2012/07/17/census-data-shows-liverpool-s-population-has-risen-by-5-5-to-466-400-99623-31408603 | location=Liverpool | work=Liverpool Daily Post | first=David | last=Bartlett | title=Census data shows Liverpool's population has risen by 5.5% to 466,400 | date=17 July 2012[/tpl] and is at the centre of a wider urban area, the Liverpool City Region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ippr.org/uploadedFiles/cfc/research/projects/centre_for_cities/Liverpool_city_briefing.pdf|title=CITY LEADERSHIP: GIVING CITY-REGIONS THE POWER TO GROW ADAM MARSHALL AND DERMOT FINCH/LIVERPOOL BRIEFING/Liverpool and its City-Region|location=London|publisher=Centre for Cities|page=1|year=2006|accessdate=16 September 2012[/tpl]
Historically, Liverpool was a part of Lancashire. The city's urbanisation and expansion were largely brought about by the city's status as a major port. By the 18th century, trade from the West Indies, Ireland and mainland Europe, coupled with close links with the Atlantic slave trade, furthered the economic expansion of Liverpool. Liverpool is also well known for its inventions and innovations, particularly in terms of infrastructure, transport, general construction, and in the fields of public health and social reform. Railways, ferries and the skyscraper[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] were all pioneered in the city, together with the first societies for animal and child protection, the first schools for the blind, for working-men, and for girls. Liverpool was the port of registry of the ocean liner, the RMS Titanic, and the words Titanic, Liverpool could be seen on the stern of the ship.
Inhabitants of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians but are also colloquially known as "Scousers", in reference to the local dish known as "scouse", a form of stew. The word "Scouse" has also become synonymous with the Liverpool accent and dialect.Many people "self-identify" as Liverpudlians or Scousers without actually being born or living within the city boundaries of Liverpool. Many people from within the greater Merseyside area consider themselves thus, although many do not. Conversely, a number of people from Liverpool itself may not consider themselves Scousers, since the term for them may have pejorative overtones. Liverpool's status as a port city has contributed to its diverse population, which, historically, were drawn from a wide range of peoples, cultures, and religions, particularly those from Ireland. The city is also home to the oldest Black African community in the country and the oldest Chinese community in Europe.
Labelled the World Capital City of Pop by Guinness World Records, artists of Liverpool origin have produced more number one singles than any other.[tpl]cite news|title=Ten facts on Liverpool|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-183439/Ten-facts-Liverpool.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=23 March 2013|location=London[/tpl] The popularity of The Beatles, Billy Fury, Gerry and the Pacemakers, and the other groups from the Merseybeat era, and later bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, contributes to Liverpool's status as a tourist destination; tourism forms a significant part of the city's modern economy. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007, and it held the European Capital of Culture title together with Stavanger, Norway, in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/pdf/doc1155_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report on the Nominations from the UK and Norway for the European Capital of Culture 2008|accessdate=11 July 2008[/tpl]
Liverpool is noted for its rich architectural heritage and is home to many buildings regarded as amongst the greatest examples of their respective styles in the world. Several areas of the city centre were granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004. Referred to as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the site comprises six separate locations in the city including the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street and includes many of the city's most famous landmarks.[tpl]cite web|title=Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City  |publisher=UK Local Authority World Heritage Forum |url=http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm |accessdate=9 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423041054/http://www.lawhf.gov.uk/LAWHF/liverpool.htm  |archivedate = 23 April 2008[/tpl]
Liverpool is also well known for its strong sporting identity. The city is home of two Premier League football clubs, Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C. Matches between the two clubs are known as the Merseyside derby. The world-famous Grand National also takes places annually at Aintree Racecourse on the outskirts of the city.

==History==

[tpl]Main|History of Liverpool[/tpl] [tpl]see also|Timeline of Liverpool history[/tpl]

===Early history===

King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool, but by the middle of the 16th century the population was still only around 500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in a H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).
In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for the town were waged during the English Civil War, including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699 Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament, that same year its first slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa. As trade from the West Indies surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee silted up, Liverpool began to grow. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[tpl]cite web|title=The Lost Dock of Liverpool |publisher=Channel 4: Time Team, 21 April 2008 |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/liverpool/liverpool-found.html |accessdate=2 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Liverpool Dock System |publisher=New York Times, 2 January 1898 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFD91039E433A25751C0A9679C94699ED7CF |accessdate=2 June 2008 | date=2 January 1898[/tpl] Note: "pdf" reader needed to see full article Substantial profits from the slave trade helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the abolitionist movement.
In the early 19th century Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.Liverpool Beach. SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica.
By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. By 1851, approximately 25% of the city's population was Irish-born. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was drawing immigrants from across Europe. This is evident from the diverse array of religious buildings located across the city, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolfus Kyrka and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.

===20th century===

The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing building across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were rehoused from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the pretext that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. A large number of private homes were also built during this era. The process continued after the Second World War, with many more new housing estates being built in suburban areas, while some of the older inner city areas were also redeveloped for new homes. The Great Depression of the early 1930s saw unemployment in the city peak at around 30%.
During the Second World War there were 80 air-raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular, and was as flawed as much town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s – the portions of the city's heritage that survived German bombing could not withstand the efforts of urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also experienced severe aerial bombing during the war.
Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants after World War II, mostly settling in older inner city areas such as Toxteth. However, a significant West Indian black community had existed in the city as long ago as the first two decades of the 20th century.
In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the "Merseybeat" sound which became synonymous with The Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands.
From the mid-1970s onwards Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were once again among the highest in the UK,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/liverpool.html |title=A History of Liverpool |publisher=Localhistories.org |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl] standing at 17% by January 1982 – although this was just over half of the level of unemployment that was affecting the city in an economic downturn 50 years previously.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gJJVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-z8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1176,3408501&dq=liverpool+million+unemployment&hl=en
In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered and has experienced growth rates higher than the national average since the mid-nineties.
thumb|right|Mathew Street is one of many tourist attractions related to The Beatles, and the location of Europe's largest annual free music festival. At the end of the 20th century Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process which still continues today.
Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became in 1974 a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside.

===21st century===

To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice.
Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as The Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.
In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 m development centred on Paradise Street, which involved the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE', the centre opened in May 2008.
In 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the foundation of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool is a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included La Princesse, a large mechanical spider which is 20 metres high and weighs 37 tonnes, and represents the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture.  La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel.
Spearheaded by the multi-billion Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued on an unprecedented scale through to the start of the early 2010s in Liverpool. Some of the most significant regeneration projects to have taken place in the city include the new Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, the Lime Street Gateway, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks and the Edge Lane Gateway. All projects could however soon be eclipsed by the Liverpool Waters scheme which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed use development which will contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from the likes of UNESCO who claim it will have a damaging effect on Liverpool's World Heritage status.

Liverpool was also the site of the UK's first provincial airport, operating from 1930, and was the first UK airport to be renamed after an individual – John Lennon.
Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No.1, often seen as Britain's Imperial anthem, was dedicated by the composer to the Liverpool Orchestral Society and had its premiere in the city in October 1901.

In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal-net, and was a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing. He was also vice-president of the Liverpool Self-Propelled Traffic Association which was a precursor, and later a constituent member, of the Royal Automobile Club.

==Government==

Liverpool has three tiers of government; the Mayor and Local Council, the National Government and the European Parliament. Liverpool is officially governed by a Unitary Authority, as when Merseyside County Council was disbanded civic functions were returned to a district borough level. However several services such as the Police and Fire and Rescue Service, continue to be run at a county-wide level.

===Mayor and local council===

The City of Liverpool is governed by the Directly elected mayor of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council, and is one of five metropolitan boroughs that combine to make up the metropolitan county of Merseyside. The Mayor is elected by the citizens of Liverpool every four years and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the council. The council's 90 elected councillors who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutininsing the Mayor's decisions, setting the Budget, and policy framework of the city. The Mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities.[tpl]cite news | url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/voting-and-elections/Mayoral-elections-2012/The-role-of-mayor | title=The role of mayor | date=May 2012 | accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl] The Mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the Prime minister through his seat at the 'Cabinet of Mayors'. Discussions include pressing decision makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other Directly elected mayors in England and Wales.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2012/apr/27/cabinet-mayors-local-authorities-analysis | title=Cabinet of mayors proves controversial offer to local authorities | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=7 May 2012 | work=The Guardian | first=Rosie | last=Niven | location=London[/tpl] The mayor is Joe Anderson.
The city of Liverpool effectively has two Mayors. As well as the directly elected Mayor, there is the ceremonial 'Lord Mayor' (or civic Mayor) who is elected by the full city council at its annual general meeting in May, and stands for one year in office. The Lord Mayor acts as the 'first citizen' of Liverpool and is responsible for promoting the city, supporting local charities and community groups as well as representing the city at civic events.[tpl]cite news | url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-committees-and-meetings/lord-mayor | title=Role of the Lord Mayor | date=May 2012 | accessdate=7 May 2012[/tpl] The Lord Mayor is Councillor Frank Prendergast.[tpl]cite web|title=The Lord Mayor |url=http://liverpool.gov.uk/council/councillors-committees-and-meetings/lord-mayor/ |accessdate=13 April 2012[/tpl]

In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was revealed to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one star rating (classified as inadequate).

While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th Century was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of prime minister Margaret Thatcher after her 1979 general election victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/07/21/the-real-legacy-of-margaret-thatcher-is-a-nation-divided-100252-21375195/ |title=News – Liverpool Local News – The real legacy of Margaret Thatcher is a nation divided |publisher=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=5 August 2011[/tpl] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3067563.stm | work=BBC News | first=Paul | last=Wilenius | title=Enemies within: Thatcher and the unions | date=5 March 2004[/tpl]

==Geography==

Liverpool has been described as having "the most splendid setting of any English city."The Buildings of England – Lancashire: Liverpool and the Southwest By Richard Pollard, Nikolaus Pevsner, Yale University Press, 2006, p243 At [tpl]Coord|53|24|0|N|2|59|0|W|type:city[/tpl] (53.4, −2.98), [tpl]convert|176|mi|km|0[/tpl] northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain.
The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east.

===Climate===

Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. Historically, Bidston Observatory (actually located on the Wirral Peninsula) has provided the longest and most unbroken weather data for the Merseyside area. More recently, the Met Office has operated a weather station at Crosby.
The absolute minimum temperature recorded at Bidston was [tpl]convert|-12.8|C|F[/tpl]  during January 1881, typically the coldest night of the year should fall to [tpl]convert|-4.0|C|F[/tpl]  (1971–2000 average) However, the variability of the local climate was exposed as the weather station at Crosby fell to [tpl]convert|-17.6|C|F[/tpl] during December 2010.
The absolute maximum temperature recorded at Bidston was [tpl]convert|34.5|C|F[/tpl] in August 1990 – typically the warmest day of the year should reach [tpl]convert|27.5|C|F[/tpl] (1971–2000 average). The absolute maximum at Crosby is [tpl]convert|33.5|C|F[/tpl], recorded in July 2006.

===Religion===

The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[tpl]cite web|url=http://liverpoolstreetgallery.com/thumbnails.php?album=51 |title=Church, Mosque, Synagogue |publisher=Liverpool Street Gallery |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=15 April 2010[/tpl] and two Christian cathedrals.

The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolfus Kyrka (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).
Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals, both dating from the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens' original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd; while this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still manages to incorporate the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street, a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2007/05/10/faith_metro_cathedral_anniv_feature.shtml|title=Cathedral celebrates anniversary[/tpl]The term may have its origins in religious and racial sectarianism, which, while now largely disappeared, was once notoriously virulent in Liverpool.
Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.Sharples, Joseph, Pevsner Architectural guide to Liverpool, Yale University Press, 2004, p249 Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside.

===LGBT community===

Liverpool has a large lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender/transsexual population, as well as the UK's only official 'gay quarter'. Despite cities such as Manchester and Brighton being historically more noted for their LGBT communities, Liverpool now has an LGBT comparable per capita to that of San Francisco.

==Economy==

The Economy of Liverpool is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre of one of the two core economies within the North West of England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolvision.co.uk/invest/economicdata.asp|title=Economic Data|publisher=Liverpool Vision|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl] In 2006, the city's GVA was £7,626 million, providing a per capita figure of £17,489, which was above the North West average.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Images/tcm21-151396.pdf|title=Liverpool Economic Briefing – March 2009|date=March 2009|publisher=Liverpool City Council|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl] After several decades of decline, Liverpool's economy has seen somewhat of a revival since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006.
In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by service sector industries, both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors.

==Landmarks==

Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.Hughes (1999), p10 The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.Hughes (1999), p11 There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[tpl]cite web|title=Grade I listing for synagogue |publisher=BBC |date=3 March 2008 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2008/03/03/faith_synagogue_feature.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2009[/tpl] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[tpl]cite web|title=Listed buildings |publisher=Liverpool City Council|url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Environment/Land_and_premises/Conservation/Listed_buildings/index.asp |accessdate=21 September 2008[/tpl] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster[tpl]cite web|title=Historic Britain: Liverpool |publisher=HistoricBritain.com |url=http://www.historicbritain.com/results.aspx?showmessage=true&location=liverpool&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |accessdate=13 July 2009[/tpl] and more Georgian houses than the city of Bath.[tpl]cite web|title=Merseyside Facts |publisher=The Mersey Partnership |year=2009 |url=http://www.merseyside.org.uk/displaypage.asp?page=40 |accessdate=13 July 2009[/tpl] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[tpl]Cite news|title=Heritage map for changing city |publisher=BBC News |date=19 March 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1881661.stm |accessdate=11 July 2009[/tpl] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[tpl]cite web|title=Liverpool – Maritime Mercantile City|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1150 |accessdate=26 May 2008[/tpl]

===Waterfront and docks===

As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[tpl]Cite book|last=Jones |first=Ron |title=Albert Dock, Liverpool |publisher=R.J. Associates Ltd |year=2004 |page=46 [/tpl] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/cityofculture2008/story/0,,950372,00.html |title=Glory of Greece, grandeur of Rome ... and docks of Liverpool |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=7 March 2003 |author=Helen Carter |accessdate=27 March 2007 | location=London[/tpl] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of areaNicholls, p38 and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/nof/docks/access/theme10.html#sta|title=Trading Places: A History of Liverpool Docks (Stanley Dock)|work=Liverpool Museums|accessdate=12 April 2008[/tpl]
One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool, and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.Liverpool City Counci (2005), p49Moscardini (2008), p10Nicholls (2005), p11Pevsner (cited in Sharples, 2004), p67
In recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the construction of the Echo Arena Liverpool and BT Convention Centre on Kings Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Princes Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks.

===Commercial District and Cultural Quarter===

Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[tpl]Cite book|last=Hughes |first=Quentin |title=Liverpool City of Architecture |publisher=The Bluecoat Press |year=1999[/tpl]
The commercial district is centred around the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's World Heritage site.Liverpool City Council (2005), p73 The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is noted as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.Liverpool City Council (2005), p74Sharples, p48 Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. Amongst the other noted buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,Manchester School of Architecture video YouTube which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[tpl]cite web|title=Oriel Chambers |publisher=Liverpool Architectural Society |url=http://www.liverpoolarchitecture.com/tours/buildings/building.php?id=25 |accessdate=14 July 2009[/tpl]
The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,Manchester School of Architecture video YouTube is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.Liverpool City Council (2005), p87 A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with "S.P.Q.L." (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.Liverpool City Council (2005), p93 The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.People's Palaces: The Golden Age of Civic Architecture BBC Four, Sep 2010, presenter Dr. Jonathan Foyle

===Other notable landmarks===

While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.Hughes (1999), p20 The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interior, which was added in the mid-19th century.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cousens |first=Belinda Cousins |title=Speke Hall |publisher=National Trust |year=2006 |page=5 [/tpl] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.Hughes (1999), p22
The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,Manchester School of Architecture video YouTube which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style,Liverpool City Council (2005), p97Hughes (1999), p23 the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher WrenSharples (2004), p7 and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to larger site in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.

==Transport==

Transport in Liverpool is primarily centred around the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public transport network, which is managed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive, and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides links to locations outside the country.

===National and international travel===

====Road links====

As a major city, Liverpool has direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the M62 motorway connects Liverpool with Hull and along the route provides links to several large cities, including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 motorway and M1 Motorway, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, Sheffield, Preston, London and Nottingham.[tpl]cite web|last= |first= |title=Motorway Database M62 |publisher=cdrd.co.uk |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m62/ |accessdate=7 February 2008[/tpl] To the west of the city, the Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the Wirral Peninsula, providing links to both Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road, which begins in Birkenhead, also provides links to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55 road, North Wales.[tpl]cite web|last= |first= |title=Motorway Database A55 |publisher=cdrd.co.uk |url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a55/ |accessdate=7 February 2008[/tpl] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 road and subsequently across the River Mersey to Runcorn, via the Silver Jubilee Bridge. Plans have been developed in recent years to construct a second bridge, known as the Mersey Gateway, across the river to alleviate congestion on the route today.

====Rail links====

Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see Local Travel below), while the national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across the England. The city's primary mainline station is Lime Street station, which acts as a terminus for several lines into the city. Train services from Lime Street provide connections to numerous destinations, including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, Preston, Leeds, Scarborough, Sheffield, Nottingham and Norwich. In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport.

====Port====

The Port of Liverpool is one of Britain's largest ports, providing passenger ferry services across the Irish Sea to Belfast, Dublin and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. In 2007, a new cruise terminal was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre.

====Airport====

Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 5.3 million passengers[tpl]cite web|title=UK Airport Statistics: 2008 – annual |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=80&pagetype=88&sglid=3&fld=2008Annual |accessdate=15 July 2009[/tpl] and today offers services to 68 destinations,[tpl]cite web|title=Airlines & Tour Operators |publisher=Liverpool John Lennon Airport |url=http://www.liverpoolairport.com/flight-information/airlines-and-tour-operators.html#airlines |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Zürich. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines, notably Ryanair and Easyjet, although it does provide additional charter services in the summer.

===Local travel===

====Buses====

Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (more commonly known as Merseytravel)[tpl]cite web|title=Bus Information |publisher=Merseytravel |url=http://www.merseytravel.gov.uk/information_bus.asp |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square Bus Station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One Bus Station formerly known as Paradise Street Bus Interchange (located near the Albert Dock) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and Merseyside.[tpl]cite web|title=Night Bus Network |publisher=Merseytravel |url=http://www.merseytravel.gov.uk/information_bus_night-bus-network.asp |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl]

====Trains====

Liverpool's local rail network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Kirkby and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.
The network is predominantly electric, with diesel trains running on the City Line. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban commuter networks outside London,
covering [tpl]convert|75|mi|km[/tpl] of track, with an average of 100,000 passenger journeys per weekday.[tpl]cite web|title=Who are Merseyrail |publisher=Merseyrail |url=http://www.merseyrail.org/about/?sGUID=2a45e2d07d59c0d621570a918cb62195 |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Public transport |publisher=Liverpool City Council |url=http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Transport_and_streets/Public_transport/index.asp |accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] Services are operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive. It should be noted that local services on the City Line are operated by Northern Rail rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city centre the majority of the network is underground, with five city centre stations and over [tpl]convert|6.5|mi|km[/tpl] of tunnels.

====Mersey Ferry====

The cross river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and during weekends.[tpl]cite web|title=Complete Timetable |publisher=Mersey Ferries |url=http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/timetable/index.aspx |accessdate=28 July 2009[/tpl] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[tpl]cite web|title=River Explorer Cruises |publisher=Mersey Ferries |url=http://www.merseyferries.co.uk/river-explorer/index.aspx |accessdate=28 July 2009[/tpl]

==Culture==

As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife amongst others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse.

Felicia Hemans (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales.

===Sports stadiums===

Liverpool is home to the Premier League football clubs Everton and Liverpool F.C.
Liverpool have played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 116 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s and only the Main Stand survives from before 1992. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994/1995) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star UEFA Elite Stadium with capacity for 45,000 spectators in comfort, and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multi-million-pound youth training facility called The Academy.
After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England. Molineux (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened Ibrox in 1887, while Celtic Park was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr. Barton prepared the land at 4½d a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost £132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill.thumb|right|Goodison Park, home of Everton F.C
The ground was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match the 12,000 crowd saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for more than 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.
Everton have been considering relocation since 1996, and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial reasons. The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby, but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well as members of the local community. At one point there was much talk for Everton to ground-share with Liverpool, at the proposed new Stanley Park Stadium, but this was not progressed by either club.
