the stand off began when Dr Blessings Chinsinga, an associate political science professor, was interrogated by Peter Mukhito, Malawi’s Inspector General of Police, about a parallel he drew in a lecture between Malawi’s fuel crisis and popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring.http://www.malawidemocrat.com/education/malawi-university-lock-out-is-illegal-%e2%80%93lecturers/ He eventually fired for drawing comparisons between the economic conditions in Egypt and  Malawi in a political science class. This prompted protests from the UNIMA students and faculty that stood in solidarity with Chisanga including Kabwila-Kapasula. It also led to the eventual closure of the universities at Chancellor College and Polytechnic.  As a condition to return to class, the academics asked for an official apology from the police chief, Peter Mukhito and assurances of respect for academic freedom. Mukhito declared that academic freedom had to be balanced with issues of national security. This statement was backed by President Bingu wa Mutharika who urged him not to apologize.http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2011/09/21/police-quiz-poly-academic-dons-over-pressure-group/ Mutharika ordered them to return to work but the lecturers refused since there was no grantee of freedom.Malawi College Teacher Boycott Shows No Sign of Ending The government was unable to provide this under the leadership of The Minister of Education, Peter Mutharika.
