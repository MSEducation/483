[[List of antibiotics]]

CATEGORIES: Antibiotics

The following is a list of antibiotics, sorted by class. The highest division is between bactericidal antibiotics and bacteriostatic antibiotics. Bactericidals kill bacteria directly, whereas bacteriostatics prevent them from dividing. However, these classifications are based on laboratory behavior. In practice, both can prevent a bacterial infection.Pelczar, M.J., Chan, E.C.S. and Krieg, N.R.
