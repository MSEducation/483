==Forced resignation, and dispute over apartment==

Messier was forced to resign from his position with Vivendi in July 2002, after the company posted a non-cash loss of 13.6 billion euro ($US 11.8 billion) during 2001.  During his time as CEO of Vivendi, Messier used corporate funds to buy a $17.5 million apartment for his personal use at 515 Park Avenue at 60th Street in New York City, the swank Arthur Zeckendorf development that was home to Senator Jon Corzine for a time. After he was fired, Messier tried to claim the apartment as part of his severance package, but was rebuffed.Johnson, Jo and Orange, Martine, The Man Who Tried To Buy The World: Jean-Marie Messier and Vivendi Universal, Pg 238 However, he did receive 23.4 million dollars in severance from his former employer, Vivendi.[tpl]cite news|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew|title=Arbitrators Say Vivendi Owes Messier $23.4 Million|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/01/business/arbitrators-say-vivendi-owes-messier-23.4-million.html|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 1, 2003[/tpl] Messier then relocated to New York City to work as a business consultant.
