Limacella illinita, or Overflowing Slimy Stem, is a mushroom in the genus Limacella, in the family Amanitaceae.

==Description==

==Distribution and habitat==

L. illinita is widely distributed in North America and often found in Europe. These can habitat singly, scattered, or in groups in woods, swamps, fields, lawns, roadsides and sand dunes.

==Bioactive compounds==

A study in 2007 discovered four new bioactive compounds from basidiomycetes, isolated from fermentations of L. illinita: Illinitone A that exhibited weak phytotoxic and moderate nematicidal activities against Caenorhabditis elegans, Illinitone B that was moderately cytotoxic, Limacellone that exhibited weak cytotoxic and phytotoxic activities and muurolane sesquiterpene 4a that was found to be inactive in the assays performed there.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gruhn|first=Nina|coauthors=Sylvia Schoettler, Olov Sterner, Timm Anke|title=Biologically active metabolites from the basidiomycete Limacella illinita (Fr.)
