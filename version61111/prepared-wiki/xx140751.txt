[[Chvorinov's rule]]

CATEGORIES: Casting (manufacturing), Metallurgy

Chvorinov's Rule is a mathematical relationship first expressed by Nicolas Chvorinov in 1940,"Theory of the Solidification of Castings", Giesserei, 1940, Vol 27, p 177-186 that relates the solidification time for a simple casting to the volume and surface area of the casting. In simple terms the rule establishes that under otherwise identical conditions, the casting with large surface area and small volume will cool more rapidly than a casting with small surface area and a large volume. The relationship can be written as:Askeland.

It is most useful in determining if a riser will solidify before the casting, because if the riser solidifies first then it is worthless.Degarmo, p. 282.
