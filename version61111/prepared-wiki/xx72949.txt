The Borough of Milton Keynes is a unitary authority and borough in the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire, at the northern tip of the South East England Region, of which it is the northernmost district.
It borders the non-metropolitan counties of Buckinghamshire (the area under the control of Buckinghamshire County Council), Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire. The principal settlement in the borough is Milton Keynes itself, which accounts for about 33% of its area and 90% of its population.

==History==

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of Bletchley Urban District, Newport Pagnell Urban District and Wolverton Urban District, Newport Pagnell Rural District and that part of Wing Rural District within the designated New Town area. The district council applied for and received borough status that year.
It was originally one of five non-metropolitan districts of Buckinghamshire, but on 1 April 1997, under a recommendation of the Local Government Commission for England it became a self-governing unitary authority, independent from Buckinghamshire County Council.

==Local government==

Milton Keynes council is under no overall control and ([tpl]as of|May 2012[/tpl]) is governed by a Conservative minority administration. The Labour Party is currently the main opposition group.
Following the 2012 local government elections and a later defection by the then Conservative councillor Lee Barney to UKIP,http://ukgeneralelection2015.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/defections-to-ukip.html the political composition for the council is as follows.
The election did not change the status of the Council from 'no overall control'.
