The Potros de Tijuana were a Triple A baseball club that played in the Mexican League. The Potros were based in Tijuana, Baja California, and played their home games at Estadio Nacional de Tijuana (Tijuana National Stadium) from 2005 through 2008 before being relocated by the League.

==Early history==

An earlier incarnation of the Potros (or Colts) de Tijuana played in the short-lived Sunset League from 1949–1950, and moved to the Southwest International League from 1951-1952. After three years of absence, they became a member of the Arizona-Mexico League during the 1956 season, before joining the Mexican League from 2005–2008. Another Potros de Tijuana club played in the Mexican Pacific League, taking championship titles in the 1987–1988 and 1990–1901 seasons to advance to the Caribbean Series in both times.ity=Tijuana&state=&country=MX Baseball Reference Minor League City Encyclopedia – Potros/Colts de Tijuana (1949–1952, 1956)

==Mexican League==

The franchise actually was a descendent of the Triple-A Toros de Tijuana before the Mexican League reportedly to have stripped the Toros owner of his franchise and gave it to new owners, who renamed the team as the Potros de Tijuana.
The new Toros ownership kept the same team name, logo, uniforms and history, as a result of the alleged political wrangling that went on in that league.Baseball Posse: Tijuana Toros (2004)
In 2009, the Potros moved to Reynosa, Tamaulipas and were renamed the Broncos de Reynosa.Termina ayuno beisbolero Hitazos.com, 2007GBL South of the Border! GBL website, December 15, 2008
