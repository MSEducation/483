Minute Maid Park (also The Ballpark at Union Station, Enron Field, and Astros Field) is a ballpark in Downtown Houston, Texas, United States that opened in 2000 to house the Houston Astros Major League Baseball team.
The ballpark was Houston's first retractable-roofed stadium, protecting fans and athletes from Houston's notoriously humid weather as did its predecessor, the Astrodome, but also allowing fans to enjoy outdoor baseball during favorable weather. The ballpark also features a grass field, compared to the Astrodome's artificial AstroTurf, which was generally disliked by professional baseball players. The largest entrance to the park is inside what was once Houston's Union Station, and the left-field side of the stadium features a railway as homage to the site's history. The train moves along a track on top of the length of the exterior wall beyond left field whenever an Astros player hits a home run, and/or when the Astros win a game. The engine's tender, traditionally used to carry coal, is filled with giant oranges in tribute to Coca Cola subsidiary Minute Maid's most famous product, orange juice. The ballpark has 5,095 club seats and 63 luxury suites.

==History==

===Union Station and pre-ballpark era===

In 1909, during the time when West End Park was Houston's premier ballpark, the Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company commissioned the design of a new union station for the city from New York City-based architects Warren and Wetmore.  The location called for the demolition of several structures of Houston prominence.  Horace Baldwin Rice's residence and Adath Yeshurun Congregation's synagogue among other structures were removed.[tpl]cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/houstonahistory00writmiss |title=Houston: A History and Guide |authors=Workers of the Writers Program of the Projects Administration in the State of Texas |authorlink=Works Progress Administration |year=1942 |publisher=The Anson Jones Press |page=260 |accessdate=December 18, 2013[/tpl]
With an original estimated cost of $1 million USD, Union Station was constructed by the American Construction Company for an eventual total of five times that amount.[tpl]cite news |title=Grand Station of Terminal Co. |publisher=Magnolia Park News |date=September 19, 1909 |page=1[/tpl]  Exterior walls were constructed of granite, limestone, and terracotta, while the interior used an extensive amount of marble. It was completed and opened on March 1, 1911.  At the time, Houston, with seventeen railways, was considered the main railroad hub of the Southern United States.[tpl]cite book |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Houston:_Where_Seventeen_Railroads_Meet_the_Sea |title=Houston: Where Seventeen Railroads Meet the Sea |last=Farbar |first=Jerome Hammond |year=1913 |publisher=H. H. Tammen Company |accessdate=December 18, 2013[/tpl] This is also evident by the Seal of Houston, which prominently features a locomotive. Two more floors were added the following year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.houstonrrmuseum.org/union/union.htm |title=Houston Union Station: The Great Hall Revealed |author=Marsh, Tom |publisher=Gulf Coast Chapter NRHS |year=1999 |accessdate=December 18, 2013[/tpl]
The station served as the main inter-city passenger terminal for Houston for over seven decades thereafter.  Passenger rail declined greatly after World War II, and the last regularly-scheduled train, the Lone Star, moved its service to Houston's current Amtrak station on July 31, 1974.  With this move, the building effectively became abandoned.  On November 10, 1977, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service.

===Planning and funding===

In August 1995, Astros owner Drayton McLane, then leasing the Astrodome from Harris County, commented to the Houston Chronicle that he was not in the market for a new ballpark. In reference to Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, McLane noted, "... I remember when those were built in the 1970s and those were as good a stadiums as there were. They were the most modern stadiums in the world, and now they're saying they're all bad. That they can't make a go of it without a new stadium. It helps, but there are other things involved."[tpl]cite news |title=Home Improvement |author=Hohlfield, Neil |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=August 27, 1995 |page=17[/tpl]
Later that year, Houston's NFL franchise and joint-tenant of the Astrodome, the Houston Oilers, announced that they were leaving to Nashville, Tennessee in order to have a new stadium built for the team there.  Citing a lack of adequate luxury boxes, in October, Astros Vice-President Bob McClaren claimed that renovations to the Astrodome would help increase revenue.[tpl]cite news |title=City officials pitch idea of ticket drive to keep Astros here |author=Williams, John; Blount, Terry; Mason, Julie |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=October 20, 1995 |page=1[/tpl]  Drayton McLane pointed toward Astrodome renovations as necessary saying "It's 30 years old and not a lot of money has been spent to remodel it."[tpl]cite news |title=McLane gives city two weeks |author=Williams, John; Blount, Terry; Mason, Julie |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=October 26, 1995 |page=1[/tpl] According to the organization, the team was in danger of being sold to a Virginia businessman who was expected to move the Astros to Washington D.C. because of poor revenue.
In June 1996, University of Houston alumnus, BMC Software and San Diego Padres owner, John J. Moores, who wanted to own the next NFL franchise in Houston, met with Texas State Senator Mario Gallegos, Jr., and other local Hispanic leaders in regards to the future of a football-only Astrodome and a new baseball-only ballpark in Downtown Houston.[tpl]cite news |title=Hispanics want downtown stadium, senator says |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=June 4, 1996 |page=20[/tpl] Meanwhile, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels pieced together a plan to build a new ballpark next to the Astrodome in the Astrodomain. The Astros echoed the Astrodomain location sentiment because they believed construction time would be shorter.[tpl]cite news |title=Astros say Eckels lags on stadium/Team warns delay could lead to move |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=June 5, 1996 |page=25[/tpl] Eckels, who convinced then Mayor Bob Lanier of the lack of viability for the ballpark in a downtown location, was quoted as saying, "They keep telling me about these miracles in other cities, but it doesn't work in Houston ... If we are going to put this stadium some place, let's stick with a proven place."[tpl]cite news |title=Downtown at Bat/Not all convinced Dome area best for new baseball stadium |publisher=Houston Chronicle |author=Williams, John |date=June 10, 1996 |page=1[/tpl] This plan was considered to be nearly finalized when the Astros and Harris County agreed to a $250 million USD county-funded stadium whose overrun costs would be funded by the Astros.[tpl]cite news |title=Astros agree to pick up stadium overrun costs |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=August 30, 1996 |page=1[/tpl]
In August 1996, Houston's Union Station received a $2 million USD grant from the Texas Transportation Commission for renovation in a separate project.[tpl]cite news |title=Renovation plans to get Union Station back on tracks |author=Feldstein, Dan |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=August 29, 1996 |page=36[/tpl] Plans for the new ballpark's location drastically changed by September mostly in response to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay's input and pledge to substantially contribute to funding if placed downtown.[tpl]cite news |title=Astros near decision to stay - if downtown |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=September 13, 1996 |page=1[/tpl] It was at this time that the Union Station location was proposed by Lay. Upon an agreement between all of the leadership entities, the idea of a retractable roof stadium was confirmed for the new ballpark.  A November referendum was planned for Harris County residents to approve the deal.
The Harris County referendum that took place on November 5. 1996 to help fund the ballpark passed by a narrow margin of 51% to 49%.[tpl]cite news |title=County stadium referendum passes by narrow margin |author=Williams, John; Ackerman, Todd; Hanson, Eric; Mason, Julie |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=November 6, 1996 |page=1[/tpl] In response to the referendum, during the Seventy-fifth Texas Legislature Texas State Senator John Whitmire of Houston sponsored a bill supported by five of the six area Harris County senators that would create the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority.[tpl]cite news |title=Stadium Bill |author=Hornaday, Sarah |publisher=Galveston Daily News |date=March 6, 1997 |page=9[/tpl]  With companion House Bill 92 authored by Houston-born Representative Kim Brimer voted upon and adopted by both chambers, the authorization for creation of a sports authority was approved.[tpl]cite news |title=Texas Senate Review |publisher=Harper Herald |date=June 3, 1997 |page=5[/tpl] It was signed into law by Governor George W.

In June 1997, with the ability to create a sports authority signed into law, concurrent votes of the Harris County Commissioners' Court and the Houston City Council to establish the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority on effective September 1, 1997.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.houstonsports.org/about/history |title=About HCHSA: History |publisher=Harris County-Houston Sports Authority |accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]  Its chairman and twelve other directors were jointly appointed by the Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge.  The institution remains in existence today.
The ballpark was named "Enron Field" after a $100 million, thirty-year naming rights deal was made with Enron on April 7, 1999.[tpl]cite news |title=New Houston Ballpark Gets Corporate Tag |author=Babineck, Mark |publisher=The Brownsville Herald |date=April 8, 1999 |section=B |page=1[/tpl]

===Design and construction===

Early stadium sketches from Kansas City-based HOK Sport using the working title "The Ballpark at Union Station" were released to the public on October 11, 1996, where Astros President Tal Smith was open about his suggestions for the stadium including the location of the flagpole in center field and a traditional dirt path from the pitcher's mound to home plate.[tpl]cite news |title=Early stadium sketches unveiled/Astros' Smith helping to create unique, asymmetrical design |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=October 12, 1996 |page=29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=The Ballpark at Union Station |publisher=New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung |date=October 13, 1996 |page=16[/tpl]  While the dirt path did not become implemented, the flagpole idea became known as "Tal's Hill", which remains a reality at the ballpark today.
In late 1997, it was announced that local Brown & Root would manage construction of the stadium, while HOK Sport with Walter P. Moore would design it.[tpl]cite news |title=Deal close on stadium project manager |author=Williams, John |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=December 3, 1997 |page=38[/tpl]
Ground broke for The Ballpark at Union Station on October 30, 1997.[tpl]cite news |title=Ground Broken for Astros' New Ballpark |author=Koidin, Michelle |date=October 31, 1997 |publisher=Texas City Sun[/tpl] Its groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, Astros owner Drayton McLane, Harris County Judge Robert Eckles, Harris County Commissioner El Franco Lee, and Harris County-Houston Sports Authority Chairman Jack Rains.

===Opening and current use===

The ballpark was first christened as Enron Field on April 7, 2000, with naming rights sold to the Houston energy and financial trading company in a 30 year, $100 million deal. Astros management faced a public relations nightmare when the energy corporation went bankrupt in 2001.  During its days as Enron Field, it was also dubbed "Ten-Run" or "Home Run" Field due to its cozy left-field dimensions. In keeping with this theme while paying homage to its current sponsor, the nickname "The Juice Box" is colloquially used today.[tpl]cite web |title=Minute Maid Park|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/stadium/index?venue=mlb_18|work=ESPN|accessdate=June 24, 2009[/tpl] The dubbing of the park as an extreme hitter-friendly park has been called into question in recent years. In fact, the 2009 season saw the park ranked 24th out of 30 Major League parks in terms of runs scored in the park, meaning only six other stadiums saw fewer runs scored during the season, and ten other ballparks saw more home runs hit.[tpl]cite web |title=MLB Park Factors - 2010|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor|work=ESPN|accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl] The extremely deep center-field and left-center-field dimensions help to balance out the park significantly, and Minute Maid's Batting park factor is consistently very near average.  However, in 2014, it was ranked the 12th most batter-friendly ballpark by comparing the statistics from 2012-2013 seasons and 2014 (accurate to April 12, 2014).

===Alterations===

In 2004, the Roast launched Wi-Fi throughout the ballpark, allowing fans to use the Internet while attending a game for a fee.[tpl]cite web |title=Minute Maid Park goes Wi-Fi|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/cisco-wi-fi-20040924/|work=Broadcast Engineering|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl] In addition, the ballpark was the first major sports facility to use a separate video board exclusively for closed captioning for the hearing impaired of PA system and video board content, rather than appearing along the bottom of the main board.[tpl]cite web |title=Minute Maid Park|url=http://www.ballparktour.com/Astros.html|publisher=BallparkTour.com|accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl]
The visiting team's bullpen is housed entirely in the exterior left field wall, next to the Crawford Boxes, making it one of the few bullpens in Major League ballparks to be completely indoors. Although windows in the outfield fence offer a view into and from the bullpen, its entrance is actually built into the side of the Crawford Boxes.
In 2006, the Chick-fil-A cows were unveiled on the foul poles, saying EAT MOR FOWL, and the cows have Astros caps on. Anytime an Astros player hits the pole, the fans in attendance get a free chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A. Hunter Pence is the first and second Astro to hit the left field "Fowl Pole" when he did it twice in the 2007 season. Ty Wigginton became the third Astro to hit the left field pole on September 16, 2007. Kazuo Matsui hit the right field foul pole on August 3, 2009 with a 2 run homer in the 6th inning to beat the Giants. Carlos Lee hit the left field pole on July 28, 2010, giving the Astros a 8-1 win against the Cubs. 2 days later, Jeff Keppinger hit the Left Field pole to help the Astros win 5-0 against the Brewers.
After the 2008 season, the Astros' groundskeepers began installing [tpl]convert|2.3|acre|m2[/tpl] of a new turfgrass playing surface at Minute Maid Park.[tpl]cite web |title=Astros First to Use New Turfgrass Surface|first=Nick|last=Zaccardi|url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081208&content_id=3706448&vkey=news_hou&fext=.jsp&c_id=hou|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|date=December 8, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2008[/tpl] The Astros also became one of the first to use the new Chemgrass, later known as AstroTurf after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome in 1966.
For the 2011 season, the park added a large  Daktronics HD screen nicknamed "El Grande" replacing the original one in center field. At 54 feet high and 124 feet wide, it is the third largest scoreboard in Major League Baseball, behind Safeco Field (home of the Seattle Mariners) and Kaufmann Stadium (home of the Kansas City Royals).  The old screen was taken out and replaced by billboards. Additionally, a smaller HD screen was added on the far left field wall. The ring of advertisement screens around the park were replaced in favor of HD ribbon boards.

===Major events===

===Events other than baseball===

While primarily a baseball venue, Minute Maid Park can adequately host sports such as soccer and both codes of rugby.  The venue can also play host to large-scale rock concerts.  It is not large enough to comfortably accommodate American football.
Its debut as a soccer venue happened during the 2006 edition of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The stadium hosted the first leg of the quarterfinal between Portmore United of Jamaica (the "home" team) and Club América of Mexico.[tpl]cite news |title=Club América Finds Its Footing in Win / Mexican Team Produces Goals to Rally Past Portmore United|first=Bernardo|last=Fallas|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/2006_4067440/club-am-rica-finds-its-footing-in-win-mexican-team.html|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=February 23, 2006|accessdate=May 27, 2012[/tpl]
The stadium also is the host of the Houston College Classic college baseball, part of the winter fan festival held in February. The tournament features local schools the University of Houston and Rice University every year, a pair of major conference schools, alternating between Big 12 members University of Texas at Austin, Texas Tech University, Baylor University and SEC member Texas A&M University, as well as two other teams from around the country.
The nationally syndicated TV talk show Rachael Ray held a mass wedding at the park following Hurricane Ike for 40 couples who were unable to get married after a company they paid to hold the weddings went bankrupt.  Comedian Jeffrey Ross served as best man for all 40 couples.  The ceremony was aired as part of a special episode of the talk show on November 21, 2008.[tpl]cite news |title=Rachael Ray Holds Mass Wedding in Houston|first=Jemimah|last=Noonoo|url=http://www.chron.com/news/hurricanes/article/Rachael-Ray-holds-mass-wedding-in-Houston-1752625.php|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=May 27, 2012[/tpl]

==Features==

In dramatic contrast to the Astrodome, the most pitching-oriented stadium in Major League Baseball for most of its existence, Minute Maid Park is known for being particularly hitter-friendly down the lines, especially in left field where it is only 315 ft (96 m) to the Crawford Boxes, though the wall there is 19 feet (5.8 m) tall. In a challenge to home run hitters, former Astros owner Drayton McLane's office window, located in the old Union Station and directly above the Crawford Boxes, is made of glass and a sign below the window is marked 422 ft (135 m) from home plate.
In contrast to the ease of hitting a home run to the Crawford Boxes, it is quite difficult to hit a ball out in center field, as the dead-center wall is 436 ft (133 m) from home plate, deepest center field of any park in baseball.[ref]Bleacher Report - Ranking MLB's Most Hitter-Friendly Ballparks, by the Numbers - 12: Minute Maid Park
[/ref] Fielding is a challenge there as well, due to the [tpl]convert|90|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide center field incline known as Tal's Hill, for former team president Tal Smith, an element taken from Crosley Field and other historic ballparks (in a bit of gallows humor, the hill is also known as the "Grassy Knoll"), and the flagpole in play, an element taken from Yankee Stadium before its remodeling in the mid-'70s and Tiger Stadium among others. Milwaukee Brewers player Richie Sexson once hit a ball off the flagpole.  There was a mark there until the 2011 season, when the pole was repainted.
While Crosley Field's infamous left field terrace, which was half as steep (only 15 degrees) as Tal's Hill (30 degrees), was a natural feature of the site on which the park was located, Tal's Hill is purely decorative. Both structures have been held in equal disdain by the respective outfielders who have had to patrol those areas. This hill has caused some of the most replayed catches in recent baseball history, and plenty of controversy as well. Lance Berkman said, "If the ball rolls onto the hill, it's not steep enough to roll back, so you have to go get it. Then there's the chance of running into the flagpole that's on it and getting hurt.” Fans started an online petition to remove the hill and flagpole, though the petition has since been discontinued.
The ballpark features 19,201 seats on the lower level,[tpl]cite web |title=Minute Maid Park Facts and Figures|url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=facts_figures|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl] 7,132 seats on the second level, 880 seats on the suite level, and 13,750 seats on the upper level.
A concourse above Tal's Hill features the "Phillips 66 Home Run Porch" in left-center field that is actually over the field of play, and features a classic gasoline pump that displays the total number of Astros home runs hit since the park opened.
The electrification of Minute Maid Park's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.[tpl]cite web |title=Stadium Systems|url=http://www.vahleinc.com/stadium-systems.html|publisher=VAHLE, Inc.|accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl]
The stadium can also be fully air-conditioned when required.

==Transportation access==

Minute Maid Park is located in Downtown Houston in a centralized area of the city, and accessible via a short driving distance on Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway/East Freeway), Interstate 69 (Southwest Freeway/Eastex Freeway), and Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway/North Freeway).  Street parking, garage parking, and private lot parking are available, with an estimated 25,000 spots within walking distance to the ballpark. Taxi cabs and pedicabs are also commonly found near the surrounding ballpark area.
Public transportation allows for accessibility via bus or light rail service.  Using METRORail North Line with service at Preston Station, the ballpark is six blocks away.  A light rail station within one block from Minute Maid Park known as "Convention District Station" is currently under construction as an expansion of METRORail, and will service the planned East End Line and Southeast Line upon their implementations.
