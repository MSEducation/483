CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

Adummim - the red ones, a place apparently on the road between Jerusalem and Jericho in the West Bank. It is mentioned the Bible book of Joshua ([tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|15:7|HE[/tpl] and [tpl]Bibleverse||Joshua|18:17|HE[/tpl]) as being "on the south side of the stream" (Wadi Kelt), looking toward Gilgal. It was nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of Tal'at ed-Dumm.
The Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adummim is in the area.

==In Christianity==

It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan ([tpl]Bibleverse||Luke|10:25-37|NIV[/tpl]). The area and The Inn of the Good Samaritan are accessible via Israel Highway 1.
