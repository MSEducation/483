The Acoma Curio Shop is a former souvenir shop located on historic U.S. Route 66 in San Fidel, New Mexico. The store was built in 1916 by Abdoo Fidel, a Lebanese immigrant, and was originally a general store. In 1937, Fidel began to sell Native American curios to tourists passing through San Fidel on Route 66. Fidel's shop only sold curios crafted at the Acoma Pueblo, separating him from most souvenir shops at the time, which generally sold replica souvenirs or curios made by multiple tribes.[tpl]cite news|title=New Mexico curio shop listed in National Register|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ictarchives/2009/11/10/new-mexico-curio-shop-listed-in-national-register-82830|accessdate=August 11, 2013|newspaper=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=November 10, 2009[/tpl] In 1941, Fidel closed the curio shop and began selling general goods again. The building now houses an art gallery called Gallery 66.[tpl]cite news|last=Boyett|first=Roseanne|title=Acoma Curio Shop|url=http://www.cibolabeacon.com/community/acoma-curio-shop/article_004f7a3f-13e0-5de2-8b87-df004239dee5.html|accessdate=August 11, 2013|newspaper=Cibola Beacon|date=October 29, 2009[/tpl]
