The arXiv (pronounced "archive", as if the "X" were the Greek letter Chi, χ) is a repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online.  In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million article milestone on October 3, 2008.[tpl]cite arXiv |last=Ginsparg |first=Paul |eprint=1108.2700 |title=It was twenty years ago today .. |class= cs.DL|year=2011 |version=  [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.library.cornell.edu/content/online-scientific-repository-hits-milestone |title=Online Scientific Repository Hits Milestone – With 500,000 Articles, arXiv Established as Vital Library Resource |publisher=News.library.cornell.edu |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl] By 2012 the submission rate had grown to more than 7000 per month.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arxiv.org/show_monthly_submissions |title=arXiv monthly submission rate statistics |publisher=Arxiv.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl]

==History==

The arXiv was originally developed by Paul Ginsparg, in part to supersede a multinational email
distribution list for preprints that had been operated manually by Joanne Cohn for about two years. It started in August 1991 as a repository for preprints in physics and later expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, nonlinear science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics.Paul Ginsparg "The global-village pioneers" Physics World October 1, 2008 It soon became obvious that there was a demand for long-term preservation of preprints. The term e-print was adopted to describe the articles. Ginsparg was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.
It was originally hosted at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and called the LANL preprint archive.  Its original domain name was xxx.lanl.gov.  It is now hosted and operated by Cornell University,[ref]
