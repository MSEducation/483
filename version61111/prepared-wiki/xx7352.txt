Manitoba [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-Manitoba.ogg|ˌ|m|æ|n|ɨ|ˈ|t|oʊ|b|ə[/tpl] is a Canadian prairie province. The province, with an area of [tpl]convert|649950|km2|-2[/tpl], has a largely continental climate, with thousands of lakes and many rivers. Agriculture, mostly concentrated in the fertile southern and western parts of the province, is vital to the province's economy; other major industries are transportation, manufacturing, mining, forestry, energy, and tourism. 
Manitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is Canada's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area, and home to 60 percent of the population of the province. Winnipeg is the seat of government, home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the highest court in the jurisdiction, the Manitoba Court of Appeal. Four of the province's five universities, both of its professional sports teams, and most of its cultural activities are located in Winnipeg.
Fur traders first arrived during the late 17th century and Manitoba was the heart of Rupert's Land, owned by the Hudson's Bay Company. Manitoba became a province of Canada in 1870 after the Red River Rebellion. A general strike took place in Winnipeg in 1919, and the province was hit hard by the Great Depression. This led to the creation of what would become the New Democratic Party of Manitoba, one of the province's major political parties and currently in power, led by premier Greg Selinger.

==Etymology==

The name Manitoba is believed to be derived from the Cree, Ojibwe or Assiniboine languages. The name derives from Cree manitou-wapow or Ojibwa manidoobaa, both meaning "straits of Manitou, the Great Spirit", a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of Lake Manitoba. It may also be from the Assiniboine for "Lake of the Prairie".[tpl]vcite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|title=Manitoba|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080604204017/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|archivedate=4 June 2008[/tpl]
The lake was known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies. Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake. Louis Riel also chose the name, and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/louis_riel/pdf/origin_mb_name.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Province of Manitoba|title=The Origin of the Name Manitoba[/tpl]

==Geography==

Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut and Northwest Territories to the north, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast, and is the only prairie province with a salt water coastline. The Churchill port is the only arctic deep-water port in Canada and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia. Lake Winnipeg is the tenth largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the second largest bay in the world. Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed, once known as Rupert's Land. It was a vital area of the Hudson's Bay Company, with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for trade.

===Hydrography and terrain===

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and contains over 110,000 lakes,[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/phys01-eng.htm |title=Land and Freshwater area, by province and territory |accessdate=7 August 2007 |publisher=Statistics Canada[/tpl] covering approximately 15.6 percent or [tpl]convert|101593|km2|sqmi[/tpl] of its surface area.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.travelmanitoba.com/default.asp?page=130&node=585|title=Geography of Manitoba|publisher=Travel Manitoba|accessdate=10 February 2010[/tpl] Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www.lakewinnipeg.org/web/content.shtml?pfl=public/downloads.param&page=000103&op9.rf1=000103 |title=Lake Winnipeg Facts |publisher=Lake Winnipeg Stewardship Board |accessdate=7 August 2007[/tpl] Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Schwartz, Bryan; Cheung, Perry|year=2007|title=East vs. West: Evaluating Manitoba Hydro's Options for a Hydro-Transmission Line from an International Law Perspective|journal=Asper Review of International Business and Trade Law|publisher=University of Manitoba|volume=7|issue=4|page=4[/tpl]
Manitoba is located at the center of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin has rivers reaching far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill Rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south lies in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; there are hilly and rocky areas throughout the province left behind by receding glaciers.[tpl]vcite book|author=Savage, Candace|title=Prairie: A Natural History|publisher=Greystone Books|year=2011|pages=52–53|isbn=978-1-55365-588-6|edition=2[/tpl]

Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Butler, George E|year=1950|title=The Lakes and Lake Fisheries of Manitoba|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|publisher=American Fisheries Society|volume=79|page=24[/tpl]
Extensive agriculture is found only in the southern areas of the province, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/agrc35h-eng.htm |title=Summary Table of Wheats and Grains by Province |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=7 August 2007[/tpl] Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is located in Manitoba.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/agrc25h-eng.htm |title=Total farm area, land tenure and land in crops, by province (Census of Agriculture, 1986 to 2006) (Manitoba)|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl]

===Climate===

Manitoba has an extreme continental climate; temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north, and precipitation decreases from east to west.[tpl]vcite book|author=Ritchie, JC|title=Post-Glacial Vegetation of Canada|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|page=25|isbn=978-0-521-54409-2[/tpl] Manitoba is far removed from the moderating influences of both mountain ranges and large bodies of water, and because of the generally flat landscape, it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February. In the summer, air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States, as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico.[tpl]vcite book|author=Vickers, Glenn; Buzza, Sandra; Schmidt, Dave; Mullock, John|title=The Weather of the Canadian Prairies|publisher=Navigation Canada|date=2001|url=http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/1-P32E.PDF|accessdate=2010-02-11|pages=48, 51, 53–64[/tpl] Temperatures exceed [tpl]convert|30|C[/tpl] numerous times each summer, and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid-40s.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/generate_chart_e.html?timeframe=3&Prov=XX&StationID=28051&Year=2006&Month=1&Day=1&Type=line&MeasTypeID=meanmaxtemp|title=Mean Max Temp History at The Forks, Manitoba |work=Climate Data Online |publisher=Environment Canada |accessdate=7 August 2007[/tpl] Carman, Manitoba holds the record for the highest humidex in Canada, with 53.0.[tpl]vcite web|title=Canada's Top Ten Weather Stories for 2007|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/EnviroZine/default.asp?lang=En&n=70BF6FA1-1|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 November 2010[/tpl] According to Environment Canada, Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round, and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/manitoba-e.html|title=Manitoba Weather Honours|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl] 
Southern Manitoba (including the city of Winnipeg), falls into the humid continental climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy in the winter and frequently experiences blizzards because of the openness of the landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length, and this region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and frequently experiences blizzards because of the openness of the landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/midlatitude_steppe.html|title=Midlatitude Steppe Climate |work=The Physical Environment |author=Ritter, Michael E |accessdate=7 August 2007 |year=2006[/tpl]
Southern parts of the province, located just north of Tornado Alley, experience tornadoes each year, with 15 confirmed touchdowns in 2006. In 2007, on 22 and 23 June, numerous tornadoes touched down, the largest of which was an F5 Tornado that devastated parts of Elie (the strongest officially recorded tornado in Canada).[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=714D9AAE-1&news=4B3DE57E-4967-4B09-98D6-EF974B32D6B5|title=Elie Tornado Upgraded to Highest Level on Damage Scale Canada's First Official F5 Tornado |date=18 September 2007|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl]
The northern sections of the province (including the city of Thompson) fall in the subarctic climate zone (Köppen climate classification Dfc). This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief, warm summers with little precipitation. Overnight temperatures as low as [tpl]convert|-40|C[/tpl] occur on several days each winter.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/subarctic.html |title=Subarctic Climate |work=The Physical Environment |author=Ritter, Michael E |accessdate=7 August 2007 |year=2006[/tpl]

===Flora and fauna===

The eastern, southeastern, and northern reaches of the province range through boreal coniferous forests, muskeg, Canadian Shield and a small section of tundra bordering Hudson Bay. Forests make up about [tpl]convert|263000|km2|sqmi[/tpl], or 48 percent, of the province's land area.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090226181706/http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/forestry/forest-education/general.html |title=Manitoba Forest Facts |publisher=Manitoba Conservation |accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl] The forests consist of pines (mostly Jack Pine, some red pine), spruces (white, black), larch, poplars (Trembling Aspen, balsam poplar), birch (white, swamp) and small pockets of eastern white cedar. The tallgrass prairie dominates the southern and particularly the southeastern parts of the province around the Red River Valley, and is notable for its endangered western prairie fringed orchid,[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct1/searchdetail_e.cfm?id=200&StartRow=1&boxStatus=All&boxTaxonomic=All&location=All&change=All&board=All&commonName=orchid&scienceName=&returnFlag=0&Page=1|title=Fringed-orchid, Western Prairie|publisher=Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada|accessdate=7 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]IUCN2008 |assessors= Goedeke, T; Sharma, J; Delphey, P; Marshall Mattson, K |year= 2008 |id= 132834 |title= Platanthera praeclara |downloaded= 9 February 2010[/tpl] whereas the rest of the south and southwest is predominantly mixed grass prairie.
Manitoba is home to a diverse species of animals. The province is especially noted for its polar bear population; Churchill is commonly referred to as the "Polar Bear Capital".[tpl]vcite book|author=Stirling, Ian; Guravich, Dan |title=Polar Bears|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1998|page=208|isbn=978-0-472-08108-0[/tpl] Other large animals, such as moose, deer, cougars, lynx, and wolves, are common throughout the province, especially in the provincial and national parks.

==History==

===First Nations and European settlement===

The geographical area of modern-day Manitoba was inhabited by the First Nations people shortly after the last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest approximately 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the Turtle Mountain area.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Ritchie, James AM; Brown, Frank; Brien, David|year=2008|title=The Cultural Transmission of the Spirit of Turtle Mountain: A Centre for Peace and Trade for 10,000 Years|journal=General Assembly and International Scientific Symposium|publisher=International Council on Monuments and Sites|volume=16|pages=4–6[/tpl] The Ojibwe, Cree, Dene, Sioux, Mandan, and Assiniboine peoples founded settlements, and other tribes entered the area to trade. In Northern Manitoba, quartz was mined to make arrowheads. The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River, where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Flynn, Catherine; Syms, E Leigh|date=Spring 1996|title=Manitoba's First Farmers|journal=Manitoba History|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|issue=31[/tpl] 
In 1611, Henry Hudson was one of the first Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay, where he was abandoned by his crew.[tpl]vcite book|author=Neatby, LH|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2000|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=1|pages=374–379|chapter=Henry Hudson|edition=online|url=http://biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=343[/tpl] The first European to reach present-day central and southern Manitoba was Sir Thomas Button, who travelled upstream along the Nelson River to Lake Winnipeg in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson.[tpl]vcite book|author=Eames, Aled|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2000|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=1|pages=144–145|chapter=Sir Thomas Button|edition=online|url=http://biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=98[/tpl] The Nonsuch, a British ship, sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, becoming the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson's Bay Company, which was given absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed by the British government. This watershed was named Rupert's Land, after Prince Rupert, who helped to subsidize the Hudson's Bay Company.[tpl]vcite book|author=Simmons, Deidre|title=Keepers of the Record: The History of the Hudson's Bay Company Archives|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2009|pages=19–23, 83–85, 115|isbn=978-0-7735-3620-3[/tpl] York Factory was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Nelson (built in 1682), was destroyed by rival French traders.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Stewart, Lillian|date=Spring 1988|title=York Factory National Historic Site|journal=Manitoba History|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|issue=15[/tpl]
Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, visited the Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open the area for French exploration and trade.[tpl]vcite book|author=Zoltvany, Yves F|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Lava|year=2000|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=3|pages=246–254|chapter=Pierre Gaultier De Varennes et De La Vérendrye|edition=online|url=http://biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=1366[/tpl] As French explorers entered the area, a Montreal-based company, the North West Company, began trading with the Métis. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve the history of this era).
Great Britain secured the territory in 1763 as a result of their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, better known as the French and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, resulted in conflict between British colonists and the Métis.[tpl]vcite book|author=Gray, John Morgan|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2000|editor=Cook, Ramsay|volume=5|pages=264–269|chapter=Thomas Douglas|edition=online|url=http://biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2377[/tpl] Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Martin, Joseph E|year=1965|title=The 150th Anniversary of Seven Oaks|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=22[/tpl] Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the Republic of Manitobah in 1867, that he and his council named.

===Confederation===

Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories; a lack of attention to Métis concerns caused Métis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government as part of the Red River Rebellion. In response, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the Manitoba Act in the Canadian House of Commons, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870.[tpl]vcite book|author=Sprague, DN|title=Canada and the Métis, 1869–1885|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, ON|year=1988|pages=33–67, 89–129|isbn=978-0-88920-964-0[/tpl] Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile.[tpl]vcite book|author=Cooke, OA|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|editor=Cook, Ramsay|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|year=2000|edition=online|volume=14|chapter=Garnet Joseph Wolseley|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=7780&&PHPSESSID=rr7c8co68cf4v1cfjr1ufabvb2[/tpl] The Métis were blocked by the Canadian government in their attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba's entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of Métis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Numbered Treaties were signed in the late 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These treaties made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.[tpl]vcite book|author=Tough, Frank|title=As Their Natural Resources Fail: Native People and the Economic History of Northern Manitoba, 1870–1930|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|pages=75–79|isbn=978-0-7748-0571-1[/tpl] The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led to efforts by aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/stem/mrd/mines/sustain/first.html|title=First Nations Land Claims|publisher=Government of Manitoba|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091030030837/http://www.gov.mb.ca/stem/mrd/mines/sustain/first.html |archivedate=30 October 2009[/tpl]
The original province of Manitoba was a square one-eighteenth of its current size, and was known colloquially as the "postage stamp province".[tpl]vcite journal|author=Kemp, Douglas|date=April 1956|title=From Postage Stamp to Keystone|journal=Manitoba Pageant|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society[/tpl] Its borders were expanded in 1881, but Ontario claimed a large portion of the land; the disputed portion was awarded to Ontario in 1889. Manitoba grew progressively, absorbing land from the Northwest Territories until it attained its current size by reaching 60°N in 1912.
The Manitoba Schools Question showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Fletcher, Robert|year=1949|title=The Language Problem in Manitoba's Schools|journal=MHS Transactions|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=3|issue=6[/tpl] The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.[tpl]vcite journal|author=McLauchlin, Kenneth|year=1986|title='Riding The Protestant Horse': The Manitoba Schools Question and Canadian Politics, 1890–1896|journal=Historical Studies|publisher=CCHA|volume=53|pages=39–52[/tpl]
The federal Conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.

===Modern era===

By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s.[tpl]vcite book|author=Hayes, Derek|title=Historical Atlas of Canada|publisher=D&M Adult|year=2006|page=227|isbn=978-1-55365-077-5[/tpl] A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP10CH3PA5LE.html|title=Winnipeg Boomtown|publisher=CBC|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl] The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War.[tpl]vcite news|title=The heart of the continent?|author=Silicz, Michael|date=10 September 2008|work=The Manitoba|publisher=University of Manitoba[/tpl] Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.[tpl]vcite book|author=Morton, William L|title=Manitoba, a History|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1957|pages=345–359[/tpl]
After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia.[tpl]vcite book|author=Conway, John Frederick|title=The West: The History of a Region in Confederation |publisher=Lorimer|year=2005|edition=3|pages=63–64, 85–100|isbn=978-1-55028-905-3[/tpl] The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.[tpl]vcite book|author=Bercuson, David J|title=Confrontation at Winnipeg: Labour, Industrial Relations, and the General Strike|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1990|pages=173–176|isbn=978-0-7735-0794-4[/tpl]
Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal Northwest Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were aliens who were deported under the Canadian Immigration Act.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Lederman, Peter R|year=1976|title=Sedition in Winnipeg: An Examination of the Trials for Seditious Conspiracy Arising from the General Strike of 1919|journal=Queen's Law Journal|publisher=Queen's University|volume=3|issue=2|pages=5, 14–17[/tpl]
The Great Depression (1929–c.1939) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production.[tpl]vcite book|author=Easterbrook, William Thomas; Aitken, Hugh GJ|title=Canadian economic history|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|year=1988|pages=493–494|isbn=978-0-8020-6696-1[/tpl] The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.[tpl]vcite book|author=Wiseman, Nelson|title=Social democracy in Manitoba|publisher=University of Manitoba|year=1983|page=13|isbn=978-0-88755-118-5[/tpl]
Canada entered the Second World War in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan to train fighter pilots, and there were air training schools throughout Manitoba. Several Manitoba-based regiments were deployed overseas, including Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. In an effort to raise money for the war effort, the Victory Loan campaign organized "If Day" in 1942. The event featured a simulated Nazi invasion and occupation of Manitoba, and eventually raised over C$65 million.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Newman, Michael|date=Spring 1987|title=February 19, 1942: If Day|journal=Manitoba History|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|issue=13[/tpl]
Winnipeg was inundated during the 1950 Red River Flood and had to be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier Duff Roblin to advocate for the construction of the Red River Floodway; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation. Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area. In 1997, the "Flood of the Century" caused over [tpl]Nowrap|C$400 million[/tpl] in damages in Manitoba, but the floodway prevented Winnipeg from flooding.[tpl]vcite journal|author=Haque, C Emdad|date=May 2000|title=Risk Assessment, Emergency Preparedness and Response to Hazards: The Case of the 1997 Red River Valley Flood, Canada|journal=Natural Hazards|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|volume=21|issue=2|pages=226–237|issn=0921-030X[/tpl]
In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attempted to pass the Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982.

==Demography==

At the 2011 census, Manitoba had a population of 1,208,268, more than half of which is in the Winnipeg Capital Region; Winnipeg is Canada's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area, with a population of 730,018 (2011 Census). Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last century has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population located in a single city.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=4611040&Geo2=PR&Code2=46&Data=Count&SearchText=Winnipeg&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=4611040|title=2006 Community Profiles Manitoba & Winnipeg|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=11 April 2011[/tpl]

Manitoba's economy relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the southern half of the province, although grain farming occurs as far north as The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).
Manitoba is the nation's largest producer of sunflower seed and dry beans,[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/afs/agric_economics/Century/ACenturyofAgriculture.PDF|title=A Century of Agriculture|publisher=University of Manitoba|accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl] and one of the leading sources of potatoes.

===Economic history===

Manitoba's early economy depended on mobility and living off the land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After the arrival of the first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs.[tpl]vcite book|author=Friesen, Gerald|title=The Canadian prairies: a history|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1987|pages=22–47, 66, 183–184|isbn=978-0-8020-6648-0[/tpl] Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811,[tpl]vcite journal|author=Morton, William L|date=April 1962|title=Lord Selkirk Settlers|journal=Manitoba Pageant|publisher=Manitoba Historical Society|volume=7|issue=3[/tpl] though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.
HBC control of Rupert's Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a province in 1870, all land became the property of the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers for farming. Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade. Manitoba's economy depended mainly on farming, which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification.

==Military bases==

CFB Winnipeg is a Canadian Forces Base at the Winnipeg International Airport. The base is home to flight operations support divisions and several training schools, as well as the 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/v2/page-eng.asp?id=24 |title=Organization Overview |publisher=Department of National Defence|accessdate=16 January 2010[/tpl] 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces is based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/17w-17e/page-eng.asp?id=182 |title=17 Wing—General Information |publisher=Department of National Defence|accessdate=22 February 2010[/tpl] It supports 113 units from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel north to the high Arctic. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.
The two 17 Wing squadrons based in the city are: the 402 ("City of Winnipeg" Squadron), which flies the Canadian designed and produced de Havilland Canada CT-142 Dash 8 navigation trainer in support of the 1 Canadian Forces Flight Training School's Air Combat Systems Officer and Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator training programs (which trains all Canadian Air Combat Systems Officer);[tpl]vcite book|author=Pigott, Peter|title=Taming the skies|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd|year=2003|page=203|isbn=978-1-55002-469-2[/tpl] and the 435 ("Chinthe" Transport and Rescue Squadron), which flies the Lockheed C-130 Hercules tanker/transport in airlift search and rescue roles, and is the only Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct air-to-air refueling of fighter aircraft.
Canadian Forces Base Shilo (CFB Shilo) is an Operations and Training base of the Canadian Forces located [tpl]convert|35|km[/tpl] east of Brandon. During the 1990s, Canadian Forces Base Shilo was designated as an Area Support Unit, acting as a local base of operations for Southwest Manitoba in times of military and civil emergency.[tpl]vcite web |url=http://www.army.gc.ca/iaol/143000440000579/index-Eng.html|title=CFB ASU Shilo |publisher=Department of National Defence|accessdate=2 April 2012[/tpl] CFB Shilo is the home of the 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, both battalions of the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, and the Royal Canadian Artillery. The Second Battalion of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), which was originally stationed in Winnipeg (first at Fort Osborne, then in Kapyong Barracks), has operated out of CFB Shilo since 2004. CFB Shilo hosts a training unit, 3rd Canadian Division Training Centre. It serves as a base for support units of 3rd Canadian Division, also including 3 CDSG Signals Squadron, Shared Services Unit (West), 11 CF Health Services Centre, 1 Dental Unit, 1 Military Police Regiment, and an Integrated Personnel Support Centre. The base currently houses 1,700 soldiers.

==Government and politics==

After the control of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba attained full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province carved out of the Northwest Territories.[tpl]vcite book|author=Dupont, Jerry|title=The Common Law Abroad: Constitutional and Legal Legacy of the British Empire|publisher=Fred B Rothman & Co|year=2000|pages=139–142|isbn=978-0-8377-3125-4[/tpl] The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives).[tpl]vcite journal|author=Adams, Chris|date=17 September 2006|title= Manitoba's Political Party Systems: An Historical Overview|journal=Annual Meeting of the Canadian Political Science Association|publisher=York University|pages=2–23[/tpl] The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.
Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly.[tpl]vcite book|author=Summers, Harrison Boyd|title=Unicameral Legislatures|publisher=Wilson|year=1936|volume=11|page=9|oclc=1036784[/tpl] The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on advice of the Prime Minister.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.lg.gov.mb.ca/role/resp.html|title=Roles and Responsibilities|publisher=Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba|accessdate=29 October 2009[/tpl] The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the Lieutenant Governor has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.

===Official languages===

English and French are the official languages of the legislature and courts of Manitoba, according to §23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (part of the Constitution of Canada). In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish the official status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).[tpl]vcite book|author=Hebert, Raymond M|title=Manitoba's French-Language Crisis: A Cautionary Tale|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2005|pages=xiv–xvi, 11–12, 30, 67–69|isbn=978-0-7735-2790-4[/tpl]
Although French is an official language for the purposes of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be an official language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions).In 1992 1 S.C.R. 221–222 Umontreal.ca, the Supreme Court rejected the contentions of the Société Franco-manitobaine that §23 extends to executive functions of the executive branch. Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/fls-slf/pdf/fls_policy.pdf|title=Manitoba Francophone Affairs Secretariat|publisher=Government of Manitoba|accessdate=29 October 2009[/tpl] According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.[tpl]vcite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/demo15-eng.htm|title=Population by knowledge of official language, by province and territory (2006 Census) |date=11 December 2007|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=8 March 2010[/tpl]
