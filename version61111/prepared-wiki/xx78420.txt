[[Baron Darcy de Knayth]]

CATEGORIES: Baronies in the Peerage of England, 1332 establishments

Baron Darcy de Knayth is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1332 for John Darcy. At the death of the sixth baron, the barony fell into abeyance, which the Sovereign terminated in 1641 in favour of Conyers Darcy. The next baron, also named Conyers, was granted the title of Earl of Holderness. The two titles remained united until the death of the fourth earl, when the earldom went to a male heir, while the barony went to a female heir, Amelia. Amelia married the fifth Duke of Leeds, and the sixth and seventh Dukes held the barony. At the death of the latter, the titles separated, the barony going to Sackville Lane-Fox, upon whose death the title became abeyant again. About 15 years later, the abeyance was terminated.
