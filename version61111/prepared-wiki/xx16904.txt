==History and description==

The Song of the Year award has been awarded since 1959.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both the Record of the Year award and Song of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes only to the composer(s) of the song whereas the Record of the Year award goes to the performer and production team of the song. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award is given to the songwriter(s) of a song that "must contain melody and lyrics and must be either a new song or a song first achieving prominence during the eligibility year. Songs containing prominent samples or interpolations are not eligible".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/announcement/category-mapper|title=Category Mapper|accessdate=November 25, 2011|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences[/tpl]
Since the late 1960s other songwriter's award has been presented for genre-specific categories including Grammy Award for Best Country Song, Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, Grammy Award for Best R&B Song  and most recently in Grammy Award for Best Rap Song (since 2004), Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song (since 2006), Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Song (since 2012) and Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song (since 2014).
