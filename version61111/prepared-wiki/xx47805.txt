Viacom Inc. (short for Video & Audio Communications) is an American global mass media company with interests primarily in, but not limited to, cinema and cable television. As of 2010, it was the world's fourth-largest media conglomerate, behind The Walt Disney Company, Time Warner and News Corporation (now 21st Century Fox).  Voting control of Viacom is held by National Amusements, Inc., a privately owned theater company controlled in turn by billionaire Sumner Redstone.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2009/industries/145/index.html |title=Global 500 2009: Industry |publisher=CNN  |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/investorrelations/Investor_Relations_Docs/Q407%20Web%20Deck%20FINAL.pdf |title=2007 Results  |format=PDF |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=Siklos |first=Richard |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/09/news/companies/disney_dreamworks.fortune |title=Why Disney wants DreamWorks |publisher=CNN  |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscorp.com/Report2007/AnnualReport2007/HTML2/news_corp_ar2007_0069.htm |title=News Corporation – Annual Report 2007 publisher=Newscorp.com |date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2011[/tpl] Redstone also holds, via National Amusements, a controlling stake in CBS Corporation.
The current Viacom was created on December 31, 2005, as a spinoff from CBS Corporation, which changed its name from Viacom to CBS at the same time. CBS, not Viacom, retains control of the over-the-air broadcasting, TV production, outdoor advertising, subscription pay television (Showtime) and publishing assets (Simon & Schuster) previously owned by the pre-split company.  Predecessor firms of Viacom include Gulf+Western, which later became Paramount Communications Inc., and Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
Comprising BET Networks, MTV Networks, and Paramount Pictures, Viacom operates approximately 170 networks reaching approximately 700 million  subscribers in 160 countries.Press release: "VIACOM REPORTS EARNINGS GROWTH FOR FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR FISCAL 2012" Viacom

==History==

===Early years===

In March 2005, the prior Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies because of not only a stagnating stock price but also the rivalry between Leslie Moonves and Tom Freston, longtime heads of MTV Networks. In addition, the company was facing issues after MTV was banned from producing any more Super Bowl halftime shows after the Super Bowl Halftime Show controversy of 2004.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
After the departure of Mel Karmazin in 2004, Sumner Redstone, who served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, decided to split the offices of President and Chief Operating Officer between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split was seen as a creative solution to the matter of replacing him. It was also intended to provide alternative investments that would be more appealing to different investors: one a high cash flow, lower growth company that could afford to pay a substantial dividend and the other a growing company that would have greater investment opportunities and therefore would not be expected to pay a dividend.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
A new company, the present Viacom, was created and was headed by Freston. It comprises BET Networks, MTV Networks, and Paramount Pictures Corporation.

===2000s===

====2005====

In June, Viacom announced its purchase of Neopets, a virtual pet website, along with GameTrailers, GoCityKids, and IFILM. That December, Paramount announced it would acquire DreamWorks. All indications were that the whole of DreamWorks—both live-comedy film and TV studios, albeit not the DreamWorks archive (which was sold to a group led by George Soros in March 2006) nor the animated unit (which was not part of the deal)—would remain owned by Viacom, even though CBS acquired Paramount's own TV studio.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

====2006====

On February 1, Paramount completed its long-awaited acquisition of DreamWorks. On April 24, Viacom obtained Xfire. In August, just hours before announcing its most recent quarterly earnings, Viacom announced that it had acquired Atom Entertainment for $200 million. In September, Viacom acquired game developer Harmonix for $175 million.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

On December 19, Viacom signed a five year, $500 million contract with Microsoft that included content sharing and advertisement. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Also, Microsoft purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks. Finally, Microsoft will also collaborate on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Copyright complaints against YouTube==

In February 2007, Viacom sent upwards of 100,000 DMCA takedown notices to the video-sharing site YouTube. Of the 100,000 notices, approximately 60–70 non-infringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement.Media Companies Blast YouTube for Anti-Piracy Policy. Foxnews.com (February 19, 2007). Retrieved July 13, 2011.
On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a US$1 billion legal claim (Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.) against Google and YouTube alleging massive copyright infringement, alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to YouTube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for Viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for YouTube.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/ViacomYouTubeComplaint3-12-07.pdf |title=United States District Court for the Southern District of New York – Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.| work=Wall Street Journal[/tpl] The complaint contended that almost 160,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom's programming were made available on YouTube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than 1.5 billion times.
In July 2008, the case generated controversy when District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site.[tpl]Cite news | title = Google Must Divulge YouTube Log | date = July 3, 2008 |publisher=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7488009.stm[/tpl] Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request for YouTube to hand over the source code of its search engine system, saying that the code was a trade secret.[tpl]Cite news|title=Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube |last=Helft |first=Miguel |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html |date=July 4, 2008 |postscript= [/tpl]

On June 23, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in Google's favor in a motion for summary judgment, holding that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.[tpl]Cite news| title = US judge tosses out Viacom copyright suit against YouTube |author=Lefkow, Chris|agency=AFP  | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_AfErLSMMGD417l8aR0CYib0aNQ|accessdate=June 24, 2010 | date=June 23, 2010[/tpl]
On April 5, 2012, the ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[tpl]cite court |litigants=Viacom International Inc. v.

Cabranes concluded that "a reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website". Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups, by making them "more hair-trigger on taking down news or content, for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers".[tpl]cite news |title=Viacom wins reversal in landmark YouTube case |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/05/net-us-google-viacom-idUSBRE8340RY20120405 |newspaper=Reuters|date=5 April 2012 |author=Jonathan Stempel |author2=Yinka Adegoke |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 17, 2013[/tpl]
