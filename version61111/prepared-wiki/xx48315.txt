==History==

LFCA was created on 1 September 1991, taking command of what was previously Central Militia Area and the Regular Force Army units and formations in Ontario from the northern Lakehead region to the border with Quebec.  At that point in time, the six subordinate militia districts were reorganized into four: Northern Ontario District, London District, Toronto District, and Ottawa District.[tpl]Cite web|title=Domestic Military Organization 1900-1999|publisher=Canadian Soldiers.com|date=22 February 2013|url=http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/organization/districts.htm[/tpl]  Later that decade, in 1997, the four reserve force districts were again reorganized into three brigade groups.
At the time of its creation in the early-1990s, it was housed on the grounds of the former base and subsequently moved ca 1993 to the Place Nouveau office tower at Yonge Street north of Finch Avenue; this was controversial as the offices of the area commander, Major-General Brian Vernon, were lavishly renovated, attracting political criticism and attention from the Auditor General of Canada.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In 2013, LFCA was renamed 4th Canadian Division. With this change of name, the formation was also granted the identifying patch and historical lineage of the division that fought in the two world wars.
