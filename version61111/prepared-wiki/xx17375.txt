==Early roles==

After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model, appearing in many fashion magazines. By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with Carol Kirkwood, who later became a BBC weather forecaster. In 1995, Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its series The Word, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, a fictional television reporter (who developed into the Kazakh Borat Sagdiyev), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted Pump TV from 1995–1996.  In 1996, he began presenting the youth chat programme F2F for Granada Talk TV. He took clown training in Paris, at the Ecole Philippe Gaulier, studying under master-clown Philippe Gaulier. Of his former pupil, Gaulier says: "He was a good clown, full of spirit".Cavendish, Dominic (12 March 2001). "From the sublime to the ridicule". The Daily Telegraph  In the late 1990s, Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedy The Jolly Boys' Last Stand. In 2000, Baron Cohen played the part of Super Greg for a series of TV advertisements for Lee Jeans; the advertisements never aired but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.[tpl]Cite news| authorlink=Kerry Lauerman|last=Lauerman|first=Kerry | title=It's Borat Day! | work=Salon | date=3 November 2006 | work=Video Dog | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/11/03/supergreg/index.html | accessdate=12 August 2009 [/tpl]

==Characters==

===Ali G===

Baron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporter Brüno on the Paramount Comedy Channel during 1998. He shot to fame when his comic character Ali G, an uneducated, boorish junglist, hailing from Staines (a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), started appearing on the British television show The 11 O'Clock Show on Channel 4, which first went to air 8 September 1998. A year after the première of the show, GQ named him comedian of the year.Robert A. Saunders (2009) The Many Faces of Sacha Baron Cohen: Politics, Parody, and the Battle Over Borat Rowman & Littlefield, p.41. Retrieved 27 February 2012 He won Best Newcomer at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and was nominated for Best British Entertainment Performance at the British Academy Television Awards.
Da Ali G Show began in 2000, and won the BAFTA for Best Comedy  in the following year.The 2001 Bafta award winners BBC. Retrieved 27 February 2012 Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver in Madonna's 2000 video "Music", directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who was also responsible for directing the titles for Da Ali G Show.
In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature film Ali G Indahouse, in which he is elected to the British Parliament and foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his home town, Staines.Films - reviews: Ali G Indahouse (2002) BBC. Retrieved 27 February 2012 His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, for HBO.
At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, thirteen years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from Sir Ben Kingsley in the guise of Ali G, and stated: "I is grown up now. I ain't living in my nan's house anymore. I is living in her garage".
Ali G's interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an insignificant crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.[tpl]cite news|last =Strauss|first =Neil| coauthors=| title =The man behind the mustache| pages=|work=Rolling Stone |date =14 November 2006|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks| accessdate =14 August 2008[/tpl]
The resulting willingness of Baron Cohen's targets to answer his frequently risqué questions often created surprising conversations. Interviewees have included:

===Borat Sagdiyev===

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, a feature film with Borat at the centre, was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film is about a journey across the United States in an ice cream truck, in which the main character is obsessed with the idea of marrying Pamela Anderson. The film is a mockumentary which includes interviews with various American citizens that poke fun at American culture, as well as sexism, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and jingoism.
It debuted at the #1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4 million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre, the fourth highest per-theatre average of all time for movies opening wide (500 screens or more), behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Spider-Man 3.
Baron Cohen won the 2007 Golden Globe in the "Best Actor – Musical or Comedy" category, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for "Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy", the film lost to Dreamgirls. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines, Peter Baynham, Sy Mordecai Finesto, Dan Mazer, and Todd Phillips.
Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish lineage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.Borat: Throw The Jew Down The Well
In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A. and Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[tpl]cite book|title=Borat: touristic guidings to glorious nation of Kazakhstan : touristic guidings to minor nation of U.

===Brüno Gehard===

Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is 'Brüno', a flamboyantly gay, Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno asks the subjects to answer "yes or no" questions with either "Vassup" (what's up) or "Ich don't think so" (No); these are occasionally substituted with "Ach, ja!" (Ah yes!) or "Nicht, nicht" ("Nicht" means "not" in German). In one segment on Da Ali G Show, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either "Keep them in the ghetto" or "Train to Auschwitz".
Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. In May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white jockstrap, white go-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto Eminem. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch, with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers D12. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/31053788 |title=Eminem-Bruno Stunt on MTV Was Planned |publisher=MSNBC |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl] After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as DreamWorks, Sony, and 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures won and paid a reported $42.5 million for the film rights.[tpl]cite news |work=Forbes | url=http://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/11/13/borat-cohen-money-tech-media-cz_lg_1114borat.html | title=Borat is Rich...NOT | date= 13 November 2006 | accessdate=21 November 2006[/tpl] A number of shill companies and websites were created in order to draw potential interviewees into interviews by creating an illusion of legitimacy.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0319092bruno1.html | title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Guerilla Tactics | date=19 March 2009 | accessdate=20 March 2009[/tpl] The film was released in July 2009.

===Admiral General Aladeen===

Baron Cohen's 2012 film, The Dictator, was described by its press as "the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12240086 |publisher=BBC News  | title=Sacha Baron Cohen to make film of 'Saddam Hussein book[tpl]'-[/tpl] | date=20 January 2011[/tpl] Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=31198 |title=First Official Shot From The Dictator |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.republicofwadiya.com/ |title=The Dictator Trailer & Official Movie Site |publisher=Paramount Pictures |accessdate=6 January 2012[/tpl] Borat and Bruno film director Larry Charles directed the film.[tpl]cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/11/sacha-baron-cohen-the-dictator-goat-larry-charles.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=A 'Borat' reunion on Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Dictator'? | date=15 November 2010[/tpl] The main target of the film's satire was Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was still alive when the film was written.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/05/21/153204627/sacha-baron-cohen-the-fresh-air-interview|title=Sacha Baron Cohen: The Fresh Air Interview|publisher=NPR|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl] The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
On 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen was allegedly banned from attending the 84th Academy Awards in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying "we haven't banned him. We're just waiting to hear what he's going to do" but made it clear that "Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt".[tpl]cite journal|title = Academy: Sacha Baron Cohen Not 'Banned' From Oscars But 'Dictator' Stunt Unwelcome | date=22 February 2012| first=Matthew | last=Belloni | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-sacha-baron-cohen-not-banned-the-dictator-293929 | work=The Hollywood Reporter[/tpl] Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of uniformed female bodyguards, holding an urn which he claimed was filled with the ashes of Kim Jong-il. The "ashes", which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of The Howard Stern Show were flour, were "accidentally" spilled onto Ryan Seacrest.

==Controversies and criticism==

In an interview with former British MP Neil Hamilton in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly cannabis, which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/607608.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Hamilton 'shared joint' with Ali G | date=18 January 2000 | accessdate=10 April 2010[/tpl]
At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat introduced Gnarls Barkley's performance of "Crazy", where he made a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he could see it clearly through her denim pants.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
At the 2006 UK premiere of Borat, he arrived in Leicester Square in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of "Kazakh women", announcing: "Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes.

Baron Cohen has been criticized for the racist or prejudiced comments his characters have made (see Da Ali G Show). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters, "Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way All in the Family did years ago."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732 |title=Did Ali G Go Too Far?|first=Liel|last=Leibovitz|work=The Jewish Week|location=New York|date=26 August 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040826111026/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732|archivedate=26 August 2004[/tpl] Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a "dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry", rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html |title=[tpl]-'[/tpl]Borat' satire turns to farce at Toronto festival |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl] "Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice", Baron Cohen explains. Addressing the same topic in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen says "...and I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3613548|first=Robert|last=Siegel|title=Ali G: Fooling Serious Interviewees, All for a Laugh|publisher=NPR |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl]
Baron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that genocide. "When I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic." Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, "In My Country There Is Problem" (also known as "Throw the Jew Down the Well"), he says, "Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism."
Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made out of velcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs."Sacha Baron Cohen Kicked Out of Milan Fashion Week"[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl]

==Other work==

Baron Cohen guest-starred in the  fifth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, with Dustin Hoffman as a guide to Heaven. He also provided the voice of the ring-tailed lemur king, King Julien, in DreamWorks Animation's film series, Madagascar, and appeared as Will Ferrell's arch rival the French Formula One speed demon Jean Girard in the 2006 hit Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.

Baron Cohen tends to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on Late Show with David Letterman, The Opie and Anthony Show, The Howard Stern Show,http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&d=1093158000 The Howard Stern Show and others in order to promote the upcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's All Things Considered. He also did an interview with Rolling Stone, published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as "his only interview as himself". He also appeared in an interview out of character with Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air on 4 January 2007.Meet the Real Sacha Baron Cohen. Fresh Air. 4 January 2007 (advance to 21:10 in the interview).
Baron Cohen has twice presented the MTV Europe Music Awards, first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in Frankfurt, Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the British Comedy Awards in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as "he's guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran",[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6177591.stm |title=Merchant takes top comedy honour |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2010[/tpl] referring to the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust.

The government of Kazakhstan threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Lisbon, and the authority in charge of the country's country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously:  for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. The New York Times, (among others), has reported that Baron Cohen, (in character as Borat), replied: "I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew"."British comic responds to legal threat against 'Borat[tpl]'"[/tpl], CBC, 25 November 2005. He was, however, defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stated, "We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything...""Daughter of Kazakhstan's president defends Borat", CBC, 21 April 2006.

After the worldwide success of the Borat film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press coverage the controversy created for their country.Saunders, Robert A.

Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three University of South Carolina students who appear in Borat sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |title=Borat Frat Boys Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge Who Secretly Knows Sacha Baron Cohen's Golden Globes Speech By Heart |publisher=Defamer.com |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl]
