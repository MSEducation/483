Three Sheets is an international travelogue/pub-crawl television series which airs on Spike in the United States. The first three seasons of the show originally aired on MOJO HD before moving to FLN for the fourth season. Repeats of the show briefly aired on The Travel Channel before being picked up by Spike. The title is taken from the popular expression, "three sheets to the wind," referring to one who is staggering drunk.
Comedian Zane Lamprey hosts a humorous trip around the world sampling the local well-known (and little-known) food and drink while also engaging in local alcohol-related customs.http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/04/zane.lamprey/index.html  In each episode Lamprey samples various food and drinks and learns about the customs and libations of that area, and then experiences the local hangover cure. The series is produced by Screaming Flea Productions.http://www.sfpseattle.com/work/three.asp

==Format==

Each episode begins with an overview of the places Zane will visit on his trip. Typically over the course of the episode Zane will introduce different local alcoholic beverages and spend some time with either a bartender or alcohol-maker to learn more about the drinks discussed. Often when a new term or item is introduced a note will appear on the screen to provide further information or help with pronunciation.
A number of recurring segments and gags surface in almost every episode.  A voice-over feature starring "The Professor" will occasionally appear to introduce an in-depth history or description of something culturally significant, a locale, or the science behind a particular drink. Zane also often refers to his drinking buddy, a stuffed monkey named Pleepleus, who appears at random points in the show.

=="Save Three Sheets"==

With the ending of the MOJO HD network on December 1, 2008, the future of Three Sheets was unclear.DPUC.state.us At the time, the third season had finished airing and the fourth season had been put into production with a majority of the shows completed; however, there was no network for the unaired fourth season shows. On December 9, 2008, Zane himself went to his fans to enlist their help in finding a new home for Three Sheets. He scheduled two rallies "to help save their favorite show from extinction".http://www.zanelamprey.com/projects/three_sheets/save_three_sheets_release.php

=="Sheet It Forward" Movement==

A small movement started in December 2009 with the philosophy to make the world a better place one drink at a time. The essential rule for members of the movement is to purchase a drink for someone they don't know if he or she is seen wearing anything related to the show "Three Sheets". It is a way to share the love for the show, and spread good will between people who have never previously met.Facebook "Sheet it Forward" Movement
