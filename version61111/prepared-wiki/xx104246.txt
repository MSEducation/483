Tikal is a German-style board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling and published in 1999 by Ravensburger in German and by Rio Grande Games in English.  The theme of the game is that of adventurers exploring parts of a Central American jungle in which artifacts and temples are discovered.
The gameplay is turn-based, with the victor decided by victory points, which can be achieved by either finding artifacts or excavating, and then controlling, temples.
Tikal won the Spiel des Jahres and the Deutscher Spiele Preis in 1999, and the Games Magazine Best Multiplayer Strategy Game in 2000.  It was the first game in the Mask Trilogy, followed by Java and Mexica.
