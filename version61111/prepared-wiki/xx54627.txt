[[Nilpotent]]

CATEGORIES: Ring theory, Zero

In mathematics, an element x of a ring R is called nilpotent if there exists some positive integer n such that xn = 0.
The term was introduced by Benjamin PeircePolcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 127. in the context of elements of an algebra that vanish when raised to a power.

==Examples==

==Properties==

No nilpotent element can be a unit (except in the trivial ring {0} which has only a single element 0 = 1). All non-zero nilpotent elements are zero divisors.
An n-by-n matrix A with entries from a field is nilpotent if and only if its characteristic polynomial is tn.
If x is nilpotent, then 1 − x is a unit, because xn = 0 entails
More generally, the sum of a unit element and a nilpotent element is a unit when they commute.

==Commutative rings==

A characteristic similar to that of Jacobson radical and annihilation of simple modules is available for nilradical: nilpotent elements of ring R are precisely those that annihilate all integral domains internal to the ring R (that is, of the form R/I for prime ideals I).  This follows from the fact that nilradical is the intersection of all prime ideals.

==Nilpotency in physics==

An operand Q that satisfies Q2 = 0 is nilpotent. Grassmann numbers which allow a path integral representation for Fermionic fields are nilpotents since their squares vanish. The BRST charge is an important example in physics.
As linear operators form an associative algebra and thus a ring, this is a special case of the initial definition.Peirce, B. Linear Associative Algebra. 1870.Milies, César Polcino; Sehgal, Sudarshan K. An introduction to group rings. Algebras and applications, Volume 1. Springer, 2002. ISBN 978-1-4020-0238-0 More generally, in view of the above definitions, an operator Q is nilpotent if there is n∈N such that Qn = 0 (the zero function). Thus, a linear map is nilpotent iff it has a nilpotent matrix in some basis. Another example for this is the exterior derivative (again with n = 2). Both are linked, also through supersymmetry and Morse theory,A. Rogers, The topological particle and Morse theory,  Class. Quantum Grav. 17:3703–3714,2000 [tpl]doi|10.1088/0264-9381/17/18/309[/tpl]. as shown by Edward Witten in a celebrated article.E Witten, Supersymmetry and Morse theory. J.Diff.Geom.17:661–692,1982.
The electromagnetic field of a plane wave without sources is nilpotent when it is expressed in terms of the algebra of physical space.Rowlands, P. Zero to Infinity: The Foundations of Physics, London, World Scientific 2007, ISBN 978-981-270-914-1

==Algebraic nilpotents==

The two-dimensional dual numbers contain a nilpotent space. Other algebras and numbers that contain nilpotent spaces include split-quaternions (coquaternions), split-octonions,
