CATEGORIES: Diketopiperazines

A diketopiperazine (DKP), also known as a dioxopiperazine or piperazinedione, is a class of organic molecules in which the two nitrogen atoms of a piperazine 6-membered ring are part of amide linkages. There are three regioisomers possible, differing in the locations of the two carbonyl groups around the ring. While these isomers share a piperazine core, optimal strategies for their synthesis differ.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Diketopiperazines.| author = Dinsmore JC, Beshore DC. | journal = Tetrahedron | year = 2002 | volume = 58 | issue = 17 | pages = 3297–3312| doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(02)00239-9[/tpl]  The 2,3-diketopiperazines may be viewed as the oxamide obtained from ethylenediamine.  2,5-diketopiperazines are cyclodipeptides obtained via condensation of two α-amino acids.  2,6-diketopiperazines may be viewed as cyclised imide derivatives  derived from Iminodiacetic acids.
DPKs can be visualized as α-amino amides where the nitrogen atoms are constrained into a six membered ring:
