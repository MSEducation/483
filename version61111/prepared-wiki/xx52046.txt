The Boat Race is an annual rowing race between the Oxford University Boat Club and the Cambridge University Boat Club, rowed between competing eights on the River Thames in London, United Kingdom. It is also known as the University Boat Race and the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, or by a title that includes the name of its current sponsor (from 2013, the BNY Mellon Boat Race). It usually takes place on the last weekend of March or the first weekend of April.
The first race was in 1829 and the event has been held annually since 1856, except during the First and Second World Wars. The course covers a 4.2-mile (6.8 km) stretch of the Thames in West London, from Putney to Mortlake. Members of both teams are traditionally known as blues and each boat as a "Blue Boat", with Cambridge in light blue and Oxford dark blue. As of 2014 Cambridge have won the race 81 times and Oxford 78 times, with one dead heat.
The race is a well-established and popular fixture in the British sporting calendar. Upwards of 250,000 people watch the race live from the banks of the river each year (in 2009, a record 270,000 people watched the race live[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | title = Record crowd for Easter Boat Race[/tpl]) while a further 15 million or more watch it on television."University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide".

==History==

===Origin===

The tradition was started in 1829 by Charles Merivale, a student at St John's College, Cambridge, and his Old Harrovian school friend Charles Wordsworth who was studying at Christ Church, Oxford. Cambridge challenged Oxford to a race at Henley-on-Thames but lost easily. As the Oxford stroke, Staniforth, and four of his crew were from Christ Church, then Head of the River, the decision was – eventually – taken to race in the Dark Blue of that college, which still persists. There is a dispute as to the source of the colour chosen by Cambridge. The second race was in 1836, with the venue moved to a course from Westminster to Putney. Over the next two years, there was disagreement over where the race should be held, with Oxford preferring Henley and Cambridge preferring London. Cambridge therefore raced Leander Club in 1837 and 1838. Following the official formation of the Oxford University Boat Club in 1839, racing between the two universities resumed on the Tideway and the tradition continues to the present day, with the loser challenging the winner to a rematch annually.
The race is governed by a Joint Understanding between Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Clubs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/128/response/452/attach/html/3/Spooner%20JU%2012%20Sep%2006.doc.html |title=Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Clubs |publisher=Whatdotheyknow.com |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]

===1877 dead heat===

The race in 1877 was declared a dead heat. Legend in Oxford has it that the judge, "Honest John" Phelps, was asleep under a bush when the race finished, leading him to announce the result as a "dead heat to Oxford by four feet". This is not borne out, however, by contemporary reports.

===Stanley Muttlebury===

Cambridge produced one of the legends of the Boat Race and of rowing worldwide, Stanley Muttlebury ("Muttle"), whose crew won the race in the first four of the five years he was a member, 1886–1890. Contemporaries writing to The Times to add to his 1933 obituary called attention to his extraordinary physical prowess and natural aptitude for rowing, traits accompanied by mildness, good manners, and natural kindness. R.P.P. Rowe wrote:R.P.P. Rowe, "Mr. S. D. Muttlebury" (Obituary), The Times, 6 May 1933, p. 14.

===1959 Oxford mutiny===

Oxford in Autumn 1958 had a large and talented squad. It included eleven returning Blues plus Yale oarsmen Reed Rubin and Charlie Grimes, a gold medallist at the 1956 Olympics. Ronnie Howard was elected OUBC President by the College Captains, beating Rubin. In 1958, Howard had rowed in the Isis crew coached by H.R.A. "Jumbo" Edwards, which had frequently beaten the Blue Boat in training.
Howard's first act was to appoint Edwards as coach. Edwards was a coach with a strong record, but he also imposed strict standards of obedience, behaviour and dress on the triallists which many of them found childish. As an example, Grimes withdrew from the squad after Edwards insisted he remove his "locomotive driver's hat" in training.
With selection for the crew highly competitive, the squad split along the lines of the presidential election. A group of dissidents called a press conference, announcing that they wanted to form a separate crew, led by Rubin and with a different coach. They then wished to race off with Howard's crew to decide who would face Cambridge.
Faced with this challenge, Ronnie Howard returned to the College Captains and asked for a vote of confidence in his selected crew and the decision not to race off with the Rubin crew. He won the vote decisively and the Cambridge president also declared that his crew would race only the Howard eight.
Three of the dissidents returned and Oxford went on to win by six lengths.

===1987 Oxford mutiny===

In 1987, another disagreement arose amongst the Oxford team.(Account of the 'mutiny')  A number of top class American oarsmen refused to row when a fellow American was dropped in favour of the Scottish President, Donald Macdonald. They became embroiled in a conflict with Macdonald and with coach Dan Topolski over his training and selection methods. This eventually led most of the Americans to protest at what they perceived to be the president's abuse of power, by withdrawing six weeks before the race date.
To the surprise of many, Oxford, with a crew partially composed of oarsmen from the reserve crew, won the race. Oxford adopted Topolski's tactic, communicated to the cox while the crews were on the start, to take shelter from the rough water in the middle of the river at the start of the race, ignoring conventional wisdom that centre stream is fastest even if rowing conditions are poor.
A further surprise was that the captains of the Oxford college boat clubs, who had voted in support of Macdonald and Topolski and precipitated the Americans' withdrawal during the mutiny, voted one of those Americans, Chris Penny, as OUBC president for 1988, a break with the tradition that the president is a returning Blue (the other candidate being Tom Cadoux-Hudson, who was a British member of the 1987 winning crew).
Topolski wrote a book entitled True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny on the incident.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/rowing/2310461/When-mutineers-hit-the-Thames.html|title=When mutineers hit the Thames|last=Baker|first=Andrew|date=6 April 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=26 November 2012[/tpl] A movie based on the book, True Blue, was released in 1996. Topolski's account was seen by some as one-sided, and Ali Gill, who had been a member of the university women's Boat Club at the time of the mutiny, wrote a book The Yanks at Oxford to present the other side of the story.
Reports of the "mutiny" still differ greatly depending on the source, and with the historians having been personally involved in the events or in the small community in which they occurred, a definitive, unbiased version has never been agreed upon. Captain Donald Macdonald and the Americans long refused to contribute to any debate on the event, including a 2007 BBC radio programme to mark its 20th anniversary. However in 2012, after 25 years, Macdonald gave his own account of the dispute in a newspaper interview.[tpl]cite news|title=True Blue Mutiny: Oxford University boat race captain reveals all about the savage feud with both Americans that tore team apart 25 years ago|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2125897/Boat-Race-2012-Oxford-University-captain-reveals-True-Blue-mutiny.html|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=7 April 2012|author=Harry Mount[/tpl]

===Sinkings===

In the 1912 race, run in extremely poor weather and high winds, both crews sank. Oxford rowed into a significant early lead, but began taking on water, and made for the bank shortly after passing Hammersmith Bridge to empty the boat out: although they attempted to restart, the race was abandoned at this point because Cambridge had also sunk, while passing the Harrods Depository.Boat Race - WHERE THE SMOOTH WATERS GLIDE In the Book of Heroic Failures it is further reported, colorfully but perhaps not entirely reliably, that Oxford's attempted restart was briefly delayed as a crewman exchanged words with a friend called Boswell in the crowd: and that as the abandonment was announced, some of the Cambridge crew came swimming past the Oxford position, minus their boat. The race was re-rowed two days later, again in poor weather, and Oxford won by six lengths.
Cambridge also sank in 1859 and 1978, while Oxford did so in 1925,Rowing back the years, BBC Sport website, 31 March 2003[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ox.ac.uk/aboutoxford/boatrace.shtml | title = The Boat Race [/tpl][tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/history/ | title = How it began | work = The Race History [/tpl] and again in 1951; the 1951 race was re-rowed on the following Monday.The 10 worst mishaps in the history of sport, Observer website, 5 November 2000 In 1984 the Cambridge boat sank after colliding with a barge before the start of the race, which was then rescheduled for the next day.1984: Boat race halted before starting, BBC On This Day website.

Cambridge's first sinking on colour TV in 1978 featured 79th on Channel 4's programme 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

===Notable races since 2000===

Recent years have seen especially dramatic races. In 2001 the race was halted by umpire Rupert Obholzer just over a minute after the start, following repeated warnings to both crews to move apart, and then a clash of blades. The blade of Cambridge bowman Colin Swainson dislodged from his hand and in consequence the umpire immediately stopped the race. Despite Oxford having a lead when the race was stopped, the boats were restarted level with each other; this decision was highly contentious, especially when Cambridge went on to win after the restart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theboatrace.org/controversies-the-race-is-stopped/ |title=Controversies: The race is stopped |publisher=Boat Race |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]
In 2002 the favoured Cambridge crew led with only a few hundred metres to go, when a Cambridge oarsman (Sebastian Mayer, who was later part of the winning 2004 Cambridge crew) collapsed from exhaustion and Oxford rowed through to win by three-quarters of a length. They did so on the outside of the last river bend, a feat last accomplished in 1952.
In the 2003 race Cambridge were substantially heavier and appeared to be the favourites. Two days prior to the race, however, the Cambridge crew suffered a collision on the river in which oarsman Wayne Pommen was injured. With a replacement (Ben Smith) in Pommen's seat, Cambridge went on to lose by the narrowest margin ever: just one foot (30 cm). In that year, there were two pairs of brothers rowing: Matt Smith and David Livingston for Oxford, and Ben Smith and James Livingston for Cambridge. All four had been pupils together at Hampton School in south-west London. Cambridge gained revenge in 2004 in a race marred by dramatic clashes of oars in the early stages, and the unseating of Oxford's bowman.
The 2006 race was won by Oxford. Cambridge had started as strong favourites but, despite rough rain[tpl]clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl], made a tactical decision not to use a pump to remove excess water from the boat. Oxford did use a pump and overtook Cambridge to win. Cambridge had introduced pumps as early as 1987 (the year of the Oxford mutiny, and a day of rough conditions).
In 2007 Cambridge were again strong favourites based on the team members' individual successes, and 9 lb (4 kg) heavier per man on average. The Cambridge crew had five returning blues compared to Oxford's one. Furthermore, the international achievements of Cambridge's rowers far exceeded those of Oxford's: the World Champion stern pair of Germans Thorsten Engelmann – the heaviest ever boat race oarsman at [tpl]convert|110.8|kg|lb[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theboatrace.org/article/newsandmedia/latestnews/2007engelmannheavy/ |title=Engelmann becomes heaviest rower in Boat Race history |date=3 April 2007 |work=The Boat Race |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003148/http://www.theboatrace.org/article/newsandmedia/latestnews/2007engelmannheavy/ |archivedate=28 September 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl] – and Sebastian Schulte; Olympic Gold medallist Kieran West MBE and GB medal winner Tom James. Although Oxford rowed strongly at the beginning, the light blues showed their class by holding Oxford while they had the advantage, and pushing on with tidier rowing from Chiswick steps. Despite their weight and technical superiority, Cambridge won by only a length and a quarter in a time of 17 minutes and 49 seconds.

===2012 disruption===

In 2012, after almost three-quarters of the course had been rowed, the race was halted for over 30 minutes when a lone protester, Australian Trenton Oldfield, entered the water from Chiswick Eyot and deliberately swam between the boats near Chiswick Pier with the intention of protesting against spending cuts, and what he saw as the erosion of civil liberties and a growing culture of elitism within British society.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/no-regrets-says-trenton-oldfield-man-who-ruined-the-boat-race--but-dont-worry-he-wont-be-back-8554617.html|title=No regrets, says Trenton Oldfield, man who ruined the boat race – but don’t worry, he won’t be back|publisher=The Independent|author=Tom Peck|date=29 March 2013[/tpl] Once spotted by assistant umpire Sir Matthew Pinsent, both boats were required to stop for safety reasons.
The umpire, John Garrett, decided to restart the race from the eastern end of Chiswick Eyot. Shortly after the restart the boats clashed and the oar of Oxford crewman Hanno Wienhausen was broken. Garrett judged the clash to be Oxford's fault and allowed the race to continue. Cambridge quickly took the lead and went on to win the race. The Oxford crew entered a final appeal to the umpire which was quickly rejected; and Cambridge were confirmed as winners by 4 1/4 lengths. It was the first time since 1849 that a crew had won the boat race without an official recorded winning time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://theboatrace.org/results |title=Results |accessdate=13 April 2012 |publisher=The Boat Race official website[/tpl] After the end of the race Oxford's bow man, Alex Woods – a medical student at Pembroke College[tpl]cite web|url=http://theboatrace.org/crew-profile/2012/4430 |title=Rower profile – Dr. Alexander Woods |publisher=Boat Race |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] – received emergency treatment after collapsing in the boat from exhaustion. Because of the circumstances, the post-race celebrations by the winning Cambridge crew were unusually muted and the planned award ceremony was cancelled.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rowing/17645929 |title=Boat Race: Man charged over incident, bowman collapses at finish |publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/shock-and-oar-as-australian-protest-swimmer-wrecks-oxbridge-boat-race-20120408-1wiyt.html |title=Shock and oar as Australian protest swimmer wrecks Oxbridge boat race |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=10 April 2012 |date=8 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Andy Bull at Mortlake |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/07/alex-woods-oxford-boat-race?newsfeed=true |title=Oxford bow Alex Woods recovering in hospital after Boat Race collapse |work=The Observer  |accessdate=10 April 2012 |date=7 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21975466|title=Race: Royal Marines to help with security|publisher=BBC News|date=9 March 2013[/tpl]

There was drama again in the 2014 race when the Cambridge number two was temporarily unseated following a clash of oars near the start of the race, and Oxford won comfortably.

==Course==

The course is 4 miles and 374 yards (6.779 km) from Putney to Mortlake,[tpl] cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/statistics | title = Statistics | publisher = Boat Race Company Ltd | accessdate = 2013-04-18 [/tpl] passing Hammersmith and Barnes; it is sometimes referred to as the Championship Course, and follows an S shape, east to west. The start and finish are marked by the University Boat Race Stones on the south bank. The clubs' presidents toss a coin (the 1829 sovereign) before the race for the right to choose which side of the river (station) they will row on: their decision is based on the day's weather conditions and how the various bends in the course might favour their crew's pace. The north station ('Middlesex') has the advantage of the first and last bends, and the south ('Surrey') station the longer middle bend.
During the race the coxes compete for the fastest current, which lies at the deepest part of the river, frequently leading to clashes of blades and warnings from the umpire. A crew that gets a lead of more than a boat's length can cut in front of their opponent, making it extremely difficult for the trailing crew to gain the lead. For this reason the tactics of the race are generally to go fast early on, and few races have a change of the lead after halfway (though this happened in 2003, 2007 and 2010).
The race is rowed upstream, but is timed to start on the incoming flood tide so that the crews are rowing with the fastest possible current.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061128162341/http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ |archivedate=28 November 2006 |title=The Boat Race |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]  If a strong wind is blowing from the west it will be against the tide in places along the course, causing the water to become very rough. The conditions are sometimes such that an international regatta would be cancelled, but the Boat Race has a tradition of proceeding even in potential sinking conditions (see Sinkings above).
During the race the crews pass various traditional landmarks, visible from the river:
At the conclusion of the race, the boats come ashore at Mortlake Anglian & Alpha Boat Club,[tpl]cite web|url=http://maabc.com/events-and-regattas/boat-race/|title=The Oxford v Cambridge Boat Race|publisher=maabc.com|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] directly upriver of Chiswick Bridge. Here shortly after the race the Boat Race trophy is presented to the winning crew. It is traditional for the winning side to throw their cox into the Thames to celebrate their achievement.
Moved from the original festivities by the stone in Mortlake, these are therefore at the clubhouse by Grove Park, Chiswick west of the busy bridge. Nonetheless the arms of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, covering more than half of the Surrey bank has two griffin supporters that hold oars, one light blue, one dark, in reference to the Boat Race, colours which are 'later tinctures' in English heraldry.

===Previous courses===

The course for the main part of the race's history has been from Putney to Mortlake, but there have been three other courses:
In addition, there were four unofficial boat races held during the Second World War away from London. As none of those competing were awarded blues, these races are not included in the official list:

==Media coverage==

The event is now a British national institution, and is televised live each year and has been covered by the BBC since 1938 while the BBC first covered it on radio in 1927. As of the 2005 race, the BBC handed over broadcasting rights to ITV, after 66 years, but it returned to the corporation in 2010."ITV drops Boat Race for football", BBC
On the radio John Snagge commentated for the BBC from 1930s to the early 1980s on BBC Radio 2. Peter Jones, Brian Johnston and Robert Hudson commentated in the 1980s on BBC Radio 2 and Jon Champion, Tony Adamson and Peter Drury commentated for BBC Radio 5 and 5 Live in the 1990s.
The most famous commentary on The Boat Race featured BBC radio commentator John Snagge who, his voice filled with excitement during the 1949 staging of the event, reported: "I can't see who's in the lead but it's either Oxford or Cambridge".Oxford and Cambridge Boat Races, UK
Howard Marshall commentated on the first BBC TV Boat Race in 1938 with a camera at the start and the finish. Desmond Hill commentated for the BBC in the 1960s and Harry Carpenter commentated for the BBC in the 1970s up to 1990 and Gerald Sinstadt commentated in 1991 and 1992 while Barry Davies became the voice of the Boat Race for the BBC for the years 1993 to 2004 and Steve Rider was the host, previous BBC hosts were David Coleman, Frank Bough and Harry Carpenter. Peter Drury then took over as the main commentator for ITV from 2005 to 2009 while coverage was presented by Gabby Logan, then Mark Durden-Smith and finally Craig Doyle.
Andrew Cotter has commentated for the BBC since its return in 2010 with Dan Topolski and Wayne Pommen while Clare Balding has presented usually with Matt Pinsent, Sir Steve Redgrave and others within the world of rowing. Jonathan Legard commentated on the 2012 Race while Andrew Cotter was at the US Masters for the BBC but has returned in 2013. Barry Davies has returned to commentate on LBC Radio when the TV coverage moved to ITV. BBC World News holds the worldwide rights to the race taking UK coverage.
The race which took place on 30 March 1895 became the subject of one of the world's first motion pictures directed by Birt Acres.
Ethnographer Mark de Rond described the training, selection, and victory of the 2007 Cambridge crew in The Last Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew.[tpl]cite web|last=de Rond |first=Mark |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Amateurs-Hell-Back-Cambridge/dp/1848310153 |title=The Last Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew  |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]

==Competitors==

The race is for heavyweight eights (i.e. eight rowers with a cox steering, and no restrictions on weight). Female coxes are permitted: the first to appear in the Boat Race was Sue Brown for Oxford in 1981. In fact female rowers would be permitted in the men's boat race, though the reverse is not true.
Although the contest is strictly between amateurs, and the competitors must be students of the university for which they race, the training schedules the teams undertake are very gruelling. Typically each team trains for six days a week for six months before the event.
Such is the competitive spirit between the universities that it is common for Olympic standard rowers to compete, notably including four-time Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent, who rowed for Oxford in 1990, 1991, and 1993. Olympic gold medallists from 2000 – Tim Foster (Oxford 1997), Luka Grubor (Oxford 1997), Andrew Lindsay (Oxford 1997, 1998, 1999) and Kieran West (Cambridge 1999, 2001, 2006, 2007), 2004 – Ed Coode (Oxford 1998), and 2008 - Malcolm Howard (Oxford 2013, 2014) have also rowed for their university. Other famous participants include Andrew Irvine (Oxford 1922, 1923), Lord Snowdon (Cambridge 1950), Colin Moynihan (Oxford 1977), actor Hugh Laurie (Cambridge 1980) and TV presenter Dan Snow (Oxford 1999, 2000, 2001).The Boat Race - Personalities

===Academic status===

There are no sporting scholarships at Oxford or Cambridge, so in theory every student must obtain a university place on academic merit, but there have been unproven accusations that some students are admitted to the universities for their rowing skill without meeting the normal academic standards. Participants in the boat race are indeed academically capable: the 2005 Cambridge crew, for example, contained four PhD students, including a qualified medical doctor and a veterinarian.
From 1978 to 1983 the race was won every year by Oxford crews that included Boris Rankov, who was then a graduate student at Oxford and recognised as a powerhouse of the crews. Although Rankov was a bona fide student (and is now a professor at the University of London), this led to the establishment of the informal "Rankov Rule", to which the teams have adhered ever since, that no rower may compete in the boat race more than four times as an undergraduate, and four times as a graduate.Royal Holloway, University of London[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/02/26/sorow26.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Rowing: Rankov to rule again | first=Rachel | last=Quarrell | date=26 February 2003 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]
In order to protect the status of the race as a competition between genuine students, the Boat Race organising committee in July 2007 refused to award a blue to 2006 and 2007 Cambridge oarsman Thorsten Engelmann, as he did not complete his academic course and instead returned to the German national rowing team to prepare for the Beijing Olympics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/rowing/6903124.stm|title=Engelmann punished for early exit|date=17 July 2007|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 June 2009[/tpl] This has caused a debate about a change of rules, and one suggestion appears to be that only students that are enrolled in courses lasting at least two years should be eligible to race.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/mihirbose/2007/07/choppy_waters_ahead_for_boat_r.html |title=Choppy waters ahead for Boat Race |publisher=BBC |date=20 July 2007 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]

===Standard of the crews===

The question whether the Boat Race crews are up to the standard of international crews is difficult to judge, since the Boat Race crews train for a long-distance race early in the season, so their training schedule is quite different from crews training for international regattas over 2000 metres that take place later in the year.
According to British Olympic gold medallist Martin Cross, Boat Race crews of the early 1980s were viewed as "a bit of a joke" by some international–level rowers of the time. However, their standard has improved substantially since then.[tpl]cite news |title=Rowing is elitist, but not in the way Trenton Oldfield thinks |author=Martin Cross |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/09/rowing-trenton-oldfield-boat-race |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 April 2012|accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl] Current Boat Race crews do race against some club and international crews in the build-up to the race, and are competitive against them, but again these matches are over various non-standard distances, against crews that might not have been together as long as the Oxbridge crews.
In 2005 a strong Oxford crew, similar to the crew who had rowed in the Boat Race, entered the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta, losing to the winning German international crew in the first round by a third of a length. The same year, Cambridge won the Ladies Challenge Plate at the same regatta.
In 2007 Cambridge were entered in the London Head of the River Race, where they should have been measured directly against the best crews in Britain and beyond. However the event was called off after several crews were sunk or swamped in rough conditions. Cambridge were fastest of the few crews who did complete the course.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/04/01/soboat01.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Boat Race: Cambridge confidence gets big boost | first=Rachel | last=Quarrell | date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]

==Sponsorship==

The Boat Race has been sponsored since 1976, with the money spent mainly on equipment and travel during the training period. The sponsors do not have their logos on the boats, but do have their logo on kit during the race. They also provide branded training gear and have some naming rights. Boat Race sponsors have included Ladbrokes, Beefeater Gin, Aberdeen Asset Management, and the business process outsourcing company Xchanging, who sponsored the race until 2012.[tpl]cite news | publisher =  BBC News | date = 29 March 2011 | title = Boat Race sponsor Xchanging to end contract | url =  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12888300 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Xchanging sponsorship of The Boat Race draws to a close | date = 29 March 2011 | publisher = Xchanging | archivedate = 23 August 2011 | url = http://www.theboatrace.org/article/newsandmedia/20102011news/xchangings | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61AAi7WAs [/tpl] Controversially, in the renewal of the deal with Xchanging, the crews agreed to wear the sponsor's logo on their kit during the race itself, in exchange for increased funding.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]  Prior to this, all sponsorship marks had been scrupulously discarded on boating for the competition, in line with the race's amateur and ‘Corinthian’ spirit. Xchanging also became title sponsor in November 2009 so, from the 156th Race until 2012, the event was known as The Xchanging Boat Race.[tpl]cite news |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=20 November 2009 |author=Rachel Quarrell |title=University Boat Race to have title sponsorship from 2010 onwards |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/rowing/6608733/University-Boat-Race-to-have-title-sponsorship-from-2010-onwards.html | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Xchanging becomes title sponsor of The Boat Race |publisher=The Boat Race Company |url=http://www.theboatrace.org/article/newsandmedia/latestnews/xchangingtitlesponsor |accessdate=20 November 2009 [/tpl] In 2013 the sponsor BNY Mellon took over and it became the BNY Mellon Boat Race.Boat Race - BNY Mellon announced as new Boat Race Title Sponsor

==Other boat races involving Oxford and Cambridge==

Although the heavyweight men's eights are the best-known event, the two universities compete in other rowing boat races. The main boat race is preceded by a race between the two reserve crews. The Oxford reserve crew is called Isis (after the Isis, a section of the River Thames which passes through Oxford), and the Cambridge reserve crew is called Goldie (the name comes from rower and Boat Club president John Goldie, 1849–1896, after whom the Goldie Boathouse is named).
The women's eights, women's reserve eights ("Osiris" and "Blondie"), men's lightweight eights and women's lightweight eights race in the Henley Boat Races, usually a week before the men's heavyweight races. There is also a 'veterans' boat race, usually held on a weekday before the main Boat Race, on the Thames between Putney and Hammersmith. The women's boat race will be moving to the Tideway, using the same course and running on the same day as the men's race, in 2015.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rowing/16937873 |title=Women's Boat Race set for men's course from 2015 |publisher=BBC |date=7 February 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2012[/tpl]

==Build-up==

Training for the Boat Race officially begins in September, before the start of term. The first public tests are in November at the British Indoor Rowing Championships, where each university sends around 20 rowers to compete. Everyone races 2 km on an indoor rower with the club presidents using adjacent machines. Both universities also send crews to the Head of the River Fours race in London, which is raced over the reverse Boat Race course, that is to say the Championship course from Mortlake to Putney.
In December, the coaches put out Trial Eights where two crews from the same university race each other over the full Boat Race course. These crews are given names such as Kara and Whakamanawa (Māori words for strength and honour, Cambridge 2004) or Cowboys and Indians (Oxford 2004). Other trials boat names have included such pairings as Guns and Roses.
Over the Christmas period the squads go on training camps abroad, where final places for the blue boats are decided. After the final blue boat crews have been decided, they race against the top crews from the UK and abroad (e.g. in recent years they have raced Leander, Molesey, the German international crew, and a composite crew of Olympic scullers[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7959908.stm |work=BBC News | title=Students v Supermen | date=24 March 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010 | first=Martin | last=Gough[/tpl]). These races are only over part of the course (from Putney to Chiswick Eyot).
In case of injury or illness, each university has ten extra rowers, eight in the reserve boats Isis and Goldie, and two as the spare pair. Isis and Goldie race 30 mins before the Blue Boat event over the same course. As for the spare pair, in the week before the main event they race each other from the mile post to university stone (i.e. from a point one mile into the Championship Course back to the Boat Race start). In the final week, there is also an official weigh in and the average crew weights are announced. The perceived slight advantage of being the heavier crew leads to the practice of drinking large volumes of water directly before the weigh in order to artificially increase weight for a short period of time.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/03/25/socrac25.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Oxford bank on a flying start to counter light blues' finess | first=James | last=Cracknell | date=25 March 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010[/tpl]

==Popular culture==

Boat race became such a popular phrase that it was incorporated into Cockney rhyming slang, for "face".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In the stories of P. G. Wodehouse, several characters allude to Boat Race Night as a time of riotous celebration (presumably after the victory of the character's alma mater). This frequently sees the participants in trouble with the authorities. Bertie Wooster mentions several times that he was fined five pounds at "Bosher Street", possibly a reference to Bow Street Magistrates Court, for stealing a policeman's helmet on Boat Race Night. The beginning of the first episode of the Jeeves and Wooster television series shows his court appearance on this occasion.[tpl]cite serial |title=Jeeves and Wooster|episode=Jeeves Takes Charge|seriallink= |url= |series=|serieslink=|credits= |network= |station= |city= |airdate=22 April 1990 |began= |ended= |dateformat= |season=1|number=1 |minutes=1 |transcript= |transcripturl=[/tpl]

==Results and statistics==

The detailed nature of the record-keeping over the event's history has many record statistics being carefully monitored. A selection of the more frequently cited statistics includes:

===Full results by year===

a. [tpl]Note_label|a|a|none[/tpl] Cambridge (on the Surrey side) had initially gone into a clear lead, so that they were entitled to take Oxford's water on the Middlesex side. When the boats came up to Crabtree Tavern, Cambridge made for the Surrey side just as Oxford were about to overhaul them. Oxford refused to give way and the two boats collided. After a close fought race, Cambridge crossed the line first. Umpire Fellows called a foul citing the rule in the code of rowing laws governing collisions after one boat has taken the others' water: "if they come into contact by the leading boat's departing from the water so taken, the leading boat shall be deemed to have committed a foul".[tpl]cite news |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=CS52199825&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0 |title=University Boat Race |publisher=The Times |date=17 December 1849 |page=3 [/tpl]
b. [tpl]Note_label|b|b|none[/tpl] In the first race, both boats sank, so it was restaged the next day.
c. [tpl]Note_label|c|c|none[/tpl] The race was interrupted and restarted. Finish judge Ben Kent counted the total time spent racing.http://theboatrace.org/men/statistics

===Unofficial wartime races===

===Reserves race===

a. [tpl]Note_label|a|a|none[/tpl] When the crews were approaching Barnes Bridge, Isis were leading by about ¾ length. Umpire John Garrett had warned Isis for being out of their water, when a further blade clash resulted in the Goldie no. 2 breaking his swivel. Garrett then disqualified Isis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=wes_ttda&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=&docId=IF503250988&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0 |last=Rosewell |first=Mike |title=Light Blue Light at the end of the tunnel |publisher=The Times |date=2 April 1990 [/tpl]
