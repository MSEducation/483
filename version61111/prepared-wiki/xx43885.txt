==Career==

===Modelling===

In 1997, Guillory accompanied a ballerina friend to the London modelling agency Select and was soon signed. She modelled solely to support her acting career. As a model, she worked in campaigns for Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Burberry, and Paul Smith and appeared on the covers of several fashion magazines. In 1999, she became the face of the Hugo Boss fragrance campaign, succeeding model Karen Ferrari and continuing the campaign for three years.[tpl]cite web |last=Baden Howard |first= Jenni |title= Sienna Guillory Interview |publisher= |work=The Sunday Times| year= 2000 |url=http://www.kappakoi.com/copy/archives/2007/06/sienna_guillory.html | accessdate= 25 April 2009 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090424053502/http://www.kappakoi.com/copy/archives/2007/06/sienna_guillory.html  |archivedate= 24 April 2009[/tpl] After modelling for a few years, Guillory returned her focus to acting in 2000. She is signed to Independent Models in London.

===Acting===

Guillory explained that she "became an actor because I wanted to know what it was like to be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support..." She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.[tpl]cite news| title= Sienna Guillory: Beauty and the beasts| publisher=The Independent | date= 12 March 2004 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/sienna-guillory-beauty-and-the-beasts-565959.html |first=Nick |last=Hasted | accessdate=25 April 2009[/tpl]
In 1993, Guillory made her screen debut in a TV adaptation of Jilly Cooper's novel, Riders, for which the casting directors needed a young actress who was able to ride a horse.[tpl]cite news| last= Morreale| first= Marie| title= Sienna Guillory| publisher= ScholasticNews.com| date= 2006-12-06| url= http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=8094| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl] Her performance landed her in another small role in the miniseries The Buccaneers, opposite Mira Sorvino.
Before becoming a model to support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing was probably the most useful thing I've done."[tpl]cite news| last=Roberts| first= Alison| title= Take a Girl Like You| publisher= thisislondon.co.uk| date= 9 April 2000 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/film/article-899239-take-a-girl-like-you.do| accessdate= 29 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because "I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't know where I was coming from".
She returned to film with a more substantial role in the thriller Sorted (2000). Guillory went on to appear in the BBC production Take a Girl Like You, a television adaptation of Kingsley Amis's novel of the same name. She portrayed Jenny Bunn, the story's virginal heroine, and gained critical attention for her part in the period piece. Guillory was pleased to have played a more innocent character, saying "I've played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads... It's nice to do something with a lighter touch."[tpl]cite press release | title= Take a Girl Like You Cast and Credits| publisher= pbs.org| year= 2000| url= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/takeagirl/credits.html| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl] The production did not fare well in the ratings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1422598.stm |title=Challenge for the corporation |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2001 |accessdate=25 April 2009[/tpl]
In 2001, Guillory continued with other roles in predominantly British films, including Oblivious, Late Night Shopping (with husband Enzo Cilenti), The Last Minute, and Superstition. 2002 saw Guillory appear in The Time Machine, alongside Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons. She was pleased to take on a larger scale film, after having worked on low-budget independent films, and compared the experience with "finding an unicorn in your sock drawer".[tpl]Cite news | title= Sienna Guillory| magazine= Vanity Fair| date= December 2001|url= http://community.livejournal.com/siennagfan/20449.html#cutid1| accessdate= 2007-09-30 | postscript= [/tpl] She played Emma, the fiancée of Pearce's character, who was killed early in the film and whose death set off its main events.
In 2003, after a friend had received a script for The Principles of Lust, Guillory claims she "read it and couldn't put it down, and begged to read for the part". She was impressed by director Penny Woolcock's unconventional style of shooting, without rehearsing the actors, using raw takes and improvisational performances. For the role of Juliette, Guillory performed nude in the film's sex scenes which were filmed during the first week of filming, making her somewhat nervous.[tpl]cite web| title= The Principles of Sienna| publisher= tiscali.co.uk| year= 2004| url= http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/interviews/sienna_guillory.html| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl] She later went on to say that it was one of her favorite acting experiences. Afterwards, Guillory had a small role in the romantic comedy Love, Actually before taking the starring role in the television miniseries Helen of Troy. The series was mostly based on Homer's epic poem Iliad and focuses on the mythological life of Helen. Helen of Troy was nominated for best miniseries at the Satellite Awards.[tpl]cite web| title= Helen of Troy (2003) (TV) – Awards| publisher= imdb.com| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0340477/awards| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl]
In May 2004, Guillory starred in a new stage production of The Shape of Things at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London, with husband Cilenti.[tpl]cite web |title= An uphill challenge fit for two |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?xml=/health/2004/05/05/hsien05.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Bryony |last=Gordon |date=5 May 2004 |accessdate= 25 April 2009[/tpl] 2004 also saw Guillory in her first big Hollywood role. She was cast as Jill Valentine, one of the lead characters in the video game adaptation sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The film makers had searched widely for an actress to portray the video game character and found her in Guillory, who had to "please not only the movie-going audience but also the gamers". She was, however, "a dead ringer for Jill Valentine".[tpl]cite web| title= Resident Evil: Apocalypse Production| publisher= hollywoodjesus.com| url = http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/resident_evil_apocalypse_about.htm| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl] Guillory was reported to have studied the original character's movements by watching playthroughs of the video game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] Before getting the script for the film, she had not been familiar with the video games or seen Resident Evil. She said about her role: [tpl]cquote|You always want to play someone you’re going to have fun with, someone you want to be. Jill's got everything a girl wants to be – she dresses to kill, says whatever she wants and can shoot anyone between the eyes in a 50-yard radius. She’s hard as nails and she's great fun. And not at all afraid of being quite the sexy minx.[/tpl]
Resident Evil: Apocalypse, although it was not well received by critics, grossed $23,036,273 on its opening weekend (10–12 September 2004) and took a total of $51,201,453 in the United States and $129,394,835 worldwide.[tpl]cite web |url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevilapocalypse.htm |title= Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo[/tpl]
After the success of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Guillory went on to appear in other film and television roles, including Beauty (2004), Marple: A Murder Is Announced (2005), In the Bathroom (2005), The Virgin Queen (2005), Silence Becomes You (2005), and Rabbit Fever (2006).
In 2006, Guillory was a lead in the ensemble cast of the fantasy Eragon, the film adaptation of the novel by Christopher Paolini; the role had reunited her with The Time Machine co-star Jeremy Irons. She portrayed Arya Dröttningu, an elf princess. She had not read the novels before filming, but after accepting the role she soon became a fan of Paolini's work. Although Arya is a key character in the film, Guillory had little screen time and went on to say jokingly: "I've been trying to explain to friends who've seen the trailer ... I'm like, "... but that's my whole part!""[tpl]cite news| last= Utichi| first=Joe| title= Redefining Elves Sienna Guillory on tackling the role of Arya in Eragon| publisher= Rotten Tomatoes| date= 2006-12-18| url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eragon/articles/1562889/ | accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl] Eragon was not well received by the critics, but was nominated as Best Fantasy Film at the 2006 Saturn Awards.[tpl]cite web| title= Awards| publisher= imdb.com| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449010/awards| accessdate= 2007-09-30[/tpl] The film went on to gross approximately $75 million in the US and $173.9 million elsewhere, totalling $249 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eragon.htm |title=Eragon (2006) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12[/tpl] Guillory was also invited to reprise her role as Jill Valentine in Resident Evil: Extinction, the sequel to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts with Eragon.[tpl]cite news| title= Sienna Guillory| publisher= empireonline.com| year= 2006| url= http://www.empireonline.com/interviews_and_events/interview.asp?IID=612| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070505063307/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews_and_events/interview.asp?IID=612| archivedate=2007-05-05| accessdate= 2007-09-29[/tpl]
In 2007, she starred in the Spanish production El Corazón de la tierra, or The Heart of the Earth, and later in the year finished filming the horror/thriller Victims and the fantasy novel adaptation Inkheart. In Inkheart, she plays Resa, the wife of Brendan Fraser's character and the mother of Eliza Bennett's.
