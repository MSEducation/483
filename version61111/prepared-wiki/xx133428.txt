The Smith & Wesson Model 59 was a modification of the S&W Model 39 pistol that had a double-column magazine. It was one of the first generation of Smith & Wesson semi-automatics.

==History and users==

It was designed for the U.S. Navy as a large-capacity version of the S&W Model 39, the basis of their Mark 22 "Hush Puppy" silenced pistol.  In 1965, the U.S. Navy commissioned a version of the S&W Model 39 that could take the 13-round magazine of the FN Browning HP35.  In early 1970, a dozen experimental all-stainless-steel prototypes were made and were issued to Navy SEAL commandos for evaluation in the field.  The firearm was not adopted. 
The Model 59 went on the market in 1971.  It went out of production a decade later in 1980 when the improved second generation series was introduced (the Model 459). 

==Design==

The Model 59 was manufactured in 9mm Parabellum caliber with a wider anodized aluminum frame (to accommodate a double-stack magazine), a straight backstrap, a magazine disconnect (the pistol will not fire unless a magazine is in place), and a blued carbon steel slide that carries the manual safety. The grip is of three pieces made of two nylon plastic panels joined by a metal backstrap. It uses a magazine release located to the rear of the trigger guard, similar to the M1911A1.

==Model 459==

The S&W Model 459 was an updated version of the Model 59 with adjustable sights and checkered nylon grips.  This model was discontinued in 1988.  Eight hundred three units were produced in a brush finish with special grips made to FBI specifications.
