Patsy Cline was best known for her string of Country and Pop ballads like "I Fall to Pieces", "Crazy" and "She's Got You". By 1962, Cline was already successful on both the Country and Pop singles charts. Her first hit that year was the song "She's Got You". After that, Cline released a string of hits, like "So Wrong". "So Wrong" was released in mid-1962 as a Decca 45 single, 31406, b/w "You're Stronger Than Me", and became a Billboard Top 20 Country Hit, reaching #14. Its success on the Pop charts was not as successful as her previous hits, reaching #85 on the Pop charts.

Cline uses her emotionally expressive voice in this song, as she did with many other hits. The song initially talks about how someone was wrong towards their lover. They regret how wrong they were for letting their lover go, and express how much they miss them.
