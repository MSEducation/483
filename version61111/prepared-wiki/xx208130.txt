John Chavis Middle School is a public middle school in the Gaston County Schools school district located in Cherryville, North Carolina, United States.  It is named for John Chavis (c. 1763-1838), African-American educator and Presbyterian minister 
John Chavis Middle School was formerly John Chavis High School, a racially-segregated school for African-American students from western Gaston County.  The school graduated its first students in 1938.  It originally housed grades one through eleven in the one main building.  An addition was added in 1954.  After a fire destroyed the main building in 1964, classes were temporarily held in two black churches and the Rhyne Houser Recreational Building.  The class of 1964 held graduation exercises at Lincoln High School in Bessemer City.  Classes resumed at the new school in the fall of 1964. Only two classes graduated from the new John Chavis High School. During the summer of 1966, the Cherryville School System became fully integrated.History of John Chavis High School, Cherryville.com.

From 1966, John Chavis School became Cherryville South Elementary School, housing students in grades three and four. In 1973, grades five and six were added. With the start of the 1997 school year, the building was remodeled and became a middle school for grades 6 to 8 and reclaimed the name of John Chavis.
