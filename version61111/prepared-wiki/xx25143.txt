Sigourney Weaver (born Susan Alexandra Weaver; October 8, 1949) is an American actress. She is known especially for the lead role of Ellen Ripley in the four Alien films: Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection.  She is also well known for her roles as Dana Barrett in Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, and in Gorillas in the Mist, Working Girl, and Avatar.
Her 1986 Academy Award nomination for Aliens is considered as a landmark in the recognition of science fiction, action, and horror genres, as well as a major step in challenging the gender role in cinema. Weaver progressively received fame for her numerous contributions to the science fiction film history (including minor roles in successful works such as Futurama, WALL-E, Paul and The Cabin in the Woods) and gained the nickname of "The Sci-Fi Queen".[tpl]cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2009/12/10/avatar-star-sigourney-weaver-as-queen-of-scifi-outer-space-has-been-good-to-me/|title=Weaver's interview in Los Angeles Times Hero Complex |publisher=Los Angeles Times Hero Complex |accessdate=October 2, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geekophonie.fr/the-sci-fi-queen/ |title=Sigourney Weaver - "The Sci-fi Queen"|publisher=Geekophonie |language=French|accessdate=October 2, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2010/oct/30/weaver-still-queen-of-sci-fi/|title=Article about Weaver|publisher=The Post and Courier |accessdate=October 2, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csaspeakers.com/eng/our-speakers/profile/Sigourney_Weaver|title=Sigourney Weaver, Multi Award Winning TV and Film Actress|publisher=Celebrity Speakers |accessdate=November 17, 2011[/tpl] She also played the lead role as Secretary of State Elaine Barrish on USA Network's Political Animals miniseries.
