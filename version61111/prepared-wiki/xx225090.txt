Hell Gates ([tpl]Coord|62|40|20.3|S|61|10|46.4|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a narrow (20 m wide) boat passage between the Vardim Rocks and Devils Point on Byers Peninsula, connecting Raskuporis Cove and Osogovo Bay at the southwest end of Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. The name dates back to about 1821 and was applied by early sealers in the area because many lives and ships were lost here.
