Joseph I ([tpl]lang-pt|José I[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ[/tpl], 6 June 1714 – 24 February 1777), "the Reformer" ([tpl]lang-pt|"o Reformador"[/tpl]), was the King of Portugal and the Algarves from 31 July 1750 until his death.

==Early life==

He was the third child of King John V of Portugal and his wife Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. Joseph had an older brother, Peter (but he died at the age of two), an older sister and three younger brothers. At the death of his elder brother, Joseph became Prince of Brazil as the heir-apparent of the king, and Duke of Braganza.
Joseph was devoted to hunting and the opera.History of Portugal: Pamphlet Collection. CUP Archive, 1937. Accessed September 2012. Indeed, he assembled one of the greatest collections of operatic scores in Europe.

===Marriage===

On 19 January 1729, Joseph married a Spanish Infanta, Mariana Victoria of Spain, daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese, and his elder sister Barbara of Portugal married the future Ferdinand VI of Spain. Mariana Victoria loved music and hunting,History of Portugal: Pamphlet Collection. CUP Archive, 1937. Accessed September 2012. but she was also a serious woman who disliked the King's affairs and did not hesitate to expose them to acquaintances. Joseph and Mariana Victoria had four daughters, two stillborn sons, one stillborn daughter and a miscarriage in 1750.

==Reign==

He succeeded to the Portuguese throne in 1750, when he was 36 years old,History of Portugal: Pamphlet Collection. CUP Archive, 1937. Accessed September 2012. and almost immediately placed effective power in the hands of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, better known today as the Marquis of Pombal.History of Portugal: Pamphlet Collection. CUP Archive, 1937. Accessed September 2012. Indeed the history of Joseph's reign is really that of Pombal himself. King Joseph also declared his eldest daughter Maria Francisca as the official heiress of the throne, and proclaimed her Princess of Brazil. By this time, the king did not believe he would have a son.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]

===Marquis of Pombal===

The powerful Marquis sought to overhaul all aspects of economic, social and colonial policy to make Portugal a more efficient contender with the other great powers of Europe, and thus secure his own power status  as a result.  A conspiracy of nobles aimed at murdering King Joseph and the Marquis gave Pombal the opportunity (some say, the pretext) to get rid of the Távora family, and to expel the Jesuits in September 1759, thus gaining control of public education and a wealth of church lands and ushering Portugal, which had been a backwater dominated by the High Aristocracy and a very conservative brand of Catholicism, into the Enlightenment age.

==Legacy and Death==

The reign of Joseph was also famous for the great Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755, in which around 100,000 people died. 
The earthquake caused Joseph to develop a severe case of claustrophobia and he was never again comfortable living within a walled building. Consequently, he moved the royal court to an extensive complex of tents in the hills of Ajuda. 
The capital was eventually rebuilt at great cost, and an equestrian statue of King Joseph still dominates Lisbon's main plaza.
With Joseph's death on 24 February 1777 the throne passed to his daughter Maria I and brother/son-in-law Peter III. Pombal's iron rule was sharply brought to an end, because she hated him very much for his arrogance and violent behaviour.

==Issue==

Joseph I fathered four surviving children by the Queen, all daughters.
