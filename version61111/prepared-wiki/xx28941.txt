==Career==

Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan–Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, he moved to California and The Michigan Voice was shut down.
After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua.[tpl]cite book|last=Schultz|first=Emily|title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|location=47–54|isbn=1-55022-699-1[/tpl] Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."Cockburn, Alexander. "Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones", The Nation, September 13, 1986. Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me.Matt Labash. "Michael Moore, One-Trick Phony".

===Writing===

Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. Stupid White Men (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also "a book of political humor."Opinion Journal from the Wall Street Journal: Unmoored from Reality. John Fund's Political Diary, March 21, 2003. URL accessed 2006-08-29. Dude, Where's My Country? (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the energy industry, and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists.

===Acting===

Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in Lucky Numbers (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his Canadian Bacon as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in The Fever, starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead.

===Television===

Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the BBC television series TV Nation, which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995.
His other major series was The Awful Truth, which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on Channel 4 in the UK, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of The Awful Truth, where he was also described as "muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker".
Another 1999 series, Michael Moore Live, was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to The Awful Truth, but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.

===Music videos===

Moore has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from The Battle of Los Angeles: "Sleep Now in the Fire" and "Testify". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of "Sleep Now in the Fire", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City had denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.Green Left Weekly: Rage against Wall Street. Michael Moore, via MichaelMoore.com, date unspecified. URL accessed 2006-07-09.
Moore also directed the videos for R.E.M. single "All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)" in 2001 and the System of a Down song "Boom!".

==Political views==

Although Moore has been noted for his political activism, he rejects being labeled as a "political activist" saying such a description is redundant as a citizen of a democracy: "I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist. If we're not politically active, it ceases to be a democracy."[tpl]cite web | url = http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-07-04/features/0706290259_1_sicko-health-care-health-care | title = 'I am the balance', says Moore | work = Minneapolis Star Tribune | publisher = South Florida Sun-Sentinel | date = July 4, 2007 | quote = Moore rejects the label "political activist"; as a citizen of a democracy, Moore insists, such a description is redundant. | accessdate = July 6, 2007 [/tpl] According to John Flesher of the Associated Press, Moore is known for his "fiery left-wing populism,"[tpl]cite news | agency=Associated Press | title = Hollywood meets Bellaire as Moore gives sneak peek of "Sicko" | first = John | last = Flesher | date = June 16, 2007 | accessdate = July 6, 2007 | quote = But the filmmaker, known for his fiery left-wing populism and polemical films such as "Fahrenheit 9/11" and Oscar-winning "Bowling for Columbine", told the audience "Sicko" would appeal across the political spectrum.[/tpl] and publications such as the Socialist Worker Online have hailed him as the "new Tom Paine."Porton, Richard.

Moore was a high-profile guest at both the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention, chronicling his impressions in USA Today. He was criticized in a speech by Republican Senator John McCain as "a disingenuous film-maker." Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting "four more years."

Despite having supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election, Moore urged Nader not to run in 2004 so as not to split the left vote. On Real Time with Bill Maher, Moore and Maher knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33257-2004Aug1.html |title=Bill Maher: Back for More |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=August 2, 2004 |accessdate=March 7, 2012[/tpl]
Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term "deserter" when he introduced Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark at a Democratic Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, "I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate" between Clark and W. Bush – "the general versus the deserter." Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including The Boston Globe which had reported that "there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2 |title=George W.

In an op-ed piece for The New York Times published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the Affordable Care Act, calling it “awful” and adding that, “Obamacare’s rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.” Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a “godsend” because it provides a start "to get what we deserve: universal quality health care.”[tpl]cite news |last=Moore |first=Michael |title=The Obamacare We Deserve |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/opinion/moore-the-obamacare-we-deserve.html |date=December 31, 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=January 6, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Staff |title=Michael Moore: 'Awful' Obamacare is Liberals' 'Dirty Little Secret' |url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/michael-moore-obamacare/2014/01/01/id/544699 |date=January 1, 2014 |work=Newsmax Media |accessdate=January 6, 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Noam Schieber|title=How Obamacare Actually Paves the Way Toward Single Payer|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116105/obamacare-will-lead-single-payer-michael-moore|date=January 5, 2014 |work=The New Republic|accessdate=January 7, 2014[/tpl]
