Additionally, multiple carbon–fluorine bonds increase the strength and stability of other nearby carbon–fluorine bonds on the same [[geminal]] carbon, as the carbon has a higher positive partial charge.<ref name=Lemal/> Furthermore, multiple carbon–fluorine bonds also strengthen the "skeletal" carbon–carbon bonds from the [[inductive effect]].<ref name=Lemal/> Therefore, [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] fluorocarbons are more chemically and thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon counterparts.  In terms of chemical reactivity, C-F bonds are very inert.  They are susceptible to attack by very strong reductants, e.g., [[Birch reduction]] and very specialized organometallic complexes.,<ref name=kip>

===Physical properties===

Fluorocarbon are colorless and have high density, up to over twice that of water.  They are not miscible with most organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate and chloroform), but are miscible with some hydrocarbons (e.g., hexane in some cases). They have very low solubility in water, and water has a very low solubility in them (on the order of 10 ppm). . They have low refractive indices. 
As the high electronegativity of fluorine reduces the polarizability of the atom, fluorocarbons are only weakly susceptible to the fleeting dipoles that form the basis of the London dispersion force. As a result, fluorocarbons have low intermolecular attractive forces and are lipophobic in addition to being hydrophobic/non-polar. Reflecting the weak intermolecular forces these compounds exhibit low viscosities when compared to liquids of similar boiling points, low surface tension, heats of vaporization.Thus fluorocarbons find applications as oil-, water-, and stain-repellents in products such as Gore-Tex and fluoropolymer carpet coatings. The reduced participation in the London dispersion force makes the solid polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) slippery as it has a very low coefficient of friction. Also, the low attractive forces in fluorocarbon liquids make them compressible and gas soluble while smaller fluorocarbons are extremely volatile. There are five fluoroalkane gases; tetrafluoromethane (bp −128 °C), hexafluoroethane (bp −78.2 °C), octafluoropropane (bp −36.5 °C), perfluoro-n-butane (bp −2.2 °C) and perfluoro-iso-butane (bp −1 °C). Nearly all other fluoroalkanes are liquids with the exception of perfluorocyclohexane, which sublimes at 51 °C.http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/v823/rpt/108771.pdf As a result of the high gas solubility of fluorocarbon liquids, they have been the subject of medical research as blood carriers because of their oxygen solubility.[ref]
