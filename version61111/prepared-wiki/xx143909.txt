[[Reach the Beach Relay]]

CATEGORIES: Long-distance relay races

The Reach The Beach Relay is a long distance relay race that is run through the picturesque hills and valleys of New Hampshire at the start of foliage season.  It is the longest running relay race in the North America at approximately [tpl]convert|204|mi|km[/tpl], starting from Cannon Mountain and ending at Hampton Beach.
The race is currently capped at 425 teams (increased from 300 in 2006) and has filled up for the last several years.  Participating teams traditionally come from the New England area, but as the race grows more and more teams are signing up from around the country and the world.

==History==

The relay was started in 1999 by two multisport athletes who wished to bring a multi-day, relay-style race to New England.  It is modelled after the grandfather of running relay races, the Hood to Coast relay in Oregon. The first year enjoyed participation by 31 teams, with the first team finishing in 23 hours and the last team in 32.  By 2007, there were 351 finishers, and the race size was capped at 350.  It sold out on June 14, 2007.  In 2008, the race sold out on April 8.

==Course==

Each year the course undergoes some minor changes and as such the total distance has increased from around [tpl]convert|198|mi|km[/tpl] to around [tpl]convert|210|mi|km[/tpl].  It is segmented into 36 legs, and is run primarily by 12-person teams.  The starts are staggered, starting at 7:30 and ending at 3:00, with the faster teams (based on their applications and history) starting latest.  Each team will run their roster three complete rotations when the race is complete, so the runner in position one runs leg 1, 13, and 25, runner in position two runs leg 2, 14, and 26, and so on.  Twelve-person teams use 2 vans, with one van eating and resting (and trying to sleep) while the other van is running its legs.  Teams of fewer than 12 are permitted to race, but they must maintain their order.  For instance, on an 11-person team the first three runners will have to run four legs each.  A team with six or fewer runners is called an Ultra.  If a runner is injured during the race and cannot continue, the subsequent runners move down one slot.
Individual legs vary in distance from [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|km[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|9.3|mi|km[/tpl] and total distances for runners varies from [tpl]convert|13.9|mi|km[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|22.5|mi|km[/tpl].  The first eight legs changed dramatically in 2007 when the start was moved from Bretton Woods to Cannon Mountain, requiring runners to run the significant uphills and downhills of the famous Kancamagus Highway. It was a one year appearance, however. In 2008 the race course was rerouted north along Interstate 93 to Beaver Brook Wayside Rest Area, which is the starting location of the first two Reach the Beach Relays (1999 and 2000).  The new course also passes Bretton Woods Mountain Resort where the race started in the years 2001 through 2006 and included a 5K run up and down the ski slopes.

==Weather==

The race is run on a Friday and Saturday in the middle of September, which generally means cool but comfortable running weather.  But with New England weather, one needs to be prepared for extremes.  The most feared weather system by the participants is the hurricane.  While technically a hurricane has never rolled through New Hampshire on race day, the remnants of three hurricanes (or what felt like hurricanes) were felt in past years.
In 2007, the weather was cool and rain fell on runners off-and-on from about 12:30 on Saturday morning until early late Saturday morning.
