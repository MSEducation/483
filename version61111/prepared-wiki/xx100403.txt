CATEGORIES: Myrmeciinae, Subfamilies of the Formicidae

The Myrmeciinae are a subfamily of the Formicidae, once found worldwide but now restricted to Australia and New Caledonia. This subfamily is one of several ant subfamilies which possess gamergates, female worker ants which are able to mate and reproduce, thus sustaining the colony after the loss of the queen.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vincent Dietemann, Christian Peeters & Bert Hölldobler |year=2004 |title=Gamergates in the Australian ant subfamily Myrmeciinae |journal=Natuwwissenschaften |volume=91 |issue=9 |pages=432–435 |pmid=15278223 |doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0549-1[/tpl] The Myrmeciinae subfamily was formerly composed of only one genus, Myrmecia, but the subfamily was redescribed by Ward & Brady in 2003 to include two tribes and four genera:[tpl]cite journal |author=Philip S.
