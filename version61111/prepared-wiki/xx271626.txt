[[Stereom]]

CATEGORIES: Echinoderms, Echinoderm anatomy

Stereom is a calcium carbonate material that makes up the internal skeletons found in sea urchins, and all other echinoderms, both living and fossilized forms. It is a sponge-like porous structure which, in a sea urchin may be 50% by volume living cells, and the rest being a matrix of calcite crystals. The size of openings in stereom varies in different species and in different places within the same organism.   Edmund BÃ¤euerlein, Handbook of Biomineralization: .
