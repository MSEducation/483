All singles released prior to "Beautiful Ending" use the Radio & Records (R&R) charts.   R&R was discontinued when "Beautiful Ending" was released, so this single, and those released after it, use the Billboard charts instead.

In addition to the above, BarlowGirl offered to feature their song "Sing Me A Love Song" in a Mercy MinistriesÂ video montage.  Apart from the Love & War album art showing up briefly during the second chorus, the band chose to be absent from this video to "keep the focus on the issues presented".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.godtube.com/watch/?v=90FE01NU | title=Sing Me a Love Song Official Music Video | author=BarlowGirl | publisher=Godtube | date=October 2, 2010 | accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl]
