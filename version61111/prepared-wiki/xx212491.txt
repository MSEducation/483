CATEGORIES: Rivers of Novosibirsk Oblast

The Kargat ([tpl]lang-ru|Каргат[/tpl]) is a river in Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia. It is a right tributary of the Chulym River. The Kargat is [tpl]convert|387|km|sp=si[/tpl] in length, with a drainage basin of [tpl]convert|7200|km2|sp=si[/tpl]
The river begins in the southern sections of the Vasyugan Swamp, at 143 meters AMSL, and flows in a southwesterly direction over the Baraba Steppe, before flowing into the Chulym River at 110 meters AMSL. A significant part of its waters either evaporates or is infiltrated in the ground, and the average discharge (at the village of Nizhny Kargat, 36 km from its mouth) is just 8.54 m³/s. In its lower reaches the river is some 30 m wide and 2 m deep, with a flow rate of 0.1 m/s. The Kargat has no major tributaries.
In its middle course is the town of Kargat, named after the river. Here the river is crossed by the Trans-Siberian Railway and the M51 highway.
The Kargat is frozen over from November to April/May.
