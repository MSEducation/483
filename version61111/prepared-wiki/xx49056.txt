==History==

In 1907 Stanley Shaw Bond, Editor at Butterworths, began a project to produce a complete statement of the law of England and Wales that was authoritative, comprehensive and up-to-date. Bond tracked down the former Lord Chancellor, the Earl of Halsbury on holiday in Nice to invite him to be the Editor-in-Chief of The Laws of England.http://lexisnexis.co.uk/HalsburysLaw/halsburys_laws_about.html
Traditionally, the role of Editor-in-Chief of Halsbury's Laws is held by a former Lord Chancellor, and the current incumbent is Lord Mackay of Clashfern.
In 2007, Halsbury's Laws celebrated its centenary with an evening of seminars led by Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Professor Richard Susskind OBE, and the publication of a collection of centenary essays.http://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/store/catalog/printProductDetailInfo.jsp?prodId=ukprod9781405733915HLCE&price=19.95&skuId=uksku9781405733915HLCE9841
