==Governors==

===Governors of the Territory of Idaho===

Idaho Territory was created from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. Initially, the territory included all of modern-day Idaho and Montana, and most of Wyoming. On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, and most of the Wyoming portion was reassigned to Dakota Territory. The portion east of the 111th meridian was split off as part of the new Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868, giving Idaho Territory its final borders.[tpl]cite book | last=Brosnan | first=Cornelius James | title=History of the State of Idaho | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | year=1918 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vA4UAAAAYAAJ | pages=117–128 | accessdate=June 29, 2010[/tpl]
Due to the long distance between Washington, D.C. and Boise, there was often a lengthy gap between a governor being appointed and his arrival in the territory; four resigned before even arriving. 

===Governors of the State of Idaho===

Idaho was admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890. Since then, the state has had 30 governors, two of whom served non-consecutive terms.  The terms for governor and lieutenant governor are four years, commencing on the first Monday in the January following the election. Prior to 1946, the offices were elected to terms of two years.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sos.idaho.gov/elect/inits/hst40_50.htm | title=Idaho Constitutional Amendment History | publisher=Idaho Secretary of State | accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl] If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is out of state or unable to discharge his duties, the lieutenant governor acts as governor until such time as the disability is removed.ID Const. art. IV, § 12  If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the President pro tempore of the Idaho Senate is next in line, and then the Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives.ID Const. art. IV, § 14 After the change to four-year terms, self-succession (re-election) was not initially allowed; newly elected Governor Smylie, formerly the state's attorney general, successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hcpeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hDIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3703%2C728300|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=Idaho voters adopt three amendments|date=November 7, 1956|page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_cFeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qTEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2840,4647264|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Corlett|first=John|title=It's mystery why law barring self-succession not repealed|date=March 31, 1963|page=5 [/tpl] There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ncsl.org/Default.aspx?TabId=14836 | title=Idaho Makes Term Limits History | publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures | date=February 1, 2002 | accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl]
