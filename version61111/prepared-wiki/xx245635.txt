St. Benard Urban Rapid Transit is the operator of public transportation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, a suburban portion of New Orleans. Although the parish and its bus service have been greatly impacted by Hurricane Katrina (the population is only 60% of pre-Katrina numbers), a commuter route remains. For $1, trips are made approximately every 40 minutes during weekdays between Poydras, Louisiana and the New Orleans neighborhood of Arabi, at which transfers to RTA buses to Downtown can be efficiently made.
