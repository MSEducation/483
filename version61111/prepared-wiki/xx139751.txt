Irchester railway station was built by the Midland Railway in 1857 on its extension from [tpl]stnlnk|Leicester[/tpl] to [tpl]stnlnk|Bedford[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|Hitchin[/tpl] in England.
The station building was built on an overbridge. It closed for passenger traffic in 1960, and for goods in 1965. 
The Irchester Bank is one of the steepest of five summit levels between Leicester and Bedford. The surrounding country provided important traffic to the line in the form of ironstone for the smelters in Derbyshire.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books 
In the early twentyfirst century local campaigners argued for the station to be reopened to serve as a 'park and ride' station for the nearby town of Rushden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/sbates/brta/html/north_of_bedford.html|title=Support a Local as well as a Semi-Fast Train Service North of Bedford|date=2003-06-10|publisher=Bedfordshire Railway & Transport Association (BRTA)|accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl] (Web site last updated September 2003)
