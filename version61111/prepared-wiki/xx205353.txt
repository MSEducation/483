==Radio career==

WWRL, New York, April–June 1965
Leonard moved to WWRL (R&B) in New York in June 1965, doing the night shift. Leonard was at WWRL for just seven weeks, before WABC (AM) deejay Dan Ingram heard him and convinced WABC to hire him. He was the first African-American broadcast personality on a major market Top 40 station.

===WABC (AM) Radio, New York, 1965-1979===

Leonard began at ABC's flagship New York radio station, Musicradio 77 WABC (AM), under program director Rick Sklar in 1965. He broke the color barrier for all who followed — the first African-American to cross over from black R&B radio to (then-mostly white) mass-appeal radio.
Leonard began in the 11 p.m. to midnight slot, and continued working late nights and Sundays at the station until November 27, 1979. He did the 10:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. shift following “Cousin” Bruce Morrow and later George Michael. He also gladly handled weekend and fill-in work.
Leonard was the host of "Sneak Preview," a five-minute Monday-through-Saturday evening program on ABC's American Contemporary Radio Network, which featured newly released songs. He stayed at WABC until 1979, before moving to WXLO and WRKS.

Leonard did mornings ("The Wake-up Club”) and afternoons in the 1980s.

===WBLS-FM, New York, June 30, 1989===

Leonard played R&B from 7–11 p.m. He always kept ties with WBLS, working weekends, fill-ins and overnights.

===WQEW-AM, New York, 1996===

Leonard played popular standards from the American songbook prior to the station flipping to Radio Disney.

===WNSW-AM 1430, New York===

WNSW was on the air for only two years (March 22, 1999 to March 1, 2001), offering popular standards.

===WJUX-FM 103.1 “Jukebox Radio”===

Leonard did afternoon drive.

===WCBS-FM, New York===

For WCBS-FM, Leonard did occasional fill in work, including on Christmas Day. He was heard on the Radio Greats weekends. He did not work full-time at WCBS-FM because he was a full-time employee for WBLS. CBS-FM welcomed Leonard to fill in any time he could.
