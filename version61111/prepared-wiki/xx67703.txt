De La Salle University (Tagalog: Pamantasang De La Salle) (also referred to as DLSU or La Salle) is a Roman Catholic, Lasallian University of Higher Learning  in Taft Avenue, Malate, Manila, Philippines. It was founded in 1911 by De La Salle Brothers as the De La Salle College in Paco, Manila with Blimond Pierre serving as its first director.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/help/faq/gen_info.asp | title= General Information | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl] The college moved on September 1921 to its present location to facilitate increase in enrollment. DLSU, granted university status on February 1975, is the oldest constituent of De La Salle Philippines (DLSP), a network of 17 Lasallian institutions established in 2006 to replace the De La Salle University System.,[tpl]Cite web | url = http://delasalle.ph/index.php?page=about&section=dlsu | publisher=De La Salle Philippines | title = De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dls-csb.edu.ph/default.asp?section=10&what=1000118 | title = College history | publisher=De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl][tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.delasalle.ph/index.php?page=about&section=facts | title = De La Salle Philippines: A Brief History | publisher=De La Salle Philippines | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl]
The university started as a boys' elementary and high school. It started offering in 1920 a two-year Associate in Arts in Commerce program, which was later discontinued in 1931 in favor of a Bachelor of Science in Commerce program.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/inside/history.asp | title = History | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl] DLSU currently offers coeducational undergraduate and graduate degree programs through its seven colleges and one school specializing in varied disciplines, including business, engineering and liberal arts.[tpl]cite news | url = http://thelasallian.com/2011/01/23/lasallians-suffer-from-limited-campus-space/ | title = Lasallians suffer from limited campus space | author=Kim Mendoza | author2= David Pagulayan | author3 = Lyzette Siazar | date = 2011-01-23 | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | newspaper=The LaSallian | location = Manila[/tpl]
The university, currently under the administration of President Ricky Laguda, is a member of several international university associations (including the ASEAN University Network and International Association of Universities) as well as local organizations (such as the South Manila Inter-Institutional Consortium).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/linkages/links.asp | publisher=De La Salle University | title = Linkages with International Organizations | accessdate = 2011-05-14[/tpl]
DLSU is identified by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as a "Center of Excellence" in six of its programs, and a "Center of Development" in 3 of its programs.[tpl]cite web | url = http://202.57.63.198/chedwww/index.php/eng/content/download/1125/6417/file/List_of_COEs-CODs_asof_04Oct2010.ods | title = List of Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development | publisher=Commission on Higher Education | accessdate = 2011-05-14 | date = 2010-10-04[/tpl] The university is also among the 40 institutions granted autonomous status by CHED as of 2010.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=582119&publicationSubCategoryId=108 | newspaper=The Philippine Star | title = CHED grants autonomous status to CDU | author=Jessica B.

Research is mainly funded by the De La Salle University Science Foundation. Since 2000, DLSU has been the CHED Zonal Research Center for 10 cities in southern Metro Manila. As such, it evaluates research proposals for recommendation for CHED funding, and monitoring of CHED-funded researches, among others. DLSU research has focused on affective computing and renewable energy. Application of its research has resulted to electrification of remote areas in the country through the use of micro hydro generators, and the creation of both of the only two solar cars of the Philippines, SINAG and SIKAT.
DLSU has four official student publications, including the Ang Pahayagang Plaridel, The LaSallian (a student newspaper) and Green & White, the university yearbook publication. The De La Salle University Chorale has won several awards from different international choir competitions, including the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and Tampere Vocal Music Festival. It is a member of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines since 1986, and has formed rivalries with other universities, including the Ateneo de Manila University and University of Santo Tomas.
People affiliated with the De La Salle University include one National Artist of the Philippines, Archbishops of Manila and prominent politicians, educators, scientists, business tycoons, singers, actors, TV personalities and the field of communication and public service.

==History==

DLSU traces its founding to Manila Archbishop Jeremiah James Harty. Harty believed that the establishment of a La Salle school in Manila is instrumental in preempting the spread of Protestantism in the Philippines through the arrival of the Thomasites.[tpl]Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003–06 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = 2003-06-26 | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | location = Manila[/tpl] His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by the Pope Pius X. An envoy of Lasallian Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus. A [tpl]convert|13000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] property in Paco, Manila was purchased for this purpose.[tpl]cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/#page=page-1 | title = The founding (1911–1920): Prologue: A Harty Request | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl]

===Early history===

De La Salle College was established as an elementary school and high school for boys on June 16, 1911 by the three Lasallian Brothers (namely Blimond Pierre Eilenbecker, Aloysius Gonzaga McGiverin and Augusto Correge) who arrived in Manila[tpl]cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/#page=page-2 | title = The founding (1911–1920): The House on Nozaleda Street | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family[/tpl] on March 1911.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/317028/dlsu-through-100-seasons-mission-and-learning | title = DLSU through 100 seasons of mission and learning | newspaper=Manila Bulletin | date = 2011-05-06 | author=Rachel C. Barawid | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl] Classes started on the same day with 125 students. This number would reach 175 by July 10.[tpl]cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/#page=page-3 | title = The founding (1911–1920): School Year 1911–1912 | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family[/tpl]
On February 12, 1912, the college was incorporated under the sole ownership of the college director, who was then Eilenbecker. The college was permitted to confer commercial high school diplomas in the same year. Meanwhile, it received a charter from the Governor-General of the Philippines, allowing the college to confer associate's degrees in commerce.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history.html | title = History: 1910 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl] It started offering the degree as a two-year program in 1920.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1920.html | title = History: 1920 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl]
The college already had 425 students by 1921. Due to the lack of space in the Paco campus, and the growing population of its student and faculty, the college moved to its present location in Malate, Manila on February 12.
In 1931, the College discontinued its two-year program in commerce in favor of a three-year Bachelor of Science in Commerce program, which was approved a year earlier.

===Second World War===

De La Salle College served as a shelter for displaced civilians and wounded soldiers during the Second World War. It was, however, occupied by the Japanese forces, and made into a defense quarters on January 2, 1942. Repeated bombings severely damaged the campus. Despite this, classes continued. De La Salle students shared classes with students from other schools that had closed because of the war, while the American Brothers had left. Meanwhile, high school classes were transferred to St. Scholastica's College in 1943.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1940.html | title = History: 1940 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/taftavenue.html#page=page-3 | title = Taft Avenue (1921–1945): War comes to Manila | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family[/tpl]
Classes were eventually discontinued. On February 1, 1945, Japanese forces ordered the occupants of the college and surrounding vicinities to vacate the college. However, Egbert Xavier Kelly, the president of the college, refused. On February 7, Kelly was abducted by the Japanese, and was never found again; he is believed to have been tortured and killed. Around 20 Japanese soldiers came to the campus on February 12 shortly after noontime, and massacred 16 of the 17 Brothers residing in the campus, along with 25 other residents. Only one Brother (Antonius von Jesus) and 21 other civilians survived the event.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/2401/20080211.pdf | title= Our Martyrs | author=Andrew Gonzales FSC | author2 = Alejandro T.

===Post-war period===

Classes resumed on July 1945, with a class of incoming freshmen that was composed of 60 high school graduates. One year later, the College of Commerce reopened with its 3-year BS Commerce program extended to 4-year program. Later, the High School Department of De La Salle College was dissolved in 1968. The college, together with Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines Diliman, gave birth to the Asian Institute of Management in the same year with assistance from the Ford Foundation and Harvard University.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1960.html | title = History: 1960 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl][tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.aim.edu/index.php/historical-highlights.html | title = History | publisher=Asian Institute of Management | accessdate = 2011-05-15[/tpl] Several other units were established in the following years.
1970s marked substantial developments for De La Salle College. For instance, it started admitting female students in 1973. On February 19, 1975, De La Salle College was granted university status. Since then it became known as De La Salle University. It also used the name De La Salle University – Manila.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/2401/20080811.pdf | date = 2008-08-11 | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | journal=2401 | page = 2 | title = Official name of the university | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | location = Manila[/tpl] Since 2008, it has since referred to itself only as De La Salle University, being its registered name in the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/legalities/trademark_policy.asp | title = Legalities | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] Meanwhile, the Grade School Department was deprecated in 1978.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1970.html | title = History: 1970 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-06-15[/tpl]
1980s was also as significant. In 1981, De La Salle University shifted from the traditional semestral academic calendar to a trimestral one. In 1987, the university, together with four other Lasallian institutions, became part of the De La Salle University System.[tpl]cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1980.html | title = History: 1980 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] The system would later be dissolved in favor of De La Salle Philippines, a network of 18 Lasallian institutions. Meanwhile, De La Salle – College of Saint Benilde became independent of the university in 1988.

===Recent history===

An explosion occurred at the DLSU portion of Taft Avenue on September 26, 2010 around 5:05 pm PST, the same day as the Philippine Bar exams conducted by the university.[tpl]Cite news| title = Blast rocks end of bar exams at DLSU; 35 hurt | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20100926-294437/Blast-rocks-end-of-bar-exams-at-DLSU-35-hurt | author=DJ Yap | newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer | date = 2010-09-26 | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] The explosive, an Mk 2 grenade, was allegedly detonated by Anthony Leal Nepomuceno who was indicted by the Philippine Department of Justice on April 29, 2011.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=680638&publicationSubCategoryId=92 | title = La Salle 'bomber' kasuhan! – DOJ | language = Tagalog | author=Doris Franche | date = 2011-04-29 | newspaper=Pilipino Star Ngayon | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] The blast injured 47 individuals,[tpl]cite news | url = http://balita.ph/2010/10/27/doj-confident-prime-suspect-in-de-la-salle-blast-will-be-arrested/ | title = DOJ confident prime suspect in De La Salle blast will be arrested | date = 2010-10-27 | agency=Philippine News Agency | newspaper=Balita | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] and resulted to the amputation of two victims.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.english.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20100928-students-legs-amputated-after-manila-student-bombing | title = Students’ legs amputated after Manila bombing | date = 2010-09-08 | publisher=Radio France International | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl]

==Campus==

===Manila Campus (Taft)===

The DLSU campus consists of 19 buildings (nine classroom buildings and 10 other buildings for administrative and auxiliary functions) located on a [tpl]convert|5.45|ha|acre|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] lot in 2401 Taft Avenue Malate, Manila. DLSU faces to its right the Taft Campus of De La Salle – College of Saint Benilde, another DLSP institution, and the Vito Cruz Station of the Manila LRT Yellow Line. As part of the University Belt, several other colleges and universities, including St. Scholastica's College and Philippine Women's University, can be found near to the campus.
The buildings have a combined floor area of [tpl]convert|136685.98|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl], and mostly feature neoclassical design. These include:
Construction of the Henry Sy Sr. Hall began on December 2, 2010 as part of the university's Centennial Renewal Plan, a project that aims to construct and renovate facilities inside the campus. A 15-floor building,[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/2401/20100816.pdf | title = Crossroads for campus activities | page = 3 | journal=2401 | date = 2010-06-16 | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | volume = 42 | number = 6 | location = Manila | publisher=De La Salle University[/tpl] it replaced DLSU's football field with plans for completion by December 2012.[tpl]cite news | url = http://thelasallian.com/2010/12/30/its-really-happening-centennial-building-construction-commenced/ | title = It’s really happening: Centennial Building construction, commenced | author=Jan-Ace Mendoza | date = 2010-12-30 | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl] It is estimated to cost ₱1.4 billion (US$32.5 million).[tpl]cite news | url = http://thelasallian.com/2010/11/21/presenting-our-usg-officers/ | title = Presenting… our USG officers! | newspaper=The LaSallian | author=Jessy Go | date = 2010-11-21 | accessdate = 2011-05-18 | location = Manila[/tpl] In line with this, DLSU entered an eight-year agreement with the Philippine Sports Commission. Under the contract, DLSU will fund the ₱7.4 million (US$171,000)Approximate conversion value as of May 2011 renovation of the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium. DLSU will get to use the facilities in return.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gmanews.tv/story/183504/rizal-memorial-football-field-up-for-renovtion | title = Rizal Memorial football field up for renovation | date = 2010-09-02 | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | publisher=GMA News[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bandera.ph/mainitinitpa/mainitinitpa/view/20100508-9056/PSC-La-Salle-forge-deal | title = PSC, La Salle forge deal | newspaper=Bandera | author=Mike Lee | date = 2010-05-08 | accessdate = 2011-05-16 | location = Manila[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideSports.htm?f=2010/february/4/sports4.isx&d=2010/february/4 | title = La Salle eyes football field at Rizal arena | author=Peter Atencio | date = 2010-02-14 | newspaper=Manila Standard Today | accessdate = 2011-05-16[/tpl]
The campus, which is relatively small in size for its large student population, suffers limited space. According to The LaSallian each student had only [tpl]convert|7.1|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] for himself in 2009. Crowding is expected to only get worse as the university's population has been continuously growing with the growth for 2008–2009 amounting to 27.7 percent. It has also expressed concerns regarding fire safety, citing possible evacuation difficulties should a fire occur at the Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall, and accessibility issues for fire trucks given the lack of wide roads to major buildings. At least three fires has occurred in the campus, including two at St. Joseph Hall.[tpl]cite news | url = http://thelasallian.com/2010/11/21/i-don’t-want-to-die/ | title = I don’t want to die | author=Audrey Virgula | date = 2010-11-21 | accessdate = 2011-05-17 | newspaper=The LaSallian | location = Manila[/tpl] To address the problem regarding limited space, DLSU has resolved to vertical expansion. But this has resulted to overcrowded elevators.

===Binan Campus (Science and Technology Complex)===

The De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex (DLSU-STC) is a satellite campus of De La Salle University (DLSU) located in Biñan City, Laguna, Philippines. The 55-hectare campus was built on land donated by the family of the late National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin. It was originally known as De La Salle Canlubang (DLSC), a district school of De La Salle Philippines that provided science and technology-based primary, secondary, and tertiary education. In 2012, the administrations of DLSU and DLSC approved the integration of DLSC to DLSU, becoming the DLSU Science and Technology Complex.
Although smaller (5 ha; 2 acres), only [tpl]convert|0.6|ha|acre|abbr=on[/tpl] of DLSC's campus is developed. Under the proposal, DLSU would expand the Colleges of Engineering, Computer Studies and Science to DLSC's campus due to its location inside the Laguna Technopark.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/announcements/default.asp?id=2166 | title = DLSU-DLSC Proposed Merger | publisher=De La Salle University | date = 2011-02-14 | author=Br. Ricardo P. Laguda FSC | accessdate = 2011-05-17[/tpl] DLSU fears, however, that it might lose some of its students due to the DLSC campus's distance from Manila (around 42 km).

===Makati Campus===

The Makati Campus is an extension campus of DLSU located in RCBC Plaza, Ayala Avenue, Makati City, Philippines. The campus primarily serves the university's Graduate School of Business students.

===Ortigas Campus===

In 2011, the Ortigas Campus of DLSU Ramon V. Del Rosario College of Business moved from La Salle Green Hills in Mandaluyong City to Ortigas Business District. The university offers its graduate programs in an extension campus in Wynsum Corporate Plaza, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, Philippines.

===Bonifacio Global City Campus===

In September 2013, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has awarded to De La Salle University the lease and development of a 1,395 square-meter institutional lot in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig City. DLSU is set to sign contract with BCDA on October 2013.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.tribune.net.ph/index.php/metro-section/item/19362-bcda-awards-last-lot-in-bgc-institutional-area-to-dlsu | title = BCDA awards last lot in BGC institutional area to DLSU | date = 2013-09-22 | newspaper=The Daily Tribiune | accessdate = 2013-09-22[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/09/21/13/dlsu-wins-bid-bonifacio-lot | title = DLSU wins bid for Bonifacio lot | date = 2013-09-21 | newspaper=ABS-CBN News | accessdate = 2013-09-22[/tpl]

==Organization and administration==

As an non-stock incorporated entity, DLSU is headed by a 15-person board of trustees.[tpl]cite book | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000921/092199eo.pdf | title = Change from a semester to a trimester system at the De La Salle University, Philippines | author=Oscar Bautista | author2 = Victor Ordoñez | author3 = Bikas C.

Estrada, selects the DLSU President. As resolved by the Board of Trustees on June 2010, the president of De La Salle University must be a Lasallian Brother and be a holder of a PhD. Filipino citizenship is not a must but preferred. Prior to the university's move to its present location in 1921, the president was referred to as the director.
