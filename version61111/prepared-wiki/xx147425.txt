In 1988, Planckaert enjoyed perhaps his best year by capturing the green jersey (points competition) at the 1988 Tour de France and winning the Tour of Flanders. In 1990, he won Paris–Roubaix, his second monumental classic, with the closest finish in the race's history beating Canadian Steve Bauer by less than a cm.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/449472/cycle-sport-s-classic-race-1990-paris-roubaix.html|title=Cycle Sport's Classic Race: 1990 Paris-Roubaix|work=Cycling weekly|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=23 April 2012|first=Lionel|last=Birnie[/tpl] More than 10 years after his cycling career, the former racer got back into the public eye with a long running reality TV show about his family life, on Vtm.
