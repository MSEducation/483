He was one of the translators of the Bishops' Bible. 
Anne Barne Lovelace married as her second husband, on 20 January 1630, at Greenwich, England, the Very Rev. Dr. Jonathan BrowneJonathan Browne, Doctor of Laws. Browne matriculated at Gloucester Hall, Oxford 13 October 1620, aged19, and received the degree of B. C. L. 1624/5, D. C. L. 1630 and L. L. D.

In 1629, when Lovelace was eleven, he went to Sutton’s Foundation at Charterhouse School, then located in London. However, there is not a clear record that Lovelace actually attended because it is believed that he studied as a "boarder" because he did not need financial assistance like the "scholars". He spent five years at Charterhouse, three of which were spent with Richard Crashaw, who also became a poet. On 5 May 1631, Lovelace was sworn in as a "Gentleman Wayter Extraordinary" to the King. This was an "honorary position for which one paid a fee". He then went on to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1634.

==Collegiate career==

Richard Lovelace attended the University of Oxford and was praised by one of his contemporaries, Anthony Wood.Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 131: Seventeenth-Century British Nondramatic Poets, Third Series. A Bruccoli Clark Layman Book. Edited by M. Thomas Hester, North Carolina State University. The Gale Group, 1993. pp. 123-133 for being "the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld; a person also of innate modesty, virtue and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially after, when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the female sex"   At the age of eighteen, during a three-week celebration at Oxford, he was granted the degree of Master of Arts.  While at school, he tried to portray himself more as a social connoisseur rather than a scholar, continuing his image of being a Cavalier.“The Early Seventeenth Century" The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Sixteenth Century, The Early Seventeenth Century. Ed. Barbara K. Lewalski and Katharine Eisaman Maus.  New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2006. 1681-1682.  Being a Cavalier poet, Lovelace wrote to praise a friend or fellow poet, to give advice in grief or love, to define a relationship, to articulate the precise amount of attention a man owes a woman, to celebrate beauty, and to persuade to love.  Lovelace wrote a comedy, The Scholars, while at Oxford. He then left for the University of Cambridge for a few months where he met Lord Goring, who led him into political trouble.

==Politics and prison==

Lovelace’s poetry was often influenced by his experiences with politics and association with important figures of his time.  At the age of thirteen, Lovelace became a "Gentlemen Wayter Extraordinary" to the King and at nineteen he contributed a verse to a volume of elegies commemorating Princess Katharine.Wilkinson, C.h., ed. The Poems of Richard Lovelace. Oxford, Great Britain: Oxford, 1963. In 1639 Lovelace joined the regiment of Lord Goring, serving first as a senior ensign and later as a captain in the Bishops’ Wars. This experience inspired the "Sonnet. To Generall Goring", the poem "To Lucasta, Going to the Warres" and the tragedy The Soldier. Upon his return to his home in Kent in 1640, Lovelace served as a country gentleman and a justice of the peace where he encountered firsthand the civil turmoil regarding religion and politics.
In 1641 Lovelace led a group of men to seize and destroy a petition for the abolition of Episcopal rule, which had been signed by fifteen thousand people.  The following year he presented the House of Commons with Dering’s pro-Royalist petition which was supposed to have been burned.  These actions resulted in Lovelace’s first imprisonment. Shortly thereafter, he was released on bail with the stipulation that he avoid communication with the House of Commons without permission. This prevented Lovelace, who had done everything to prove himself during the Bishops’ Wars, from participating in the first phase of the English Civil War. However, this first experience of imprisonment did result in some good, as it brought him to write one of his finest and most beloved lyrics, "To Althea, from Prison," in which he illustrates his noble and paradoxical nature. Lovelace did everything he could to remain in the king’s favor despite his inability to participate in the war.
Richard Lovelace did his part again during the political chaos of 1648, though it is unclear specifically what his actions were.  He did, however, manage to warrant himself another prison sentence; this time for nearly a year.  When he was released in April 1649, the king had been executed and Lovelace’s cause seemed lost.  As in his previous incarceration, this experience led to creative production—this time in the form of spiritual freedom, as reflected in the release of his first volume of poetry, "Lucasta".

==Literature==

Richard Lovelace first started writing while he was a student at Oxford and wrote almost 200 poems from that time until his death. His first work was a drama titled The Scholars. The play was never published; however, it was performed at college and then in London. In 1640, he wrote a tragedy titled The Soldier which was based on his own military experience. When serving in the Bishops' Wars, he wrote the sonnet "To Generall Goring," which is a poem of Bacchanalian celebration rather than a glorification of military action. One of his extremely famous poems is "To Lucasta, Going to the Warres," written in 1640 and exposed in his first political action. During his first imprisonment in 1642, he wrote his most famous poem "To Althea, From Prison." Later on that year during his travels to Holland with General Goring, he wrote "The Rose," following with "The Scrutiny" and on 14 May 1649, "Lucasta" was published. He also wrote poems analyzing the details of many simple insects. "The Ant," 'The Grasse-hopper," "The Snayl," "The Falcon," "The Toad and Spyder." Of these poems, "The Grasse-hopper" is his most well-known. In 1660, after Lovelace died, "Lucasta: Postume Poems" was published; it contains "A Mock-Song," which has a much darker tone than his previous works.
William Winstanley, who praised much of Richard Lovelace's works, thought highly of him and compared him to an idol; "I can compare no Man so like this Colonel Lovelace as Sir Philip Sidney,” of which it is in an Epitaph made of him;
His most quoted excerpts are from the beginning of the last stanza of "To Althea, From Prison":
and the end of "To Lucasta. Going to the Warres":
