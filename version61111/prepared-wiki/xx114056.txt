"The Land of Make Believe" is a 1981 single by British band Bucks Fizz. It reached No.1 in the UK in early 1982 - the second single by the band to do so. The song was produced by Andy Hill with music by Hill and lyrics by ex-King Crimson member Peter Sinfield. Despite the apparent sugar-coated style of the song, Sinfield later claimed it was a subtle attack on Margaret Thatcher and her government's policy at the time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Peter_Sinfield_in_Modern_Dance |title= Pete Sinfield discusses his work with Bucks Fizz |author= Elephant-talk|accessdate=2008-05-11 [/tpl] The song was later covered by pop band allSTARS* for a 2002 single release.

==Overview==

===Song information===

"The Land of Make Believe" was the second of three UK #1 singles for the British Eurovision winners Bucks Fizz, staying at the top for two weeks in January 1982. It remained on the charts for 16 weeks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=9689|title= "The Land of Make Believe" UK Chart details |author=Chartstats|accessdate=2008-08-08 [/tpl]
The lyrics are based on a child's dream where ghostly voices lure the child outside to a world where everything is bright and happy, but the child resists. Characters, Superman and Captain Kidd are referenced in the lyrics. The close of the song features a nursery rhyme narrated by Abby Kimber, who was the 11-year old daughter of Bill Kimber, an executive of RCA Records. This was an original piece, penned by Sinfield, and read:
 
 "I've got a friend who comes to tea,

And no-one else can see but me,

He came today, but had to go

To visit you? You never know!"

At the time, radio stations were instructed to fade the song before the narration.Record Mirror, "Sex of One", January 1982
During the recording member Mike Nolan expressed reservations for the song and told producer Andy Hill that it would not be a hit and probably the end for the band. Hill however told Nolan that Bobby G and Cheryl Baker had already recorded their parts of the song and had said that they really liked it. Nolan later admitted that his judgement was obviously wrong.Bucks Fizz Story'', Glassbeach Media DVD, 2009 Bobby G spent an afternoon recording harmonies for the middle 8 of the song, but after he left the studio, the engineer accidentally wiped the tape and the vocal part was never re-recorded.

===Music video===

The music video was filmed at White City, London swimming baths and is a parody of many childhood stories. It begins in a black and white bedroom, with member Cheryl Baker waking up, and in reference to the film The Wizard of Oz the picture changes to colour, and Baker's clothes are transformed by a Fairy Godmother in the style of Cinderella. She then walks from everyday life, through a gap into a winter wonderland and has to push her way through fir trees, in reference to "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe", before joining the rest of the band on stage.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bucksfizzearlyyears.co.uk/landbelieve.htm |title= "The Land of Make Believe" video shots |author=Bucks Fizz - the early years|accessdate=2008-09-12 [/tpl] 
The remainder of the video consists of the group performing the song, intercut with brief fantastical scenes. The costumes the group wore in the video were subsequently used in television appearances for the song and many photo-shoots. Member Jay Aston chose the outfits, with the female costumes from Kahn & Bell on London's King's Road and the male costumes from Boy. They cost between £50 and £120 each.Number One Magazine, "Making Their Clothes Up" - Jay Aston interview, January 1984 Aston has since remarked that it was one of her favourite looks for the band and in reference to hers and Baker's costume said "we were ten years ahead of Madonna with the cone boobs". British disc jockey Mark Goodier who became famous in the late 1980s features as an extra in the video.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

"The Land of Make Believe" remains a firm fan favourite and reviews in the press at the time were positive with Smash Hits calling the song "sheer genius" and more recently Q Magazine labelling the song "not half bad" and "an 80s classic".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bucksfizzearlyyears.co.uk/top404.htm |title= Fans top 40, 2007 |author=Bucks Fizz - the early years|accessdate=2009-02-11 [/tpl]Smash Hits, December 1986 ("Keep Each Other Warm" review)Q Magazine, October 2000, (Are You Ready re-issue review)Q Magazine, April 2001 Members Bobby G and Cheryl Baker have both named it as the best of their own songs.

"The Land of Make Believe" was many times used as the closing number of Bucks Fizz's concerts. During their 1984 tour a lighting effect to simulate falling snow was used to signify the festive feel of the song due to its Christmas-time release. The song was later included on the group's second album, Are You Ready and was later released in a remixed form in 1991 as a bootleg single. A similar version of this was included on a compilation album released in 2005, while a more recent remix of the song was featured on the group's 2008 album, The Lost Masters 2 - The Final Cut. The B-Side of the single was a ballad, "Now You're Gone" featuring lead vocals by Cheryl Baker. The song features the chorus line; "It doesn't feel like Christmas now you're gone" and remains the only festive-themed song recorded by the group. An alternate ending to this song was featured as a hidden track on The Lost Masters 2 - The Final Cut.
