==Creation and conception==

In an interview in Shōnen Jump's Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto claimed that he enjoys drawing Lee more than any other character in the series. When designing Lee's appearance, Kishimoto intended to have Lee wield a variety of weapons, including nunchaku; however, due to time constraints while creating the series, he was unable to do so.[tpl]cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9 |page=130[/tpl] Kishimoto has noted that he originally designed Lee to symbolize human weakness; Kishimoto's design of Sakura Haruno was also intended to carry the same symbolism. Due to the popularity Lee garnered over the course of the series, Kishimoto tends to place him towards the front of promotional artwork in which he appears.[tpl]cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media|isbn=1-4215-1407-9 |page=133[/tpl]
