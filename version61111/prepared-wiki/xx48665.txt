CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods of Oslo, Majorstuen

Majorstuen or Majorstua is an affluent neighbourhood in the Frogner borough in the western part of Oslo, Norway.
Majorstuen is known for its vibrant downtown, especially its shopping area. The area has several elegant townhouses circa 1880-1890. The area is also an important public transport junction in Oslo, where all metro lines, three tram lines and five bus lines operate. It is served by Majorstuen station.

==The name==

The neighborhood was named after a well-known public house which was located on the east side of Sørkedalsveien. Dating from the 1700s, the house was named for the Major Michael Wilhelm Sundt (dead 1759).  The last element is the finite form of stue 'cabin, house with one single room'.
There has long been a quarrel about the forms Majorstuen and Majorstua - stuen is the finite form when stue is treated as a masculine, and stua is the finite form when it is treated as a feminine word. The original pronunciation was -stua (Norwegian feminine inflection),http://www.edd.uio.no/perl/search/objectviewer.cgi?tabid=1383&primarykey=8625 but since Danish was the only written language in Norway well into the 19th century, the name was written -stuen (Danish common gender inflection). The locals say Majorstuen and the local borough council has also adopted this as the official name of the area. (For a similar conflict see > Akerselva)

==Majorstuen  Station==

Majorstuen station (Majorstuen stasjon) is the last common point for all subway lines on the western side of Oslo. The station was opened in 1898 as the terminus for Holmenkollbanen. It remained so until Smestadbanen was completed in 1912. In 1928 the tunnel to the National Theatre station (called the Underground Railway) was built.  The original station building was built in 1916, when  Tryvandsbanen  was completed. It was designed by Erik Glosimodt who also designed a number of shelters and station buildings along Holmenkollbanen. It had two entrances, one for Holmenkollbanen, and one for  Smestadbanen. When the work of underground track started, the station was destroyed. The  current Majorstuen station darted to 1930 and was  designed by  Kristoffer Lange.Erik Waldemar Glosimodt  (Norske arkitekter)
