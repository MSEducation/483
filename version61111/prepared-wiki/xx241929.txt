The LG Versa (VX9600) is a mobile phone for use on the Verizon Wireless network. Like the LG Dare VX-9700, the Versa has a full touch screen and onscreen QWERTY keyboard. The Vers also accepts handwriting recognition or gesture control for entering phone numbers and typing. The phone includes a HTML mobile web web browser, a built-in MP3 music player, access to Verizon Wireless's VCAST multimedia services, and mobile e-mail services. The phone includes a 3.2-inch digital camera with zoom, autofocus, and flash. The phone also had a built-in camcorder. An expandable MicroSD card slot is included into the phone, though no MicroSD card is pre-installed into the device. The difference between the LG Dare and the Versa is that the Versa featured a unique, foldout QWERTY keyboard that was detachable. Originally included with the Versa, the QWERTY keyboard was no longer included and only available as an accessory at Verizon Wireless retail stores. The attachment also included send and end call keys so that the user could answer an incoming call even with the flip closed. The attachment also included an integrated LED display screen that displayed information such as the currently-playing music track, current time, current date, signal strength, type of CDMA signal (1X or 3G) that the phone was currently operating on, the network provider's name, and who is calling, should an incoming call come through when the case is attached and closed.
