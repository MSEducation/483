===Arts and entertainment===

Whitehorse's Yukon Arts Centre offers all varieties of shows and artists and includes an art gallery.
The Frantic Follies Vaudeville Revue was established in 1970 and has been a major tourist draw ever since. Recreating an 1890's style goldrush era vaudeville show, The Frantic Follies includes barbershop quartet, sketches, marching band, banjo and saw orchestral numbers as well as kickline dancing girls. In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge.
By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Twice the show travelled to Alert, the Canadian Forces Station four hundred miles from the North Pole.
In 1976, the Company undertook to produce not only the Whitehorse show, but the entertainment in Dawson City's Palace Grand Theatre and Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Casino. At the end of the 1980 season they left Dawson City. In January 1981, the show joined the "Snow Birds" for a season and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, for a four-month run. The fall of 1990 saw the Frantic Follies taking to the road again as ambassadors for the Yukon in a whirlwind tour, performing in ten Canadian and American cities in a little over two weeks. The Frantic Follies currently perform nightly shows in the summer season at the Westmark Hotel in Downtown Whitehorse.
Plays are also performed at the Guild Hall in Porter Creek, and downtown Whitehorse's Wood Street Centre offers smaller local productions. Whitehorse's arts and entertainment schedule is non-stop throughout the year, not only with local events and celebrations but Whitehorse also plays host to several major festivals which attract artists from all over Canada and internationally, including the Sourdough Rendezvous' Ice Sculpture contest,[tpl]cite web|title=Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous|url=http://www.yukonrendezvous.com/|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] the Frostbite Music Festival,[tpl]cite web|title=Frostbite Music Festival|url=http://www.frostbitefest.ca/|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] the Yukon International Storytelling Festival, and the Available Light Film Festival.[tpl]cite web|title=Available Light Film Festival|url=http://www.yukonfilmsociety.com/alff/|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl]
