Tsang began his civil service career in 1967, occupying various positions in finance and trade in the Hong Kong Civil Service, and was appointed Financial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1995, becoming the first ethnic Hong Konger to hold the position under British administration.[tpl]cite news|title=A Rarity in Hong Kong: Budget Is in Deficit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/07/business/a-rarity-in-hong-kong-budget-is-in-deficit.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 March 1996|agency=Reuters[/tpl] He remained in that position after the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong before being appointed Chief Secretary for Administration after the resignation of Anson Chan. Tsang was praised for his handling of the Hong Kong economy both as Chief Executive in the mid-2000s and as Financial Secretary in the late 1990s.BBC Profile: Donald Tsang Tsang was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in June 1997 hours before the handover.Tsang was a Commonwealth citizen (specifically, British Dependent Territories Citizen) at the time his honour was conferred, so his membership in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is substantive and not honorary. Although an ordinary KBE is entitled to style himself as 'Sir', Tsang did not use the title in his official capacity http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E0DF1230F935A25751C0A9679C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tsang,%20Donald,http://www.economist.com/background/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9359174. Like other Hong Kong officials, he appeared on Hong Kong Government publications and websites as "The Honourable Donald TSANG, GBM" without the title 'Sir' http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2004/en/app_01.htm. The British Government states it has no policy on the use of Donald Tsang's title, which derives from the KBE status awarded to him in 1997 for his 30-year service to Hong Kong and that it is for the individual concerned to decide whether they use or wish to be known by their title. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050712/text/50712w09.htm#50712w09.html_sbhd3http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4091570.
He assumed the office of Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2005. After his appointment, he was criticised for the government's mishandling of a number of incidents, most notably the demolition of Queen's Pier, Political Appointments System, the Leung Chin-man appointment controversy, and the Employee Retraining Levy waiver controversy.

===Bow ties===

Tsang is well known for his preference of wearing bow-ties. His nickname, Bow-Tie Tsang, is widely known among Hongkongers. According to a television interview, this preference started somewhere between 1988–1993, when Tsang's office was adjacent to Deputy Political Adviser Stephen Bradley, who himself wore bow-ties. Tsang felt comfortable with a bow-tie Bradley gave him, saying that its design brings fewer hurdles to its wearer than a necktie.Episode 17, Be My Guest, originally broadcast on 23 September 2006  His penchant for wearing bow-ties and fondness of keeping koi has been portrayed by Chinese contemporary artist Lee Shi-min in the work Hua Koi Tie (2008).

==Government service==

Tsang joined the Hong Kong Civil Service in January 1967, and held positions in many different government departments, ranging from finance, trade to policies relating to the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China.
From 1981 to 1982, Tsang studied in the United States, where he completed a Master of Public Administration at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He has also received honorary doctorates from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the University of Hong Kong.
He was attached to the Asian Development Bank in Manila in 1977 for a year and worked on water supply and railway development projects in the Philippines and Bangladesh.
As Deputy Secretary of the General Duties Branch between 1985 and 1989, Tsang was responsible for the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the promotion of the British Nationality Selection Scheme. He served as Director-General of Trade between 1991 and 1993, and was responsible for all facets of trade negotiation and administration affecting Hong Kong. In May 1993, he was promoted to Secretary for the Treasury, where he was responsible for the overall allocation of resources, the taxation system and the cost effectiveness of the Hong Kong government.
In September 1995, Tsang was appointed Financial Secretary, becoming the first ethnic Chinese to hold the position. He was made a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1997 for his long-time service to Hong Kong, and he was knighted by Prince Charles at Government House hours before the handover. Tsang was also awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal by the Hong Kong Government in June 2002.  During his term as Financial Secretary, Hong Kong's public spending grew steadily as public revenue remained robust and government budget in surplus.  Public expenditure to GDP rose to as high as 23%, though still the lowest among developed economies.  He also approved a raise in civil servants' salaries at the beginning of the Asian economic crisis.  The salary raise was finally reversed, aligning civil servants' salaries to 1997 levels.
During his six-year tenure, he steered Hong Kong through the Asian financial crisis that swept across the region in 1997 and 1998. He worked with Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and waged war on speculators attacking the Hong Kong currency peg.
On 1 May 2001 former Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan resigned, citing personal reasons.  Tung then appointed Tsang to become the Chief Secretary and invited a civil service outsider, Antony Leung, to take up the post of Financial Secretary.
As Chief Secretary, Tsang ranked second to the then Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, advising him on matters of policy and deputising for him during his absence. He was also a member of Tung's inner cabinet, the Executive Council, which is also the highest policy-making body in Hong Kong. He assumed the post of acting Chief Executive when Tung's resignation was approved by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on 12 March 2005.
Tsang's identity as a civil servant ended in mid-2002, when the POAS, or ministerial system, was introduced in the territory. He carried on his duty as the Chief Secretary, but was no longer a civil servant. Under the POAS all secretaries are selected by the Chief Executive and do not have to be civil servants.
