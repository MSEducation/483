In 1987, he published a demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.Cohen, Fred, An Undetectable Computer Virus (Archived), 1987, IBM
In 1987 the first two heuristic antivirus utilities were released: Flushot Plus by Ross Greenberg and Anti4us by Erwin Lanting. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Also in 1988 a mailing list named VIRUS-LVIRUS-L mailing list archive was started on the BITNET/EARN network where new viruses and the possibilities of detecting and eliminating viruses were discussed. Some members of this mailing list like John McAfee or Eugene Kaspersky later founded software companies that developed and sold commercial antivirus software.
Before internet connectivity was widespread, viruses were typically spread by infected floppy disks. Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially had to check executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks. However, as internet usage became common, viruses began to spread online.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/media/press-releases/viewnews?noticia=4974&entorno=&ver=&pagina=&producto=|title = (II) Evolution of computer viruses|accessdate = 2009-06-20|last = Panda Security|authorlink = |date=April 2004[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Over the years it has become necessary for antivirus software to check an increasing variety of files, rather than just executables, for several reasons:
As always-on broadband connections became the norm, and more and more viruses were released, it became essential to update virus checkers more and more frequently. Even then, a new zero-day virus could become widespread before antivirus companies released an update to protect against it.

==Identification method==

One of the few solid theoretical results in the study of computer viruses is Frederick B. Cohen's 1987 demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.
There are several methods which antivirus software can use to identify malware:

===Signature-based detection===

Traditionally, antivirus software heavily relied upon signatures to identify malware. This can be very effective, but cannot defend against malware unless samples have already been obtained and signatures created. Because of this, signature-based approaches are not effective against new, unknown viruses.
As new viruses are being created each day, the signature-based detection approach requires frequent updates of the virus signature dictionary. To assist the antivirus software companies, the software may allow the user to upload new viruses or variants to the company, allowing the virus to be analyzed and the signature added to the dictionary.
Although the signature-based approach can effectively contain virus outbreaks, virus authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing "oligomorphic", "polymorphic" and, more recently, "metamorphic" viruses, which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise, so as to not match virus signatures in the dictionary.[tpl]Harvnb|Szor|2005|pp=252–288[/tpl]

===Heuristics===

Some more sophisticated antivirus software uses heuristic analysis to identify new malware or variants of known malware.
Many viruses start as a single infection and through either mutation or refinements by other attackers, can grow into dozens of slightly different strains, called variants. Generic detection refers to the detection and removal of multiple threats using a single virus definition.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.securelist.com/en/glossary?glossid=189210517|title=Generic detection |accessdate=2013-07-11 |work= |publisher=Kaspersky |date= [/tpl]
For example, the Vundo trojan has several family members, depending on the antivirus vendor's classification. Symantec classifies members of the Vundo family into two distinct categories, Trojan.Vundo and Trojan.Vundo.B.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-112111-3912-99|title = Trojan.Vundo|accessdate = 2009-04-14|last = Symantec Corporation|authorlink = |date=February 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090409002645/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-112111-3912-99| archivedate= 9 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-042810-2611-99|title = Trojan.Vundo.B|accessdate = 2009-04-14|last = Symantec Corporation|authorlink = |date=February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090427160747/http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2005-042810-2611-99| archivedate= 27 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
While it may be advantageous to identify a specific virus, it can be quicker to detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain non-contiguous code, using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,1154648,00.asp |title=Antivirus Research and Detection Techniques |accessdate=2009-02-24 |work= |publisher= ExtremeTech|date= | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090227002351/http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,1154648,00.asp| archivedate= 27 February 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] A detection that uses this method is said to be "heuristic detection."

===Rootkit detection===

Anti-virus software can attempt to scan for rootkits; a rootkit is a type of malware that is designed to gain administrative-level control over a computer system without being detected. Rootkits can change how the operating system functions and in some cases can tamper with the anti-virus program and render it ineffective. Rootkits are also difficult to remove, in some cases requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system.Rootkit

===Real-time protection===

Real-time protection, on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield, autoprotect, and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most antivirus, anti-spyware, and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects in 'real-time', in other words while data loaded into the computer's active memory: when inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.Kaspersky Lab Technical Support Portal [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wTrMA7aY|date =2011-02-13[/tpl]

==Issues of concern==

===Unexpected renewal costs===

Some commercial antivirus software end-user license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed, and the purchaser's credit card automatically billed, at the renewal time without explicit approval. For example, McAfee requires users to unsubscribe at least 60 days before the expiration of the present subscription[tpl]cite web|url = http://michaelkelly.blogs.com/buyingdangerously/2006/10/bad_mcafee_on_a.html|title = Buying Dangerously|accessdate = 2009-11-29|last = Kelly|first = Michael|authorlink = |date=October 2006[/tpl] while BitDefender sends notifications to unsubscribe 30 days before the renewal.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.bitdefender.com/site/KnowledgeBase/consumer/#542|title = Automatic Renewal|accessdate = 2009-11-29|last = Bitdefender|authorlink = |year = 2009[/tpl] Norton AntiVirus also renews subscriptions automatically by default.[tpl]cite web|url = https://support.norton.com/sp/en/uk/home/current/solutions/kb20080417115558EN_EndUserProfile_en_us|title = Norton Automatic Renewal Service FAQ|accessdate = 2014-04-09|last = Symantec|authorlink = |year = 2014[/tpl]

===Rogue security applications===

Some apparent antivirus programs are actually malware masquerading as legitimate software, such as WinFixer, MS Antivirus, and Mac Defender.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm|title = Rogue/Suspect Anti-Spyware Products & Web Sites|accessdate = 2009-11-29 |last = SpywareWarrior |authorlink = |year = 2007[/tpl]

===Problems caused by false positives===

A "false positive" is when antivirus software identifies a non-malicious file as a virus.  When this happens, it can cause serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/11/avg-incorrectly-flags-user32-dll-in-windows-xp-sp2sp3.ars|title=AVG incorrectly flags user32.dll in Windows XP SP2/SP3|accessdate=2011-02-24|author=Emil Protalinski|date=November 11, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica[/tpl] Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/security-management/2010/04/27/mcafee-to-compensate-businesses-for-buggy-update-40088779/|title=McAfee to compensate businesses for buggy update|accessdate=2 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20003074-83.html|title=Buggy McAfee update whacks Windows XP PCs|accessdate=2 December 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110113170013/http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-20003074-83.html| archivedate= 13 January 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] For example, in May 2007 a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot.[tpl]cite web|title=Flawed Symantec update cripples Chinese PCs|url=http://news.cnet.com/Flawed-Symantec-update-cripples-Chinese-PCs/2100-1002_3-6186271.html|author=Aaron Tan|publisher=CNET Networks|date=May 24, 2007|accessdate=2009-04-05[/tpl]
Also in May 2007, the executable file required by Pegasus Mail on Windows was falsely detected by Norton AntiVirus as being a Trojan and it was automatically removed, preventing Pegasus Mail from running.

It is sometimes necessary to temporarily disable virus protection when installing major updates such as Windows Service Packs or updating graphics card drivers.[tpl]cite web|url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717|title = Steps to take before you install Windows XP Service Pack 3|accessdate = 2009-11-29|last = Microsoft|authorlink = |date=April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091208074504/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717| archivedate= 8 December 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Active antivirus protection may partially or completely prevent the installation of a major update.  Anti-virus software can cause problems during the installation of an operating system upgrade, e.g. when upgrading to a newer version of Windows "in place" — without erasing the previous version of Windows.  Microsoft recommends that anti-virus software be disabled to avoid conflicts with the upgrade installation process.[ref]

Support issues also exist around antivirus application interoperability with common solutions like SSL VPN remote access and network access control products.Field Notice: FN - 63204 - Cisco Clean Access has Interoperability issue with Symantec Anti-virus - delays Agent start-up These technology solutions often have policy assessment applications which require that an up to date antivirus is installed and running. If the antivirus application is not recognized by the policy assessment, whether because the antivirus application has been updated or because it is not part of the policy assessment library, the user will be unable to connect.

===Effectiveness===

Studies in December 2007 showed that the effectiveness of antivirus software had decreased in the previous year, particularly against unknown or zero day attacks. The computer magazine c't found that detection rates for these threats had dropped from 40-50% in 2006 to 20-30% in 2007. At that time, the only exception was the NOD32 antivirus, which managed a detection rate of 68 percent.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Channel Register|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2007/12/21/dwindling_antivirus_protection/|author=Dan Goodin|title=Anti-virus protection gets worse|date=December 21, 2007|accessdate=2011-02-24[/tpl]
The problem is magnified by the changing intent of virus authors. Some years ago it was obvious when a virus infection was present. The viruses of the day, written by amateurs, exhibited destructive behavior or pop-ups. Modern viruses are often written by professionals, financed by criminal organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/07/13/225537/hacking-poses-threats-to-business.htm|title=Hacking poses threats to business|accessdate=2009-11-15|author=Dan Illett|publisher=Computer Weekly|date=July 13, 2007[/tpl]
Independent testing on all the major virus scanners consistently shows that none provide 100% virus detection. The best ones provided as high as 99.9% detection for simulated real-world situations, while the lowest provided 91.1% in tests conducted in August 2013. Many virus scanners produce false positive results as well, identifying benign files as malware.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/avc_prot_2013b_en.pdf|title = Whole Product Dynamic "Real World" Production Test |accessdate = 2 January 2014|last = AV Comparatives |authorlink = |date=December 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102214834/http://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/avc_prot_2013b_en.pdf| archivedate= 2 January 2013 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===New viruses===

Anti-virus programs are not always effective against new viruses, even those that use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses. The reason for this is that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major anti-virus applications to make sure that they are not detected before releasing them into the wild.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.zdnet.com.au/why-popular-antivirus-apps-do-not-work-139264249.htm?omnRef=NULL|title = Why popular antivirus apps 'do not work'|accessdate = 14 April 2010|last = Kotadia|first = Munir |authorlink = |date=July 2006[/tpl]
Some new viruses, particularly ransomware, use polymorphic code to avoid detection by virus scanners. Jerome Segura, a security analyst with ParetoLogic, explained:[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/04/16/con-adult-video-virus.html|title = Internet scam uses adult game to extort cash|accessdate = 17 April 2010|last = The Canadian Press |authorlink = |date=April 2010 | work=CBC News| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100418215458/http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2010/04/16/con-adult-video-virus.html| archivedate= 18 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The potential success of this involves bypassing the CPU in order to make it much harder for security researchers to analyse the inner workings of such malware.Researchers up evilness ante with GPU-assisted malware - Coming to a PC near you, by Dan Goodin

===Rootkits===

Detecting rootkits is a major challenge for anti-virus programs. Rootkits have full administrative access to the computer and are invisible to users and hidden from the list of running processes in the task manager. Rootkits can modify the inner workings of the operating systemGIBSON RESEARCH CORPORATION SERIES: Security Now! and tamper with antivirus programs.

===Damaged files===

Files which have been damaged by computer viruses, e.g. by ransomware, may be damaged beyond recovery.  Anti-virus software removes the virus code from the file during disinfection, but this does not always restore the file to its undamaged state.  In such circumstances, damaged files can only be restored from existing backups or shadow copies;[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.malwarebytes.org/intelligence/2013/10/cryptolocker-ransomware-what-you-need-to-know/|title=Cryptolocker Ransomware: What You Need To Know|accessdate=2014-03-28[/tpl] installed software that is damaged requires re-installation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts/cs201/projects/viruses/anti-virus.html|title=How Anti-Virus Software Works|accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl] (however, see System File Checker).

===Firmware issues===

Active anti-virus software can interfere with a firmware update process.  Any writeable firmware in the computer can be infected by malicious code.  This is a major concern, as an infected BIOS could require the actual BIOS chip to be replaced to ensure the malicious code is completely removed.  Anti-virus software is not effective at protecting firmware and the motherboard BIOS from infection.[ref]
[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][/ref]

==Other methods==

Installed antivirus software running on an individual computer is only one method of guarding against viruses. Other methods are also used, including cloud-based antivirus, firewalls and on-line scanners.

===Cloud antivirus===

Cloud antivirus is a technology that uses lightweight agent software on the protected computer, while offloading the majority of data analysis to the provider's infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|url = http://blog.zeltser.com/post/1256199682/what-is-cloud-anti-virus|title = What Is Cloud Anti-Virus and How Does It Work?|accessdate = 2010-10-26|last = Zeltser|first = Lenny|authorlink = |date=October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101010113820/http://blog.zeltser.com/post/1256199682/what-is-cloud-anti-virus| archivedate= 10 October 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
One approach to implementing cloud antivirus involves scanning suspicious files using multiple antivirus engines. This approach was proposed by an early implementation of the cloud antivirus concept called CloudAV. CloudAV was designed to send programs or documents to a network cloud where multiple antivirus and behavioral detection programs are used simultaneously in order to improve detection rates. Parallel scanning of files using potentially incompatible antivirus scanners is achieved by spawning a virtual machine per detection engine and therefore eliminating any possible issues. CloudAV can also perform "retrospective detection," whereby the cloud detection engine rescans all files in its file access history when a new threat is identified thus improving new threat detection speed. Finally, CloudAV is a solution for effective virus scanning on devices that lack the computing power to perform the scans themselves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/08/antivirus_softw.html|title=Antivirus Software Heads for the Clouds|author=Jon Erickson|publisher=Information Week|authorlink = |date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-24[/tpl]
Some examples of cloud anti-virus products are Panda Cloud Antivirus and Immunet.

===Network firewall===

Network firewalls prevent unknown programs and processes from accessing the system. However, they are not antivirus systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything. They may protect against infection from outside the protected computer or network, and limit the activity of any malicious software which is present by blocking incoming or outgoing requests on certain TCP/IP ports. A firewall is designed to deal with broader system threats that come from network connections into the system and is not an alternative to a virus protection system.

===Online scanning===

Some antivirus vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.[tpl]cite web|title=Online Anti-Virus Scans: A Free Second Opinion|author=Brian Krebs|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/03/online_antivirus_scans_a_free.html|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2011-02-24[/tpl]
