==Critical reception==

Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying McGraw "plays his cards so close to his chest that upon first listen, you may only pick up on his unconditional love and selflessness toward the girl whoâ€™s been stringing him along for all these years."CountryUniverse.net Song review
