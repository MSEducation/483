===Football divisions===

Beginning in 2013, the conference split into two divisions of six teams for football. The Mountain West also added a conference championship game pitting the winners of the Mountain and West divisions. This first championship game took place on December 7, 2013 at Bulldog Stadium in Fresno, California, the home stadium of Fresno State, the divisional winner with the higher BCS ranking.[tpl]cite web|author=Paul Myerberg, USA TODAY Sports |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/01/22/mountain-west-conference-football-announces-divisions/1856165/ |title=Mountain West splits 12 football schools into six-team divisions |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] Each team plays five divisional games and three cross-divisional contests annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themwc.com/genrel/012213aaa.html |title=Mountain West Conference |publisher=Themwc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl]

Since the 2009-10 season, the Mountain West and Missouri Valley Conferences have held an annual challenge series. Before the 2013–14 season, when the MW had fewer members than the MVC, it involved all members of the MW and an equal number of the 10 MVC teams in basketball. With the MW now having 11 members to the MVC's 10, future series are expected to involve all MVC teams, with one MW team sitting out each season. The first game was on November 13, 2009, featuring the Bradley Braves and the BYU Cougars in Provo and it concluded on December 23 with the Wyoming Cowboys visiting the Northern Iowa Panthers in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The challenge is similar to the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, which pits men's basketball teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big Ten Conference.[tpl]cite web | title = Missouri Valley, MWC to start basketball series | publisher = Las Vegas Review-Journal | date = January 15, 2009 | url = http://www.lvrj.com/sports/37627364.html | accessdate = January 16, 2009[/tpl]

==Elevation==

The Mountain West's slogan is "Above the rest," and over half of the member institutions are at more than [tpl]convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level. This impacts endurance in sports like football, soccer, and the distance races in track & field and swimming meets, and aerodynamics in baseball, softball, tennis, golf, and the discus and javelin throws. The Mountain West's institutions have the highest average elevations in NCAA Division I sports.
