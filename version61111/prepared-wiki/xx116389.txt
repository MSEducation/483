==Program history==

Roy Brown, OakTree Software's president and application developer, created one of the first Bible programs available for the Macintosh, known as ThePerfectWord, in 1988. ThePerfectWord was later bought by another company and renamed MacBible. 
By the early 1990s there were a number of good general Bible study programs for the Mac. However, Brown saw the need for a new program which would make it easy to engage in more sophisticated kinds of Bible study, enabling scholars and pastors to do in-depth analysis of the original Greek and Hebrew texts of the Bible. Accordance 1.0 was released in February 1994, and welcomed for its power and ease of use.Accordance: History on company site
A version of Accordance 5.0 rewritten to run natively under Mac OS X was released at the start of 2002.Accordance Bible software now Mac OS X native, January 14, 2002, Macworld.
The company has continued to add and improve features, such as the native Quartz rendering system. Version 8 was released in May 2008 and introduced a universal binary for Intel-based Macs. Version 9 was released in September 2010. The latest version 10 was released in 2012.
Accordance for iOS was released on December 30, 2010 as a free app for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.Buzz: Accordance for iOS Now Released, Oaktree, December 30, 2010
