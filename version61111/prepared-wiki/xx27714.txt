[[Ahimaaz]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people, 10th-century BC clergy, Books of Samuel

Ahimaaz (Hebrew: אחימעץ áḤYMaàTs "My Brother Is Counselor") was son and successor of Zadok in the office of high priest (1 Chronicles 6:8, 53). On the occasion of the revolt of Absalom he remained faithful to David, and was of service to him in conveying to him tidings of the proceedings of Absalom in Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-37; 17:15-21). He was swift of foot, and was the first to carry to David tidings of the defeat of Absalom, although he refrained, from delicacy of feeling, from telling him of his death (2 Sam. 18:19-33).
He may have been the same Ahimaaz who took as wife Basemath, one of Solomon's daughters(I Kings 4:15). Subsequent kings of Israel, Ahaz, also married daughters of the high priest.
