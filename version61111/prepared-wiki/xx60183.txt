==History==

Established in 1991 under Chapter 1141 of the Laws of Hong Kong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance), HKUST is one of the nine universities in Hong Kong.
In the late 1980s the Hong Kong Government anticipated a strong demand for university graduates to fuel an economy increasingly based on services.  Sir Chung Sze Yuen and the then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Edward Youde, conceived the idea of another university in addition to the pre-existing two universities (HKU and CUHK).
Planning for the Third University, named The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology later, began in 1986.  Construction began at the Kohima Camp site in Tai Po Tsai on the Clear Water Bay Peninsula. The site was earmarked for the construction of a new British Army garrison, but plans for the construction of the garrison were shelved after the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984.
Originally scheduled to finish in 1994,The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology the death of Sir Edward in 1986 led to increased effort and allowed UST to open its doors early — in 1991. Several leading scientists and researchers took up positions at the new university in its early years, including physicist Leroy Chang who arrived in 1993 as Dean of Science and went on to become Vice-President for Academic Affairs.[tpl]cite web|title=Leroy Chang|work=Array of Contemporary American Physicists|publisher=American Institute of Physics|url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?changl|accessdate=5 January 2013[/tpl] Thomas E. Stelson was also a founding member of the administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ssb.brand.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=_3wqWJgQLs8utBB&ID=1068090|title=Schedule 14A|publisher=MTS Systems Corporation|date=1994-12-02|accessdate=2010-07-14[/tpl]
The project was criticized for surpassing the budget set forth by the Hong Kong Government and Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.  However, under the fund-raising efforts of its vice-chancellor, Woo Chia-wei, the first students enrolled in October 1991.  By 1992, accommodation and athletic facilities were expanded to support about 7,000 students.
Several more expansion projects such as the construction of The Hong Kong Jockey Club Enterprise Center have since been completed. The library extension building, Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK), South Bus Station and Undergraduate Halls VIII and IX are the latest additions to the campus.
