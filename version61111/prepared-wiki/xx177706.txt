General Manuel García Banqueda (1803 – May 4, 1872) was a Chilean military and political figure.
García Banqueda was born in Santiago, the son of Antonio García, Lieutenant in the "Dragones de la Reina" (Queen's Dragoons) and of Juana Banqueda. In 1817 (at the age of 12), he became a cadet in the recently formed Military Academy, created by Bernardo O'Higgins that year. He fought in the Battle of Maipú, during the Chilean War of Independence.  He also participated in the Valdivia and Chiloé campaigns of 1825 and 1826.

During the War of the Confederation he fought at the battles of Portada de Guías (1838), Chiquián, Buin, Yungay (1839), and in the capture of Lima. He was promoted to Colonel on the field of Yungay as a reward for his bravery.
In 1834 he was elected Deputy for "Rancagua" until 1837. He was a firm supporter of minister Diego Portales. In 1840 he was again elected a deputy and again between 1852 and 1861, this times for "Santiago", "Concepcion" and "San Carlos".
