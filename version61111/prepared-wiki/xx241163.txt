==History==

The cemetery was discovered in the 1920s,[tpl]cite book|last=Barrett|first=Pam|title=Peru|year=2002|page=178|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aUWThg8JWTIC&pg=PA178&dq=chauchilla+cemetery&lr=#v=onepage&q=chauchilla%20cemetery&f=false|accessdate=October 2009 | isbn=978-981-234-808-1 | publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group[/tpl] but had not been used since the 9th century AD. The cemetery includes many important burials over a period of 600 to 700 years. The start of the interments was in about 200 AD. It is important as a source of archaeology to Nazca culture.[tpl]cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Dilwyn Jenkins|title=The Rough Guide to Peru|page=224|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nP1LAMJ1IEgC&pg=PA224&dq=chauchilla+nasca#v=onepage&q=&f=false|accessdate=October 2007 | isbn=978-1-84353-074-9 | year=2003 | publisher=Rough Guides[/tpl] The cemetery has been extensively plundered by huaqueros (grave robbers) who have left human bones and pottery scattered around the area. Similar local cemeteries have been damaged to a greater extent. The site has been protected by Peruvian law since 1997 and tourists pay around seven U.S. dollars to take the two-hour tour of this ancient necropolis. The site is by the Poroma riverbed and can be accessed off a dirt track from  the Panamerican Highway. In 1997, the majority of the scattered bones and plundered pottery were restored to the tombs.

==Preservation of the bodies==

The bodies are so remarkably preserved due mainly to the dry climate in the Peruvian Desert but the funeral rites were also a contributing factor. The bodies were clothed in embroidered cotton and then painted with a resin and kept in purpose-built tombs made from mud bricks. The resin is thought to have kept out insects and slowed bacteria trying to feed on the bodies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nazcamystery.com/nazca_chauchilla.htm|title=The Chauchilla Tombs|last=McGuinness|first=Tim|accessdate=2009-10-19[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]
The nearby site of Estaquer√≠a may provide clues to the remarkable preservation of the numerous bodies in these cemeteries. At that site, archeologists found wooden pillars initially thought to have been used for astronomical sightings.http://www.periododeaventura.com/tours/cahuachi.html However, it is now believed that the posts were used to dry bodies in a mummification process. This may account for the high degree of preservation seen in thousand-year-old bodies which still have hair and the remains of soft tissue, such as skin.
