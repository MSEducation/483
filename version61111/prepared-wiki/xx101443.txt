CATEGORIES: Towns and villages in Pendle

Trawden is a medium sized village in the Trawden Forest parish of Pendle, at the foot of Boulsworth Hill, in Lancashire, England. Agriculture was the main industry of the village and surrounding area, although it did have several mills, most of which have now been demolished for, or converted to, housing.
As a way of encouraging people to visit Trawden and the surrounding area, a small group of village residents organise and mobilise other villagers in order to hold the annual Trawden Garden Festival and Scarecrow Trail. This takes place over the first weekend in July.Lancashire Telegraph Photos of the Trawden Garden Festival
Trawden also holds an annual Agricultural show each August, which many farmers, riders and people from around Lancashire enjoy and take part in.Lancashire Telegraph Photos of the Trawden Show
Trawden F.C. were champions of the Pendle Charity League Second Division in the 2006-07 season.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
