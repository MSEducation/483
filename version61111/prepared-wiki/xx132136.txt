The Concord Resort Hotel (pronounced KAHN-cord) was a resort in the Borscht Belt part of the Catskills, known for its large resort industry in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.  Located in Kiamesha Lake, New York, the Concord was the largest resort in the region until its closing in 1998.  There were over 1,500 guest rooms and a dining room that sat 3,000; the resort encompassed some [tpl]convert|2000|acre|km2[/tpl].
According to the Concord Resort & Golf Club Website, the hotel is now
 
 "...home of the World Famous "Monster" Golf Course rated by Golf Digest as one of America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses" which "features full service pro shop, driving range, overnight accommodations, meeting rooms, restaurant and bar, large catering and banquet facilities, individual and corporate memberships, golf school, and a PGA professional staff for all golf instruction programs."Concord Resort & Golf Club Website

There are currently 42 guest rooms and the website indicates that more rooms will be built as well as amenities not related to the golf course (i.e. swimming pool, tennis courts, etc.)  The "Monster Golf Academy" is under the direction of PGA Professional Todd Barker. The former hotel portion, though, was completely demolished in 2008 and the site remains vacant.
The Concord was used several times a year by the New York State Association of Fire Chiefs for live fire training. Because of its size, relative isolation and heavy type 1 concrete construction, it was ideal for firefighter training.
In 2010, financial disputes between the owners led to a legal settlement, splitting property between the parties. Entertainment Properties Trust REIT won [tpl]convert|1,500|acre|km2[/tpl] of the Concord site from developer Louis R. Cappelli, who retained control of [tpl]convert|116|acre|km2[/tpl].
