The Australian women's cricket team toured England in 2013. They were defending the Women's Ashes.
The only Test match of the tour took place on 11–14 August at Wormsley Park, and was drawn. Three One-Day Internationals were played: the first at Lord's on 20 August, and the other two at Hove on 23 and 25 August. Also three Twenty20 matches were played, on 27, 29 and 31 August, at Chelmsford, Southampton and Chester-le-Street respectively (the second and third of these being followed, on the same dates and at the same venues, by Twenty20 matches in the concurrent Australian men's tour).
The tourists also played a match against the England Academy women on 5–6 August at Brunton Memorial Ground, Radlett. Australia won the match by 116 runs.
For the first time, the Ashes were decided based on a points system, taking account not only of the one Test match, but also the results of limited-overs games. Six points are awarded for a Test victory (two points to each side in the event of a draw), and two points for a victory in any of the One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 games.
Following their victory in the second Twenty20 match, it became certain that England would regain the Ashes. The final points total was England 12, Australia 4.
