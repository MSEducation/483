==About the song==

As the baronial couple profess their love for one another, the Baron is simultaneously trying to kill his wife through equally barbaric means, yet his attempts always fail. Despite the obvious attempts on her life, the Baroness completely overlooks the fact that her husband wants her dead, even after he triggers an axe to fall on her head, a barbed spike to fall from the chandelier, and a trap door to open under her. The song is a humorous take on couples who secretly despise one another.

==Songwriters==

The song was written by Robert B. Sherman & Richard M. Sherman (also known as the "Sherman Brothers").
A version titled "My Fluffy One" was used in a Yoplait commercial.
