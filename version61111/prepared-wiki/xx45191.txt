Luke Vibert is a British recording artist and producer known for his work in many subgenres of electronic music.  Vibert began his musical career as a member of the Hate Brothers, only later branching out into his own compositions.  Vibert has recorded under several different aliases, most notably Plug and Wagon Christ.

==Early years: 1990s==

Vibert's first musical output was in a variety of bands, including a punk act called Five Minute Fashion and later a Beastie Boys-esque group called the Hate Brothers, but he quickly moved into the low-cost environment of solo electronic composition. Although Vibert originally had no intention of ever releasing any of the recordings, his reputation as a creative young voice in his field created a demand for his work.
Vibert originally became involved in electronic music through his interest in hip-hop as well as the environment of bedroom experimentalism associated with the swelling late 1980s UK dance scene. 
Vibert grew up in Cornwall and attended the Wesleyan Methodist Truro School along with a number of key members of Aphex Twin's Rephlex Records crew.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stuartaitken.com/post/43555798376/aphextwin |title=Rephlexology |date=28 November 2003|author=Stuart Aitken|work=mad.co.uk [/tpl] Luke and another school friend, Jeremy Simmonds, released an album on Rephlex under the name of Vibert/Simmonds which attracted attention from the Rising High music label. As a result of the popularity of the style in the early 1990s, Rising High commissioned an ambient music album from Vibert, who delivered the well-received Phat Lab Nightmare under the alias Wagon Christ in 1993.
He would go on further over the next few years to produce more music under the Wagon Christ name for Rising High and Ninja Tune, as well as introducing more aliases such as Plug (drum and bass/jungle), with the 1996  album 'Drum and Bass for Papa' which gained critical acclaim.

==2000 and onwards==

In late 1999 and 2000, Vibert began touring with BJ Cole to promote their fusion album Stop the Panic. In 2002, he would begin a series of live collaborations with Aphex Twin. Although Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert never released an album together, Aphex Twin used the song name "Analord", from Vibert's album Lover's Acid, for a series of EPs. Vibert's later releases varied in style as he released albums under various names, including Plug, Amen Andrews, Kerrier District and Spac Hand Luke. "Amen Andrews" is a word play on the name of Irish game show host Eamonn Andrews, referring to the fact that each Amen Andrews track uses the Amen break. In 2004, Vibert explored acid disco when he remixed a Black Devil song, which was released on Disco Club (Remix) and released his first album under the alias Kerrier District. In 2006, a collection of vintage Plug drum'n'bass songs were released on Here It Comes EP.
In 2006, Vibert's song "Shadows" was featured on the DJ mix album A Bugged Out Mix by Miss Kittin,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Miss-Kittin-A-Bugged-Out-Mix-By-Miss-Kittin/release/674304 |title=Miss Kittin - A Bugged Out Mix By Miss Kittin (CD)|accessdate=2011-01-29|author=|year=|work=Discogs|publisher=Zink Media, Inc[/tpl] which charted at number one-hundred seventy on the French Albums Chart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ultratop.be/fr/showitem.asp?interpret=Miss+Kittin&titel=A+Bugged+Out+Mix+By+Miss+Kittin&cat=a|title=ultratop.be - Miss Kittin - A Bugged Out Mix By Miss Kittin|language=French|work=Ultratop|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=2011-01-29[/tpl] In 2009, he contributed a cover of LFO's song "LFO" to the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation.

==Critical reception==

"It was under the alias of Wagon Christ (along with other equally vital monikers like Plug, Vibert & Simmonds, and later more simply in his own name) that Vibert helped to redefine the rules of electronic music in the UK in the early to mid '90s - alongside a bunch of reprehensible mates that included Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin), Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher), Mike Paradinas (Âµ-Ziq), Chris Jeffs (Cylob), and the labels Rephlex and Warp," stated journalist Andrez Bergen in an article that appeared in Japan's Daily Yomiuri newspaper in 2003. 
"Together they assimilated such diverse elements as hip hop beats and drum & bass into the more eccentric take on electronica they tweaked, and kick-started a virtual insurrection in sound around the world." Vibert Admits Moral Bankruptcy, Andrez Bergen. Daily Yomiuri, October 2003.
