His most famous Canadian collaborations are with Richard Terfry (better known as Buck 65), Dallas Green of City and Colour, and The Sadies.

Richard Terfry collaborated with Gordon Downie on the song Whispers of the Waves off the album 20 Odd Years.

In his solo project City and Colour, Dallas Green had Gordon Downie sing on the track Sleeping Sickness off City and Colour's hit album Bring Me Your Love.  The album debuted at number 11 of the Top Heatseekers chart in March 2008.
Gordon has begun a new project with The Sadies, a Toronto band most noted for their 2010 Polaris Music Prize nomination. Gordon commented on working with the Sadies, saying, "I enjoy getting together with those guys; it's a whole other universe. They're writing all the music and I'm writing all the lyrics and we're coming up with some neat stuff. You do it for the company but I'm genuinely shocked by the themes and things you touch on based on the music you're singing to. That's really compelling to me." He also says they are planning on creating ten songs together.[tpl]cite news|last=Khanna|first=Vish|title=Gord Downie Sheds Light on Collaborative Album with the Sadies|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/Gord_Downie_Sheds_Light_on_Collaborative_Album_with_Sadies|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=Exclaim![/tpl]

He is an active member of Waterkeeper Alliance and is recognized as a valued member.[tpl]cite web|title=Lake Ontario Waterkeeper|url=http://www.waterkeeper.ca/whoweare-trustees/|publisher=Waterkeeper Alliance MEMBER|accessdate=30 March 2012[/tpl] Although his work can be considered environmentalism he does not consider himself an environmentalist, but a “free market capitalist.”[tpl]cite news|last=Boyden|first=Joseph|title=Maclean's Interview: Gord Downie|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/04/13/maclean%E2%80%99s-interview-gord-downie/|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=Macleans|date=13 April 2009[/tpl] With Waterkeeper Alliance, Gordon helped work on a cause to prevent a cement company from burning tires for fuel.

===The Great Moon Gathering===

In February 2012 in Fort Albany, Downie, with The Tragically Hip, played at the Great Moon Gathering, a yearly educational conference that takes place in various communities along Northern Ontario's James Bay coast. Its focus is on youth learning and combining Cree education with the contemporary world.[tpl]cite news|last=Boyden|first=Joseph|title=North of the 52nd with the Tragically Hip|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/02/29/north-of-the-52nd/|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=Macleans|date=29 February 2012[/tpl] The venue was small and not typical of the band. Author Joseph Boyden, who invited them, said their motivation was to “initiate a guerrilla act of love for a people who are so thoroughly underrepresented but now, somehow, overexposed for only their shortcomings. A guerrilla act of love to show the rest of the country what strength and artistry, grace and humour the Cree possess.” In addition to the Tragically Hip's performance, Downie sang a song with a local band, Northern Revolution. The song "Goodnight Attawapiskat" from the album "Now For Plan A" was a result of this trip.
