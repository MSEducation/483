The Sooners continued to play strong following the loss and again rose in the polls as more teams above them also lost. Back in the #3 spot, the Sooners traveled to Lubbock, Texas to take on the Red Raiders to clinch the Big 12 South Division title. However, Bradford was injured on the opening play for the Sooners as they quickly fell behind. It was 27–10 at the halftime. Oklahoma mounted a comeback in the 4th quarter but it was not enough. The Sooners lost their second game and again were knocked out of the national title picture.[tpl]cite news | title=No definitive word on Bradford | first=John | last=Hoover | publisher=Tulsa World | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071118_2__There81567 | accessdate=2007-11-19 | date=2007-11-18 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071202153100/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071118_2__There81567| archivedate= 2 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Knocked out | publisher=Tulsa World | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/TWPDFs/2007/Final/W_111907_B_1.pdf | format=PDF | first=John | last=Hoover | accessdate=2007-11-19 | date=2007-11-19 [/tpl] In their next game against Oklahoma State, in what is referred to as Bedlam, the Sooners dominated winning 49–17 and locking up their spot in the Big 12 Championship Game.[tpl]cite news | title=Patrick runs for career-best 202 yards, 2 TDs as OU rolls | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273280201 | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=2007-11-26 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071201141325/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273280201| archivedate= 1 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In the Big 12 Championship, Oklahoma faced Missouri, then the number one ranked team in the nation.

===West Virginia===

West Virginia was picked by the Big East media to finish first in the conference[tpl]cite press release | title=West Virginia Selected To Win 2007 Big East Title |url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/season_preview_2007_bigeast_media.html | accessdate=2007-12-03 | date=2007-07-27 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071104150224/http://collegefootballpoll.com/season_preview_2007_bigeast_media.html| archivedate= 4 November 2007 | deadurl= yes[/tpl] and they did just that. Nationally, West Virginia was among the favorites to win a national championship from the beginning. In the preseason AP Poll, West Virginia was ranked third and received one first place vote. In the Coaches Poll, they were picked sixth. They started the season ranked higher than Oklahoma in both polls (Oklahoma was #8 in both polls).[tpl]cite web | title=2007 NCAA Football Rankings - Preseason (Aug. 19) - AP | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?seasonYear=2007&weekNumber=1&seasonType=2&pollId=1 | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=2007-12-03 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=2007 NCAA Football Rankings - Preseason (Aug. 19) - Coaches | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?seasonYear=2007&weekNumber=1&seasonType=2&pollId=2 | publisher=ESPN | accessdate=2007-12-03 [/tpl] The Mountaineers were led on offense by quarterback Pat White and running back Steve Slaton, both juniors and both on many preseason Heisman Trophy watchlists.[tpl]cite web | url=http://heismanpundit.com/item/1398/ | title=The 2007 Preseason Heismanpundit Heisman Watch | publisher=HeismanPundit.com | date=2007-08-28 | accessdate=2007-12-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118182402/http://heismanpundit.com/item/1398/  |archivedate = 2007-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nationalchamps.net/2007/earlybird/topplayers/index.htm | title=Top 25 Heisman List for 2007 | publisher=NationalChamps.net | accessdate=2007-12-03 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071221033210/http://www.nationalchamps.net/2007/earlybird/topplayers/index.htm| archivedate= 21 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] West Virginia hit their first stumbling block against then-#18 South Florida in late September. They rebounded with six consecutive wins including a win over the Connecticut Huskies which clinched at least a share of the Big East title for West Virginia. West Virginia only needed one more win to also clinch a spot in the national championship game.[tpl]cite news | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273280277 | title=White's three TDs maintain Mountaneers' national-title hopes | accessdate=2007-12-03 | publisher=ESPN | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071128021703/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273280277| archivedate= 28 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In their last game of the regular season, the 100th Backyard Brawl at Mountaineer Field in Morgantown, West Virginia, the #2 ranked Mountaineers suffered an upset when they were defeated by unranked Pittsburgh 9–13.

==Selection process==

Beginning with the 1998 football season, when the Bowl Championship Series began, the winner of the Big 12 Conference was contractually assigned to play in the Fiesta Bowl, unless ranked in the top two in which they would play in the national championship game.[tpl]cite web | title=BCS Chronology | publisher=Bowl Championship Series | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214203217/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history  |archivedate = 2007-12-14[/tpl] By winning the conference but not finishing ranked in the top two, Oklahoma was automatically assigned to the Fiesta Bowl. With Oklahoma guaranteed to play in the Fiesta Bowl, the bowl committee still had an at-large team to select.
Per the BCS selection procedure, the bowl games that lost teams to the national championship get first picks for a replacement.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/eligibility | title= BCS Selection Policies and Procedures | publisher=Bowl Championship Series | accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218092040/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/eligibility  |archivedate = 2007-12-18[/tpl] The Rose Bowl, after losing top ranked Ohio State, selected Illinois. Next, the Sugar Bowl selected Georgia to replace the #2 LSU Tigers. For the second selection for each bowl, per the BCS selection procedure, the game played nearest the date of the national championship had the first pick. For 2008, this was the Orange Bowl, which selected Kansas. Following the Orange Bowl's select, the Fiesta Bowl had the next pick following lastly by the Sugar Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl committee had a few teams to select from including Arizona State, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, and Big East champion West Virginia.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.mercextra.com/blogs/collegesports/2007/12/02/bsc-and-pac-10-bowl-projections-wwjd/ | title=BSC and Pac-10 bowl projections: WWJD? | publisher=San Jose Mercury News | accessdate=2007-12-31 | date=2007-12-02 | first=Jon | last=Wilner [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Kansas awaits Bowl announcement | url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/120207/haw_222149637.shtml | accessdate=2007-12-31 | date=2007-12-02 | publisher=The Topeka Capital-Journal | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080105055836/http://www.cjonline.com/stories/120207/haw_222149637.shtml| archivedate= 5 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=ASU hoping for Fiesta Bowl invite after beating rival | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/1202gameblomo1202.html | publisher=The Arizona Republic | accessdate=2007-12-31 | date=2007-12-02 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Oklahoma, West Virginia Earn Fiesta Bowl | url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqAb73xW8RmTAtMHooAF02iSiEjgD8T9NLA02 | agency=Associated Press | first=Andrew | last=Bagnato | accessdate=2007-12-27 | date=2007-12-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071206163850/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gqAb73xW8RmTAtMHooAF02iSiEjgD8T9NLA02 |archivedate = December 6, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The committee chose to invite West Virginia who almost made the national championship game before losing their last regular season game. John Junker, CEO of the Fiesta Bowl, said "the selection we had was very simple."  If West Virginia had not been selected by the Fiesta Bowl, the Sugar Bowl would have been forced to select them, as West Virginia was guaranteed a BCS bowl berth by virtue of winning the Big East.

==Pre-game buildup==

This game marked Oklahoma's fourth trip to the Fiesta Bowl. Oklahoma defeated Wyoming in 1976 before losing to Arizona State in 1982 and in overtime to Boise State in 2007.[tpl]cite news | title=OU to Fiesta Bowl vs. West Virginia | publisher=SoonerSports.com | accessdate=2007-12-27 | date=2007-12-02 | url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120207aae.html | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080108071321/http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120207aae.html| archivedate= 8 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] West Virginia made their second trip to the Fiesta Bowl.

On 2007-12-17, Stewart Mandel, a writer for Sports Illustrated, revealed that Oklahoma's athletic director, Joe Castiglione had tried to arrange for Oklahoma to face the highest ranked opponent available, which would have been Virginia Tech, in the Orange Bowl. This would have pitted the #3 team against the #4 team. Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe contacted BCS officials (which includes the 11 conference heads and the athletic director of Notre Dame) to see if this could be done. Mike Slive, then the BCS commissioner and SEC commissioner, considered the idea but it was ultimately rejected. There was no word on which officials voted against the proposition. Beebe stated he did not agree with the decision, but respected the views of those against it. Castiglione stated that he hopes "at some point in time we can hear an explanation of why this wasn't possible given the fact the rules provided the opportunity if it was in everybody's best interest." Mandel said that two of his sources speculated that the commissioner "feared such a matchup might damage the legitimacy of the Ohio State-LSU title game." Slive said "there weren't such compelling circumstances as to merit a change."[tpl]cite news | title=The Orange Bowl that wasn't | publisher=Sports Illustrated | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/12/17/bcs/index.html | first=Stewart | last=Mandel | accessdate=2007-12-19 | date=2007-12-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071219153638/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/12/17/bcs/index.html| archivedate= 19 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Report: Oklahoma v.

West Virginia scored early with two field goals by Pat McAfee to take the lead, 6–0, into the second quarter. Sam Bradford was intercepted by Mountaineer safety Quinton Andrews early on, but the Sooners bounced back with a field goal to make it 6–3. However, fullback Owen Schmitt led the Mountaineers to their first touchdown on a 57-yard run to make the score 13-3 on a play in which announcer Matt Vasgersian referred to Schmitt as a "runaway beer truck." Oklahoma returned with a field goal to make it 13-6, but West Virginia ended the first half with a pass from their star quarterback, Pat White to a wide-open Darius Reynaud for a 21-yard touchdown to make it 20-6 at halftime.
Oklahoma came back in the second half early with a field goal, followed by a goal line touchdown run by Chris Brown. The Sooners went for a 2-point conversion after the touchdown, but Bradford's pass was incomplete, leaving the score at 20-15. The Mountaineers answered back with a 17-yard run by Noel Devine for the touchdown to put the Mountaineers up 27–15. The Mountaineers scored again to end the third quarter, this time on a 30-yard reverse run by Darius Reynaud, to put the Mountaineers up 34–15 going into the fourth quarter.
