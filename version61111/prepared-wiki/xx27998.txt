==Public transport==

Most Belizeans travel the country using public buses as their primary form of transportation. In the larger towns and cities, such as Belize City or Belmopan, there are bus terminals.  In smaller places, there are bus stops. However, the most common way of catching a bus is by flagging it down on the road. On the Northern and George Price Highways, bus service is more frequent than on smaller highways and other roads. In some locations, like small towns, buses may run only once a day. Buses are classified as either Regular runs (usual prices) or Express runs (faster, for slightly higher prices). Some Belizeans prefer riding bikes due to traffic, or the time of day.
Many buses are Greyhounds or school buses, although newer express buses travel the two main highways. 
A new zoning system was implemented on Sunday, October 19, 2008.New Bus Transport System , press release, Belmopan, October 17, 2008.  Accordingly, the country is divided into zones: Northern (highway/rural), Southern (highway/rural), Western (highway/rural).
Bus providers are restricted to assigned zones:

==Roads==

Belize has four major asphalt-paved two-lane roads: the Hummingbird Highway, Southern Highway, George Price Highway, and Northern Highway. Most other roads are unpaved, rough and in poor condition.  A [tpl]convert|9|mi|adj=on[/tpl] stretch of the Southern Highway near Big Falls is unpaved as well. Driving is on the right-hand side of the road.

===Unpaved runways===

As of 2008, an estimated 44 airports and airstrips were in operation.  The international airport is Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport in Ladyville, outside of Belize City.  Currently, the international airport is served by American, Delta, TACA, United and US Airways, along with local airlines Maya Island and Tropic.  A runway expansion program set to be completed in 2007 may allow larger aircraft to land and may encourage new direct or nonstop service from Europe and Canada.  Also in Belize City is the Municipal Airport.
Two airlines, Tropic Air and Maya Island Air, provide frequent service around Belize.  In most cases, both airlines have service from the international airport, Philip S. W. Goldson, in Ladyville 9 miles north of Belize City, and from the Belize City Municipal Airport in the city, to San Pedro, Caye Caulker, Dangriga, Placencia, Punta Gorda, and to Flores in Guatemala, and one airline serves Savannah at Big Creek.  There is also service from San Pedro to Sarteneja and to Corozal Town.  The airlines typically fly small single-engine equipment, such as the Cessna Caravan.

==Railways==

Belize has no railways. Dismantled lines include the Stann Creek Railway that linked Dangriga and Middlesex Estate; it was abandoned in 1937. Some of its bridges remain along the Hummingbird Highway.
The FERISTSA Railway was proposed to connect Mexico with Panama; if built, it might bypass Belize unless a branch were built.
