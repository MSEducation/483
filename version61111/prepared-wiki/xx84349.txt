Lympstone Commando railway station is a railway station on the branch line from Exeter to Exmouth in Devon, England.
The station is a rare example of a passenger station not open to the general public; it is exclusively for the use of visitors to the Royal Marine Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, although the Ministry of Defence have accepted that it is the property of Network Rail, and as such they cannot prohibit members of the public from alighting at the station, although there is no exit other than the guarded exit to the camp.FOI request sent through Whatdotheyknow

==History==

The station was opened on 3 May 1976.  This caused some confusion with the older Lympstone railway station,  but this has since been renamed "Lympstone Village".[tpl]cite book |last = Mitchell |first = Vic|coauthors = Smith, Keith |title = Branch Lines to Exmouth |publisher = Middleton Press |year = 1992 |location = Midhurst|isbn = 1-873793-00-6[/tpl] It was built using cast platform sections recovered from Weston Milton railway station where the track had been singled and so one platform was no longer needed.
For many years troop trains were a feature of its operation about three times each year.  The trains were operated with a locomotive at each end as there is no way to run around a train south of Topsham; the leading locomotive on arrival was dragged back to Exeter Central where it was detached.  The trains were considerably longer than the platform and loading the passengers was a slow operation as they had to make their way through the train from the centre coaches.  A similar operation today is difficult to arrange as the regular timetabled passenger service is much more intensive than in the 1980s.

==Description==

The station is situated on the banks of the estuary of the River Exe.  It consists of a single platform, which is on the left of trains arriving from Exeter.
On 28 May 2010 a section of the Exe Estuary Trail opened between Lympstone village and Exton.[tpl]cite web|title=East of the estuary|url=http://www.exe-estuary.org/index/exe-news/latest_news_from_the_estuary.htm|work=latest News from the Estuary|publisher=Exe Estuary Management Partnership|accessdate=2012-01-17[/tpl] This runs between the platform and the entrance to the camp, both of which are locked and guarded.See Geograph photograph

==Services==

About half the trains on the Avocet Line from [tpl]Stnlnk|Exmouth[/tpl] to [tpl]Stnlnk|Exeter St Davids[/tpl] call at Lympstone Commando â€“ it is a request stop, this means that passengers alighting here must tell the conductor that they wish to do so, and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches.
Beyond Exeter St Davids they generally continue to either [tpl]Stnlnk|Paignton[/tpl] or [tpl]Stnlnk|Barnstaple[/tpl].  Connections are available at [tpl]Stnlnk|Exeter Central[/tpl] for [tpl]Stnlnk|Pinhoe[/tpl] and other stations including London Waterloo; passengers for other main line stations change at St Davids.[tpl]cite web| title = National Rail Timetable 136|url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/Dec07/timetables/Table136.pdf[/tpl]
Officially only people having business at the commando base are allowed to board or alight at this station, although the Ministry of Defence have accepted that it is the property of Network Rail and as such they cannot prohibit members of the public from alighting at the station, although there is no exit other than the guarded exit to the camp. Passengers for Lympstone itself must use Lympstone Village railway station, or on the other side of the line, Exton is a mere [tpl]frac|1|4[/tpl] of a mile away and is only a twenty minute walk away from Commando station.
