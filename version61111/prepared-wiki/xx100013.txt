The Tiger funds reached a peak of $22 billion in assets in 1998. But a combination of poor stock picking and failure to exploit the technology stock craze caused Robertson's funds to suffer steep losses at the end of the decade, prompting investors to withdraw cash.http://www.hedgefundhistory.com/famousfunds.html When the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index climbed 21 percent in 1999, the Tiger funds declined 19 percent. 
Robertson has been quoted as saying "our mandate is to find the 200 best companies in the world and invest in them, and find the 200 worst companies in the world and go short on them. If the 200 best don't do better than the 200 worst, you should probably be in another business."http://www.investopedia.com/university/greatest/julianrobertson.asp
Tiger's largest equity holding at that time was U.S. Airways, whose troubles dragged down the value of his holdings. Such missteps ultimately led him to close his investment company in March 2000 and return all outside capital to investors. Tiger earlier made $2 billion in gains but then gave most of them back during a huge one-day move in the yen in 1998. In September 2001, Robertson distributed 24.8 million greatly devalued U.S. Airways shares to former Tiger investors. Robertson declared his intent to hold onto his own stock in the airline."INVESTING: DIARY; Left Holding the Bag On US Airways Stock", by Laurence Zuckerman, September 23, 2001 

==After Tiger==

After closing his fund in 2000, Robertson kept his hand in the hedge fund business by supporting and financing upcoming hedge fund managers (38 in total as of September 2009), in return for a stake in their fund  management companies. Apart from those, many of the analysts and managers Robertson employed and mentored at Tiger Management, including Chris Shumway, Lee Ainslie and Ole Andreas Halvorsen went out on their own and are now running some of the best-known hedge fund firms, called "Tiger Cubs".http://www.opalesque.com/tiger - list of 38 Tiger Seeds and 32 Tiger Cubs "The Tiger and His Cubs," New York Times, July 30, 2012
