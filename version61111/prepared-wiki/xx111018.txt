==History==

Metro is located in the Dhobitalao area of Mumbai. The Art Deco cinema opened on 8 June 1938, and initially exhibited movies made by MGM. The interior, floors, walls, ceilings as well as the furniture, was in shades of red and pink. The marble foyer and staircases led up to murals executed by students of the J. J. School of Art, under the director Charles Gerard. Among the famous invitees was Gregory Peck. And if the films were classy, so was the audience at Metro. The ushers wore suits and the soda fountain provided excellent bar snacks and service. In 1955 Metro was the venue for the first Filmfare Awards night.[tpl]cite news|title=50 years of dreams, disappointments|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-02-25/india/27859867_1_filmfare-statuette-bimal-roy-awards|accessdate=12 April 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=25 February 2005[/tpl]
In 1970, the cinema was taken over by the Gupta family and with Indianisation came the era of screening Hindi films and flashy, glittering, star-studded premieres. Raj Kapoor's Bobby set the trend and when RK released Satyam Shivam Sundaram in typical monsoon fury, the guests were delighted when the young Kapoor brothers — Randhir, Rishi and Rajeev — opened their car doors, held umbrellas over their heads and led them inside.
It soon became Bollywood's most famous red-carpet theatre. The star presence at Metro became so huge that most often riot police had to be called in at film premieres.

==Transformation into multiplex==

Despite such achievements, Metro could not stand up to the multiplex invasion, it was becoming difficult to fill up the 1,491 seats. The promoters decided to transform the old cinema into a multiplex, while also restoring its original art-deco interiors. The cinema was acquired by Adlabs Cinemas and in the start of 2005, the cinema closed down.
After a massive retrofitting job in August 2006, the cinema re-opened. Keeping with its famous red-carpet reputation, the cinema re-opened in its new avatar with the much anticipated Karan Johar Movie "Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna". The cinema now has six screens, which are among the largest multiplex screens in Mumbai.The math doesn’t add up for Mumbai’s Art Deco cinemas. Livemint (2009-05-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-17.
