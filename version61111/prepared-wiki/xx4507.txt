[[Haematopoiesis]]

CATEGORIES: Hematopoiesis, Histology

Haematopoiesis (from Greek αἷμα, "blood" and ποιεῖν "to make"; also hematopoiesis in American English; sometimes also haemopoiesis or hemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cellular components. All cellular blood components are derived from haematopoietic stem cells. In a healthy adult person, approximately 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily in order to maintain steady state levels in the peripheral circulation.Semester 4 medical lectures at Uppsala University 2008 by Leif Jansson[tpl]cite book |author=Parslow,T G.;Stites, DP.; Terr, AI.; and Imboden JB. |title=Medical Immunology |edition=1 |isbn=0-8385-6278-7[/tpl]

==Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)==

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the medulla of the bone (bone marrow) and have the unique ability to give rise to all of the different mature blood cell types and tissues. HSCs are self-renewing cells: when they proliferate, at least some of their daughter cells remain as HSCs, so the pool of stem cells does not become depleted.This phenomenon is called asymmetric division.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morrison|first=J.|author2=Judith Kimble|title=Asymmetric and symmetric stem-cell divisions in development and cancer|doi=10.1038/nature04956|pmid=16810241|journal=Nature|volume=441|issue=7097|pages=1068|year=2006|bibcode=2006Natur.441.1068M[/tpl]   The other daughters of HSCs (myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells), however can commit to any of the alternative differentiation pathways that lead to the production of one or more  specific types of blood cells, but cannot self-renew. The pool of progenitors is heterogeneous and can be divided into two groups, long-term self-renewing HSC and only transiently self-renewing HSC, also called short-terms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Morrison|first=SJ|coauthors=Weissman, IL|title=The long-term repopulating subset of hematopoietic stem cells is deterministic and isolatable by phenotype.|journal=Immunity|date=Nov 1994|volume=1|issue=8|pages=661–73|pmid=7541305[/tpl]  This is one of the main vital processes in the body.
All blood cells are divided into three lineages.[tpl]cite web|title=http://www.ebioscience.com/resources/pathways/hematopoiesis-from-pluripotent-sem-cells.htm|url=http://www.ebioscience.com/resources/pathways/hematopoiesis-from-pluripotent-sem-cells.htm|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl] 
Granulopoiesis (or granulocytopoiesis) is haematopoiesis of granulocytes.
Megakaryocytopoiesis is haematopoiesis of megakaryocytes.

==Locations==

In developing embryos, blood formation occurs in aggregates of blood cells in the yolk sac, called blood islands. As development progresses, blood formation occurs in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes. When bone marrow develops, it eventually assumes the task of forming most of the blood cells for the entire organism. However, maturation, activation, and some proliferation of lymphoid cells occurs in secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes).  In children, haematopoiesis occurs in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia.  In adults, it occurs mainly in the pelvis, cranium, vertebrae, and sternum.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fernández|first=KS|coauthors=de Alarcón, PA|title=Development of the hematopoietic system and disorders of hematopoiesis that present during infancy and early childhood.|journal=Pediatric clinics of North America|date=Dec 2013|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1273–89|pmid=24237971[/tpl]

===Extramedullary===

In some cases, the liver, thymus, and spleen may resume their haematopoietic function, if necessary. This is called extramedullary haematopoiesis. It may cause these organs to increase in size substantially. 
During fetal development, since bones and thus the bone marrow develop later, the liver functions as the main haematopoetic organ. Therefore, the liver is enlarged during development.[tpl]cite journal|last=Georgiades|first=CS|coauthors=Neyman, EG; Francis, IR; Sneider, MB; Fishman, EK|title=Typical and atypical presentations of extramedullary hemopoiesis.|journal=AJR.

===Other vertebrates===

In some vertebrates, haematopoiesis can occur wherever there is a loose stroma of connective tissue and slow blood supply, such as the gut, spleen or kidney.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zon|first=LI|title=Developmental biology of hematopoiesis.|journal=Blood|date=Oct 15, 1995|volume=86|issue=8|pages=2876–91|pmid=7579378[/tpl]

==Maturation==

As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression that limit the cell types that it can become and moves it closer to a specific cell type. These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and further limits its potential to become a different cell type.

===Determination===

There are two points of view. For the stem cells and other undifferentiated blood cells in the bone marrow, the determination is generally explained by the determinism theory of haematopoiesis, saying that colony stimulating factors and other factors of the haematopoietic microenvironment determine the cells to follow a certain path of cell differentiation. This is the classical way of describing haematopoiesis. The other point of view is stochastic theory: Undifferentiated blood cells are determined to specific cell types by randomness. The haematopoietic microenvironment prevails upon some of the cells to survive and some, on the other hand, to perform apoptosis and die. By regulating this balance between different cell types, the bone marrow can alter the quantity of different cells to ultimately be produced.[tpl]cite journal|last=Alenzi|first=FQ|coauthors=Alenazi, BQ; Ahmad, SY; Salem, ML; Al-Jabri, AA; Wyse, RK|title=The haemopoietic stem cell: between apoptosis and self renewal.|journal=The Yale journal of biology and medicine|date=Mar 2009|volume=82|issue=1|pages=7–18|pmid=19325941[/tpl]
