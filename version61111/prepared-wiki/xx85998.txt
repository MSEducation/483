==Career==

===Early acting career===

Hayter did some live acting in the early 1990s, but became interested in voice acting after making a cameo appearance in an episode of the sitcom Major Dad, and later landed the role of Captain America in the popular 1994 Spider-Man animated series. He also provided the voice of Arsène Lupin III in the English version of the anime film The Castle of Cagliostro and the voice of Tamahome in the English version of the anime series Fushigi Yūgi. He also starred in the 1994 straight-to-video movie Guyver: Dark Hero, taking over the role of protagonist Sean Barker from previous actor Jack Armstrong.

===Metal Gear Solid===

In 1998, Hayter voiced protagonist Solid Snake in the highly successful video game Metal Gear Solid. He provided Snake's voice in later Metal Gear games such as Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (which was a remake of Metal Gear Solid), and provided the voice for a closely related character, Naked Snake, a young Big Boss, in the prequels Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. Afterward, he voiced Solid Snake (renamed Old Snake) in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and Snake/Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Hayter also had an extended cameo as himself in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots during one of the live-action sequences prior to the start of the game. In the scene, he wears the "Solid Eye", the technologically advanced eye patch that Old Snake wears throughout the game. Hayter also provided the voice of Solid Snake for the character's guest appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a Wii fighting game featuring various Nintendo characters.
Hayter is one of the few Metal Gear Solid actors to have played and completed the Metal Gear games he's voiced in,[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.psp.gamespy.com/playstation-portable/kojima-productions-project/747389p1.html|accessdate = 15 December 2006|title= UK PSP[/tpl] while co-star Christopher Randolph has only played Metal Gear Solid.
According to an interview with Paul Eiding, Hayter gave up half of his own paycheck in order to bring back the cast of Metal Gear Solid for the Nintendo Gamecube remake The Twin Snakes. This is the reason why the voice acting in The Twin Snakes was almost completely redone with the same voice actors, one of the few differences being the actor for Gray Fox, Greg Eagles, who was replaced by Rob Paulsen.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
His work with Metal Gear Solid has also led Hayter to do voice work in other video game projects such as Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and Star Wars: The Old Republic. He also cited the Metal Gear Solid series as an influence on his screenwriting, stating that "Kojima and I have different styles," "but I've certainly learned things from him, especially about ambiguity and telling a story without giving all the answers."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/anime-expo-david-hayter-critical|title=Anime Expo: David Hayter Critical of Some MGS Moments|date=May 7, 2008|publisher=1UP.com|author=Fitch, Andrew|accessdate=March 2, 2012[/tpl]
After the announcement of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Hayter announced that he was not asked to reprise his role as Big Boss/Snake.[tpl]cite news|title=Beloved Solid Snake Voice Actor Says He Wasn’t Asked to Be in Metal Gear Solid V|url=http://kotaku.com/beloved-solid-snake-voice-actor-says-he-wasn-t-asked-to-461256492|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|work=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013[/tpl] This was later confirmed on June 6, when Konami announced that Kiefer Sutherland would be the new voice of Snake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/06/06/kiefer-sutherland-playing-snake-in-metal-gear-solid-v|title=Kiefer Sutherland Playing Snake in Metal Gear Solid V|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|publisher=IGN|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl] Hayter's final performance as Snake was the release of the Digital Graphic Novel adaptations of Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2, which were released as part of the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection in 2013.

===Filmmaking===

In 2000 he wrote the screenplay for the movie version of X-Men, and then went on to co-write the screenplay for its sequel X2 with writing team Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Shortly after his work on X-Men, Hayter was hired to write and direct a project based on the heroine Black Widow. However, due to the limited success of similar themed films featuring female vigilante protagonists at the time, Marvel withdrew their offer to Hayter stating, "We don’t think it’s time to do this movie". Hayter's daughter Natasha, born whilst he was writing the Black Widow script, is named after the titular character.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Hayter also wrote an adaptation of the graphic novel Watchmen by Alan Moore and David Gibbons. Noted for being a harsh critic of translations of his works to film, Moore said of the script "David Hayter's screenplay was as close as I could imagine anyone getting to film version of Watchmen. That said, I shan't be going to see it. My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Jeff | last=Jensen | title=Watchmen: An Oral History | date=2005-10-21[/tpl] Hayter and writer Alex Tse shared credit on the finished screenplay.
