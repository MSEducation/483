"Home" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Alan Jackson. The song was originally recorded by him on his 1989 debut album Here in the Real World. The original 1989 recording served as the B-side to three of Jackson's singles: his debut single "Blue Blooded Woman", as well as his first two Number One hits "I'd Love You All Over Again" and "Don't Rock the Jukebox."[tpl]cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=201|isbn=0-89820-177-2|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling it a "loving tribute to Jackson's parents and the home they provided." She goes on to say that "in the hands of a lesser, artist this type of song could easily disintegrate into sticky sentimentality, but that is definitely not the case here. Honest and heartfelt emotion makes for powerful communication, and the straightforward sincerity in Jackson's voice makes this tune a homespun masterpiece."Billboard, April 27, 1996
