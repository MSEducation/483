===Profile===

Comic Book Guy (claiming Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode "Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass"[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/2010/05/07/ten-times-the-simpsons-jumped-the-shark| title=Ten Times The Simpsons Jumped the Shark|last= Greene | first= James Jr.|date= May 6, 2010|accessdate= January 12, 2012|publisher= Nerve.com[/tpl]) is a morbidly obese, nerdy and snobby man best known for his eloquence and sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid science fiction buff. He holds a master's degree in folklore and mythology (having translated The Lord of the Rings into Klingon as part of his thesis),"Three Men and a Comic Book" as well as a degree in chemical engineering,Married to the Blob has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of Mensa.[tpl]cite episode |title=They Saved Lisa's Brain |episodelink=They_Saved_Lisa's_Brain |series=The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |credits= Selman, Matt; Michels, Pete|network=Fox |airdate= |season=10 |number=22 [/tpl] He has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail. His catchphrase is the declaration "worst/best subject ever", sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall. For example, in the episode "Saddlesore Galactica", he wears a T-shirt saying "Worst Episode Ever" and criticizes the idea of the Simpson family keeping a horse since that was the subject of a previous episode. Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy's chair collapses, and he sarcastically says "Ooh, a fat man falls. Real original." Despite his solitary life, in The Simpsons Movie, minutes before his likely death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a "life well spent". However, in "Treehouse of Horror VIII", when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself, "Oh, I've wasted my life." (Although the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes are not part of the normal Simpsons canon.) In the 2008 episode "Any Given Sundance" it was revealed that he is also a writer and posts to his own site called "Ain't I Fat News," a take on the real-life movie review website Ain't It Cool News.

===Romance===

Comic Book Guy was once married in an online role-playing game. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his "power crystals."[tpl]cite episode |title=My Big Fat Geek Wedding|episodelink=My_Big_Fat_Geek_Wedding |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= Curran, Kevin; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox|airdate= |season=15 |number=17 [/tpl] In Season 16's "There's Something About Marrying", he hopes to wed a Xena: Warrior Princess cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual junta that briefly ran Springfield in "They Saved Lisa's Brain", he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the Vulcan blood fever of mating, called Pon farr), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, "much, much more". He is a virgin well into his forties,[tpl]cite episode|title=Mayored to the Mob|episodelink=Mayored_to_the_Mob |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= Hauge, Ron; Scott III, Swinton O. |network=Fox |airdate= |season=10 |number=9 [/tpl] but becomes sexually and romantically involved with Principal Skinner's mother Agnes. He later dates Edna Krabappel. They are nearly married at a science fiction convention, but Edna changes her mind. CBG was not particularly surprised by this, saying, "There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick?" When Edna gently explains "It's like I'm DC Comics, and you're Marvel", he accepts the comparison without any rancor. In "Married to the Blob" Comic book Guy marries Kumiko a Japanese Manga artist.

===The Android's Dungeon===

Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. The comics, collectibles, and toys he sells are of wildly varying quality and often have very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like Bart Simpson and Milhouse Van Houten, using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal videos (which include Mr. Rogers drunk, Alien Autopsy, Illegal Alien Autopsy, a "good version" of The Godfather Part III, and Kent Brockman picking his nose). 
In "Husbands and Knives", the store was closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened across the road, run by an owner with significantly better customer service and social skills. Although his old store was bought by Marge Simpson in the same episode and not returned, Comic Book Guy continues running his store in future episodes and the rival store is usually not mentioned, though it was referred to again when Milo showed up in Married to the Blob.

==Character==

===Creation===

Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles Amok book shop who often "sat on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of fried clams with a lot of tartar sauce." Groening noted: [tpl]cquote|I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, 'I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block.' And I have to tell them, 'No, it's every comic book store guy in America.'[/tpl] 
Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a college contemporary who went by the nickname "F", short for "Flounder" from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House, and lived in the room next door to him at Tufts University.Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Azaria "loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers."

===Development===

Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons.[tpl]cite news |last=Tossell |first=Ivor |title=Worst. Column.

Cohen often read alt.tv.simpsons to gauge audience response to episodes. He decided to lampoon the passion and the fickleness of the fans.[tpl]cite news |first=Chris |last=Baker |title=Futurama Is Back!

In the eighth season episode "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" after Comic Book Guy views the  Itchy & Scratchy episode featuring Poochie, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, “Worst episode ever” on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nit-picks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of Bart Simpson:Alberti, pp. 147-148

The catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the eleventh season episode "Saddlesore Galactica",[tpl]cite episode |title=Saddlesore Galactica|episodelink=Saddlesore_Galactica|series=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=February 6, 2000|season=11 |number=13[/tpl] and as the title of the twelfth season episode "Worst Episode Ever".[tpl]cite episode |title=Worst Episode Ever|episodelink=Worst Episode Ever|series=The Simpsons |credits=Doyle, Larry; Nastuk, Matthew|network=Fox |airdate=4 February 2001|season=12 |number=11[/tpl] The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, "Worst. (Noun). Ever."

===Name===

A long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters referring to him as "Comic Book Guy". The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him "Comic Book Guy", with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him.Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for "Three Men and a Comic Book", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. However, they continually procrastinated.  Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, "Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells Ned Flanders: "My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'".[tpl]cite episode |title= Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass |episodelink=Homer_and_Ned's_Hail_Mary_Pass |series=The Simpsons |series link=The Simpsons |credits= Steven Dean Moore, Tim Long |network=Fox |airdate= |season=16 |number=8 [/tpl] Showrunner Al Jean remarked: "That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the Super Bowl show. We did it so the most people possible would see it." Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be "obsessed and tormented by" Lois Lane, but Groening was not present when the writers chose the name.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|title="Simpsons" Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To "Burns-Sexual" Smithers|accessdate=2007-07-29|date=2007-07-26|first=Larry|last=Carroll|publisher=MTV[/tpl] His name is also mentioned in The Simpsons Game.
