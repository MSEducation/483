==History==

Aeroperú was formed on 22 May 1973 following the reorganization of SATCO,  an earlier airline controlled by the Peruvian Army. Initially a wholly state-owned company with a fleet of three Fokker F28 Fellowships taken over from SATCO, revenue flights were commenced in October on the Lima-Cusco route.[tpl]cite journal|title=World Airline Directory|journal=Flight International|volume=21 March 2000|page=55|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2000/2000%20-%200799.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] Soon, a Boeing 727 joined the fleet, and the airline placed an order for two new Fokker F27 Friendships.[tpl]cite journal|title=World airlines update|journal=Flight International|issue=17 October 1974|page=512|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%201652.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] In 1974, two Douglas DC-8s were acquired from Viasa, which allowed for the launch of international routes. The inaugurational flight to Buenos Aires took place on 29 July of that year, which was soon followed by a scheduled service to Miami. By 1978, the Aeroperú network had grown to include a multitude of destinations in Latin America, as well as the US cities of New York and Los Angeles with their important Latino populations.
In July 1981, Aeroperú was gradually privatized, with the Peruvian government keeping a minority share of 20 percent. In 1982, plans were made for a merger with Faucett Perú, the other large passenger airline in the country at that time. As a preparatory measure, redundancies in the route networks of the two airlines were removed, so that Aeroperú had to suspend flights to a number of destinations,[tpl]cite journal|title=Peru streamlines its airlines|journal=Flight International|volume=24 April 1982|page=1028|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201084.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, New York City and Los Angeles.[tpl]cite journal|title=World airline directory|journal=Flight International|issue=3 April 1982|page=801|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200845.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] No further steps were taken towards merging the two airlines, and that in 1983, flights to several destinations recommenced.[tpl]cite journal|title=World Airline Directory|journal=Flight International|issue=2 April 1983|page=870|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%200566.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]  A bilateral air traffic agreement between Peru and the United States expired on 11 November 1983. Because of disagreements over the granting of fifth freedom rights, all flights between the two countries were stopped in May 1984[tpl]cite journal|title=US/Peru dispute upsets tourism|journal=Flight International|issue=26 January 1985|pages=32|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200222.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] until mid-1985, which affected Aeroperú's Lima-Miami route.[tpl]cite journal|title=World Airline Directory|issue=30 March 1985|page=32|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%200892.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
In 1993, Aeroméxico acquired 70 percent of the shares worth $54 million, thus making Aeroperú their subsidiary.[tpl]cite journal|title=AeroMexico wins AeroPeru re-bid|journal=Flight International|issue=27 January 1993|page=21|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1993/1993%20-%200155.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] Subsequently two Boeing 757-200 airliners were transferred, allowing for Aeroperú to replace their ageing DC-8s.[tpl]cite web|title=Aeroperú fleet list|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Airline/Aeroperu|publisher=planespotters.net|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]  In 1996, 47 percent of Aeroperú was transferred to Cintra, the parent company of Aeroméxico and Mexicana de Aviación. The three airlines entered mutual codeshare agreements under the Alas de Americas name, with Aeroperú joining Club Permier, the frequent-flyer program of Aeroméxico.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Between 1996 and 1997, Aeropéru maintained a second base at Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport in Colombia, from where regional flights were offered.[tpl]cite journal|title=World Airline Directory|journal=Flight International|issue=19 March 1997|page=43|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%200699.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] In 1998, Delta Air Lines became a major shareholder of Aeroperú, when they acquired a 35 percent stake in the airline. The agreement saw Cintra reducing their share to an equal 35 percent.[tpl]cite journal|title=AeroPerú suspends flights while debt renegotiations take place|journal=Flight International|volume=17 March 1999|page=20|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1999/1999%20-%200472.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl]
Due to financial difficulties that had troubled the airline for most of its existence, Aeroperú was forced to suspend all flight operations on 10 March 1999. Several plans for a relaunch were made, which included a possible buy-in of Continental Airlines[tpl]cite journal|title=Aeroperú stake|journal=Flight International|volume=9 June 1999|page=9|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1999/1999%20-%201597.html|accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] or a take-over by a group of foreign investors. None of these materialized, and Aeroperú was liquidated on 18 August 1999. Most of its route network as well as the role of Peruvian flag carrier was taken over by newly founded LAN Perú.
