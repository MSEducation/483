Glimepiride is a medium- to long-acting sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug. It is marketed as K-GLIM-1 by BLUE CROSS, Amaryl by Sanofi-Aventis, GLIMPID by Ranbaxy Laboratories(Cardiovascular) and GLIMY by Dr.Reddy's Labs.
It is sometimes classified as either the first third-generation sulfonylurea,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hamaguchi T, Hirose T, Asakawa H, et al. |title=Efficacy of glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients treated with glibenclamide |journal=Diabetes Res.

==Indication / contraindications==

Glimepiride is indicated to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus; its mode of action is to increase insulin production by the pancreas.  It is not used for type 1 diabetes because in type 1 diabetes the pancreas is not able to produce insulin.http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696016.html
Its use is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to glimepiride or other sulfonylureas, and during pregnancy.

==Adverse effects==

Side effects from taking glimepiride include gastrointestinal tract (GI) disturbances, occasional allergic reactions, and rarely blood production disorders including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia.  In the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased. Alcohol consumption and exposure to sunlight should be restricted because they can worsen side effects.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Gastrointestinal absorption is complete, with no interference from meals. Significant absorption can occur within one hour, and distribution is throughout the body,  99.5% bound to plasma protein.  Metabolism is by oxidative biotransformation. Excretion in the urine is 65%, and the remainder is excreted in the feces.

==Mechanism of action==

Like all sulfonylureas, glimepiride acts as an insulin secretagogue.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nissen SE, Nicholls SJ, Wolski K, et al. |title=Comparison of pioglitazone vs glimepiride on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PERISCOPE randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=299 |issue=13 |pages=1561–73 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18378631 |doi=10.1001/jama.299.13.1561 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18378631[/tpl] It lowers  blood sugar by stimulating the release of insulin by pancreatic beta cells and by inducing increased activity of intracellular insulin receptors.
Not all secondary sufonylureas have the same risks of hypoglycemia. Glibenclamide (glyburide) is associated with an incidence of hypoglycemia of up to 20–30%, compared to as low as 2% to 4% with glimepiride. Glibenclamide also interferes with the normal homeostatic suppression of insulin secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not. Also, glibenclamide diminishes glucagon secretion in reaction to hypoglycemia, whereas glimepiride does not.[tpl]cite book |author=Davis, Stephen N. |chapter=60.

==Interactions==

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as salicylates), sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, coumadin and probenecid) may potentiate the hypoglycemic action of glimepiride. Thiazides, other diuretics, phothiazides, thyroid products, oral contraceptives, and phenytoin tend to produce hyperglycemia.
