[[List of Cistercian monasteries]]

CATEGORIES: Cistercian monasteries

The Cistercians are a Roman Catholic religious order of enclosed monks, whose monasteries and abbeys have been built from 1098. The first Cistercian abbey was Cîteaux Abbey. Their monasteries spread throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, but many were closed during the Protestant Reformation, the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII, the French Revolution, and the revolutions of the 18th century. Some survived and new monasteries have been founded since the 19th century.
There are a certain number of medieval monasteries and other cistercians buildings (salt factories, Watermills) that are abandoned or ruined, or converted into hotels such as Monasterio de Piedra or St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church.[tpl]cite journal |last=de Ange |first=Angie |year=2007 |month= |title=Oldest Building in the West |journal=Orange & Blue |volume= |issue= |pages= | publisher = College of Journalism & Communications| location =University of Florida |id= |url=http://www.jou.ufl.edu/pubs/onb/s07/index.php?id=51 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |quote=The St. Bernard de Clairvaux Episcopal Church, known as North Miami Beach’s Ancient Spanish Monastery, it is one of the oldest buildings in the Western Hemisphere.[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Weird Florida |last=Carlson |first=Charle |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 2005 |publisher=Barnes & Noble |location= |isbn=978-0-7607-5945-5 |page=136 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LEVpJytFVYcC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=St.+Bernard+de+Clairvaux+Church+oldest [/tpl]
