[[Barangaroo, New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Sydney, Fishing communities in Australia

Barangaroo is an inner-city suburb of Sydney, Australia. It is located on the north-western edge of the Sydney central business district and the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney, and was part of the territory of the Cadigal people, the traditional owners of the Sydney city region. The area was used for fishing and hunting by Australian Aborigines prior to colonial settlement. The area is inclusive of The Hungry Mile, the name harbourside workers gave to the docklands area of Darling Harbour East, where workers would walk from wharf to wharf in search of a job, often failing to find one.
In 2003, the Government of New South Wales determined that the precinct would be redeveloped from shipping and stevedoring facilities to provide more commercial office space and recreational areas. This redevelopment has moved from design contest to concept plan from 2005 to 2012. In the interim, stevedoring facilities have been relocated, some of the site remediated, and temporary alternate uses such as major events implemented, pending major development. The site is managed by an agency of the Government, called the Barangaroo Delivery Authority.
The precinct is currently being redeveloped and is expected to be entirely completed by 2023.[tpl]cite web|title=Barangaroo Timeline|url=http://barangaroo.com.au/discover-barangaroo/timeline.aspx|publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority[/tpl]

==History==

This area was of great importance to Aboriginal Cadigal people as a major hunting and fishing region. Large shell middens and numerous rock engravings close to the site indicate indigenous occupation dating back around 6,000 years, while radiocarbon dates from other parts of Sydney indicate that the wider area was occupied for at least 14,500 years prior to European settlement, from 1788.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barangaroo.com/discover-barangaroo/history.aspx |title=Discover Barangaroo: History |work=Barangaroo, Sydney, Australia |publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority |year=2011 |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl]

 "Not seeing Barangaroo of the party, I asked for her, and was informed that she had violently opposed Bennelong's departure. When she found persuasion vain, she had recourse to tears, scolding, and threats, stamping the ground, and tearing her hair. But Baneelon continuing determined, she snatched up in her rage one of his fish-gigs, and dashed it with such fury on the rocks, that it broke. To quiet her apprehensions on the score of her husband's safety, Mr. Johnson, attended by Abaroo, agreed to remain as a hostage until Bennelong should return". 

===European settlement===

At the time of European and indigenous contact, Governor Phillip estimated that there were about 1500 Aboriginal people inhabiting the coastal area of Botany Bay, Port Jackson and Broken Bay. The population reduced dramatically with the introduction of smallpox into Sydney's Aboriginal community in the first years of European settlement. More than half of Sydney's Indigenous population is believed to have died in the smallpox epidemic of 1789.[tpl]cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=92-4-156110-6 |format=PDF[/tpl] Originally known as Cockle Bay Point during the early years of the Sydney colony, little activity or settlement took place in the area. Then in the 1820s windmills were built out on what was to become known as Millers Point and European settlers started constructing houses and building a small village. In the 1830s the first wharf was constructed in the area immediately bringing more people to the nascent villages around two public houses. In 1843 the Australian Gas Light Company finished building and began operating a gas works in East Darling Harbour. This was the beginning of major residential and dockland development in the area as employees needed to be housed near the works. The works also brought more commercial shipping into the harbour as the coal for the works had to be delivered by boat.http://agl.com.au/about/companyoverview/Pages/agl-history.aspx
In 1859 a direct route from The Rocks to Millers Point was created, called The Argyle Cut. This made the journey back and forth from the main colony much safer and quicker. The route was a major catalyst for development in east Darling Harbour and Millers Point.http://nga.gov.au/federation/Detail.cfm?WorkID=112337

===Early shipping era to 1960s===

From the 1850s to the 1880s the docks and shipyards in East Darling Harbour multiplied tremendously, going from a coal and ferry drop off point to a hub of commercial shipping activity. During the gold rush, labour shortages plagued the docks as most poor labourers headed out to the gold fields in Victoria to strike it rich. The companies had to be become more flexible in meeting worker demands so they offered better pay and working conditions to workers who stayed in Sydney. In the 1860s storage facilities and warehouses had to be built out on Millers Point to accommodate the massive amount of bulk goods flowing through the port. By the 1870s the waterfront was covered in warehouses and storage depots, mostly holding the treasured export of the time, wool.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
From 1880 to 1900, specialisation of the area occurred. Shipyards closed down in favour of storage facilities and bigger wharfs to accommodate contemporary ships with larger cargo loads were built. The skilled ship builders were therefore out of a job and had to find work else where, while more unskilled workers were needed to fill stevedoring positions. This shifted the demographics of the area significantly, turning it from a mix of skilled and unskilled workers to a working-class neighbourhood.
The arrival of the bubonic plague in Sydney in 1900 was cause for alarm on the docks. Mass areas of Sydney were fenced off and people deported to North Head to be quarantined. Shipping operations were shut down for a period of time while Council decontaminated the area and exterminated disease ridden rats. During this time the ownership of the port was shifted from individually owned private wharfs to the Sydney Harbour Trust. The trust dismantled the inadequate and unsafe docks and built finger wharfs large enough to facilitate large modern ships. By the end of the 1930s construction was complete, the wharfs dominated the waterfront from Millers point down to Darling Harbour.
The Great Depression gave East Darling Harbour and dock areas surrounding it a poignant nickname, The Hungry Mile. During this period great masses of workers would line up down the mile long stretch of wharfs and wait for work.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/sydneys-hungry-mile-made-official-20090729-e131.html |title=Sydney's Hungry Mile made official |date=29 July 2009 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald  |accessdate=23 January 2012 |agency=AAP[/tpl] Clerks chose the workers based on the a system where the fitter men were chosen over the weaker, and where socialist troublemakers were sidelined in favour of willing workers. This brutal system made for a very adversarial environment which polarised the community at large. They erupted occasionally in protest, most famously refusing to load a boat with scrap metal bound for Japan on the eve of World War II.http://www.mua.org.au/media/uploads/TheHungryMilebook.pdf

===Modern shipping era to redevelopment===

By the 1960s ships had become too big for the now inadequately small finger wharfs of East Darling Harbour. Standardized shipping container sizes had eliminated the need for bulk offloading. One crane operator could now do the work of 50 men. The whole of what is known today as South Barangaroo was turned into a massive concrete apron, the northern end followed similarly in the 1970s. Flaws in the site's modern shipping capability started to show. The lack of a heavy rail link or a b-double capable road limited the port's capacity in processing in and outbound cargo. As container ships got bigger this problem only got worse. The ultimate demise of commercial shipping in Darling Harbour, and ultimately Sydney Harbour as a working harbour, was the construction of Port Botany in 1979 and the expansion of port facilities at Port Kembla and Newcastle Port. With excellent rail, road and air connections to the port, along with massive capacity for expansion and the ability to handle large container ships, it progressively became the main port of Sydney.
The wharfs had been unusually free of union activity from the beginning of World War II up until the mid-1990s, with high wages and a steady stream of jobs. In 1996 Howard Government was elected into power promising industrial relations reform. In 1997 the [tpl]Cite Legislation AU|Cwlth|act|Workplace Relations Act, 1996[/tpl] limited the bargaining power of unions and sidelined the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's ability to mediate negotiations as well as introducing statutory employee contracts. In 1998 Patrick Stevedoring laid off all its workers and liquidated its assets after encountering backlash from the unions for the new workplace contracts taking advantage of the new legislation.[tpl]cite journal|last=O'Nill|first=Steve|title=Outline of Waterfront Dispute|journal=Current issues brief (Parliamentary Library)|year=1997–1998|issue= 15|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/CIB9798/98cib15|accessdate=28 November 2013[/tpl] But the very next day when work was expected to grind to a halt, everything was proceeding as if nothing happened. The employees were rehired by a new corporation with the same people who owned Patrick, just on a lower wage and with fewer concessions in their contracts.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
In 2003 with the stevedoring companies set to move out within three years, the Government of New South Wales designated the site for redevelopment into parklands and commercial space. An international design contest was launched in 2005 attracting 139 submissions from around the world. The winning design by Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects, Paul Berkemeier Architects and Jane Irwin Landscape Architecture was announced in March 2006 together with a naming competition for the new precinct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barangarooaction.com.au/page/history.html |title=History of the Barangaroo redevelopment |work=About us |publisher=Barangaroo Action Group |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] In October 2006, the Minister for Planning, Frank Sartor, announced that the area will be renamed as Barangaroo.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/mediarelplan/fs20061018_427.html |title=New look, new name for Sydney foreshore precinct |date=18 October 2006 |author=Sartor, Frank |authorlink=Frank Sartor |publisher=Department of Planning |accessdate=23 January 2012 |location=Sydney[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/barangaroo-back-in-sydney/2006/10/18/1160850971716.html |title=Barangaroo back in Sydney |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=19 October 2006 |author=Pearlman, Jonathan |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] In late 2006 Patrick Corporation, who leased the site from the New South Wales Government, moved their stevedoring operations to Port Botany. This put an end to almost 130 years of cargo shipping operations in eastern Darling Harbour.
Prior to the precinct's redevelopment, Barangaroo was a World Youth Day 2008 site used for the opening mass for an estimated 150,000 people,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world-youth-day/opening-mass-underway/2008/07/15/1215887621840.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Opening Mass underway |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=15 July 2008 |agency=AAP |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] concerts, a re-enactment of the Stations of the Cross and for the arrival of Pope Benedict XVI to Sydney. A passenger terminal for cruise liners was temporarily located at Barangaroo, prior to construction of the White Bay Cruise Terminal. The Barangaroo Foreshore is also available for events during construction.

==Redevelopment==

Initially placed in the hands of Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority,[tpl]cite web|title=Barangaroo : Agency information guide July 2013|url=http://www.barangaroo.com/media/35678/agency_information_guide_july_2012.pdf|publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority|accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl] the Barangaroo Delivery Authority was established pursuant to the Barangaroo Delivery Authority Act, 2009 No 2 to facilitate a high quality commercial and mixed use precinct at Barangaroo balancing social, economic and environment outcomes, including the establishment of a headland park and other public domains; amongst other objectives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barangaroo.com/media/58015/barangarooar_2011%20final_web_version.pdf |title=The Act |page=5 |work=Annual Report |year=2011 |publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority |location=Sydney |accessdate=23 January 2012 |format=PDF[/tpl] Supporting the Authority is a Design Excellence Review Panel that comprised Paul Keating (Chairman from 2005 until 2011),[tpl]cite news |url=http://inner-west-courier.whereilive.com.au/news/story/mayor-hits-back-at-former-pm-1/ |title=Clover Moore hits back at former PM quitting Barangaroo panel |work=Inner West Courier |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] Chris Johnson, Bridget Smyth, Oi Choong, James Weirick, Angelo Candalepas, and Leo Schofield (resigned 2011). The role of the Panel was to guide the government authority on a range of design issues, such as architecture, landscape and culture. Commissioned initially in 2005, the Panel was instrumental in the selection of Hill Thalis Architecture as the winning the international design competition in 2006.[tpl]cite news |author=Dempster, Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Dempster |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-26/interview-with-paul-keating/345220 |format=transcript |work=Stateline |location=Sydney, Australia |date=1 March 2010 |title=Interview with Paul Keating |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] The winning team was commissioned to assist the Government in developing the design during the latter part of 2006. There was early debate regarding the design and size of waterfront developments. The City of Sydney and some architectural bodies expressed concern that the proposed designs would be out of scale with the surrounding environment, as well as causing large unwanted shadows over the immediate area, parts of Darling Harbour and possibly nearby Pyrmont.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/monster-so-hungry-itll-eat-the-sunlight/2006/11/01/1162339918416.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=A monster so hungry it will eat all the sunlight |date=2 November 2006 |accessdate=20 January 2012 |author=Norrie, Justin[/tpl]
A concept plan was released by the Government in 2007 and a year later announced that it had shortlisted consortia led by Brookfield Multiplex, Lend Lease and Mirvac. In 2009, to assist with the economic viability of the project, the Government announced that the amount of commercial office space would increase by one third, allowing an additional [tpl]convert|120000|m2|sqft|0[/tpl] from the initial concept plan for the [tpl]AUD[/tpl]6 billion development. In late 2009, after a further shortlisting process, the Government announced that it would not to proceed with Hill Thalis' winning design, choosing instead a consortium that included lead architect Lord Rogers and developer, Lend Lease, who controversially proposed a [tpl]convert|230|m|ft|0[/tpl] tall hotel to be constructed [tpl]convert|150|m|ft|0[/tpl] into Darling Harbour, as well as parkland and commercial offices. When plans were put on public display during 2010 it was claimed that the development exceeded planning height and footprint limits.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/barangaroo-towers-breach-height-limits-says-design-architect-20100303-pj3t.html?autostart=1 |title=Barangaroo towers breach height limits, says design architect |author=Moore, Matthew |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=23 January 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl] Following public outcry at changes to the original Concept Plan, community-based organisations such as the Friends of Barangaroo, Australians for Sustainable Development and the Barangaroo Action Group formed, colloquially referring to the precinct as "the Greedy Mile". In March 2010, the Government and Lend Lease entered into provisional contracts for the development of the site, subject to Ministerial approval which was given in May 2010. Concerned about the lack of transparency, in September 2010 Clover Moore, Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney and Member for Sydney, resigned as a director of the Barangaroo Delivery Authority.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/moore-quits-over-barangaroo-railroading-20100921-15ldg.html |title=Moore quits over Barangaroo 'railroading' |author=Moore, Matthew |date=22 September 2010 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl]
On attaining Government in March 2011, Premier Barry O'Farrell announced an independent review into the selection processes. The panel reported in August 2011 and stated that two members of a design panel had a conflict of duty.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-review-suggests-a-conflict-of-duty-on-design-panel-20110809-1ikyj.html |date=11 August 2011 |title=Barangaroo review suggests a conflict of duty on design panel |author=Moore, Matthew |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] O'Farrell also overturned an amendment to planning legislation made in the last days of the Keneally government that placed the Barangaroo site as exempt from remediation of contaminated sites requirements. The Government has also asked Lend Lease to move the hotel off the harbour as a gesture of goodwill, even though it has planning approval from the Keneally government. Discussions with the developer are ongoing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/top-marks-for-barangaroo-cleanup--now-to-agree-on-a-spot-for-hotel-20120119-1q8gu.html#ixzz1kG7Xv937 |title=Top marks for Barangaroo clean-up – now to agree on a spot for hotel |author=Munro, Kesley |date=20 January 2012 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl]

===Precincts===

The redevelopment project comprises three precincts: Barangaroo South, Barangaroo Central and the Headland Park.
Barangaroo South is the southern third of the site and acts as an extension of Sydney's CBD, with office buildings, apartments, retail outlets, public spaces and a hotel.[tpl]cite web | url=http://barangaroo.com/discover-barangaroo/barangaroo-south.aspx | title=Welcome to Barangaroo South | publisher=Barangaroo Delivery Authority | accessdate=23 January 2012[/tpl] Three commercial skyscrapers designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners form the core of this stage; known as International Towers Sydney. The tallest is IT1 at [tpl]convert|217|m|ft|0[/tpl]. In addition to office space, it will also include a community or childcare centre. All three towers will feature retail on the podium levels. IT2 is due for completion in 2015, while IT1 & IT3 are expected to be complete the following year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.barangaroosouth.com.au/Commercial-Buildings/default.aspx |title=Commercial Buildings |work=Barangaroo South Designs |publisher=Lend Lease |accessdate=21 January 2012[/tpl]

 With our harbour and climate, Sydney should be one of the world's best destinations, but we are being let down by an under-investment in quality tourism infrastructure.... A world-class landmark resort on Sydney Harbour can be the catalyst to help turn the city around, just as Crown assisted in the turnaround of Melbourne.... Some commentators have raised the process we are undertaking to progress our proposal. The NSW unsolicited proposal process exists to allow any organisation with unique ideas to make a submission to the government. We have followed that process to the letter and, despite reaching stage two, there is a long way to go.... For a hotel resort in Sydney to be a landmark building that will attract millions of visitors, it must be on Sydney Harbour. Barangaroo is the only waterfront and harbourside location in the Sydney CBD that will accommodate such a development.
