The song was originally written by Question Mark (Rudy Martinez) around 1962.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The recording was done in Bay City, Michigan. It was first released on the small Pa-Go-Go label and then picked up by Cameo Records for national distribution.
Known for its signature organ licks and bare-bones lyrics, "96 Tears" is widely recognized as one of the first garage band hits, and has even been given credit for starting the punk rock movement.[tpl]cite book|title=Billboard Book of Number One Hits|author=Fred Bronson|publisher=Billboard Books U.S.|page=?|edition=5th|date=October 1, 2003|isbn=978-0823076772[/tpl]
The song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. in 1966 and almost simultaneously topped the RPM 100 in Canada. Follow-up song "I Need Somebody" peaked at number 22 later that year, but no other U.S. Top 40 singles followed. It appeared on the band's album, 96 Tears.
