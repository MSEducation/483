[[USS Astrolabe Bay]]

CATEGORIES: United States Navy ship names

Two ships of the United States Navy have been named Astrolabe Bay. Navy records explain the name as a "bay in Alaska" but Astrolabe Bay fails to appear on contemporary maps. What the ship-namers perhaps had in mind was an Astrolabe Point on the mainland of Alaska, between what was then known as Cross Sound and Lituya Bay.
