==Europe==

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===

In both countries, the Pharm. D. (Pharmaciae doctor) diploma can be obtained by pharmacists who have previously graduated in pharmacy (Magister, Mgr.) (the undergraduate study of pharmacy takes 5 years). Applicants must defend a research or experimental thesis, and pass a rigorous examination. The PharmDr. title is highly prestigious and written in front of the name. It is different from the postgraduate Ph.D. diploma.

===France===

In France, Pharm.D studies can only be accessed through a competitive examination ("concours", with numerus clausus) happening at the end of the first year of health studies. Most candidates hold a Scientific Baccalaureate from the equivalent to high schools (lycée). In case of failure, it is possible to retry once. Yearly success rate depends on the university's current numerus clausus and the number or registered students, ranging from 10 to 30% bearing in mind that second-time participants are three to four times more likely to succeed than students trying for the first time.
In order to obtain the state diploma of "Doctor of Pharmacy", the studies last a minimum of 6 years, or 9 years for students choosing residency (hospital pharmacy or medical biology). It is accessible through another competitive exam, even more selective. It lasts four years and gives another diploma of specialist like in medicine (DES for "diplôme d'études spécialisées" ) .
Students must specialise when entering the 5th year, and choose between dispensing pharmacy, pharmaceutical industry or hospital residency. In any case, a 12-month part-time hospital externship is mandatory during the 5th year, although some flexibility is possible for students choosing industry.
6th year for industry is generally dedicated to further specialisation with a former Professional Master's degree or a former Research Master's degree including internship.
In France, since the harmonization of European Union in September 2005, the student who chooses the industry/research orientation have a 6 month period of part-time hospital externship, and 3 to 6 month of full-time training in a pharmaceutical industry or a research lab.

===Hungary===

In Hungary, pharmacists obtain their Master's degree, after 5 years of study. On the fifth year, students must undergo a professional training, that lasts for six months in a public pharmacy or a hospital. At the end of this period, the student must pass a nationwide exam to be legally entitled for practicing the profession of pharmacy, after acquiring the pharmacist work license.

It is not required if the pharmacist is working in a private entity (e.g. a pharmaceutical company).

===Netherlands===

The education of pharmacists in the Netherlands requires a minimum of six years of university study. EU-harmonisation has led to division into three bachelor and three master years. A bachelor title is, however, not used at all professionally. The Dutch consider the educational level of their current (M.Sc.) Degree in Pharmacy to be comparable to the PharmD title in use in the United States. Before the harmonization a four year Master of Science was superseded by two more years of university education preparing for pharmacy practice. To become a hospital pharmacist a 4-year residency program has to completed after that.

The student takes the Master's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences (equivalent to the PharmD program) in one of the 9 Pharmacy faculties with their own respective numerous clausus which comprises a 6 year rigorous study (5 with the uniformities in EU teaching). Finished the degree, the academic title of Doctor of Pharmacy is issued. The graduate can then enroll in the regulatory institution for the Pharmacist profession in Portugal called, "Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society" or in Portuguese "Ordem dos Farmacêuticos". After the enrollment the title of Pharmacist is issued. Afterward, Pharmacists can start their career in a limitless number of professional areas that range from community pharmacies, drug development, fundamental or applied research, biotechnology to areas such as forensic sciences, toxicology, regulatory affairs, clinical analysis, law enforcement (scientific police), bromatology, drug marketing, regulatory authorities, university teachers, etc. The Pharmacists can also choose to become a specialist in one of following areas of activity: Pharmaceutical Industry, Regulatory Affairs, Hospital Pharmacy, and Clinical Analysis. Each specialization requires an additional 5 year professional study program guided by a tutor in the respective area of knowledge.  This training includes regular evaluations by the professional order, which also requires an exam at the end of the 5 year training. After the success at the exam, the Pharmacist then becomes a specialist in its area of expertise.

This is the first international program to undergo review and receive accreditation by this sole Canadian accreditation agency.

===Saudi Arabia===

Started in 2001 at King Abdulaziz University, then in 2005 at Ibn-Sina University, then 2006 at KFU, then 2007 at Qassim University.

==North America==

===Canada===

Currently in Canada, the BPharm (and not PharmD) is the minimum qualification required to practice pharmacy. In Canada the PharmD program is offered in both English and French, and as a first professional degree as well as a postgraduate degree.  Students enrolled in the program must have graduated from a CCAPP (Canadian Council for Accreditation of Pharmacy Programs) or an ACPE (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) school with an accredited teaching program or must have passed the PEBC (Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada) Evaluating and Qualifying examinations.
As of 2007, the PharmD professional degree program in French is offered at the Université de Montréal and, as of 2011, at the Université Laval. The Université de Montréal was the first Canadian university to offer the PharmD program as a first professional degree instead of the BPharm in pharmacy. In 2013, the University of Alberta would be offering a PharmD as a post-professional degree, and a BPharm is required for admission into the program. The University of Toronto replaced their entry-level BPharm curriculum with an entry-to-practice PharmD curriculum in 2011, with approval being granted in 2013.
The PharmD degree is also offered as a postgraduate degree at the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto.
However, by the year 2020, most, if not all Canadian Pharmacy schools will have changed their Entry-To-Practice programs that awarded successful graduates with a Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Sciences to Entry-To-PharmD as the scope of practice for pharmacists continue to expand and change. Once this change is implemented, UBC will no longer have a separate 2-year PharmD Program that is currently offered.
On January 23, 2013, the government of Ontario approved the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo applications for the entry-to-practice Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program. Students graduating in 2015 will be the first cohort under this new undergraduate PharmD program.

===United States of America===

Pharmacy is a health science and profession that melds chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology and other biomedical sciences together. The practice of pharmacy in the US is administered by an appropriately educated and licensed individual charged with ensuring the effective and safe use of drugs used throughout all aspects of patient care. In the United States, Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) is a professional doctorate degree that offers opportunities in research, teaching, clinical practice, industry, manufacturing, judicial, and a multitude of other areas.
After completing the required prerequisites or obtaining a transferrable bachelor's degree, pharmacy school is another four years (some year-round accelerated Pharmacy Schools are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience.  Most schools require students to take an entrance testhttp://www.pharmapplicants.com/schools_that_require_pcat.php (PCAT) and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the Pharm.D. program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, many pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.
Estimated timeline: 2–4 years undergraduate + 3–4 years doctorate + 1–2 years residency (optional) + 1–3 years fellowship (optional) = 5–13 years
A doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) to be eligible to "sit" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). Previously the United States had a 5 year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by ACPE (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated Pharm.D. programs (similar to 6 year MD programs), though in both cases the issuance of a doctoral degree in less than 8 years is controversial.
The current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) from an accredited program, conducting a specified number of hours in internship under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the NAPLEX, and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam (MPJE).
Residency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1–2 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) mandated that a Doctor of Pharmacy degree would be the new professional degree. Currently all accredited schools and colleges of pharmacy in the U.S. offer the Pharm.D. degree. Graduates from a Pharm.D. program may also elect to go into a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1–3 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.

==South America==

===Brazil===

In Brazil the title of pharmacist is awarded after completion of certified graduate studies; while the term PharmD is not formally regulated it can be used and is commonly added to the graduate's professional license (issued by the regional pharmacy (Conselho Regional de Farmacia). By law, graduates in Medicine, Law, Pharmacy, Dental Medicine and Veterinarian Medicine upon receiving their license may use the title of Doctor before their name. In the past, those degrees was awarderd as doctorate and the tradition still remain.
Many Universities award sub-titles or co-titles including Biochemist and Industrial pharmacyst. University of São Paulo and few others have awarded specialization titles for many years for their Pharmacy and Biochemistry graduate students, including toxicological and clinical analysis, food and nutrition and industrial pharmacy which are also equivalent to different degrees in the US and Europe.
Whereas Bachelor of Pharmacy takes a minimum of 4 years, the Pharmacist-Biochemist degree is completed by 4 and 1/2 years of full-time studies with at least 720 hours of internship. The student can opt to get the degree during evening and it takes 6 years with Saturday classes (full day) and also at least 720 hrs of internship.
Although many Universities granted a degree of Doctor in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Doctor in Pharmacy after completion of original research dissertation, those are not professional but a post-graduated course and do not grant permission to work as pharmacist.

===Chile===

In Chile, the title of Pharmacist (Quimico Farmaceutico) is granted after completing 10 or 11 semesters of full-time studies in an acredited University.
The Pharmacist degree is a Professional Degree, awarded after finishing 5 years of study (Bachelor in Pharmacy), and then finish an internship of 6 months on the specialization area of the student (Pharmaceutical Lab, Community Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy).
The pharmacist can get a Master in Pharmaceutical Sciences (MSc), of 2 years, or a Doctorate in Pharmacology (PhD), of 4 years after finished the Bachelor, but these are Academic Degrees, needed for scientific career on investigation, but are not required to work in other professional areas.
