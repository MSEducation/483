La Schelle Tarver (born January 30, 1959 in Modesto, California) is a former backup outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Boston Red Sox during the [tpl]By|1986[/tpl] season. Listed at 5' 11", 165 lb., he batted and threw left-handed.
In a one season career, Tarver was a .120 hitter (3-for-25) with three runs and one RBI in 13 games. He did not have an extrabase or stolen bases. Although he did not steal any bases at the major league level, he was primarily valued for his speed in the outfield and on the base paths. A memorable incident occurred in 1986 when a PA announcer at an opponents ballpark announced him as "Tarver La Schelle".
Tarver also played in the Mets and Red Sox minor league systems (1981–87), hitting .312 with four home runs, 205 RBI, 249 stolen bases, and a .384 on-base percentage in 709 games.
