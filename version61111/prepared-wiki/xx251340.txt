==Background==

Following her launch on the TV show The Big Time, Easton shot to success during the summer of 1980 with two top ten hits; "9 to 5" and "Modern Girl". In October, the third single "One Man Woman" was released. It was also a success peaking at #14 in the UK and #5 in Ireland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=9074 |title="One Man Woman" - UK Chart details|author=Chartstats|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=Search "One Man Woman" - Irish chart information|author=Irishcharts.ie|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] The song was backed by the ballad "Summer's Over" on the B-Side. Like her previous two singles, this was again produced by Christopher Neil and recorded at AIR Studios in London. The song was later included on her debut album, Take My Time, released early the following year. The video for the single featured Easton during a photo shoot.
In November 1980, Easton was invited to appear at The Royal Variety Performance to sing for the Queen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1980s/1980|title=Royal Variety Performance 1980|author=EABF|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] Despite this song being currently in the charts at the time, Easton instead sung "When He Shines", a song from her upcoming album.
