[[Calvinism]]

CATEGORIES: Calvinism, Chalcedonianism, Trinitarianism

Calvinism (also called the Reformed tradition or the Reformed faith) is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians.  Calvinists broke with the Roman Catholic Church but differed with Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things.[tpl]cite book |last= Schaff |first= Philip |title= New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge |chapter= Protestantism |pages= 297–299 |volume= IX |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc09.protestantism.html#protestantism-p89.1[/tpl]
Calvinism can be a misleading term because the religious tradition it denotes is and has always been diverse, with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called "Calvinism" by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word Reformed.[tpl]cite book |last=Hägglund|first=Bengt|title=Teologins Historia|language=German|trans_title=History of Theology|others=Translated by Gene J.

While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word Calvinism is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on soteriology and predestination, which are summarized in part by the five points of Calvinism. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things – in salvation but also in all of life.
Early influential Reformed theologians include John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli, Martin Bucer, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Theodore Beza, and John Knox. In the twentieth century, Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, B. B. Warfield, Karl Barth, and Cornelius Van Til were influential, while contemporary Reformed theologians include J. I. Packer, R. C. Sproul, N. T. Wright, Timothy J. Keller, Alister McGrath,  John Piper, and Michael Horton.
The biggest Reformed association is the World Communion of Reformed Churches with more than 80 million members in 211 member denominations around the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wcrc.ch/theology/ |title=Theology and Communion |website=Wcrc.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/ |title=Member Churches |website=Wcrc.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl] There are more conservative Reformed federations like the World Reformed Fellowship and the International Conference of Reformed Churches.

==History==

First-generation Reformed theologians include Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), Martin Bucer (1491–1551), Wolfgang Capito (1478–1541), John Oecolampadius (1482–1531), and Guillaume Farel (1489–1565). These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctives of Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of scripture as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal theology of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.[tpl]sfn|Muller|2004|pp=131–132[/tpl]
John Calvin (1509–64), Heinrich Bullinger (1504–75), Wolfgang Musculus (1497–1563), Peter Martyr Vermigli (1500–62), and Andreas Hyperius (1511–64) belong to the second generation of Reformed theologians. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536–59) was one of the most influential theologies of the era.[tpl]sfn|Muller|2004|p=132[/tpl] Toward the middle of the 16th century, the Reformed began to commit their beliefs to confessions of faith, which would shape the future definition of the Reformed faith. The 1549 Consensus Tigurinus brought together those who followed Zwingli and Bullinger's memorialist theology of the Lord's supper, which taught that the supper simply serves as a reminder of Christ's death, and Calvin's view that the supper serves as a means of grace with Christ actually present, though spiritually rather than bodily. The document demonstrates the diversity as well as unity in early Reformed theology. The remainder of the 16th century saw an explosion of confessional activity. The stability and breadth of Reformed theology during this  period stand in marked contrast to the bitter controversy experienced by Lutherans prior to the 1579 Formula of Concord.[tpl]sfn|Muller|2004|p=135[/tpl]
Due to Calvin's missionary work in France, his programme of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was adopted in the Electoral Palatinate under Frederick III, which led to the formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This and the Belgic Confession were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Łaski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world. Having established itself in Europe, the movement continued to spread to other parts of the world including North America, South Africa, and Korea.[tpl]Harvnb|Holder|2004|pp=246–256[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|McGrath|1990| pp=198–199[/tpl]
Calvin did not live to see the foundation of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.[tpl]Harvnb|Pettegree|2004|p=222[/tpl]

===Spread===

Although much of Calvin's work was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a "correctly" reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in Scotland (see John Knox), the Netherlands, with men such as William Ames, T. J. Frelinghuysen and Wilhelmus à Brakel and parts of Germany (especially those adjacent to the Netherlands) with the likes of Olevianus and his colleague Zacharias Ursinus. In Hungary and then independent Transylvania Calvinism was a significant religion. In the 16th century the Reformation gained many supporters especially in Eastern Hungary and Transylvania. In these parts the Reformed nobles protected the faith. Today there are about 3.5 million Hungarian Reformed people worldwide.[tpl]cite web|title=The Reformed Church|url=http://www.bocskaihall.org.au/reformed-church.htm|publisher=Hungarian Reformed Church of Australia|accessdate=8 February 2014[/tpl] It was influential in France, Lithuania and Poland. Calvinism gained some popularity in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of Lutheranism after the Synod of Uppsala in 1593.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html |title=The Reformation In Germany And Scandinavia |publisher=Vlib.iue.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl]
Most settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and New England were Calvinists, including the English Puritans, the French Huguenot and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York), and the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the Appalachian back country. Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of South Africa, beginning in the 17th century, who became known as Boers or Afrikaners.
Sierra Leone was largely colonized by Calvinist settlers from Nova Scotia, who were largely Black Loyalists, blacks who had fought for the British during the American War of Independence. John Marrant had organized a congregation there under the auspices of the Huntingdon Connection. Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century missionaries. Especially large are those in Indonesia, Korea and Nigeria. In South Korea there are 20,000 Presbyterian congregations in about 9–10 million church members, scattered in more than 100 Presbyterian denominations. In Korea Presbyterianism is far the biggest Christian denomination.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.crcna.org/news-and-views/touched-devotion-south-korea |title=Touched by Devotion in South Korea | Article | Christian Reformed Church |publisher=Crcna.org |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl]

==Theology==

===Scripture===

Calvinists believe that the Bible (not including the Deuterocanonicals) is the infallible Word of God, and contains all the revelations of God which he designed to be a rule of faith and practice for his Church. The Calvinist doctrine of perspicuity teaches that everything necessary for salvation is taught in the Scriptures plainly enough that special training is not required for interpretation. Church officers are given the authority to preach what is contained within the Scriptures, but this does not permit them to bind Christians to their own interpretation. Christians are to compare interpretations with one another, and even give deference to other Christians and especially the officers ordained above them, but they are always free to personally interpret Scripture.[tpl]cite book|last=Hodge|first=Charles|title=Systematic Theology|year=1940|publisher=WM. B. EERDMANS PUBLISHING CO|pages=151–185|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology1.iii.vi.i.html|volume=1[/tpl]

====Law and Gospel====

Following Lutheran theologians, the Reformed sharply contrast the law and gospel as "the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures." The law contains the moral requirements of God, and is equated with the decalogue, while the gospel is the free offer of forgiveness of sin.[tpl]cite book|last=Ursinus|first=Zacharias|title=The commentary of Dr. Zacharias Ursinus on the Heidelberg catechism|year=1888|publisher=Elm Street Printing Co|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hNpDAAAAYAAJ&pg=pa2|edition=4th[/tpl] As one author nicely put it, being under Law amounts to approaching God through Mount Sinai, whereas being under grace amounts to approaching God through Mount Calvary. (John 1:17) While there may be subtle differences between the Reformed and Lutheran presentations of this doctrine, it has a prominent place in Reformed theology.[tpl]cite journal|last=Horton|first=Michael|title=The Distinction between Law and Gospel in Reformed Faith and Practice|volume=19|issue=5|pages=12–14|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&var1=ArtRead&var2=1164&var3=main|work=Modern Reformation|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2010[/tpl]
The law is given three uses: the political or civil use which is a restraint on sin and stands apart from the work of salvation, the elenctical or pedagogical use which confronts sin and points one to Christ for forgiveness of sin, and the didactic use which teaches believers the way of righteousness, but does not have any power to condemn.[tpl]cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|title=Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology|year=2006|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0801020643|pages=320–321|edition=1st[/tpl] Lutheran and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (tertius usus legis) because the redeemed are expected to bear good works. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.

====Covenant theology====

Although the doctrines of grace have generally received the greater focus in contemporary Calvinism, covenant theology is the historic superstructure that unifies the entire system of doctrine.[tpl]cite book |author = Michael Horton |title=God of Promise, Introducing Covenant Theology |year=2006 |isbn=0-8010-1289-9 |publisher = Baker Books |location = Grand Rapids, Mich.[/tpl]
Calvinists take God's transcendence to mean that the relationship between God and his creation must be by voluntary condescension on God's part. This relationship he establishes is covenantal: the terms of the relationship are unchangeably decreed by God alone.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=VII.I[/tpl]
Reformed writings commonly refer to an intra-Trinitarian covenant of redemption. The greater focus is the relationship between God and man, which in historic Calvinism is seen as bi-covenantal, reflecting the early Reformation distinction between Law and Gospel. The covenant of works encompasses the moral and natural law, dictating the terms of creation. By its terms, man would enjoy eternal life and blessedness based on his continued personal and perfect righteousness. With the fall of man, this covenant continues to operate, but only to condemn sinful man.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=XIX.I,II[/tpl] The covenant of grace is instituted at the fall, and administered through successive historic covenants seen in Scripture for the purpose of redemption. By its terms, salvation comes not by any personal performance, but by promise. Peace with God comes only through a mediator, the fulfillment of which is found in the person and work of Jesus Christ. Christ is seen as the federal head of his elect people, and thus the covenant is the basis of the doctrines of the substitutionary atonement and the imputation of the active obedience of Christ.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=VII.III[/tpl][tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=XIII[/tpl]

===Salvation===

====Sovereign grace====

Calvinism teaches that people are totally depraved or totally inadequate in their ethical nature, necessitating the sovereign grace of God for salvation. It states that fallen people are morally and spiritually incapable of following God or redeeming themselves.[tpl]cite book |last= Calvin |first= John |title= Commentaries to the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians |others= Translated by Rev. William Pringle. |chapter= Ephesians Ch 2:1. |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom41.iii.iv.i.html[/tpl] They see redemption as the work of God; God changes their unwilling hearts from rebellion to eager obedience.
In this view, people are at the complete and total mercy of God, who would be just in condemning all people for their sins, though God has chosen to show mercy to some, not all. In Calvinism some are saved while others are condemned, not because of inclination, foreseen faith, or any virtue in people but because God chooses to have mercy on them (Romans 9:16–17) according to his own purpose which is, ultimately, to glorify Himself (Ephesians 1:11–12).[tpl]cite book |last=Calvin |first= John |title=Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans |others= Translated by John Owen |chapter= Ch 9:10–13 |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom38.xiii.iii.html[/tpl] A person must believe the gospel and repent to be saved, but this compliance of faith is a gift from God (Philippians 1:29; Ephesians 2:8), and thus God completely and sovereignly achieves the salvation of sinners, including the chief (1 Timothy 1:15). In other words, faith is a fruit of regeneration, not the cause of it.  God saves sinners so that they will believe, not because they believe out of their own resources.  Many Reformed theologians teach that people are predestinated to damnation (as the doctrine of reprobation). There is less agreement among the Reformed regarding reprobation than predestination to salvation (the doctrine of election).
Calvinism is distinct from other similar Protestant theologies such as Molinism, Lutheranism, and Classical Arminianism in this area, but they share much common ground with each other.  For instance, the Calvinist doctrine that God saves some but not all is agreed upon by Molinists, Classical Arminians, and Lutherans.  Only Universalists would dispute the limitation of the atonement. The issue disagreed upon is how and why the atonement is limited. There is also agreement that faith is not meritorious,Arminian Theology: Myths and Realities, By Roger E. Olson, (InterVarsity Press, Aug 20, 2009), Page 204,207,210 nor does faith initiate God's salvation,"The Transforming Power of Grace, Thomas Oden (Abingdon Press, 1993), Page 37 presenting a Methodist-Arminian view: "One cannot apart from grace even pray for or hope for, much less initiate, or design, a reborn relationship to God.  One cannot simply grasp , claim, or seize faith, hope, or love.  They are gifts of the Spirit, which, until given, the unawakened sinner cannot cajole or manipulate into birth or possession however...the Spirit works to awaken the cooperation of a human willing with God's own goodwill... Although justification is imputed, wholly as a gift, an answer is required: for what is imputed seeks to be imparted, given in such a way that spiritual gifts can be appropriated as acts of freedom." because faith in God is itself a gift from God, received "as a beggar receives a gift," a description used by both CalvinistsJohn Piper, "Is Faith Meritorious?" link: http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/is-faith-meritorious and Arminians.http://evangelicalarminians.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lopez.-Is-Faith-A-Gift-from-God-or-aHuman-Exercise.pdf These branches of Protestant theology  agree a person cannot exercise faith in God without God first choosing to work spiritually in that personArminian Theology: Myths and Realities, By Roger E. Olson, (InterVarsity Press, Aug 20, 2009), Page 144 (as semi-Pelagianism asserted). The history of Calvinist-Arminian debate here does not revolve around the five solae or the limited number of men saved, or whether people 'merit' salvation through faith or virtue, but it centers on other issues surrounding the reason why some are saved while others are not in the interplay of God's sovereign will and man's will.
In practice, Calvinists teach sovereign grace mostly for encouragement of the church because Calvinists believe the doctrine validates the extent of God's love for saving those who are not able to follow him, or choose not to do so, as well as defeating pride and self-reliance and stressing Christians' total need for and dependence on the grace of God. In a similar way, sanctification in the Calvinist view involves a frequent dependence on God to gain victory over sin, and experience the joy of the Lord.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&var1=ArtRead&var2=270&var3=authorbio&var4=AutRes&var5=42|title=Gospel-Driven Sanctification|author=Bridges, Jerry|accessdate=2007-05-31[/tpl]

====Five points of Calvinism====

Most objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the "five points of Calvinism," also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the mnemonic "TULIP."[tpl]citation|last=Horton|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Horton (theologian)|title=For Calvinism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ezoDtwAACAAJ|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Zondervan Books|isbn=978-0-310-32465-2|page=15[/tpl] The five points are popularly said to summarize the Canons of Dort,[tpl]Citation|last = Sproul|first = R C|authorlink = R. C. Sproul|title = What is Reformed Theology?|publisher = Baker Books|place = Grand Rapids|year = 1997|pages = 27–28[/tpl] however there is no historical relationship between them, and some scholars argue that their language distorts the meaning of the Canons, Calvin's theology, and the theology of 17th-century Calvinistic orthodoxy, particularly in the language of total depravity and limited atonement.[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=Baker Academic|pages=50–51|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)[/tpl]
The central assertion of these points is that God saves every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.

====Nature of the atonement====

An additional point of disagreement with Arminianism implicit in the five points is the Calvinist understanding of the doctrine of Jesus's substitutionary atonement as a punishment for the sins of the elect, which was developed by St. Augustine and especially St. Anselm and Calvin himself. Calvinists argue that if Christ takes the punishment in the place of a particular sinner, that person must be saved since it would be unjust for him then to be condemned for the same sins.[tpl]cite book |last=Calvin |first=John |title=Institutes of the Christian Religion |at=Book 2 Ch 16 |year=1536 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.xvii.html |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] The definitive and binding nature of this satisfaction model has strong implications for each of the five TULIP points, and it has led some Arminians to subscribe instead to the governmental theory of atonement. Under that theory, no particular sins or sinners are in view, but all of humanity are included in those whose sins have been taken away. The atonement was not the penalty of the law, but a substitute for the penalty, which allows God to remit the penalty by his grace when any sinner repents and believes in Jesus as the Christ.[tpl]Bibleref2|John|3:16[/tpl]

====Comparison among Protestants====

===Worship===

====Regulative principle of worship====

The regulative principle of worship is a teaching shared by some Calvinists and Anabaptists on how the Bible orders public worship. The substance of the doctrine regarding worship is that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for worship in the Church and that everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with icons, which he considered violations of the Ten Commandments' prohibition of graven images.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/joh_barber/PT.joh_barber.Luther.Calvin.Music.Worship.html |journal=Reformed Perspectives Magazine |volume=8 |issue=26 |date=25 June 2006 |title=Luther and Calvin on Music and Worship |author=John Barber |accessdate=2008-05-06[/tpl]
On this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed musical instruments and advocated a capella exclusive psalmody in worship,[tpl]cite web |url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year=1998 |title= Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God |author=Brian Schwertley[/tpl] though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms, and this practice typified presbyterian worship and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time.  The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions.[tpl]cite book |first= William D. |last= Maxwell |title= An Outline of Christian Worship: Its Development and Forms |location= London |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1936[/tpl]
Since the 19th century, however, some of the Reformed churches have modified their understanding of the regulative principle and make use of musical instruments, believing that Calvin and his early followers went beyond the biblical requirements and that such things are circumstances of worship requiring biblically-rooted wisdom, rather than an explicit command. Despite the protestations of those who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today hymns and musical instruments are in common use, as are contemporary worship music styles with elements such as worship bands.[tpl]cite book |author=John Frame |title=Worship in Spirit and Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-87552-242-4 |publisher=P&R Pub. |location=Phillipsburg, NJ[/tpl]

===Sacraments===

The Westminster Confession of Faith limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper. Sacraments are denoted "signs and seals of the covenant of grace."[tpl]sfn|1646|loc=XXVII.I[/tpl] Westminster speaks of "a sacramental relation, or a sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other."[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=XXVII.II[/tpl] Baptism is for infant children of believers as well as believers, as it is for all the Reformed except  Baptists and some Congregationalists. Baptism admits the baptized into the visible church, and in it all the benefits of Christ are offered to the baptized.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=XXVII.II[/tpl] On the Lord's supper, Westminster takes a position between Lutheran sacramental union and Zwinglian memorialism: "the Lord's supper really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses."[tpl]sfn|1646|loc=XXVII.I[/tpl]
The 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith does not use the term sacrament, but describes baptism and the Lord's supper as ordinances, as do most Baptists Calvinist or otherwise. Baptism is only for those who "actually profess repentance towards God," and not for the children of believers.[tpl]cite wikisource |title=1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|anchor=Chapter 28: Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper|at=Ch. 28 Sec. 2[/tpl] Baptists also insist on immersion or dipping, in contradistinction to other Reformed Christians.[tpl]cite wikisource |title=1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|anchor=#Chapter 28: Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper |at= Ch. 28 Sec. 4[/tpl] The Baptist Confession, describes the Lord's supper as "the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance," similarly to the Westminster Confession.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=XXIX.VII[/tpl] There is significant latitude in Baptist congregations regarding the Lord's supper, and many hold the Zwinglian view.

===Logical order of God's decree===

There are two schools of thought regarding the logical order of God's decree to ordain the fall of man: supralapsarianism (from the Latin: supra, "above", here meaning "before" + lapsus, "fall") and infralapsarianism (from the Latin: infra, "beneath", here meaning "after" + lapsus, "fall"). The former view, sometimes called "high Calvinism", argues that the Fall occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called "low Calvinism", is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.
Supralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save logically prior to the decision to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to hell and others to heaven (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the reprobate and the need for salvation in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be "saved", one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.
These two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort, an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism (Canons of Dort, First Point of Doctrine, Article 7). The Westminster Confession of Faith also teaches (in Hodge's words "clearly implies") the infralapsarian[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.ii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Supralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04[/tpl] view, but is sensitive to those holding to supralapsarianism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Infralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04[/tpl] The Lapsarian controversy has a few vocal proponents on each side today, but overall it does not receive much attention among modern Calvinists.

==Variants==

===Amyraldism===

Amyraldism (or sometimes Amyraldianism, also known as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iv.html |title=Systematic Theology - Volume II - Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-07-21 |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl] post redemptionism,Benjamin B. Warfield, Works vol. V,Calvin and Calvinism, pp. 364–365, and vol. VI, The Westminster Assembly and Its Work, pp. 138–144. moderate Calvinism,Michael Horton in J. Matthew Pinson (ed.), Four Views on Eternal Security, 113. or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that God, prior to his decree of election, decreed Christ's atonement for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.
Named after its formulator Moses Amyraut, this doctrine is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors like B. B. Warfield have termed it "an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism."Warfield, B. B., The Plan of Salvation (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973)

===Hyper-Calvinism===

Hyper-Calvinism first referred to a view that appeared among the early English Particular Baptists in the 18th century. Their system denied that the call of the gospel to "repent and believe" is directed to every single person and that it is the duty of every person to trust in Christ for salvation. The term also occasionally appears in both theological and secular controversial contexts, where it usually connotes a negative opinion about some variety of theological determinism, predestination, or a version of Evangelical Christianity or Calvinism that is deemed by the critic to be unenlightened, harsh, or extreme.
The Westminster Confession of Faith says that the gospel is to be freely offered to sinners, and the Larger Catechism makes clear that the gospel is offered to the non-elect.[tpl]sfn |WCF|1646|loc=VII.III[/tpl][tpl]cite wikisource |title=Westminster Larger Catechism|anchor=Q. 51–100|at=Question 68[/tpl]

===Neo-Calvinism===

Neo-Calvinism, a form of Dutch Calvinism, is the movement initiated by the theologian and former Dutch prime minister Abraham Kuyper. James Bratt has identified a number of different types of Dutch Calvinism: The Seceders—split into the Reformed Church "West" and the Confessionalists; and the Neo-Calvinists—the Positives and the Antithetical Calvinists. The Seceders were largely infralapsarian and the Neo-Calvinists usually supralapsarian.James Bratt, Dutch Calvinism in Modern America. Wipf and Stock; original Eerdmans (1984)
Kuyper wanted to awaken the church from what he viewed as its pietistic slumber. He declared:
 No single piece of our mental world is to be sealed off from the rest and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'James E. McGoldrick, Abraham Kuyper: God's Renaissance Man. (Welwyn, UK: Evangelical Press, 2000).  
This refrain has become something of a rallying call for Neo-Calvinists.

==Social and economic influences==

===Usury and capitalism===

One school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of usury and, implicitly, of profit in general.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] Such a connection was advanced in influential works by R. H. Tawney (1880–1962) and by Max Weber (1864–1920).
Calvin expressed himself on usury in a 1545 letter to a friend, Claude de Sachin, in which he criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.The letter is quoted in [tpl]cite book | last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 [/tpl]
He qualified his view, however, by saying that money should be lent to people in dire need without hope of interest, while a modest interest rate of 5% should be permitted in relation to other borrowers.See [tpl]cite book | last = Haas | first = Guenther H. | title = The Concept of Equity in Calvin's Ethics | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, Ont., Canada | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-88920-285-0 | pages = 117ff [/tpl]

==Politics and society==

Calvin's concept of God and man contained strong elements of freedom that were gradually put into practice after his death, in particular in the fields of politics and society. 
After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the Netherlands, under Calvinist leadership, became, besides England, the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French Huguenots, English Independents (Congregationalists), and Jews from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher Baruch Spinoza were Portuguese Jews. Aware of the trial against Galileo, René Descartes lived in the Netherlands, out of reach of the Inquisition.Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Descartes, René, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band II, col. 88 Pierre Bayle, a Reformed Frenchman, also felt safer in the Netherlands than in his home country. He was the first prominent philosopher who demanded tolerance for atheists. Hugo Grotius was able to publish a rather liberal interpretation of the Bible and his ideas about natural law.Karl Heussi, Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte, 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), p. 396-397H. Knittermeyer, Bayle, Pierre, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band I, col. 947 Moreover, the Calvinist Dutch authorities allowed the printing of books that could not be published elsewhere, e.g. Galileo's Discorsi.Bertolt Brecht, Leben des Galilei, Bild 15
Even more important than the liberal development of the Netherlands was the rise of modern democracy in England and North America. In the Middle Ages state and church had been closely connected. Martin Luther’s doctrine of the two kingdoms separated state and church in principle.Heinrich Bornkamm, Toleranz, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 941 His doctrine of the priesthood of all believers raised the laity to the same level as the clergy.B. Lohse, Priestertum, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 579–580 Going one step further, Calvin included elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his concept of church government. The Huguenots added synods whose members were also elected by the congregations. The other Reformed churches took over this system of church self-government which was essentially a representative democracy.Karl Heussi, Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte, p. 325 Baptists, Quakers, and Methodists are organized in a similar way. These denominations and the Anglican Church were influenced by Calvin’s theology in varying degrees.Karl Heussi, Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte, pp. 329–330, 382, 422–424
Another precondition for the rise of democracy in the Anglo-American world was the fact that Calvin favored a mixture of democracy and aristocracy as the best form of government (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy.Jan Weerda, Calvin, in Evangelisches Soziallexikon, 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210 The aim of his political thought was to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ordinary men and women. In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political absolutism and furthered the cause of democracy.Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), History of Religion in the United States, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 10 The Congregationalists who founded Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.M. Schmidt, Pilgerväter, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 384Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, p. 18 Enjoying self-rule they practiced separation of powers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.histarch.uiuc.edu/plymouth/ccflaw.html |title=Plymouth Colony Legal Structure |publisher=Histarch.uiuc.edu |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl]Allan Weinstein and David Rubel (2002), The Story of America: Freedom and Crisis from Settlement to Superpower, DK Publishing, Inc., New York, N.Y., ISBN 0-7894-8903-1, pp. 56–62 Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, founded by Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively, combined democratic government with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.Clifton E.

Gaustad (1999), Liberty of Conscience: Roger Williams in America, Judson Press, Valley Forge
In England, Baptists Thomas Helwys and John Smyth influenced the liberal political thought of Presbyterian poet and politician John Milton and philosopher John Locke, who in turn had both a strong impact on the political development in their home country (English Civil War, Glorious Revolution) as well as in North America.G. Müller-Schwefe, Milton, John, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 954–955Karl Heussi, Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte, p. 398 The ideological basis of the American Revolution was largely provided by the radical Whigs, who had been inspired by Milton, Locke, James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and other thinkers. The Whigs’ "perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestantism that had always verged on Puritanism."Robert Middlekauff (2005), The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789, Revised and Enlarged Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y., ISBN 978-0-19-531588-2, pp. 52, 136 The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution and (American) Bill of Rights initiated a tradition of human and civil rights that was continued in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen and the constitutions of numerous countries around the world, e. g. Latin America, Japan, Germany, and other European countries. It is also echoed in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Douglas K. Stevenson (1987), American Life and Institutions, Stuttgart (Germany), p. 34
In the nineteenth century, the churches that were based on Calvin’s theology or influenced by it were deeply involved in social reforms, e.g. the abolition of slavery (William Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Abraham Lincoln, and others), women suffrage, and prison reforms.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, pp. 353–375M. Schmidt, Kongregationalismus, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band III, col. 1769–1771 Members of these churches formed co-operatives to help the impoverished masses.Wilhelm Dietrich, Genossenschaften, in Evangelisches Soziallexikon, 3. Auflage (1958), col. 411–412 Henry Dunant, a Reformed pietist, founded the Red Cross and initiated the Geneva Conventions.Ulrich Scheuner, Genfer Konventionen, in Evangelisches Soziallexikon, 3. Auflage, col. 407–408R. Pfister, Schweiz, in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 1614–1615
Some sources would view Calvinist influence as not always being solely positive.  The Boers and so-called Afrikaner Calvinists allegedly used a twisted form of Calvinism and Kuyperian theology to justify apartheidWelfare, Religion and Gender in Post-apartheid South Africa: Constructing a South-North Dialogue, AFRICAN SUN MeDIA, (Jan 1, 2012), Page 326 in South Africa (see Afrikaner Calvinism). As late as 1974, the majority of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa was convinced that their theological stances (including the story of the Tower of Babel) could justify apartheid.Maintaining Apartheid Or Promoting Change?: The Role of the Dutch Reformed Church in a Phase of Increasing Conflict in South Africa, Wolfram Weisse, Carel Aaron Anthonissen, Waxmann Verlag, (Jan 1, 2004), Page 124-126 In 1990, the Dutch Reformed Church document Church and Society maintained that although they were changing their stance on apartheid, they believed that within apartheid and under God's sovereign guidance, "...everything was not without significance, but was of service to the Kingdom of God." ibid., Page 131. It should be noted that these views were not universal and were condemned by many Calvinists outside South Africa. It was pressure from both outside and inside the Dutch Reformed Calvinist church which helped reverse apartheid in South Africa.  Even Calvin was not always above his own time, and as an influential leader in Geneva he helped ensure that people were kept under close watch and that crimes and sins (such as failure to attend church or laughing in church) were punished more severely than before his leadership.History of the Christian Church, by Phillip Schaff, Chapter 13, Section 107: "Calvin succeeded after a fierce struggle in infusing the Church of Geneva with his views on discipline...Even the number of dishes at meals was regulated. Attendance on public worship was commanded on penalty of three sols. When a refugee from Lyons once gratefully exclaimed, "How glorious is the liberty we enjoy here," a woman bitterly replied: "Free indeed we formerly were to attend mass, but now we are compelled to hear a sermon." Watchmen were appointed to see that people went to church. The members of the Consistory visited every house once a year to examine into the faith and morals of the family. Every unseemly word and act on the street was reported, and the offenders were cited before the Consistory to be either censured and warned, or to be handed over to the Council for severer punishment...Three men who had laughed during the sermon were imprisoned for three days... A girl was beheaded for striking her parents, to vindicate the dignity of the fifth commandment... Calvin was, as he himself confessed, not free from impatience, passion, and anger, which were increased by his physical infirmities; but he was influenced by an honest zeal for the purity of the Church, and not by personal malice."
Throughout the world, the Reformed churches operate hospitals, homes for handicapped or elderly people, and educational institutions on all levels. For example, American Congregationalists founded Harvard (1636), Yale (1701), and about a dozen other colleges.Clifton E. Olmstead, History of Religion in the United States, pp. 80, 89, 257 Princeton was a Presbyterian foundation.
