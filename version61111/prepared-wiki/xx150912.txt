==Early life==

Fields grew up in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1959, he attended Harvard Law School, but left during his first year. He moved to Manhattan's Greenwich Village in 1960, briefly enrolled at New York University, and became involved with the burgeoning downtown arts and music scene.

==Career==

Fields was an editor at a music magazine, Datebook, when he began frequenting Max's Kansas City It was there that he developed connections to Andy Warhol's Factory social circle. Fields occasionally shared his loft with Warhol actress Edie Sedgwick,[tpl]cite journal |last1=Seabrook |first1=John |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |title=The Back Room |journal=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |volume= |issue=August 30, 2010 |pages=26–27 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/08/30/100830ta_talk_seabrook |doi= [/tpl] and wrote an account of the Warhol-sponsored Velvet Underground during their early years. He later penned the liner notes for the band's historic Live At Max's Kansas City album, recorded in 1970, but released in 1972, after the band broke up. Fields was one of the first people in the music business to be openly gay, at a time when most were closeted.
Fields hosted a radio show on New Jersey's WFMU during its groundbreaking 1968-1969 free-form years, and he was hired by Elektra Records as a publicist. Elektra, which had primarily been a folk music label, was having huge success in the rock record market with The Doors, and hired Fields to publicize the band, despite the fact (discussed by Fields in numerous interviews) that he and lead singer Jim Morrison did not like each other. Despite this mutual antagonism, Fields' PR skills got Morrison on many key teen magazine covers in 1968. In September 1968, Fields visited Detroit and Ann Arbor on the recommendation of two fellow DJs at WFMU. He recommended to Elektra that the label sign the MC5 and The Stooges. Both bands served as major inspirations for the US and UK punk music movements of the mid-to-late 1970s. 
In 1975, Fields discovered the Ramones at CBGB, and helped get them signed to Sire Records. As the band's co-manager, with Linda Stein, Fields brought the band to England, where they had an enormous impact, inspiring the nascent UK punk movement, including such bands as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Damned. Under Fields' management the Ramones recorded Ramones, Leave Home, and Rocket to Russia. The 1980 Ramones album End of the Century includes the track "Danny Says", about Fields.
Fields later managed other performers, including The Modern Lovers and Steve Forbert. In 1990, Fields discovered singer-songwriter Paleface at a performance in New York's Chameleon club and became his manager: he helped the young artist get signed to Polygram Records.[tpl]cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5tGSN9fYYiQJ:www.answers.com/topic/paleface-2+paleface+danny+fields&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us |title=Artist: Paleface |author=All Music Guide  |year=2010 |work= |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2010-10-30 [/tpl]
After leaving the music business, Fields co-authored Dream On, the biography of Warhol actress Cyrinda Foxe, the wife of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. He subsequently wrote Linda McCartney: A Portrait, which was turned into a television miniseries by CBS. Fields currently lives in New York City.

(1997), 25 Years of Punk (2001), MC5: A True Testimonial (2002), End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones (2003), and A Walk Into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory (2007), It's Alive 1974-1996 (2007), and Lords of the Revolution: Andy Warhol (2009).
