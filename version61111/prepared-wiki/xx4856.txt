[[Inoculation]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology, Smallpox, Smallpox vaccines

Inoculation (also known as variolation) was a historical method for the prevention of smallpox by deliberate inoculation into the skin  of material from smallpox pustules. This generally produced a less severe infection than naturally-acquired smallpox, but still induced immunity to it. The term entered medical English through horticultural usage meaning  to graft a bud (or eye) from one plant into another. It is derived from the  Latin in + oculus (eye).[tpl]cite web|title=Inoculate|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Inoculate|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] Though innoculation/innoculate is sometimes seen, this is incorrect, possibly erroneously thought to be related to innocuous, which is derive from the Latin in + nocuus (= not harmful).
The terms inoculation, vaccination, immunization and injection are often used synonymously to refer to artificial induction of immunity against various infectious diseases. This is supported by some dictionaries.[tpl]cite web|title=Inoculate|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Inoculation|publisher=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Inject|url=http://Thefreedictionary.com/inject|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] However, there are some important historical and current differences. In English medicine inoculation referred only to the prevention of smallpox until the very early 1800s. When Edward Jenner introduced smallpox vaccine in 1798 this was initially called cowpox inoculation or vaccine inoculation. Soon, to avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was referred to as variolation (from variola = smallpox) and cowpox inoculation was referred to as vaccination (from Jenner's use of Variolae vaccinae = smallpox of the cow). Then, in 1891 Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms vaccine/vaccination should be extended to include the new protective procedures being developed. Immunization refers to the use of all vaccines but also extends to the use of antitoxin, which contains preformed antibody to e.g diphtheria or tetanus exotoxins. Inoculation is now more or less synonymous in nontechnical usage with injection etc, and the question e.g 'Have you had your flu injection/vaccination/inoculation/immunization?' should not cause confusion. The focus is on what is being given and why, not the literal meaning of the technique used.
Inoculation also has a specific meaning for procedures done in vitro. These include the transfer of microorganisms into and from laboratory apparatus such as test tubes and petri dishes in research and diagnostic laboratories, and also in commercial applications such as brewing, baking and the production of antibiotics.
In almost all cases the material inoculated is called the inoculum, or less commonly the inoculant, although the term culture is also used for work done in vitro.

==Origins==

===India===

Variolation is documented in India from the eighteenth century, thanks to the 1767 account by J. Z. Holwell.[tpl]cite book|last=Holwell|first=John Zephaniah|title=An Account of the Manner of Inoculating for the Small Pox in the East Indies with ... Observations on the ... Mode of Treating that Disease in those Parts|year=1767|publisher=T. Becket & P. A. de Hondt|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/accountofmannero00holw[/tpl]  Holwell's extensive 1767 description included the following statement, on p.25, that points to the connection between disease and "multitudes of imperceptible animalculae floating in the atmosphere":
 
 They lay it down as a principle, that the immediate cause of the smallpox exists in the mortal part of every human and animal form; that the mediate (or second) acting cause, which stirs up the first, and throws it into a state of fermentation, is multitudes of imperceptible animalculae floating in the atmosphere; that these are the cause of all epidemical diseases, but more particularly of the small pox. 

Holwell ascribes this account to his Brahman informants.  However, such a theory has not yet been discovered in any Sanskrit or vernacular treatise.[tpl]cite book|last=Meulenbeld|first=Gerrit Jan|title=A history of Indian medical literature|year=1999–2002|publisher=Egbert Forsten|location=Groningen[/tpl]    Holwell's use of the word "animalculae" suggests that he may have been aware of the observations of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made in about 1683.  Other parts of Holwell's account, especially his use of the idea of "immediate" and "mediate" causation, and the concept of "fermentation," suggest a non-Indian source for his ideas outlined in this passage, which remain of great research interest.
Several historians have suggested that variolation may be older than the eighteenth century in India,E.g., [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianscience.org/dyk/t_dy_Q14.shtml|title=Did you know that smallpox inoculation started in India before the West?|last=Agrawal|first=D.P.|authorlink=D. P. Agrawal |coauthors=Tiwari, Lalit|publisher=HIST: History of Indian Science and Technology|accessdate=2009-11-06[/tpl] but historical evidence for this assertion is lacking.  The widespread rumour since the nineteenth century that vaccination was documented in India before the discoveries of Edward Jenner can all be traced to propaganda tracts written in Sanskrit and the Indian vernaculars by colonial officers, in the pious hope of convincing Indians to accept the newly discovered Jennerian procedure.[tpl]cite book|last=Wujastyk|first=Dominik|title=Studies in Indian Medical History|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=121–154|url=https://www.academia.edu/451964|edition=2|editor=G.

Holwell's account proves beyond doubt that smallpox inoculation was practised in India in the eighteenth century.  Yet no Sanskrit or vernacular Indian sources yet discovered mention the practice.  That such a major medical procedure would not be documented by the normally verbose members of the Brahman caste remains a historical puzzle.  Some details of the practice described by Holwell (sniffing) suggest Chinese practice.

===China===

The British historian Joseph Needham and the American historian Robert Temple write that the practice of inoculation for smallpox began in China during the 10th century.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 135.Needham, Joseph. (2000). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 6, Medicine. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.154 A Song Dynasty (960–1279) chancellor of China, Wang Dan (957–1017), lost his eldest son to smallpox and sought a means to spare the rest of his family from the disease, so he summoned physicians, wise men, and magicians from all across the empire to convene at the capital in Kaifeng and share ideas on how to cure patients of it.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 135–136. From Mount Emei in Sichuan, a Daoist hermit, a nun known as a "numinous old woman" and "holy physician"—who Temple says was associated with the 'school of the ancient immortals' and thus most likely specialized in 'internal alchemy'—introduced the technique of inoculation to the capital.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 136. However, the sinologist Joseph Needham states that this information comes from the Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang, centuries after the alleged events.
The first clear and credible reference to smallpox inoculation in China comes from Wan Quan's (1499–1582) Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549, which states that some women unexpectedly menstruate during the procedure, yet his text did not give details on techniques of inoculation. Inoculation was first vividly described by Yu Chang in his book Yuyi cao (寓意草), or Notes on My Judgment, published in 1643. Inoculation was reportedly not widely practised in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567–1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), as written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (痧痘集解) of 1727, which he alleges was based on Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579.Needham, Joseph. (1999). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 6, Medicine. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Page 134.Temple, Robert. (1986). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention. With a forward by Joseph Needham. New York: Simon and Schuster, Inc. ISBN 0-671-62028-2. Page 137. From these accounts, it is known that the Chinese banned the practice of using smallpox material from patients who actually had the full-blown disease of Variola major (considered too dangerous); instead they used proxy material of a cotton plug inserted into the nose of a person who had already been inoculated and had only a few scabs, i.e. Variola minor. This was called "to implant the sprouts", an idea of transplanting the disease which fit their conception of beansprouts in germination. Robert Temple quotes an account from Zhang Yan's Zhongdou xinshu (種痘新書), or New book on smallpox inoculation, written in 1741 during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), which shows how the Chinese process had become refined up until that point:
As for other methods used in China, the technique of scratching the skin and putting pox onto the scab seems to have developed later than the first accounts made in China, and possibly came from Central Asia—according to Temple.

===Ethiopia===

Early travellers to Ethiopia report that variolation was practiced by the Amhara and Tigray peoples. The first European to report this was Nathaniel Pearce, who noted that it was performed by a debtera who would collect "a quantity of matter" from a person with the most sores from small pox, then he "cuts a small cross with a razor in the arm" of his subject and put "a little of the matter" into the cut which was afterwards bound up with a bandage. Subsequent visitors who described this practice included W.C. Harris and Dr. Petit of the French scientific mission of 1839-1841.Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1999), pp. 26f

===West Africa===

The knowledge of inoculating oneself against smallpox seems to have been known to West Africans, more specifically the Akan. A slave named Onesimus explained the inoculation procedure to Cotton Mather during the 18th century, he reported to have gotten the knowledge from Africa.Waldstreicher, David. Runaway America: Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the American Revolution. Macmillan; p. 40, ISBN 0-8090-8314-0

==Importation to the West==

The practice was introduced to the west by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (May 26, 1689 – August 21, 1762).  Lady Montagu's husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, served as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1716 to 1718.  She witnessed firsthand the Turkish use of inoculation in Istanbul,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-islamic-inventors-changed-the-world-469452.html|title=How Islamic inventors changed the world|date=11 March 2008|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 February 2012|location=London[/tpl] and was greatly impressed:Donald R. Hopkins, Princes and Peasants: Smallpox in History (University of Chicago Press, 1983) she had lost a brother to smallpox and bore facial scars from the disease herself. When a smallpox epidemic threatened England in 1721, she called on her physician to inoculate her daughter. She invited friends to see her daughter, including Sir Hans Sloane, the King's physician. Sufficient interest arose that Maitland gained permission to test inoculation at Newgate prison in exchange for their freedom on six prisoners due to be hanged, an experiment which was witnessed by a number of notable doctors.[ref]
