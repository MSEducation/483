Her work at SETI focuses on extending outreach activities and design in terms of scope, scale, and methods of engagement towards architecture, installations, environments, social system, performances, experiences and narratives, as events.

==Extreme Fieldwork==

Ben Hayoun speaks about the value of ‘extreme’ fieldwork which she considers an essential part of designer training. For Ben Hayoun, designing experiences implies tangibility, hence fieldwork, and working collaboratively with experts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2010/12/the-other-volcano.php#.UhAralNQ0zQ |title=The Other Volcano |publisher=we make money not art |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl] Ben Hayoun’s design practice brought her investigation to the empty lands of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Large Hadron Collider, CERN situated 100m below ground.[tpl]cite web|author=Nelly Ben Hayoun |url=http://www.nellyben.com/projects/dark-energy-in-the-kitchen-sink/ |title=Dark Energy in the Kitchen Sink - Nelly Ben Hayoun |publisher=Nellyben.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl] She has also collided atoms at SLAC, trapped herself in a Soyuz rocket capsule in Baikonur Cosmodrome,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2011/08/10/unknown-fields-division-part-iii-baikonur-cosmodrome.html |title=Unknown Fields Division Part III: Baikonur Cosmodrome |publisher=Domusweb.it |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl] and experienced a sonic Booum in the neutrino Observatory Super Kamiokande[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.superksonic.com/the-project |title=The Project | Super K Sonic Booooum |publisher=Superksonic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28[/tpl] in Japan.
About her practice she said: "My working method is to go in situ in scientists’ research centres and design events that radically change and adapt their attitudes to their research to a non-scientific audience’s creative needs. Design should be embedded in a physical experience, it should be something you remember like seeing a painting and remembering the tone of it."Ough Interview

==Director of the International Space Orchestra (ISO)==

"We Transfer's 18 million monthly active users will be able to experience the places I go, the activities I do and the people I meet. Each entry will be numbered so people can follow the diaries as they are published," This will extend into a further storytelling platform that will incorporate the service's app, she explains. "I have my practice, which is all about bringing the scientific and creative communities together through carefully designed experiences, and ultimately WeTransfer is about creating unique experiences for their community of digital users."
