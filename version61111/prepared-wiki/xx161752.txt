[[Are U Ready?]]

CATEGORIES: French songs, Pakito songs, 2007 singles

"Are U Ready?" is a dance song recorded by French DJ Pakito. It was the third and last single from his debut album Video, after the previous two European hits "Living on Video" and "Moving on Stereo", and was released on March 2007 in Finland, and two months later in the other countries. "Are U Ready?" was a top ten hit in Poland, Finland and France (where it reached its highest position #2), but achieved a moderate success in Belgium.
The music, which uses a sample from Groove Coverage's 2000 song, "Are U Ready", was remixed by Julien Ranouil (as for Pakito's previous single), Xavier Longuep√©e and David Toinet, and the single was published by Universal Music. The words "Are U Ready" are the only lyrics of "Are U Ready?", repeated throughout the song by a female voice.
