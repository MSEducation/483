==History==

The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the Sixteen Mile Creek; Martin immigrated from Newcastle, England with his wife Sarah and two sons on May 17, 1818. Martin was granted [tpl]convert|100|acre|ha[/tpl] of land, from the Crown in 1820, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, Township of Trafalgar, Halton County, in the District of Gore. Martin later built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as Mill Pond, to power his mill.  The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region.  In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named Mill Town.  The town, as it is today, soon after became known as Milton.  The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters.  The current site of Milton's town hall was donated from Mr. Hugh Foster (and thus, Hugh Foster Hall).Town of Milton
Milton was incorporated into a town in 1857, after being chosen as county seat for Halton. In 1974, the present municipal structure was created when the Regional Municipality of Halton replaced Halton County. The new town of Milton added parts of the former township of Esquesing (most of this township comprises Halton Hills), all of Nassagaweya Township including the village of Campbellville, and the northern sections of Trafalgar and Nelson from (a 1962 annexation of the former townships) Oakville and Burlington respectively.
With the addition of the Niagara Escarpment lands, tourism, recreation, and heritage conservation have increased in importance.  The Halton Region Museum which has a large number of historic agricultural buildings and the Halton County Radial Railway museum are located in Milton, as is Country Heritage Park (formerly the Ontario Agricultural Museum). Five large parks operated by Conservation Halton reside in the town and Mohawk Raceway is located near Campbellville. It is also home to Maplehurst Correctional Complex and the Vanier Centre for Women.

There is close proximity to  Toronto Pearson International Airport along Highway 401 (under 40Â km from 401/Halton 25 exit).
Milton Transit was developed in 1972 to provide public transportation service throughout the urban centre, as well as a feeder route for GO Transit trains and buses.
While most of the development is suburban in nature, larger industrial lots are being developed closer to the Escarpment.  The major industries in Milton are automotive, advanced manufacturing, distribution and food production.
Residential growth has increased substantially over the past several years due to completion of "The Big Pipe" project; designed to deliver water to the town from Lake Ontario.  Since this time, Milton has developed 7 new subdivisions, including Hawthorne Village, and several new ones are under development by Mattamy Homes and various other builders.  Two new grade schools have been built as well as the Crossroads Centre shopping plaza that includes various major retail stores and restaurants.
