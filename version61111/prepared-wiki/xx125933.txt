[[Aslan's Country]]

CATEGORIES: The Chronicles of Narnia countries, Fictional concepts of the afterlife

Aslan's Country is a fictional location from C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia series. It is the home of Aslan, the great lion. It is described as a series of mountains, thousands of feet high, but without snow or ice. Instead, Aslan's Country has a clear blue sky, lush green grass, colourful birds, and beautiful trees. There are entrances to Aslan's Country from all worlds, including Narnia and Earth. It is located beyond Narnia's rising sun at the eastern edge of the world, and indeed rings around the whole Narnian world.

===The Voyage of the Dawn Treader===

In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, the third published book of the series, King Caspian X of Narnia set out to the eastern edge of the world to find seven lost lords of Narnia. At the end of the voyage, Reepicheep, a talking mouse, went directly to Aslan's Country. (VDT Ch. 16)

===The Silver Chair===

At the beginning of The Silver Chair, Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole escape from bullies at a boarding school in England and find themselves in Aslan's Country, where they meet Aslan. They are then blown to Narnia by Aslan's breath. At the end of the book they find themselves back in Aslan's Country, where they meet the resurrected King Caspian and are sent back to England. (SC   Ch. 1,16)

===The Last Battle===

At the end of The Last Battle, there is a stable door that leads to Aslan's country. For creatures that have not believed in Aslan, the stable door leads inside of a stable that is said to hold the false god "Tashlan". For creatures that have believed in Aslan—including King Tirian, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole—the door leads to part of Aslan's country. It is there that they meet the three Pevensie children (excluding Susan) and the elderly Digory Kirke and Polly  Plummer. Aslan later summons all creatures in the world of Narnia to the stable door to be judged: all creatures look at Aslan and are separated, the "good" creatures going to Aslan's country, and the "bad" going to an unmentioned place. The Narnian world is then destroyed.
The part of Aslan's country that they are brought to is described as a larger Narnia: it is exactly like the old one only perfect. It is also discovered that there are several worlds like it that jut out from the mountains of Aslan's Country. It is where creatures from all worlds come to live at their death or the end of their world.

==Commentary==

Because, as Lewis wrote, "He Aslan is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?'" [tpl]Harvard citation|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=[/tpl] it is natural to associate Aslan's Country with the Christian heaven.  It is where Narnians who love Aslan go at death [tpl]Harvard citation|Lewis|1953|pp=ch16[/tpl] and where all Narnians who "looked in the face of Aslan and loved him" arrive at the end of the world [tpl]Harvard citation|Lewis|1956|pp=ch14[/tpl]. The representation of Heaven as a mountain is Biblical: "Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord?"
Aslan's Country also represents Plato's World of Ideas, of which the physical world and the ideas in our minds are alike copies.  In The Last Battle it is explained that all worlds, including the Narnia world and our own, are spurs from Aslan's Mountain, and Professor Kirke comments "All in Plato, all in Plato".
