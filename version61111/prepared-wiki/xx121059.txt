==History==

It was formerly known as Dance Dimension Project.  ECNAD (http://www.ecnad.org) is one of the first non government professional creative dance company that mushroomed amidst the then cultural desert of Singapore.  This in turn sparks off the formation of many new contemporary dance companies in Singapore, a phenomenon never seem before in the modern cultural history of Singapore.  Its founders and artistic directors Tan How Choon and Lim Chin Huat (Lim was 2000 Young Artist Award recipient) who are 2 ordinary individuals of indigenous approach to expression despite their western influences in fine arts, dance and sport training backgrounds.
From 1997 to 2000, it initiated a series of outreach site-specific works at fountains and architectural spaces in the urban environment. Suntec City fountain,Dancing Bodies: Culture and Modernity Bugis Junction fountain, Millennia Walk and UOB Plaza Atrium are some of the performance venues. These are projects that aims at facilitating environment and dance aesthetics of the general public through performances that highlight and work with the existing aesthetics of the chosen space.  In fact, this is at that time, one of the first of its kind project by private individuals never seem before by the republic.
ECNAD has performed more than 50 creations over the past 12 years as in year 2008.

The word "ecnad" is now becoming popular worldwide in representing performing arts activities and companies.  It has also been attached with the meaning of "someone who lives for dancing".Crazy Dictionary  The word "ecnad" has indeed come a long way since it was invented in 1996 by the Singaporean artists!
