Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus was a Roman statesman and consul (145 BC).
Fabius was by adoption a member of the patrician gens Fabia, but by birth he was the eldest son of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus and Papiria Masonis and the elder brother of Scipio Aemilianus. He was the father of Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus.
Fabius served under his blood father in the Third Macedonian War and was sent by his father to Rome to announce the news of the Roman victory at Pydna. Fabius served as praetor in Sicily during 149 BC-148 BC and was elected consul for 145 BC. After his consulship he went as proconsul to Hispania where he fought and defeated Viriathus in an episode of the Lusitanian War but failed to capture him and the war went on until the fall of Numantia by his brother a decade later.
Fabius and his brother were the pupils and patrons of the historian Polybius, who recorded the strong fraternal bond between the brothers, even after their adoption into other houses.
