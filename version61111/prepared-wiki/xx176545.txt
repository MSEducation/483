On 20 April 1806 the Governor King arrived off Port Jackson from Norfolk Island.  Finding the wind direction unfavourable for entering the harbour the ship headed north to Newcastle and dropped anchor in the harbour.  A strong current dragged the ship on the 22 April and it hit the rocks so violently that the stern shattered and it filled instantly, breaking up in a few hours. The crew and much of the cargo of pork being carried was saved but the ship was completely destroyed.Australian Shipwrecks - vol1 1622-1850, Charles Bateson, AH and AW Reed, Sydney, 1972, ISBN 0-589-07112-2 p41
