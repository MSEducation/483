Scream is the third solo studio album by American musician Chris Cornell. Released on March 10, 2009 through Suretone Records and Mosley Music Group, it marked a shift from Cornell's previous musical efforts with the exclusion of some guitar and rock elements that were replaced with producer Timbaland's electronic pop soundscapes. The album was promoted with the release of five digital singles and three music videos, and was met with mostly negative reviews. The album debuted in the U.S at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 26,000 copies sold.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269179/kelly-clarkson-tops-billboard-200 |title=Information Not Found |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27[/tpl]

==Production==

===Recording history===

With the idea of remixing songs from his previous album Carry On (2007), Cornell first came into contact with Timbaland.[tpl]cite news |title = Chris Cornell Unveils Timbaland-Produced Tracks That Sound Like ... Chris Cornell And Timbaland |publisher = MTV|date = 2008-07-24 |url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591482/20080724/audioslave.jhtml?rsspartner=rssFeedBurner |accessdate = 2008-09-08[/tpl] However, the collaboration evolved into the duo writing and recording an entire album in just six weeks, notably with the conceptual direction of "tying it all together musically", which Cornell describes as "harkening back to albums that I listened to when I was a kid, where the music never stops" and that it "begs to be listened to on headphones all the way through".

===Musical style===

Billboard reported that Scream shows Cornell moving "in a much more R&B-oriented direction, with busy drum machine beats, buffed-up chorus vocals and string samples filling the nooks and crannies", comparing it to Gnarls Barkley and less that of "the guitar-driven music of Cornell's past with Soundgarden and Audioslave". Despite the controversy caused by teaming up with Timbaland,[tpl]cite news |title = CHRIS CORNELL Sets Release Date For New Album |publisher = Blabbermouth|date = 2008-08-25 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=103482 |accessdate = 2008-09-08[/tpl] Cornell insisted that he still played an integral part of the album's creation and didn't do what "Timbaland told me to do", further noting that they "didn't really have that relationship" and "it wasn't that type of a process. It was more, he would bring in a beat, an idea, I would write to it and sing it, and we would move on kind of to the next thing."
Describing the album as a whole, Cornell compared it to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon and Queen's A Night at the Opera, citing the psychedelic elements that Timbaland brought into the production.[tpl]cite news |title = CHRIS CORNELL To Unleash His 'Scream' This Fall |publisher = Blabbermouth|date = 2008-07-29 |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101810 |accessdate = 2008-09-08[/tpl]
However, while a majority of the album is an R&B styled album, the hidden track "Two Drink Minimum" sees Cornell playing a blues-influenced rock song, with an acoustic guitar, organ, drums, and harmonica.

==Reception==

In the U.S, the album debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200 and thus became Cornell's first top 10 solo album. The next week it dropped 55 places to number 65, which was the largest second-week drop for a top 10-debuting album in two and a half years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus.jsp |title=Music Chart Analysis, Artist Spotlights, Music Insider, Chart Beat & News |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27[/tpl] It was also a commercial disappointment, spending only 10 weeks on the Billboard 200.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Initial critical response towards the release was mixed to negative. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 42, based on 19 reviews.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/cornellchris/scream | title=Chris Cornel:Scream (2009): Reviews | work=Metacritic | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=2009-04-07 [/tpl] Scream received positive reviews from Entertainment Weekly and Hot Press who felt that the collaboration between producer Timbaland and Chris Cornell worked. The mixed reviews were more prevalent, with Spin stating the album was "strangely appealing in its elaborately empty efficiency." while Billboard noted that "Sometimes it's good bizarre. Other times it's bad bizarre." Rolling Stone wrote that Scream "veers between drab–sleek and rock–dude soulful; Cornell's yowl never sounds at home". Among the negative reviews, Allmusic wrote that "Scream is one of those rare big-budget disasters, an exercise in misguided ambition that makes no sense outside of pure theory."[tpl]cite web | url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r1436554|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title=Scream review: Allmusic | work=Allmusic | publisher=Macrovision, Inc | accessdate=2009-03-13 [/tpl]

==Rock Versions==

There are currently two Scream tracks that have had "Rock Versions" of them released. The first being an alternate version of "Long Gone", produced by Howard Benson,[tpl]cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/long-gone-rock-version-single/id313885528 |title=iTunes - Music - Long Gone (Rock Version) - Single by Chris Cornell |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2011-12-27[/tpl] which was accompanied by an official music video directed by DJ Skee's Skee.tv.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFhGkdX8Pvo |title=Long Gone (Rock Version) - Chris Cornell |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03[/tpl]
The second track to come to light was a "Rock Version" of "Never Far Away". This version was not a remix, but a completely new recording, produced by Jordon Zadorozny. It has yet to be released for purchase, but has been, with permission from Cornell himself, made available for streaming by Alan Cross.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] In October 2009, it was reported that Cornell was working with Jordan Zadorozny and Michael Friedman to rework the entire Scream album but this remains unconfirmed. This now seems unlikely as Cornell has now rejoined Soundgarden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1554/Cornell-To-Rework-Scream-Into-Rock-Album |title=Chris Cornell to rework entire "Scream" album into rock album |publisher=AlternativeAddiction |date= |accessdate=2012-06-03[/tpl]
