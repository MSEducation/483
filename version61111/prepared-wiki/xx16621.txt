[[Gun control]]

CATEGORIES: Firearms, Gun politics

Gun controls are laws or policies that regulate the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms. They vary greatly around the world. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have very strict limits on gun possession while others, like the United States, have laws that vary significantly among their states.
Proponents of gun control generally argue the dangers of widespread gun ownership. Opponents argue that gun control does not reduce gun-related injuries, murder, or suicide, and some argue that certain regulations may violate individual liberties.

==Terminology and context==

The concept of gun control is a subset of a much greater, yet equally global, topic, arms control. In the context of this article, the concept of gun control is in reference to various means of restrictions on the use, transport, and possession of firearms, specifically with regard to the class of weapons referred to as small arms. On a global scale this context is sometimes expanded to include light weapons; also known in the arms trade as SALW.
From the perspective of military small arms, this encompasses: revolvers, pistols, submachine guns, carbines, assault rifles, battle rifles, multiple barrel firearms, sniper rifles, squad automatic weapons, light machine guns (e.g. M60), and sometimes hand grenades, shotguns, general-purpose machine guns, medium machine guns, and grenade launchers may be considered small arms or as support weapons, depending on the particular armed forces. Other groups utilizing these types of arms may also include government sanctioned non-military personnel such as law enforcement agencies.
From a civilian (meaning via private, individual ownership) perspective and varying via legislation from country to country this encompasses a subset of the above list. It is usually limited to: revolvers, pistols, carbines, hunting rifles, sporting rifles, and shotguns.
Separate, yet integral, to the concept of gun control are the individuals and companies that comprise the global arms industry.
The arms industry is a global business which manufactures weapons and military technology and equipment. It consists of commercial industry involved in research, development, production, sale, and transport. Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms industry to supply their own military forces. Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens. An illegal trade in small arms is prevalent in many countries and regions affected by political instability.

==Global distribution of small arms==

It is estimated that there are in total 875 million small arms distributed amongst civilians, law enforcement agencies and armed forces, globally.[tpl]efn|This figure excludes older, pre-automatic small arms from military and law enforcement stockpiles or 'craft-produced' civilian firearms.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2007|p=39[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]sfn|Karp|2007|p=39[/tpl] 650 million of these firearms, or 75 per cent, are held by civilians worldwide.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2007|p=39|ps=[/tpl] U.S. civilians alone account for 270 million of this total.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2007|p=39|ps=[/tpl] A further 200 million are controlled by state military forces.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=102|ps=[/tpl] Law enforcement agencies have some 26 million small arms.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=102|ps=[/tpl] Non-state armed groups[tpl]efn|Composed of 'insurgents and militias, including dormant and state-related groups'.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=101|ps=[/tpl][/tpl] have about 1.4 million firearms.[tpl]efn|However, as of 2009, active non-state armed groups, numbering about 285,000 combatants, control only about 350,000 small arms.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=121|ps=[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=102|ps=[/tpl] Finally, gang members hold between 2 and 10 million small arms.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=102|ps=[/tpl] Together, the small arms arsenals of non-state armed groups and gangs account for, at most, 1.4 per cent of the global total.[tpl]sfn|Karp|2010|p=101|ps=[/tpl]

==Regulation of civilian firearms==

Barring a few exceptions,[tpl]efn|Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, and Taiwan (Republic of China) prohibit civilian ownership of firearms in almost all instances. Eritrea and Somalia also prohibit civilian possession of firearms as part of their implementation of the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms. In the Solomon Islands civilian firearm ownership is restricted to members of the Regional Assistance Mission.[tpl]sfn|Parker|2011|p=62 n. 1|ps=[/tpl][/tpl] most countries in the world allow civilians to purchase firearms subject to certain restrictions.[tpl]sfn|Parker|2011|p=1|ps=[/tpl] A 2011 survey of 28 countries over five continents
