Chiltern RailwaysCompanies House extract company no 3007939 The Chiltern Railway Company Limited is a British train operating company owned by Arriva UK Trains that has operated the Chiltern Railways franchise since July 1996. Chiltern Railways operates services on the Chiltern Main Line from London Marylebone to Aylesbury, Stratford-upon-Avon and Birmingham Snow Hill with some peak-hour services to Kidderminster. It also runs services on the Princes Risborough to Aylesbury and Oxford to Bicester branch lines.

==History==

In June 1996 M40 TrainsCompanies House extract company no 3005018 M40 Trains Limited was awarded the Chiltern Railways franchise by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising for a period of seven years with operations commencing on 21 July 1996."M40 to put new stock on Chiltern". The Independent (London). 26 June 1996.  M40 Trains was a management buyout led by some former British Rail managers who held a combined 51% shareholding backed by John Laing plc (26%) and 3i (23%).  A restructure in March 1999 saw John Laing taking an 84% shareholding with the remaining 16% owned by the former British Rail managers."Fat cat row in Chiltern bid".

==Services==

Chiltern operates services on five routes:
The "core" off-peak Chiltern Railways timetable is currently as follows:
Chiltern Railways runs once a day service to London Paddington1V28 South Ruislip – Paddington  Open Trains Times2M28 Paddington – Gerrards Cross Open Train Times to maintain traincrew route knowledge (as the route is regularly used for diversions during periods of engineering work), from Oxford to Banbury2U92 Oxford – Banbury Open Train Times and from Stratford-upon-Avon to Oxford.2V92 Stratford-upon-Avon – Oxford Open Trains Times
The London Marylebone to Birmingham Snow Hill route used by Chiltern Railways goes via [tpl]stnlink|High Wycombe[/tpl], Bicester, [tpl]stnlink|Banbury[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Leamington Spa[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Warwick Parkway[/tpl], [tpl]stnlnk|Dorridge[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlink|Solihull[/tpl].
Off-peak trains between London and Birmingham operate every half-hour. The fastest timetabled journey from Birmingham to London via this route is 90 minutes (compared with 82 minutes using Virgin Trains' services between [tpl]stnlink|Birmingham New Street[/tpl] and London Euston).
Some peak-hour Chiltern services continue beyond Birmingham Snow Hill to [tpl]stnlnk|Stourbridge Junction[/tpl] or [tpl]stnlnk|Kidderminster[/tpl].
The line to Aylesbury Vale Parkway via Amersham runs alongside London Underground's Metropolitan Line between Finchley Road) and Harrow-on-the-Hill, with each operator running on separate tracks, then shares the tracks with Metropolitan Line services.[tpl]cite book |last=Yonge |first=John |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=Gerald |title=Railway Track Diagrams 5: Southern & TfL |edition=3rd |date=November 2008 |origyear=1994 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=978-0-9549866-4-3 |at=maps 41C, 42A, 42B, 43A |ref=harv [/tpl] This is the only situation where National Rail services use non Network Rail tracks and it uses a unique unregulated track access agreement with London Underground.
On certain Bank Holiday Mondays, services are extended from Aylesbury to the Buckinghamshire Railway Heritage Centre facilities at Quainton Road, a short way south of [tpl]Stnlnk|Verney Junction[/tpl]. These services are often run by one of Chiltern's two Class 121s.
A shuttle service operates on the branch line between [tpl]stnlnk|Aylesbury[/tpl] and [tpl]stnlnk|Princes Risborough[/tpl] on the line to Birmingham via High Wycombe. Certain services from Marylebone via High Wycombe also provide a limited through service to Aylesbury.
In December 2004 Chiltern Railways took over operation of passenger services on the [tpl]stnlink|Leamington Spa[/tpl] to [tpl]stnlnk|Stratford-upon-Avon[/tpl] branch line from First Great Western Link.
In May 2011 Chiltern took over operating services on the Oxford to Bicester Line from First Great Western.[tpl]cite web |title=Oxford to Bicester Town Service Change of Train Operator |url=http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Content.aspx?id=5239 |publisher=First Great Western |accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl]Chiltern Railways takes over Bicester to Oxford services Chiltern Railways news 28 April 2011

==Tickets==

Since winning the franchise, Chiltern has introduced "Route: High Wycombe" tickets for the Chiltern route between Birmingham and London that are considerably cheaper than "Route: Any Permitted" tickets, valid on the faster Virgin service to London Euston as well a number of other operators and routes. Chiltern offers only Standard Class, not Standard and First Class as on Virgin services. However, Chiltern does offer a premium economy "Business Zone" cabin on a small number of Birmingham to London peak-time trains.  Passengers pay a £20 upgrade to sit in a larger first-class-style seat with refreshments included.
Chiltern is the first train operator in the UK to pilot – and subsequently implement – a full system for purchasing, retailing, fulfilling and validating train tickets electronically. As of April 2008, over 18,000 "E-Day" customers have registered to use the service, and more than 40,000 electronic tickets have been sold, mainly as barcodes delivered as text messages to customers' mobile phones and also as 'Self-Print' tickets.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==Performance==

Chiltern is considered one of the best operators in Britain, with Public Performance Measure (PPM) regularly over 90%. Chiltern is the only operating company to have achieved over 95% performance over 12 months.[tpl]cite press release |date =24 April 2008 |url= http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/news/press-releases/chiltern-railways-sets-new-record-for-punctuality/ |title= Chiltern Railways sets new record for punctuality |publisher= Chiltern Railways[/tpl] Chiltern's PPM is measured on stricter conditions than its long-distance rivals, such as Virgin Trains, as Chiltern has a 5-minute window for performance while others have a 10-minute window.
Performance figures published by NR (Network Rail) rate Chiltern Railways as one of the most punctual train operating companies in the UK at 97.1% (PPM – period 7) and 95.6% (MAA) for the year to 12 October 2013.[tpl]cite web |title= Rail performance results period 7 |url= http://www.networkrail.co.uk/about/performance/ |publisher= Network Rail[/tpl]
A new timetable introduced on 4 September 2011, combined with significant disruption caused by engineering work, caused a negative reaction from customers. A petition to have the service reviewed was started, and articles highlighting the plight of commuters appeared in the press.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/9269787.New_Chiltern_line_is_say_commuters/  |newspaper= Bucks Free Press |first=Lawrence |last=Dunhill |title=Beaconsfield commuters say new Chiltern line is 'misery' |date=24 September 2011 |location=High Wycombe |accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl]
A new timetable introduced on 10 December 2012 also met with frustration and opposition from some customers, particularly those using Saunderton and Princes Risborough stations.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/10141769.Commuters_call_for_a_return_to_a_better_train_service/  |newspaper= Bucks Free Press |first=Rebecca |last=Cain |title=Commuters call for a return to a better train service |date=4 January 2011 |location=Princes Risborough |accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]

==Project Evergreen==

Evergreen is the name given by Chiltern to the major infrastructure works that the company has committed to over the 20-year duration of its franchise to improve routes and services. This has been divided into three distinct phases.

===Evergreen 1===

The main focus of phase 1 was the redoubling of the Chiltern Main Line between Princes Risborough and Bicester North in 1998 and Bicester North and Aynho Junction in 2001, together with the reconstruction of [tpl]Stnlnk|Haddenham and Thame Parkway[/tpl] from a single platform to two platforms, the installation of a new platform at [tpl]Stnlnk|Princes Risborough[/tpl], and the raising of the line speed limit.Chiltern Renaissance – The Evergreen Success Rail.co 26 October 2011

===Evergreen 2===

Phase 2 began after the award of Chiltern's new 20-year franchise. This entailed a realignment of the route through [tpl]Stnlnk|Beaconsfield[/tpl] to allow speeds to be increased to 75 mph, improved signalling between High Wycombe and Bicester and between Princes Risborough and Aylesbury, the construction of two new platforms at London Marylebone on the old carriage sidings, and the construction of a new depot at Wembley.

===Evergreen 3===

The Department for Transport, Chiltern Railways and Network Rail agreed in January 2010 to a £250m upgrade of the Chiltern Main Line.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/uploads/publications/1412.pdf |title= £250 investment from Chiltern Railways creates new main line |publisher=Chiltern Railways |date=15 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=4946&NewsAreaID=2 |title= £250m Rail Investment to Bring Much Faster Journeys for Chiltern Passengers |publisher=Network Rail |date=15 January 2010[/tpl]

====Phase 1====

Phase 1 of the project, now complete, involved upgrading the Marylebone – Birmingham Chiltern Main Line to permit 100 mph running on 50 more miles of route. Junctions at Neasden, Northolt and Aynho were remodelled to permit higher speeds. The 'up' through track has been restored at Princes Risborough, the existing 'up' line becoming a platform loop, a new turnback siding has been provided at Gerrards Cross, and a new, straighter 'down' through track built from Northolt Junction (where the original layout favoured the now little-used Paddington route) to Ruislip Gardens. The existing 'down' track continues to serve South Ruislip station. The former speed restrictions through [tpl]stnlink|Bicester North[/tpl] have been removed to permit 100 mph running.[tpl]cite news |title= Evergreen 3 progress |work= Modern Railways |location = London |page=9 |date=December 2010 [/tpl] Two additional terminating platforms at Birmingham Moor Street were reopened in December 2010. Accelerated services were initially planned to start in May 2011, but there were delays and it was not until 5 September 2011 that Chiltern was able to introduce a new timetable to take advantage of the improvements.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/business/2008/08/29-chiltern-railways-upgrade.html |title= Chiltern Railways plan to make Bicester well connected |newspaper=Railnews |location=Stevenage |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=7 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.chiltern-evergreen3.co.uk |title=Project Evergreen 3 |publisher=Chiltern Railways |year=2009 |accessdate=6 February 2009[/tpl]
As a result of the speed increases, journey times have been reduced significantly. From Marylebone, the fastest peak-hour journey time to Birmingham Moor Street is now 90 minutes, instead of 117 minutes previously. The table below outlines the peak timetable improvements.
Chiltern Railways former chairman Adrian Shooter said, "This is the biggest passenger rail project for several generations not to call on the taxpayer for support. Working closely with Network Rail, we are going to create a new main-line railway for the people of Oxfordshire and the Midlands. This deal demonstrates that real improvements to rail services can be paid for without public subsidy by attracting people out of their cars and on to trains."

====Phase 2====

Under Phase 2 of the Evergreen 3 project, a quarter-of-a-mile double track will be constructed joining the Oxford to Bicester Line at Bicester Town to the Chiltern Main Line, allowing a new Oxford to London Marylebone service to operate.  As part of this plan, the Oxford to Bicester Town service transferred from First Great Western to Chiltern in May 2011. Part of the line between Wolvercote Tunnel (on the outskirts of Oxford) and Bicester Town will be restored to double track, and a new station constructed at Water Eaton, to be named [tpl]stnlnk|Oxford Parkway[/tpl]. The scheme will include additional platforms at Oxford, Islip and Bicester Town.
Network Rail will provide the capital for the upgrade and recover this through a facility charge over the next 30 years, initially payable by Chiltern until its franchise expires, and then by the next franchisee. The infrastructure upgrade is being carried out by main contractor BAM Nuttall, in partnership with Jarvis and WS Atkins."Chiltern Railways announces £250m improvements and new main line to be built by BAM Nuttall". New Civil Engineer (London). 15 January 2010.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.bamnuttall.co.uk/news/JAN10/BAM_Nuttall_lands_Chiltern.html |title= BAM Nuttall lands £190 million Evergreen 3 Contract for Chiltern Railways |publisher=BAM Nuttall |location =Camberley |date=January 2010[/tpl]
The £200m project had originally proposed doubling the entire route from Oxford to Bicester, but structural problems[tpl]what|date=June 2013[/tpl] found in September 2009 may mean that the section between Islip and Bicester will remain single-track. Oxfordshire County Council supports the scheme but remains to be convinced of the benefits of a new station at Water Eaton, which would be in the Green Belt.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/4630476.Rail_link_plan_runs_into_problems/ |title=Rail link plan runs into problems |work=Oxford Mail |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2009[/tpl]
All signalling on the route (including the new platforms at Oxford) would be controlled by Marylebone Signalling Centre.
There was a further setback to the plan when in November 2011 a planning inspector withheld approval because it was found that bats were roosting in Wolvercote Tunnel. Great Crested Newts also have a breeding habitat close to the route.[tpl]cite news |title=Rail line hits buffers amid bat risk fear |first=Reg |last=Little |url= http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/archive/2011/11/17/Oxford+news+%28om_oxfordnews%29/9368010.Wildlife_could_halt___130m_Oxford_train_link/ |newspaper=The Oxford Times |date=17 November 2011 |page=1[/tpl] The "bat problem" however seems to have been resolved.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/news/chiltern-railways-oxford-%E2%80%93-london-line-statement |title=Chiltern Railways: Oxford–London line statement |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2012[/tpl] In October 2012 the Secretary of State for Transport granted permission for work to begin on Phase 2 with services between London Marylebone and Oxford starting in 2015.[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/news/chiltern-railways-given-green-light-build-new-rail-line-between-oxford-and-london |title=Chiltern Railways given green light to build new rail line between Oxford and London |publisher=Chiltern Railways |date=18 October 2012 |accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl]McGregor, Sam (19 October 2012).

==Rolling stock==

Chiltern Railways inherited a fleet of 34 Class 165 Turbos from British Rail. In December 2004 a further five Class 165s were transferred from First Great Western Link. All 39 were overhauled by Bombardier, Ilford in 2003 – 2005 including the installation of air-conditioning and removal of the hopper opening windows.Our Train Fleet. Chiltern Railways. As they were designed for suburban rather than InterCity use, they tend to be concentrated on services to Aylesbury and Banbury, although this stock can be found operating the service between Birmingham and Leamington Spa.
Chiltern ordered several batches of Class 168 Clubmans, entering service between 1998 and 2004, and now has nine three-carriage and ten four-carriage sets. These operate across the network.
In April 2003 Chiltern restored a Class 121 Bubble Car for use on the Aylesbury to Princes Risborough shuttles, a second following in May 2011 after overhaul at Tyseley TMD."BR green 'bubble car' headlines £1million upgrade by Chiltern". Rail Express. 27 May 2011.55034 Class 121 Driving Motor Brake Second (Returned to Mainline use) The Railcar Association In March 2013, a third Class 121 (121032) was acquired from Arriva Trains Wales for use as a spare parts donor.
In January 2008 Chiltern ordered four two-coach Class 172 Turbostars. These entered service in June 2011.Angel Trains orders 'Green Trains' for the UK Rail Market Angel Trains 31 January 2008 Because they cannot be fitted with tripcock safety equipment necessary to operate on London Underground lines, they cannot operate via Amersham unless attached to a Class 165 or 168. Although initially intended for use on all-stations services out of London, they frequently operate to Birmingham.
From December 2010 Chiltern began operating two peak-hour loco-hauled services consisting of a Class 67 hauling Mark 3 coaches and a Driving Van Trailer. One set was hired from fellow DB Regio subsidiary Wrexham & Shropshire to operate a Birmingham Moor Street to London Marylebone service while the other was made up of some DB-Regio-owned Mark 3s painted in British Rail blue/grey and Virgin Trains livery and operated from Banbury to London Marylebone."Chiltern commence Birmingham loco-hauled". Rail Express. 14 December 2010.
After Wrexham & Shropshire ceased operations in January 2011, Chiltern began using a second ex-Wrexham & Shropshire set from May 2011. For the introduction of Chiltern's new timetable in September 2011 they had a Mainline logo and blue stripes added to their silver livery."Chiltern mounts Silver Trains Challenge to Virgin". Railnews. 5 September 2011. Motive power is provided by Class 67s, 67010, 67012-015 and 67018, all modified to operate with Driving Van Trailers.
In 2012 the ex-Wrexham & Shropshire Mark 3s were overhauled fitted with sliding plug doors (similar to those fitted to South West Trains' Class 444 Desiros) and toilet retention tanks by Wabtec. Once this programme is complete, a further ten Mark 3s will be overhauled by Wabtec to create a fifth set and bring the existing sets up to six coaches."Chiltern Railways puts refurbished Mk 111 coaches into service". Railway Gazette. 31 May 2012. In 2012 the DB-Regio-owned Mark 3s used on the peak-hour Banbury service were given a light overhaul at LNWR, Bristol, and the Virgin-liveried examples repainted into British Rail blue/grey.
To allow Class 168s to be cascaded to the new Oxford services as part of Evergreen 3, more Mark 3s are to be returned to service in the future.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Comfort |first1=Nick |last2=Pritchard |first2=Robert |year=2010 |title=Marylebone-Birmingham expresses from December |journal=Today's Railways | location = Sheffield |issue=99 |page=7 [/tpl] The Class 170 Turbostars currently with First TransPennine Express were to be transferred to Chiltern Railways.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/campaigners-fury-nine-transpennine-express-6768197 |title=Campaigners' fury as nine TransPennine Express trains sent south in 'crazy and scandalous' move |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=3 March 2014 [/tpl] MP Stephen Hammond revealed on 12 March 2014 that all the class 170/3s will remain with First TransPennine Express until the May 2015 timetable change and talks relating to First TransPennine keeping some of the 170/3s until the May 2016 timetable change are currently on-going.http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=14995&player=silverlight&wfs=true  This was then followed by an announcement by the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee saying that "Members were pleased to note that DfT had confirmed that the proposal to relocate Class 170 diesel units from the north of England to the south east would not now take place."http://www.transportforgreatermanchestercommittee.gov.uk/tfgmc/downloads/file/4826/item_04_minutes_28_march_2014

==Gerrards Cross incident==

Tesco proposed building a supermarket over the railway line near Gerrards Cross railway station in 1996,[tpl]cite news |title=In a hole |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/aug/25/architecture.supermarkets |date=25 August 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=17 June 2009 | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey[/tpl] which, following an initial objection by the local council was approved by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in July 1998. Due to a lack of space in the area, Tesco had proposed building over the railway line, which would free up a large area of land suitable for the development.
During construction, the partially built tunnel collapsed on 30 June 2005. Nobody was injured but the line was closed for over six weeks, eventually reopening on 20 August 2005. Compensation by Tesco to Chiltern Railway and Network Rail was estimated to be between £5-20m and the retailer pledged to fund a media campaign to win back passengers lost by the closure of its route[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl].

==Plans==

===Active===

In addition to the completed and ongoing Evergreen initiatives many other potential enhancements for Chiltern's route have been discussed, but not (yet) progressed to date. These include:
As successful completion of Project Evergreen 3 will fulfill Chiltern Railways' obligation to invest in infrastructure there is no clear road to completion for these projects.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.incoseonline.org.uk/Documents/Events/22Jun10/22062010_Chiltern.pdf| title=Private Sector Specification and Delivery of Enhancement |date=22 June 2010 |publisher= International Council on Systems Engineering[/tpl]

===East West Rail Link===

In July 2012 the government confirmed the East West Rail Link project will see the Varsity Line reopened between Oxford, Aylesbury Vale Parkway and Bletchley in December 2017, however on 31 March 2014, Network Rail announced that the project had been delayed until 2019.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.bucksherald.co.uk/news/business/business-news/disappointment-as-east-west-rail-delayed-by-two-years-1-5970200 |date=31 March 2014 |title= Disappointment as East West Rail delayed by two years |publisher=Bucks Herald |accessdate=31 March 2014 [/tpl] This is likely to see Chiltern operate services continuing north of Aylesbury and east of Bicester to either Bedford or Milton Keynes.
