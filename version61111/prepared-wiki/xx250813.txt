Orval William Prophet (31 August 1922 â€“ 4 January 1984) was among the first Canadian country music performers to achieve a career of international scope.

==Early life==

Prophet was born in Edwards, Ontario, now part of Ottawa.[tpl]cite web | url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/P/Prophet_Orval.html | title=Prophet, Orval | publisher=Jam!/Canoe | work=The Canadian Pop Encyclopedia | accessdate=2010-06-09[/tpl] During his teens, he sang pop songs within his family and performed at church and community functions. He changed his focus to country music after he heard Hank Snow's music and concluded that "Western folk-songs would fit my style".
During World War II, Prophet worked on his family's farm since health limitations precluded him from military service. He performed for injured soldiers in Ottawa, walking [tpl]convert|38|km|mi[/tpl] from his home to their hospital.
He is a second cousin of Ronnie Prophet who is also a country musician.

==Career==

From 1944 to 1949, he performed throughout eastern Ontario in a country band led by Bill Sheppard. In Ottawa, his live radio performances were featured on CFRA's Fiddler's Fling from 1947 to 1951.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=GKQyAAAAIBAJ&pg=1548,1048766 | title=Orval Prophet dies | publisher=Ottawa Citizen | date=5 January 1984 | page=55 | first=Tom | last=Van Dusen | accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl] A Canadian tour with Wilf Carter in 1949 led to Prophet's recording contract with Decca Records by late 1951.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ottawacountrymusichof.org/inductees/1985/orval_prophet.htm | title=1985 Inductee - Orval Prophet | publisher=Ottawa Country Music Hall of Fame | accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=yB8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA102 | title=Folk Talent and Tunes | publisher=Billboard | date=13 September 1952 | first=Johnny | last=Sippei | page=102 | accessdate=2010-01-10 [/tpl] This made Prophet among the earliest Canadian country music artists who recorded in a Nashville studio.[tpl]cite news | title=Canadian recorded in Nashville | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=5 January 1984 | page=E3 | author=The Canadian Press [/tpl]

He remained based in Edwards throughout most of his career, becoming known as "The Canadian Ploughboy". His initial reason for remaining in Canada was to remain with his girlfriend. In April 1954, Prophet became a million-selling artist in terms of record sales following successful songs such as "Going Back to Birmingham", "Judgement Day Express" and "Beautiful Bells".[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=M_gwAAAAIBAJ&pg=7479,116629 | title=1,000,000th Record Bears Name Of Ottawa Valley Cowboy Singer | publisher=Ottawa Citizen | page=21 | first=Bob | last=Buchanan | date=17 April 1954 | accessdate=2010-01-09 [/tpl]

Other appearances included CBC Television's The Tommy Hunter Show and at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.

When Waylon Jennings was working as a radio host prior to his singing career, he sought to adopt Prophet's singing style. Johnny Cash and Dallas Harms also wrote material for Prophet.
