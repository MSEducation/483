==Budget==

The Aeronautics Commission is a non-appropriated State agency. As such, it does not rely upon annual appropriations from the Oklahoma Legislature in order to function. Instead, the Commission is funded by a dedicated 0.0008% tax on motor fuels bought for aircraft use and a dedicated 3.25% tax on the purchase of aircraft. Those two dedicated taxes make up 80% of the Commission's annual budget. The remaining 20% comes from federal grants and other fees for the Commission's services. About half of that budget is dedicated to providing assistance to local airport improvement projects. The remainder is used to operate the agency and to provide educational activities to inform the public about aeronautics.
