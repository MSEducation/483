==Reception==

The Billboard review from 15 June 1963 selected the album for its pop spotlight, and commentated that "...both the devotees of country music and Dino will be pleased".[tpl]cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=awsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29|accessdate=11 August 2013|date=15 June 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=29â€“|id=[tpl]ISSN|00062510[/tpl][/tpl] William Ruhlmann on Allmusic.com said that "The songs may have been Nashville products technically, but Marty Paich got no closer to real country music than the countrypolitan style...This was country music by way of Hollywood. But that suited Martin, who sounded as at ease as ever. If there was any criticism to be made of his approach, it was that he brought little sense of emotional turmoil to some of the romantic laments here".
