Opus Dei, formally known as The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei ([tpl]lang-la|Praelatura Sanctae Crucis et Operis Dei[/tpl]), is an institution of the Roman Catholic Church that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2002/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20021007_opus-dei_en.html | title=Address of John Paul II in Praise of St. Josemaría, Founder of Opus Dei | accessdate=2007-06-08[/tpl] The majority of its membership are lay people, with secular priests under the governance of a prelate (bishop) elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope.Upon whom does the prelate of Opus Dei depend?

Opus Dei is Latin for Work of God; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as the Work.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4249444.stm | work=BBC News | title=Decoding secret world of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27 | date=2005-09-16[/tpl][tpl]Cite news | work=Kansas City Star | author=Bill Tammeus |date=2005-10-19 | title=Bishop confirms connection to group | accessdate=2006-11-28[/tpl]
Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic priest Josemaría Escrivá, Opus Dei was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII. In 1982, by decision of Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church made it into a personal prelature—that is, the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are, rather than geographical dioceses.
As of 2012, members of the Prelature numbered 91,960. Lay persons, men and women, numbered 89,909, while there were 2,051 priests. These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005. Members are in more than 90 countries. About 70 per cent of Opus Dei members live in their private homes, leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers,[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/opusdei.shtml | work=BBC Religion and Ethics|title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/mar/24/terry-mattingly-da-vinci-code-mania-opened-opus-de/ | work=Alburquerque Tribune|title='Da Vinci Code' mania opened up Opus Dei|author=Terry Mattingly | accessdate=2007-04-02[/tpl] while the other 30 per cent are celibate, of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centres. Opus Dei organizes training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life. Aside from personal charity and social work, Opus Dei members are involved in running universities, university residences, schools, publishing houses, and technical and agricultural training centers.
Opus Dei has been described as the most controversial force within the Catholic Church.[tpl]Cite book| author=John Allen | title=Opus Dei: An Objective Look Behind the Myths and Reality of the Most Controversial Force in the Catholic Church | year=2005 | publisher=Doubleday Religion| isbn=0-385-51449-2[/tpl] According to several journalists who researched Opus Dei separately, many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents,[tpl]Cite book| title=Opus Dei: The Truth Behind the Myth| author=Maggy Whitehouse| publisher=Hermes House|year=2006| isbn=0-681-35584-0[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article575959.ece | title=What Is Opus Dei?

Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness, controversial recruiting methods, strict rules governing members, elitism and misogyny, and support of or participation in authoritarian or right-wing governments, especially the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978. The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized.

==History==

===Foundational period===

Opus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he experienced a vision in which he "saw Opus Dei".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=271&id_scat=270|work=JosemariaEscriva.info|title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1409237/Vatican-proves-the-power-of-Opus-Dei-founder.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Vatican proves the power of Opus Dei Founder | accessdate=2006-11-27 | location=London | first=Graeme | last=Archer | date=2002-10-05[/tpl] He gave the organization the name "Opus Dei", which in Latin means "Work of God", in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=4761 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Pope Benedict XVI on St. Josemaría Escriva | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=218&id_scat=35 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=The Founding of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians "to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/60 | title=Conversations 60 | first=Josemaría | last=Escrivá | accessdate=2006-05-16[/tpl]
Initially, Opus Dei was open only to men, but in 1930, Escrivá started to admit women, based on what he believed to be a communication from God. In 1936, the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, as many Catholic priests and religious figures, including Escrivá, were forced into hiding (the Catholic Church actively supported the Nationalist rebels). The many atrocities committed during the civil war included the murder and rape of religious figures by anti-Franco Anarchists. After the civil war was won by General Francisco Franco, Escrivá was able to return to Madrid.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.josemariaescriva.info/index.php?id_cat=293&id_scat=270 | work=JosemariaEscriva.info | title=Historical Overview | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Escriva himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found "the greatest difficulties" because of traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei's ideas.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/conversations/point/33| title=Conversations 33| first=Josemaría | last=Escrivá | accessdate=2007-05-30[/tpl] Despite this, Opus Dei flourished during the years of the Franquismo, spreading first throughout Spain, and after 1945, expanding internationally.
In 1939, Escrivá published The Way, a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.escrivaworks.org/book/the_way | work=EscrivaWorks.org | title=The Way | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] In the 1940s, Opus Dei found an early critic in the Jesuit Superior General Wlodimir Ledóchowski, who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei "very dangerous for the Church in Spain," citing its "secretive character" and calling it "a form of Christian Masonry."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/dvc_3.html | author=Philip Copens | title=Deciphering the Da Vinci Code | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
In 1947, a year after Escrivá moved the organization's headquarters to Rome, Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII, making it an institute of "pontifical right", i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope. In 1950,  Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei, thereby allowing married people to join the organisation, and secular clergy to be admitted to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross.

===Post-foundational years===

In 1975, Escriva died and was succeeded by Álvaro del Portillo. In 1982, Opus Dei was made into a personal prelature. This means that Opus Dei is part of the universal Church, and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are. As to "what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful", the lay members of Opus Dei, being no different from other Catholics, "continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop", in the words of John Paul II's Ut Sit.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781530298/Opus_Dei.html | work=MSN Encarta | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=November 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT[/tpl] In 1994, Javier Echevarria became Prelate upon the death of his predecessor.
One-third of the world's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=3720 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Blessed Josemaría Escrivá to be canonised | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Escriva was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about Escriva's suitability for sainthood. In 2002, approximately 300,000 people gathered in St. Peter's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonised Josemaría Escrivá.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives/101802/101802h.htm | work=National Catholic Reporter | title=300,000 pilgrims turn out for canonisation of Opus Dei founder | author=John L.

During that same year, Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively. The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarising views on the organisation.

===Doctrine===

Opus Dei is an organisation of the Catholic Church. As such, it shares the doctrines of the Catholic Church.
Opus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine. A central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.catholicity.com/mccloskey/popeandopusdei.html | work=Crisis Magazine | author=Fr. John McCloskey|date=March 1995 | title=The Pope and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] mirrored on CatholiCity[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=9319 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Opus Dei's focus on secular life | accessdate=2006-11-28[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.nysun.com/article/30310?access=391277 | work=The New York Sun | title='Da Vinci' And Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Opus Dei emphasises the "universal call to holiness": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, as per Jesus' commandment to "Love God with all your heart" ([tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|22:37|NRSV|[/tpl]) and "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect." ([tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|5:48|NRSV|[/tpl]) Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone, not just a few special individuals, given Jesus' teaching that his demands are "easy" and "light," as his divine assistance is assured. ([tpl]bibleverse|Matthew||11:28–30|NRSV|[/tpl])Escriva, J, Christ is Passing By, n. 176; Friends of God, n. 28.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5029154 | work=National Public Radio | title=A Glimpse Inside a Catholic 'Force': Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are priests.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=19147 | work=Catholic News Service | title=Opus Dei called 'complete opposite' of 'The Da Vinci Code' portrayal | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life. Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and secular careers, and strive to "sanctify ordinary life". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escrivá "the saint of ordinary life".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-05/2006-05-22-voa20.cfm?CFID=2829126&CFTOKEN=35170673 | work=JoseMaria.info|title=Decree of Canonisation | accessdate=2006-11-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016162133/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2006-05/2006-05-22-voa20.cfm?CFID=2829126&CFTOKEN=35170673 |archivedate = October 16, 2007[/tpl]
Similarly, Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence.[ref]

The biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine, according to the founder, are in the phrase "God created man to work" (Gen 2:15) and Jesus's long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town. Escrivá, who stressed the Christian's duty to follow Christ's example, also points to the gospel account that Jesus "has done everything well" (Mk 7:37).
The foundation of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is divine filiation: Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: freedom, respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and charity, love of God above all and love of others.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=12224 | work=Opus Dei website | title=Message of Opus Dei | accessdate=2007-03-11[/tpl]
At the bottom of Escrivá's understanding of the "universal call to holiness" are two dimensions, subjective and objective, according to Fernando Ocariz, a Catholic theologian and Vicar General of Opus Dei. The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint, regardless of his place in society. The objective refers to what Escrivá calls Christian materialism: all of creation, even the most material situation, is a meeting place with God, and leads to union with Him.
Different qualifiers have been used to describe Opus Dei's doctrine: radical, reactionary,[tpl]Cite web|author=Rob Boston|url=http://www.cath4choice.org/news/inthenews/2006/200605cs_breakingtheopusdeicode.asp| work=Catholics for Free Choice| title=Breaking the Opus Dei Code| accessdate=2008-04-04[/tpl] faithful, revolutionary, ultraconservative,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/oct/05/spain.gilestremlett|author=Gilles Tremlett| work=The Guardian| title=Sainthood beckons for priest linked to Franco| accessdate=2008-04-03 | location=London | date=2002-10-05[/tpl] most modern,[tpl]cite news |author=Mike Collet White|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/04/AR2009110401371.html| work=Washington Post| title=Founder of Catholic Opus Dei group focus of movie| accessdate=2010-01-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] conservative.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93086&page=1 | work=ABC News | author=David Ruppe |date=2001-06-18 | title=Opus Dei: A Return to Tradition | accessdate=2011-01-11[/tpl] and liberal.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809216-2,00.html| work=Time Magazine| title=Religion:Opus Dei| accessdate=2011-08-28 | date=1957-03-18[/tpl]

===Prayers===

All members – whether married or unmarried, priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a 'plan of life', or 'the norms of piety', which are some traditional Catholic devotions. This is meant to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism: "pray at specific times...to nourish continual prayer,"[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p4s1c3.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 2697-8 | title=The Life of Prayer | accessdate=2007-08-20[/tpl] which in turn is based on Jesus' "pray at all times" ([tpl]bibleverse||Luke|18:1|NRSV|[/tpl]), echoed by St. Paul's "pray without ceasing" ([tpl]bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17|NRSV[/tpl]). According to Escriva, the vocation to Opus Dei is a calling to be a "contemplative in the middle of the world," who converts work and daily life into prayer.

Weekly norms:[tpl]fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed#Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=noprint Template-Fact [/tpl]
Additionally, members should participate yearly in a spiritual retreat; a three-week seminar every year is obligatory for numeraries, and a one-week seminar for supernumeraries. Also members are expected to make a day-trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5-decade rosaries on the month of May in honour of Mary.

===Mortification===

Much public attention has focused on Opus Dei's practice of mortification—the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God; this includes fasting, or in some circumstances self-inflicted pain such as self-flagellation. Mortification has a long history in many world religions, including the Catholic Church. It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ, who died in a bloody crucifixion and who gave this advice: "let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me." (Lk 9:23)[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=7017|work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=The Da Vinci Code, the Catholic Church and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost (1) the "sense of the enormity of sin" or offense against God, and the consequent penance, both interior and exterior, (2) the notions of "wounded human nature" and of concupiscence or inclination to sin, and thus the need for "spiritual battle,"[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm | work=Catechism of the Catholic Church no. 405 | title=The consequences of Adam's sin for humanity | accessdate=2007-06-13[/tpl] and (3) a spirit of sacrifice for love and "supernatural ends," and not only for physical enhancement. Critics[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] claim that such practices that inflict pain are counterproductive given modern advances.
As a spirituality for ordinary people, Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness. Additionally, Opus Dei celibate members practise "corporal mortifications" such as sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on the floor, fasting or remaining silent for certain hours during the day.

==Organization and activities==

===Governance===

In Pope John Paul II's 1982 decree known as the Apostolic constitution Ut Sit, Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature, a new official structure of the Catholic Church, similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop. However, whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese, the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide, no matter what diocese they are in. To date, Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence. In addition to being governed by Ut Sit and by the Catholic Church's general law, Opus Dei is governed by the Church's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei, otherwise known as Opus Dei's statutes. This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature. The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISUTSI.HTM|author=Pope John Paul II | title=Apostolic Constitution Ut Sit, Establishing Opus Dei as the first Personal Prelature of the Catholic Church | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=10877 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Place in the Church | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
The head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the Prelate. The Prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils—the General Council (made up of men) and the Central Advisory (made up of women).[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=13018 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=What is Opus Dei – Governance | accessdate=2006-11-28[/tpl] The Prelate holds his position for life. The current prelate of Opus Dei is Javier Echevarría Rodríguez, who became the second Prelate of Opus Dei in 1994.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.ideasrapidas.org/opusdeii.htm | work=IdeasRapidas.org | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] The first Prelate of Opus Dei was Álvaro del Portillo, who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994.
Opus Dei's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses, which are usually convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses for the men and women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts.Original Latin version on Opus Dei Official Site After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.

===Membership===

Based on the language of Catholic Church law and theology, the prelature calls the people under the pastoral care of the prelate as "faithful of the prelature", since the term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese.
As of 2010, the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 91,960 of which 89,909 are lay persons, men and women, and 2051 priests. These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, estimated to number 2,000 in the year 2005.
About 60 per cent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe, and 35 per cent reside in the Americas.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=26013 | work=Zenit News Agency | title=Opus Dei: Its Mission, Structure and Members | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]  According to the study of John Allen, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society, in terms of education, income, and social status.
Opus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful:
Supernumeraries, the largest type, currently account for about 70% of the total membership.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-12-07/news/0312070395_1_liberal-catholics-secrets-new-york | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Catholics scrutinise enigmatic Opus Dei | accessdate=2011-01-11 | first=Ron | last=Grossman | date=2003-12-07[/tpl] Typically, supernumeraries are married men and women with careers. Supernumeraries devote a portion of their day to prayer, in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats. Due to their career and family obligations, supernumeraries are not as available to the organisation as the other types of faithful, but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei, and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit.
Numeraries, the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei, comprise about 20% of total membership. Numeraries are celibate members who usually live in special centers run by Opus Dei. Both men and women may become numeraries, although the centers are strictly gender-segregated. Numeraries generally have careers and devote the bulk of their income to the organisation.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/articles/martin-opusdei.cfm | work=America: The National Catholic Weekly | title=Opus Dei In the United States | author=James Martin, S.J. | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
Numerary assistants are unmarried, celibate female faithful of Opus Dei. They live in special centres run by Opus Dei but do not have jobs outside the centres—instead, their professional life is dedicated to looking after the domestic needs of the centers and their residents.
Associates are unmarried, celibate faithful who typically have family or professional obligations. Unlike numeraries and numerary assistants, the associates do not live in Opus Dei centres.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.cephas-library.com/catholic_opus_die.html | work=Cephas Library|title=Opus Dei |accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
The Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei. They are a minority in Opus Dei—only about 2% of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy. Typically, they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood.
The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross consists of priests associated with Opus Dei. Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature—priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society. Other members in the society are diocesan priests—clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese. These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training. They do not however report to the Opus Dei Prelate but to their own diocesan bishop.[tpl]Cite book|author= Pedro Rodríguez, Fernando Ocariz, José Luis Illanes | title=Opus Dei in the Church|publisher=Scepter |year=2003|isbn= 1-889334-93-6[/tpl] As of 2005, there were roughly two thousand of these priests.
The Cooperators of Opus Dei are non-members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei—usually through praying, charitable contributions, or by providing some other assistance. Cooperators are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements. Indeed, cooperators are not even required to be Christian. There were 164,000 cooperators in the year 2005.
In accordance with Catholic theology, membership is granted when a vocation, or divine calling is presumed to have occurred.

===Activities===

Leaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within.[tpl]cite news | author = David Van Biema | title = The Ways of Opus Dei | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1184078,00.html | work = Time | date = April 19, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-24[/tpl]Escriva said, "Opus Dei is a great catechesis."

Its lay people and priests organize seminars, workshops, retreats, and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives. Spiritual direction, one-on-one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest, is considered the "paramount means" of training. Through these activities they provide religious instruction (doctrinal formation), coaching in spirituality for lay people (spiritual formation), character and moral education (human formation), lessons in sanctifying one's work (professional formation), and know-how in evangelizing one's family and workplace (apostolic formation).
The official Catholic document which established the prelature states that Opus Dei strives "to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work." Thus, the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church—ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://lukeraid.tripod.com/opusdei/id19.html | work=Opus Dei: A Dialogue Between Friend and Foe | title=St. Liguori et Als on vocation and Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://en.romana.org/?s=8.0&n=29&ID=1 | work=Romana: The Official Bulletin of Opus Dei | title=The Example of the Early Christians in Blessed Josemaria's Teachings | author=Domingo Ramos-Lissón | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
Opus Dei runs residential centres throughout the world. These centers provide residential housing for celibate members, and provide doctrinal and theological education.

==Relations with Catholic leaders==

Leopoldo Eijo y Garay, the bishop of Madrid where Opus Dei was born, supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that "this opus is truly Dei" (this work is truly God's). Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy, the bishop described Opus Dei's founder as someone who is "open as a child" and "most obedient to the Church hierarchy."Vázquez de Prada, Andrés, The Founder of Opus Dei: The life of Josemaría Escrivá, Volume 1: The early years, New York, 2000.
In the 1950s, Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop, Cardinal Norman Gilroy that Escriva "is a true saint, a man sent by God for our times".Manuel Cerda, Like a bridge over troubled waters in Sydney: Warrane College and the student protests of 1970, Studia et Documenta 4(2010) 147–181 http://warrane.unsw.edu.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=81
In 1960, Pope John XXIII commented that Opus Dei opens up "unsuspected horizons of apostolate". Furthermore, in 1964, Pope Paul VI praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá, saying:
 
 Opus Dei is "a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church, fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God, the desire of doing good that guides it, the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it, and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life."

The relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei, according to Alberto Moncada, a doctor of sociology and ex-member, was "stormy".[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.takingfive.com/ethics_opusdei.htm | work=TakingFive.com | author=Ruth Bertels | title=The Ethics of Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965, Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei's petition to become a personal prelature, Moncada stated.
Pope John Paul I, a few years before his election, wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness. While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá "it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity", thus providing a lay spirituality.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |author=Cardinal Albino Luciani (John Paul I)| work=Opus Dei Files| title=Seeking God Through Everyday Work: A profile of the Founder of Opus Dei, Josemaria Escriva| accessdate=2007-04-03[/tpl]

Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered. Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception. Opus Dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood. In this country and elsewhere an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://horatio.uap.edu.ph/opusdei/opusdei_chapter2.html| work=University of Asia and the Pacific | author=William O'Connor| title=Opus Dei: An Open Book| accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl]

He emphasized that Escrivá's founding of Opus Dei was ductus divina inspiratione, led by divine inspiration, and he granted the organisation its status as a personal prelature.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISUTSI.HTM | author=Pope John Paul II | title=Ut Sit | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Stating that Escrivá is "counted among the great witnesses of Christianity," John Paul II canonized him in 2002, and called him "the saint of ordinary life."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=14246 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=St. Josemaría's Canonisation | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] Of the organisation, John Paul II said:
 
 "Dei has as its aim the sanctification of one's life, while remaining within the world at one's place of work and profession: to live the Gospel in the world, while living immersed in the world, but in order to transform it, and to redeem it with one's personal love for Christ. This is truly a great ideal, which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state of the Second Vatican Council and the post-conciliar period."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&p=9319 | work=Opus Dei Official Site | title=Opus Dei's focus on secular life | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]

One-third of the world's bishops petitioned for the canonisation of Escrivá. During the canonisation, there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world, generals superior of many religious institutes, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder.[tpl]Cite book| author=Messori, Vittorio| title=Opus Dei, Leadership and Vision in Today's Catholic Church | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=1997 | isbn=0-89526-450-1[/tpl] For his canonisation homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, "it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34)."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20021006_escriva_en.html| work=Vatican Official site| title=Canonization of St. Josemaria Escriva: Homily of John Paul II| accessdate=2008-03-20[/tpl]
Concerning the group's role in the Catholic Church, critics have argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence, making it essentially a "church within a church" and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid canonisation of Escrivá, which some considered to be irregular.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0510.baumann.html | work=Washington Monthly | title=Let There Be Light: A look inside the hidden world of Opus Dei | author=Paul Baumann | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope,[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=20829 | work=Opus Dei website | author=Francesco Monterisi | title=The Personal Prelature: a Framework which Enriches the Communion of the Church | accessdate=2007-02-17[/tpl] and its status as a prelature "precisely means dependence."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://zenit.org/article-22167?l=english| work=Zenit News Agency | author=Miriam Díez i Bosch| title=Opus Dei Opens its Doors to Everyone: Interview With the Vicar General of the Personal Prelature| accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl] Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.
Pope Benedict XVI, has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá. Pointing to the name "Work of God", Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger), wrote that "The Lord simply made use of Escrivá who allowed God to work." Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners: Even if he can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.
Ratzinger spoke of Opus Dei's "surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church's great tradition, to its faith, and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world, whether in the academic world, in the field of work, or in matters of the economy, etc." He further explained:
 
 "the theocentrism of Escrivá...means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal...This, for me, is a message of greatest importance. It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times: the pretense that after the 'Big Bang' God retired from history."

Pope Francis is a "friend of Opus Dei," said Jesuit writer, James V. Schall.http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2095/the_pope_and_the_poor.aspx#.Uko6slNElek As Pope he referred to St. Josemaria as "a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness."Telegramma della Segreteria di Stato per il Convegno su san Josemaría He has a devotion to St. Josemaria,http://www.opusdei.es/art.php?p=53061 and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes, when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.es.josemariaescriva.info/articulo/entrevista-javier-echevarria-el-papa-francisco-sentira-la-fuerza-y-compania-espiritual-de-benedicto| work=St. Josemaria website| title=Javier Echevarría: "El Papa Francisco sentirá la fuerza y la compañía espiritual de Benedicto XVI"| accessdate=2013-05-04[/tpl] He also celebrated the annual Holy Mass for several years on the Feast of St. Josemaria in Buenos Aires.

==Controversy==

Throughout its history, Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters, prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as "the most controversial force in the Catholic Church" and founder Saint Josemaría Escrivá as a "polarizing" figure.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Feb2006/books.asp | work=American Catholic | author=Brennan Hill | title=Who Stood For and Against Hitler? | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
The organisation has been criticized for issues relating to the Catholic Church, especially the practice of mortification of the flesh. Controversies about Opus Dei have centered around criticisms of its behaviours, such as alleged secretiveness, aggressive recruiting methods, and its strict rules governing members.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=7593 |work=Catalyst |title=Opus Dei: Fact and Fiction |date=March 1, 2004 |accessdate=February 19, 2011[/tpl] The organization's members have also been categorized by critics as right-leaning elitists, with some individuals supporting fascist governments, such as the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/moncada_alberto_opusdei_en0502.htm |title=Opus Dei Over Time | author=Alberto Moncada PhD | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-11-24[/tpl]

===Supporting views===

According to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett,[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.zenit.org/article-12784?l=french | work=Zenit News Agency | title=Entretien avec l’auteur de L’Opus Dei – Enquête sur le " monstre " | author=Patrice de Plunkett | accessdate=2007-06-20[/tpl] Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2300685.stm | work=BBC News | title=The rise of Opus Dei | author=Peter Gould | accessdate=2006-11-27 | date=2002-10-04[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week444/cover.html | author=Kim Lawton | work=PBS Religion & Ethics Newsweekly |date=2001-06-29 | title=Opus Dei | accessdate=2006-11-28[/tpl] Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents, with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/reviews/Opus-Dei-An-Interview-with-John-Allen-by-John-Romanowsky.cfm|work=Gospy| title=Unveiling Opus Dei: Interview with John L.

Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.theamericanmag.com/article.php?show_issue_id=24&show_article_id=320 | work=The American | author=Edward Pentin | title=Profiles: John Allen | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl]
As to its alleged participation in right-wing politics, especially the Francoist regime, British historians Paul Preston and Brian Crozier state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco's ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership.[tpl]Cite book| author=Paul Preston| title=Franco.

Opus Dei is not "elitist" in the sense in which people often invoke the term, meaning an exclusively white-collar phenomenon, concluded John Allen. He observed that among its members are barbers, bricklayers, mechanics and fruit sellers. Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle-class lives, he said.
Regarding alleged misogyny, John Allen states that half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women, and they supervise men.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/tall-tale-ignites-an-overdue-debate/2006/05/17/1147545387121.html?page=2 | title=Tall tale ignites an overdue debate | author=Julia Baird | accessdate=2007-04-04 | date=2006-05-18 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl] The Catholic Church defends its male priesthood by saying that "the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven are not the ministers but the saints."[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/teach/inteinsi.htm | title=Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (Inter Insigniores) | author=Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Approved for Publication by His Holiness Pope Paul VI | year=1976 | accessdate=2007-04-04[/tpl]

Critics state that Opus Dei is "intensely secretive"—for example, members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public. Further, under the 1950 constitution, members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors. This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member.
Opus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices such as showering potential members with intense praise ("Love bombing"),[tpl]Cite web| url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/14640/opus-dei-members-da-vinci-distorted | work=Daily Record | title=Opus Dei members: 'Da Vinci' distorted | author=Abbott Karloff|date=May 14, 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-27[/tpl] mirrored on ReligionNewsBlog.com[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=347479 | title=Opening the doors of Opus Dei: Part 2| author=Elizabeth W.

Critics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors. Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families. Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as "very cult-like".
Critics assert that Escrivá and the organisation supported radical right-wing governments, such as those of Franco, Augusto Pinochet[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s.Allen, John, Jr. Opus Dei, The Truth about its Rituals, Secrets and Power, 2005, Penguin Books, ISBN 0-14-102465-8, pp 287–290 Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments.

After conducting a critical study of Opus Dei, journalist John L. Allen, Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should (1) be more transparent, (2) collaborate with members of religious institutes, and (3) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution.

===Other views===

Sociologists Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington suggest that Opus Dei is involved in "a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity," one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions.[tpl]Cite book| title=Many Globalizations: Cultural Diversity in the Contemporary World | author=Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002| isbn=84-493-1322-8[/tpl] Van Biema of Time magazine emphasises Opus Dei's Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo-Saxon world, and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic, controversies about Opus Dei (and similar Catholic organizations) will decrease.
In her 2006 book on Opus Dei, Maggy Whitehouse, a non-Catholic journalist, argues that the relative autonomy of each director and centre has resulted in mistakes at the local level. She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei, which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by The Da Vinci Code and other critics.
