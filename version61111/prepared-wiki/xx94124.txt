[[Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste]]

CATEGORIES: Provincial political parties in Quebec, Political parties established in 1996

The Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste or RAP ([tpl]lang-en|Rally for a Progressive Alternative[/tpl]) originated as the Rassemblement pour l'alternative politique, a social movement founded in 1996 as an attempt to unite the progressive and leftist forces in Quebec, Canada. It formally became a political party in 2000, although it presented seven independent candidates (including former trade union leader Michel Chartrand) in the 1998 Quebec provincial election.
In 2002, it joined with the Parti de la démocratie socialiste and the Parti communiste du Québec to form the Union des forces progressistes (UFP).
