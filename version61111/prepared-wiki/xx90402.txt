Daniel Boyle (born July 12, 1976) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and an alternate captain of the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played for the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning, with whom he won a Stanley Cup in 2004.

==Playing career==

Undrafted after four years with the Miami RedHawks of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA), Boyle was signed as a free agent by the Florida Panthers on March 30, 1998.[tpl]cite web|title=Dan Boyle's NHL Profile|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8467096&view=notes|accessdate=2008-12-08|publisher=National Hockey League[/tpl]  He played his first two seasons in the Panthers' farm system in the American Hockey League (AHL), earning All-Rookie Team honours in 1999, as well as Second Team All-Star honours in 1999 and 2000.  Boyle earned a full-time roster spot with the Panthers in 2000–01, recording 4 goals and 22 points.  The next season, his fourth in Florida, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (Martin Tůma) in 2003 on January 7, 2002.  After completing the season with 20 points in 41 games after coming over from the Panthers, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Lightning on August 6, 2002.[tpl]Cite news|title=Lightning re-sign Boyle|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/06/lightning020806.html|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2002-08-06|publisher=CBC[/tpl]
He recorded 13 goals and 53 points in his first full season with the Lightning in 2002–03 before helping the team to the 2004 Stanley Cup championship.  Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Boyle went overseas to play for Djurgårdens IF of the Elitserien.  As NHL play resumed the next season, Boyle continued to produce with a 15-goal, 53-point season in 2005–06.  He recorded his first career NHL hat trick against the New York Rangers on December 23, 2006, adding an assist for a four-point game in a 4–3 win.[tpl]cite news|title=Lightning 4, Rangers 3|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores106/106357/NHL706450.htm|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2006-12-23|publisher=USA Today[/tpl]  The following season, Boyle elevated his game to career-high numbers of 20 goals, 43 assists and 63 points, good enough for Second Team All-Star honours.
He suffered a major setback, however, in September 2007, injuring himself in a freak accident after a pre-season game when a skate slipped off a hook in his locker and hit him in the left wrist, severing three tendons.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=218979&hubname=nhl|title=Lightning's Boyle hurt in freak accident|accessdate=2007-09-22|publisher=TSN|year=2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Boyle underwent initial wrist surgery on September 23;[tpl]cite news|title=Lightning's Boyle undergoes wrist surgery|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/09/23/boyle-injury-nhl.html?ref=rss|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2007-09-23|publisher=CBC[/tpl] he attempted to return on October 29, but after playing his first four games of the 2007–08 season, Boyle underwent additional surgery on the injured wrist,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://lightning.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=342409|title=Dan Boyle to have second surgery on left wrist|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=Tampa Bay Lightning|year=2007[/tpl] missing another 36 games.  He did not make a full comeback until January 24, 2008, scoring two goals in his return,[tpl]Cite web|title=Boyle makes strong return|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3213888&type=blogEntry|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2008-01-25|publisher=ESPN[/tpl] and soon thereafter was re-signed to a six-year, $40 million contract extension on February 25.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=230585&hubname=nhl|title=Lightning, Boyle agree to 6-year pact|accessdate=2008-02-25|publisher=TSN|year=2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  He completed his injury-shortened campaign with 25 points in 37 games.
Despite coming off a recent contract extension with the Lightning, on July 4, 2008, Boyle was traded along with Brad Lukowich to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle, Ty Wishart, a first round draft pick in 2009 and a fourth round draft pick in 2010.[tpl]Cite web|title=Boyle trade creates questions for both Lightning and Sharks|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=3473962|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2008-07-05|publisher=ESPN[/tpl]  Boyle was pressured to waive his no-trade clause by Tampa Bay's new ownership, who said they would otherwise place him on waivers where he would likely be claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers. Already knowing Joe Thornton, Patrick Marleau and Evgeni Nabokov, Boyle agreed to be traded to the Sharks.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
In his first season with the Sharks, he tallied 16 goals and 57 points over 77 games, leading all team defencemen.  The following season, on December 31, 2009, Boyle scored his 100th goal against the Phoenix Coyotes in a 3–2 shootout win.  He finished the campaign with 15 goals and 58 points.  In the opening series of the 2010 playoffs, Boyle ended game three against the Colorado Avalanche in overtime by inadvertently shooting the puck into his own net.  Pressured by Avalanche forward Ryan O'Reilly, Boyle attempted to ring the puck around the boards behind his net, but it was deflected by O'Reilly into the Sharks' net between Nabokov's pad and the post.[tpl]cite news|title=Sharks' Boyle looking to bounce back from bad break|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=318673|accessdate=2010-04-19|date=2010-04-19|publisher=The Sports Network[/tpl] Nonetheless, the Sharks won the series 4-2, winning games 4, 5, and 6. Boyle had a point in all three of these games.
In the first period of the October 15, 2013 against the St. Louis Blues, Boyle was checked from behind by Maxim Lapierre into the boards, injuring his jaw and knocking him unconscious;[tpl]cite web|last=Halford|first=Mike|url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/16/boyle-says-hes-ok-after-scary-lapierre-hit/?ocid=Yahoo&partner=ya5nbcs|title=Boyle says he’s OK after ‘scary’ Lapierre hit|publisher=NBC Sports|date=2013-10-16|accessdate=2013-10-16[/tpl] the incident led to a fight involving teammate Matt Pelech and 17 minutes worth of penalties for Andrew Desjardins.

He contributed 3 assists in 9 games as part of a silver-medal winning effort by Team Canada; they were defeated 3–0 in the gold medal game by the Czech Republic.  The next year, Boyle was named as a reserve in light of injuries to Scott Niedermayer and Ed Jovanovski for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.[tpl]cite web|title=Injury woes for Pronger|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Olympics/2006Turin/Hockey/2006/02/11/1437263-sun.html|accessdate=2008-12-08|date=2006-02-11|publisher=CANOE[/tpl]  He did not appear in a game as Team Canada was kept from the podium.
