The Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) ([tpl]lang-de|Institut f√ºr Quantenoptik und Quanteninformation[/tpl]) is a child institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and was founded in November 2003. The institute, with sites in Innsbruck and Vienna, is dedicated to fundamental research in quantum optics and quantum information, both theoretical and experimental.
The research institute has around 100 employees and consists of a section in Innsbruck, with four working groups led by Rainer Blatt, Hans Briegel, Rudolf Grimm and Peter Zoller, and a section in Vienna under the leadership of Anton Zeilinger. The institute is an independent research center with strong links to the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna. Thereby a close exchange of students and postdocs is established and the members of the institute can be integrated in teaching at the universities.
