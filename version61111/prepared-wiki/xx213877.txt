Chanh muối is a salted, pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine. Its name comes from the Vietnamese words chanh (meaning "lime" or "lemon") and muối (meaning "salt"). To make the chanh muối, many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass container and placed in the sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a pickling liquid which immerses the finished chanh muối.

==Serving method==

Chanh muối are used to make a drink (with added sugar and water or carbonated water) that is also called chanh muối (or soda chanh muối if made with carbonated water), and which often appears on the menus of Vietnamese restaurants translated as "salty lemonade" or "salty limeade." To prepare the drink, a small piece of chanh muối (containing both rind and flesh) is cut, placed in a glass, and crushed slightly with a spoon or other utensil to release its juices, then the other ingredients are added.
Although the drink is typically served cold, with ice, as a refreshing summer drink, it may also be served hot, and is believed to be a remedy for the common cold.Vietnamese Preserved Lemons (Chanh Muối) and Salty Lemonade | Garden Betty After finishing the drink, many Vietnamese people enjoy eating the piece of chanh muối left in the glass.
