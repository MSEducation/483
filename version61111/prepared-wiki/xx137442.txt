Apex Computer Productions were the brothers John and Steve Rowlands, British based game designers and programmers on the Commodore 64 in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
They programmed in pure assembly language and their earliest commercial release was Cyberdyne Warrior, a platform shooter, for Hewson in 1989. Soon after, they entered a relationship with Thalamus the game publishing arm of Zzap!64, who published their next game, Retrograde.

During the development of their next game, Creatures, Apex signed up for a "Diary of a game" feature in Zzap!64, where month by month the creation of Creatures was featured. This proved extremely popular among Zzap's readership. When released, all major publications gave the game a very high rating and it proved a major commercial success for Thalamus[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl].
After Creatures, Apex began work on the sequel Creatures II: Torture Trouble, still developing on the Commodore 64. In a startling coup - since Thalamus were associated with a rival magazine - Commodore Format (Future Publishing) had secured the rights to serialise the development of the game which again proved very popular. Creatures II was received favorably by the critics but ultimately did not sell well[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] due to the declining popularity of the C64 platform. Creatures II focused more on the popular torture screens than on the side-scrolling platforming of Creatures.
Thalamus collapsed shortly after the publication of Creatures II, as the Commodore 64 had started to wane in popularity. Apex then decided to publish for themselves.

Mayhem in Monsterland was their swan song. Platformers had become very popular, with Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario Bros. on the consoles, Mayhem was a game fashioned after Sonic, though mostly a direct descendant of Creatures.
