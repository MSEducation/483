Fields Of Omagh (foaled 1997) is a champion middle distance Australian  Thoroughbred racehorse of the early-mid-2000s. He was a half-brother to the stakeswinners, King Brian (Bunbury Cup, Pinjarra Cup), Malcolm (STC Canterbury Stakes, Ajax Stakes and Yallambee Stud Stakes) and Timeless Grace (VATC WW Cockram Stakes).
Fields Of Omagh was trained at Lindsay Park, South Australia by Peter Hayes, Tony McEvoy and David Hayes. 'FOO', as he was affectionately dubbed by fans and the media, won seven races in succession in the early part of his career. Nursed back from two serious injuries by Dr. Campbell Baker, head veterinary surgeon for Lindsay Park, the horse gained a reputation as a Moonee Valley specialist. He is also noted for his gallant runners-up behind Northerly in the 2002 Caulfield Cup. He won the Valley's prestigious Cox Plate for the first time in 2003, and, in a record-equalling fifth attempt, created history in becoming the race's oldest winner, as a nine-year-old, in 2006. In between these wins, he was second to Savabeel, and third behind Makybe Diva. 'FOO' also won the 2006 Group One Futurity Stakes.2006 Futurity result 'FOO' campaigned at or near the highest level for six years in-a-row and raced against a number of champions including Makybe Diva, Sunline, Northerly, Lonhro and El Segundo.
