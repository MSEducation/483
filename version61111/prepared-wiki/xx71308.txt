Since graduating, Geraci has become well known for his sculpture, working mainly in bronze.  Many of his works are symbolic, drawing on the lessons of mythology, promoting humanity, and frequently take the form of circular plaques or medallions, small and large.
Works include the 1.9 m (6 ft) diameter bronze plaque at Palermo International Airport in memory of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and a 9 m high statue of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina at Poggio Maria, Cefalù.
His works are known to be found in Denmark, Netherlands (including a monument in Leersum to the space age following the launch of Sputnik 1), Italy, and the Vatican.
