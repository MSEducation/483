Drovers Cave was well known to early explorers and stockmen; the location of the site near to the Canning Stock Route meant it was often visited by drovers, hence the name. The first known visit to the cave was a drover who signed the cave wall in 1886. Many more visits occurred between 1930 and 1940. The cave was surveyed in 1973 and gazetted as part of the National Park the same year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wasg.iinet.net.au/drovers.html|title=Western Australian Speleological Group Website|year=2008|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl]
