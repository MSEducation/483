Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands is a major tourism company based in Northland, New Zealand. Today it is Northland's largest marine tourism operator with a wide range of cruises and land tours.

==History==

In 1886, Albert Ernest Fuller launched the “Undine” sailing ship in the Bay of Islands to deliver coal supplies to the islands within the Bay. With the fitting of a motor in the early 1900s, Fuller was able to deliver the coal and essential supplies to communities as far out as Cape Brett. In 1927 Fuller acquired the “Cream Trip” from Eddie Lane – with the facilities on board to transport cream from the islands, and by the 1960s, the well known ‘Bay Belle’ started this run. Although a modern catamaran now takes this historical route (The Cream Trip), the Bay Belle continues to transport visitors and locals between Paihia and Russell throughout the day. 
In December 2008 Fullers Bay of Islands was rebranded Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands to bring it inline with InterCity Group's parent sightseeing brand of GreatSights New Zealand.
