==History==

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002-2003, 2013)===

Originally, The Disciples of the New Church formed as a heel stable consisting of Tempest, Slash, and Malice, along with Father James Mitchell as their manager. They were all introduced in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 19, 2002 when they competed in the Gauntlet for the Gold: an over-the-top rope elimination match in which the final two competitors face off in a one-fall singles match to crown the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era. Malice and Ken Shamrock were the last two remaining in the Gauntlet for the gold match, with Ken Shamrock winning via pinfall, thus leading up to a feud between him and The New Church.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/020619a.html|title=NWA:TNA PPV results - June 19, 2002|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=May 2, 2012[/tpl]
On the next PPV, the following week, The New Church interrupted a speech by Ken Shamrock. James Mitchell challenged Shamrock to a match with his Disciple, Malice, for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and Ken Shamrock agreed. Then Malice attacked Shamrock from behind in the ring and gave him a chokeslam. On July 3, Ken Shamrock was attacked by Malice backstage before their match even started, but Ken Shamrock competed to face Malice in the ring regardless and retained his NWA World Title after he defeated Malice in a singles match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tna/020703.html|title=NWA:TNA PPV results - July 3, 2002|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] On July 10, Slash and Tempest got a shot at the Tag Team Titles against A.J.
