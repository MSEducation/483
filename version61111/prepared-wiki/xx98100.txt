Notably, it has been integrated with Inkscape, giving Inkscape its Trace Bitmap action.Potrace in Inkscape CR8tracer is a simple Windows GUI based frontend. FontForge can use Potrace to import a bitmap image into a font. Potrace is also used by the music engraving program LilyPond.
Potrace's input and output is black and white (colored images are greyscaled before processing).
