==History== 
Crewe Wolves entered the Northern Division of the Rugby League Conference in 1999 playing their first season at Crewe & Nantwich RUFC. 
In seasons 2000-2002 they played at Sandbach RUFC and 2003-2004 at Winnington Park RFC. Crewe & Nantwich Steamers started in early 2003 as a junior colts team with some senior players and then joined forces with Wolves to create one senior and one colts team under one club. 
The Wolves played at Crosfields ARLFC in Warrington in 2005 before returning to Crewe for the 2006 season. In 2007 Crewe & Nantwich Steamers broke with Wolves and formed their own senior and colts sides.
In 2008 Crewe Wolves moved their home once more, this time to Lymm RUFC. This move incorporated a name change to Lymm Wolves. 
In 2009 the club dropped the Wolves to become Lymm RL. After competing in the Cheshire Division in 2008, the club moved up to the Rugby League Conference North West Premier. Lymm RL finished top of the table and defeated Widnes Saints 20-10 in the final to be crowned the North West Premier Champions 2009. Lymm knocked out Kippax Knights with a 28-26 victory in the national quarter-finals before being pipped for a national Grand Final appearance with a 32-20 defeat against Coventry Bears.
In 2011 Lymm were dropped from the North West Premier to North West Merit League due allegedly to a late application.
