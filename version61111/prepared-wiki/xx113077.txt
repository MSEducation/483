Grenadine Records is a Canadian independent record label based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  The music label was founded in 1997 by Eric Y. Lapointe and Alex Megelas who met at Bishop's University's radio station CJMQ-FM.  
The label, initially named Bittersweet Records, released two 7" vinyl recordings and then quickly changed its name in 1999 when a New York City-based label of the same name was discovered.  The label was officially announced as Grenadine Records as of March 1999 along with its first CD release Syrup & Gasoline Vol.1 which was a compilation of bands from across Canada. The label's tagline of "Timeless Pop Attitude" reflected the label's interest in a variety of pop music with sometimes earlier influences.
Grenadine Records has released albums in both English and French by bands including the Dears, Nightwood, Shane Watt, the Frenetics, Tricky Woo, Blurtonia, Shy Child, Alexis O'Hara, the American Devices, Melon Galia, music for mapmakers, LowBrow, Starvin Hungry, Eux Autres and Les Sequelles.
