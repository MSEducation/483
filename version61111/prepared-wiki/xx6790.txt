The location of L1 is the solution to the following equation balancing gravitation and centrifugal force:
where r is the distance of the L1 point from the smaller object, R is the distance between the two main objects, and M1 and M2 are the masses of the large and small object, respectively. (The quantity in parenthesis on the right is the distance of L1 from the center of mass.) Solving this for r involves solving a quintic, but if the mass of the smaller object (M2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (M1) then [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] are at approximately equal distances r from the smaller object, equal to the radius of the Hill sphere, given by:
The Sun–Earth [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] is suited for making observations of the Sun–Earth system.  Objects here are never shadowed by the Earth or the Moon. The first mission of this type was the International Sun Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE3) mission used as an interplanetary early warning storm monitor for solar disturbances.  The feasibility of this orbit was the result of a PhD thesis by the astrodynamicist Robert W. Farquhar.Farquhar, R. W.: "The Control and Use of Libration-Point Satellites", Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 1968 Subsequently the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was stationed in a Halo orbit at [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl], and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) in a Lissajous orbit, also at the [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] point. WIND is also at [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl].
The Earth–Moon [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] allows comparatively easy access to lunar and earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and has this as an advantage to position a half-way manned space station intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the Moon and back.
In a binary star system, the Roche lobe has its apex located at [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl]; if a star overflows its Roche lobe then it will lose matter to its companion star.
The L1 point is also important for scientific research satellites.

===[tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl]===

The [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] point lies on the line through the two large masses, beyond the smaller of the two. Here, the gravitational forces of the two large masses balance the centrifugal effect on a body at [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl].
The Sun–Earth [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] is a good spot for space-based observatories. Because an object around [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] will maintain the same relative position with respect to the Sun and Earth, shielding and calibration are much simpler. It is, however, slightly beyond the reach of Earth's umbra,Angular size of the Sun at 1 AU + 930000 miles: 31.6', angular size of Earth at 930000 miles: 29.3' so solar radiation is not completely blocked. 
Earth–Moon [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] would be a good location for a communications satellite covering the Moon's far side.
Earth–Moon [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] would be "an ideal location" for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.[ref]

L2 is an ideal location to store propellants and cargos: it is close, high energy, and cold. More importantly, it allows the continuous onward movement of propellants from LEO depots thus suppressing their size and effectively minimizing the near-earth boiloff penalties.[/tpl][/ref]
The location of L2 is the solution to the following equation balancing gravitation and inertia:
with parameters defined as for the L1 case. Again, if the mass of the smaller object (M2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (M1) then L2 is at approximately the radius of the Hill sphere, given by:

====Spacecraft at Sun–Earth L2====

Spacecraft at the Sun–Earth L2 are in a Lissajous orbit until decommissioned, when they are sent into a heliocentric graveyard orbit.

===L3===

The [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] point lies on the line defined by the two large masses, beyond the larger of the two.
The location of L3 is the solution to the following equation balancing gravitation and centrifugal force:
with parameters defined as for the L1 and L2 cases except that r now indicates how much closer L3 is to the more massive object than the smaller object. If the mass of the smaller object (M2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (M1) then:
The Sun–Earth [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] point was a popular place to put a "Counter-Earth" in pulp science fiction and comic books. Once space-based observation became possible via satellitesSTEREO mission description by NASA, http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html#.UuG0NxDb-kk and probes, it was shown to hold no such object. The Sun–Earth [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] is unstable and could not contain an object, large or small, for very long. This is because the gravitational forces of the other planets are stronger than that of the Earth (Venus, for example, comes within 0.3 AU of this [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] every 20 months).
A spacecraft orbiting near Sun–Earth [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] would be able to closely monitor the evolution of active sunspot regions before they rotate into a geoeffective position, so that a 7-day early warning could be issued by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center. Moreover, a satellite near Sun–Earth [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] would provide very important observations not only for Earth forecasts, but also for deep space support (Mars predictions and for manned mission to near-Earth asteroids). In 2010, spacecraft transfer trajectories to Sun–Earth [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] were studied and several designs were considered.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Spacecraft trajectories to the [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] point of the Sun–Earth three-body problem |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy (Springer) |last1=Tantardini |first1=Marco|last2=Fantino |first2=Elena |coauthors= Yuan Ren, Pierpaolo Pergola, Gerard Gómez and Josep J.

Scientists at the B612 Foundation are planning to use Venus's L3 point to position their planned Sentinel telescope, which aims to look back towards Earth's orbit and compile a catalogue of near-Earth asteroids.The Sentinel Mission, B612 Foundation. Retrieved Feb 2014.
One example of asteroids which visit an [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] point is the Hilda family whose orbit brings them to the Sun–Jupiter [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] point.

===[tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl]===

The [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] points lie at the third corners of the two equilateral triangles in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses, such that the point lies behind ([tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl]) or ahead ([tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl]) of the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass.
The reason these points are in balance is that, at [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl], the distances to the two masses are equal. Accordingly, the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies are in the same ratio as the masses of the two bodies, and so the resultant force acts through the barycenter of the system; additionally, the geometry of the triangle ensures that the resultant acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same ratio as for the two massive bodies. The barycenter being both the center of mass and center of rotation of the three-body system, this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the Lagrange point in orbital equilibrium with the other two larger bodies of system. (Indeed, the third body need not have negligible mass). The general triangular configuration was discovered by Lagrange in work on the 3-body problem.
[tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] are sometimes called triangular Lagrange points or Trojan points.  The name Trojan points comes from the Trojan asteroids at the Sun–Jupiter [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] points, which themselves are named after characters from Homer's Iliad (the legendary siege of Troy). Asteroids at the [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] point, which leads Jupiter, are referred to as the "Greek camp", while those at the [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] point are referred to as the "Trojan camp". These asteroids are (largely) named after characters from the respective sides of the Trojan War.

==Stability==

Although the [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl], [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl], and [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] points are nominally unstable, it turns out that it is possible to find (unstable) periodic orbits around these points, at least in the restricted three-body problem. These periodic orbits, referred to as "halo" orbits, do not exist in a full n-body dynamical system such as the Solar System. However, quasi-periodic (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following Lissajous-curve trajectories do exist in the n-body system. These quasi-periodic Lissajous orbits are what most of Lagrangian-point missions to date have used. Although they are not perfectly stable, a relatively modest effort at station keeping can allow a spacecraft to stay in a desired Lissajous orbit for an extended period of time. It also turns out that, at least in the case of Sun–Earth-[tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] missions, it is actually preferable to place the spacecraft in a large-amplitude ([tpl]convert|100000|–|200000|km|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) Lissajous orbit, instead of having it sit at the Lagrangian point, because this keeps the spacecraft off the direct Sun–Earth line, thereby reducing the impact of solar interference on Earth–spacecraft communications. Another interesting and useful property of the collinear Lagrangian points and their associated Lissajous orbits is that they serve as "gateways" to control the chaotic trajectories of the Interplanetary Transport Network.
In 2008 it was found that the [tpl]L4[/tpl] and [tpl]L5[/tpl] points in the Earth–Moon system would be stable for 1000 million years, even with perturbations from the sun, but because of smaller perturbations by the planets, orbits around these points can only last a few million years."Solar and planetary destabilization of the Earth–Moon triangular Lagrangian points" by Jack Lissauer and John Chambers, Icarus, vol. 195, issue 1, May 2008, pp. 16-27.

==Intuitive explanation==

Lagrangian points can be explained intuitively using the Earth–Moon system.[tpl]cite book| last = Tyson| first = Neil deGrasse| title = Death by Black hole: and other cosmic quandaries| url = http://books.google.com/?id=0co_UQgNXacC| date = 2007-01-16| publisher = W. W. Norton & Company| isbn = 978-0-393-06224-3 [/tpl]
Lagrangian points [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] through [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] exist only in rotating systems, such as in the monthly orbiting of the Moon about the Earth. At these points, the combined attraction from the two masses is equivalent to what would be exerted by a single mass at the barycenter of the system, sufficient to cause a small body to orbit with the same period.
Imagine a person swinging a stone at the end of a string. The string provides a tension force that continuously accelerates the stone toward the center. To an ant standing on the stone, however, it seems as if there is an opposite force trying to fling it directly away from the center. This apparent force is called the centrifugal force.  It is actually simply the outward radial component of the stone's inertia caused by its swing.  This same effect is present at the Lagrangian points in the Earth–Moon system, where the analogue of the string is the summed (or net) gravitational attraction of the two masses, and the stone is an asteroid or a spacecraft. The Earth–Moon system and the spacecraft all rotate about this combined center of mass, or barycenter. Because the Earth is much heavier than the Moon, the barycenter is located within the Earth (about [tpl]convert|1700|km|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] below the surface). Any object gravitationally held by the rotating Earth–Moon system will be attracted to the barycenter to an equal and opposite degree as its tendency to fly off into space.
[tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] is a bit farther from the (less massive) Moon and closer to the (more massive) Earth than the point where total gravity is zero. [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] is slightly unstable (see stability, above) because drifting towards the Moon or Earth increases one gravitational attraction while decreasing the other, causing more drift.
At Lagrangian points [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl], [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl], [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl], and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl], a spacecraft's inertia to move away from the barycenter is balanced by the attraction of gravity toward the barycenter. [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] are slightly unstable because small changes in position upset the balance between gravity and inertia, allowing one or the other force to dominate, so that the spacecraft either flies off into space or spirals in toward the barycenter. Stability at [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] is explained by gravitational equilibrium: if  the object were moved into a tighter orbit, it would orbit faster which would counteract the increase in gravity; if the object moves into a wider orbit, the gravity is lower, but it loses speed.  The net result is that the object appears constantly to hover or orbit around the [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] or [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] point.
The easiest way to understand the resulting stability is to say [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl], [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl], and [tpl]L3|nolink=yes[/tpl] positions are as stable as a ball balanced on the tip of a wedge would be stable: any disturbance will toss it out of equilibrium. The [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl], and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] positions are stable as a ball at the bottom of a bowl would be stable: small perturbations will move it out of place, but it will drift back toward the center of the bowl.
Note that from the perspective of the smaller-mass object—from the moon, in the preceding example—a spacecraft might appear to orbit in an irregular path about the [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] or [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] point, but from the perspective above the orbital plane, it becomes clear that both the smaller mass and the spacecraft are orbiting the larger mass (or more precisely, all of the objects are in orbit around the barycenter of the system); they simply have overlapping orbital paths. This point of view difference is illustrated clearly by animations in the 3753 Cruithne and Coriolis effect articles.

==List of missions to Lagrangian points==

Orbits around Lagrangian points offer unique advantages that have made them a good choice for performing certain spacecraft missions. For example the Sun–Earth [tpl]L1|nolink=yes[/tpl] point is useful for observations of the Sun, as the Sun is always visible without obstructions by the Earth or the Moon. The Sun–Earth [tpl]L2|nolink=yes[/tpl] point is useful for astronomy missions using space observatories, as from this point the Sun, Earth and Moon are relatively closely positioned together in the sky, and hence leave a large field of view without interference – this is especially helpful for infrared astronomy.
Missions to Lagrangian points generally orbit the points rather than occupy them directly.

===Future and proposed missions===

==Natural examples==

In the Sun–Jupiter system several thousand asteroids, collectively referred to as Jupiter trojans or "Trojan asteroids", are in orbits around the Sun–Jupiter [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] points. Recent observations suggest that the Sun–Neptune [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] points, known as the Neptune trojans, may be very thickly populated, containing large bodies an order of magnitude more numerous than the Jupiter trojans. Mars has three known co-orbital asteroids (5261 Eureka, [tpl]mpl|1999 UJ|7[/tpl], and [tpl]mpl|1998 VF|31[/tpl]), all at its Lagrangian points. There is one known trojan for Earth as of July 2011. Clouds of dust, called Kordylewski clouds, even fainter than the notoriously weak gegenschein, may also be present in the [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] of the Earth–Moon system.
The Saturnian moon Tethys has two smaller moons in its [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] and [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] points, Telesto and Calypso. The Saturnian moon Dione also has two Lagrangian co-orbitals, Helene at its [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] point and Polydeuces at [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl]. The moons wander azimuthally about the Lagrangian points, with Polydeuces describing the largest deviations, moving up to 32 degrees away from the Saturn–Dione [tpl]L5|nolink=yes[/tpl] point. Tethys and Dione are hundreds of times more massive than their "escorts" (see the moons' articles for exact diameter figures; masses are not known in several cases), and Saturn is far more massive still, which makes the overall system stable.

===Other co-orbitals===

[tpl]mpl|2010 TK|7[/tpl] is the first Earth trojan asteroid discovered. It was discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer in October, 2010. After evaluation of the collected data the trojan character of its motion was published in July 2011. [tpl]mp|2010 TK|7[/tpl] has a diameter of 300 meters. Its path is around the Sun–Earth [tpl]L4|nolink=yes[/tpl] Lagrangian point.
The Earth's companion object 3753 Cruithne is in a relationship with the Earth which is somewhat trojan-like, but different from a true trojan. This asteroid occupies one of two regular solar orbits, one of them slightly smaller and faster than the Earth's orbit, and the other slightly larger and slower.  The asteroid periodically alternates between these two orbits due to close encounters with Earth. When the asteroid is in the smaller, faster orbit and approaches the Earth, it gains orbital energy from the Earth and moves up into the larger, slower orbit. It then falls farther and farther behind the Earth, and eventually Earth approaches it from the other direction.  Then the asteroid gives up orbital energy to the Earth, and drops back into the smaller orbit, thus beginning the cycle anew.  The cycle has no noticeable impact on the length of the year, because Earth's mass is over 20 billion ([tpl]val|2|e=10[/tpl]) times more than 3753 Cruithne.
Epimetheus and Janus, satellites of Saturn, have a similar relationship, though they are of similar masses and so actually exchange orbits with each other periodically. (Janus is roughly 4 times more massive but still light enough for its orbit to be altered.) Another similar configuration is known as orbital resonance, in which orbiting bodies tend to have periods of a simple integer ratio, due to their interaction.
