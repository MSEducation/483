==Biography==

He was born in Drogheda and educated at the Free Grammar School, Derry (later renamed Foyle College, now part of Foyle and Londonderry College) and Trinity College Dublin. Ordained in 1799, he became curate of Swanlinbar, County Cavan and later curate in Mogorbane, County Tipperary in 1805 and archdeacon of Emly in 1801.
For his services in maintaining order in the parish during the disturbances that followed the outbreak of famine in the west of Ireland in 1822, he was made Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe in that year. In 1827 he had a stroke and afterwards spent his time in various places in England, devoting himself to writing. He favoured the high church approach to ritual and is regarded as a forerunner of the Oxford movement. He died in East Hill, near Wandsworth, Surrey.
