[[24 BC]]

CATEGORIES: 24 BC

Year 24 BC was either a common year starting on Thursday, Friday or Saturday or a leap year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a common year starting on Thursday of the Proleptic Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Flaccus (or, less frequently, year 730 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 24 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
