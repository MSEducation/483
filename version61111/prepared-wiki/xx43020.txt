Chitin (C8H13O5N)n ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|t|ɨ|n[/tpl] [tpl]respell|KY|tin[/tpl]) is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose, and is found in many places throughout the natural world. It is the main component of the cell walls of fungi, the exoskeletons of arthropods such as crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps) and insects, the radulas of mollusks, and the beaks and internal shells of cephalopods, including squid and octopuses. The structure of chitin is comparable to the polysaccharide cellulose, forming crystalline nanofibrils or whiskers. In terms of function, it may be compared to the protein keratin.  Chitin has also proven useful for several medical and industrial purposes. Bird plumage and butterfly wing scales are often organized into stacks of nano-layers or nano-sticks made of chitin nanocrystals that produce various iridescent colors by thin-film interference.[tpl]cite journal | journal = J of Nanomaterials & Molecular Nanotechnology | year = 2012 | volume = 1 | pages = 2-4  | Author = Morganti P | title = Nanoparticles and Nanostroctures Man-made or Naturally recovered: the biomimetic activity of Chitin Nanofibrils[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The English word "chitin" comes from the French word chitine, which first appeared in 1821 and derived from the Greek word χιτών (chiton), meaning covering.Auguste Odier (presented:  1821 ; published:  1823) "Mémoire sur la composition chimique des parties cornées des insectes"  (Memoir on the chemical composition of the horny parts of insects), Mémoires de la Société d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, 1 : 29-42.  From page 35:  "… la Chitine (c'est ainsi que je nomme cette substance de chiton, χιτον, enveloppe) …"  (… chitine (it is thus that I name this substance from chiton, χιτον, covering) …)
A similar word, "chiton", refers to a marine animal with a protective shell (also known as a "sea cradle").

==Chemistry, physical properties and biological function==

The structure of chitin was solved by Albert Hofmann in 1929.[ref]Hofmann hydrolyzed chitin using a crude preparation of the enzyme chitinase, which he obtained from the snail Helix pomatia.  See:
Chitin is a modified polysaccharide that contains nitrogen; it is synthesized from units of N-acetylglucosamine (to be precise, 2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-D-glucose). These units form covalent β-1,4 linkages (similar to the linkages between glucose units forming cellulose). Therefore, chitin may be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced with an acetyl amine group. This allows for increased hydrogen bonding between adjacent polymers, giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.
In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in sclerotin, a tanned proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, chitin is leathery, but in most invertebrates it occurs largely as a component of composite materials. Combined with  calcium carbonate, as in the shells of Crustacea and molluscs, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and more stiff than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than calcium carbonate.Campbell, N. A. (1996) Biology (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings, New Work. p.69 ISBN 0-8053-1957-3 Another difference between pure and composite forms can be seen by comparing the flexible body wall between the segments of a caterpillar (mainly chitin) to the stiff, light elytron of a beetle (containing a large proportion of sclerotin).[tpl]cite book | author = Gilbert, Lawrence I. | title = Insect development : morphogenesis, molting and metamorphosis | publisher = Elsevier/Academic Press | location = Amsterdam Boston | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-12-375136-2 [/tpl]

==Fossil record==

Chitin was probably present in the exoskeletons of Cambrian arthropods such as trilobites. The oldest preserved chitin dates to the Oligocene,  about [tpl]ma|25[/tpl], comprising a scorpion encased in amber.

===Agriculture===

Most recent studies point out that chitin is a good inducer of defense mechanisms in plants.[tpl]cite web | title=Linden, J., Stoner, R., Knutson, K. Gardner-Hughes, C.

===Industrial===

Chitin is used in industry in many processes. Examples of the potential uses of chemically modified chitin in food processing include the formation edible films and as an additive to thicken and stabilize foodsShahidi,F., Arachchi, J.K.V. and Jeon, Y.-J. (1999) Food applications of chitin and chitosans. Trends in Food Science & Technology, 10 37-51 and pharmaceuticals.

===Medicine===

Chitin's properties as a flexible and strong material make it favorable as surgical thread. Its biodegradibility means it wears away with time as the wound heals. Moreover, chitin has been reported to have some unusual properties that accelerate healing of wounds in humans.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121487185/PDFSTART |volume=20 |journal=Polymers for Advanced Technologies|pages=58–65 |date=July 2008 |doi=10.1002/pat.1280 |title=Preparation of chitosan–polyethylene glycol coated cotton membranes for wound dressings: preparation and characterization |author=Bhuvanesh Gupta, Abha Arorab, Shalini Saxena and Mohammad Sarwar Alam[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title = Marine Biomaterials  | author = SK Kim | publisher = CRC-Press | year = 2013 | pages = 149–159[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Nanoparticles and nanocomposite chitin nanofibrils/chitosan films in health-care-prepartion and characterization of biomimetic films for wounds in humans | author = Morganti P, Tishenko G, et al  | pages = 681–715[/tpl][tpl]full[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Anti-aging activity of chitin nanofibrils complexes | journal = The Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–245 | year = 2012 | author = Morganti P, Fabrizi G et al. | doi = 10.1007/s12603-011-0358-0[/tpl]
Occupations associated with high environmental chitin levels, such as shellfish processors, are prone to high incidences of asthma.  Recent studies have suggested that chitin may play a role in a possible pathway in human allergic disease.  To be specific, mice treated with chitin develop an allergic response, characterized by a build-up of interleukin-4-expressing innate immune cells.  In these treated mice, additional treatment with a chitinase enzyme abolishes the response.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7140/edsumm/e070503-13.html |volume=447 |journal=Nature |pages=92–96 |date=3 May 2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05746 |title=Chitin induces accumulation in tissue of innate immune cells associated with allergy |pmid=17450126 |author=Tiffany A.

===Biomedical research===

Chitin may be employed for affinity purification of recombinant protein.  A chitin binding domain is genetically fused to a protein of interest and then contacted to beads coated with chitin.  The immobilized protein is purified and released from the beads by cleaving off the chitin binding domain.[tpl]clarify|date=April 2012[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
