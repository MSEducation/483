[tpl]nihongo|Hosokawa Ujitsuna|細川 氏綱|extra=1514 – January 4, 1564[/tpl] was a Japanese military commander and Deputy Shogun of the Hosokawa clan in the end of the Muromachi period and Sengoku period of the 16th century. He was the foster son of Hosokawa Takakuni.
In 1543, Ujitsuna raised his armies in revenge for Takakuni who was killed by Hosokawa Harumoto. He was at a great disadvantage at first; however, Miyoshi Nagayoshi, Harumoto's retainer, betrayed Harumoto and sided with Ujitsuna. In 1549, at last, Ujitsuna was able to expel Harumoto to Ōmi Province. 
In 1552, Ujitsuna marched his armies along with Nagayoshi, and was appointed Kanrei. However, as a puppet of Nagayoshi, Ujitsuna had no real power. After that, Ujitsuna was given Yodo Castle at Settsu province and was monitored by Nagayoshi.
In 1564, he died in despair and hopelessness.
