</ref> The collection includes five short stories spanning Butler's career, the first finished in 1971 and the last in 1993. "[[Bloodchild]]", the Hugo and Nebula award-winning title story,<ref name=SFAwards/> concerns humans who live on a reservation on an alien planet ruled by insect-like creatures. The aliens breed by implanting eggs in the humans, with whom they share a [[symbiotic]] existence. In Butler's afterword to the story, she writes that it is not about slavery as some have suggested, but rather about love and coming-of-ageâ€”as well as [[male pregnancy]] and the "unusual accommodation[s]" that a group of interstellar colonists might have to make with their adopted planet's prior inhabitants.<ref name="bloodaft">

She also states that writing it was her way of overcoming a fear of bot flies.
In 2005, Seven Stories Press released an expanded edition.

===Themes of social criticism===

Butler used the hyperbolic reach of speculative fiction to explore modern and ancient social issues. She often represented concepts like race, sexuality, gender, religion, social progress, and social class in metaphoric language. However, these issues were not relegated only to metaphor. For instance, class struggle is an overt topic in the Parable of the Sower series. Her work has been more specifically associated with the genre of Afrofuturism, a theme in contemporary black works in various media (music, art, writing, film). Afrofuturism employs speculative fiction and the trope of space and/or abduction in order to draw parallels with a marginalized, black experience. In "Further Considerations on Afrofuturism, Eshun writes, "Most science fiction tales dramatically deal with how the individual is going to contend with these alienating, dislocating societies and circumstances that pretty much sums up the mass experiences of black people in the postslavery twentieth century" (298)Muse.jhu.edu Eshun, Kodwo "Further Considerations on Afrofuturism" Thus, Butler's exploration of the themes of isolation and power struggles in futuristic settings, often with black protagonists, allows her work to fall under this critical category.

==Interviews==

Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 soon after the award of MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, "What then is central to what you want to say about race?" Butler's response was, "Do I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it."Charlie Rose: A Conversation with Octavia Butler", 2000.
