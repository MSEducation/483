London City Airways was a former British airline which was founded in 1986 by British Midland to operate services from London City Airport. The company was originally known as Eurocity Express.

==History==

The company was incorporated in 1986 as Eurocity Express. Operations began in the summer of 1987 from its base at London City Airport to Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris using two de Havilland Canada Dash 7. Together with Brymon Airways, with whom it competed directly on the Paris route, the airline was responsible for launching operations from the newly constructed airport. A summer schedule to Jersey and weekend Adhoc charters were added later.
In 1988, the airline was renamed as London City Airways so as to identify more closely with its base. Orders were placed for three de Havilland Canada Dash 7, the final airframes of this type that were produced. They took up the recently released British Airways unused Concorde registrations G-BOAW, AX and AY. The two original aircraft were sold when the 3rd aircraft arrived but later in 1988 a further Dash 7 G-BOAZ was purchased from Maersk Air to increase the fleet to four aircraft.
The airline was closed in 1990 following sustained financial losses. The aircraft were transferred to the parent British Midland Airways.
