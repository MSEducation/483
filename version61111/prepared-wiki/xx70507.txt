Chronic alcohol misuse and abuse has serious effects on physical and mental health. Chronic excess alcohol intake, or alcohol dependence, can lead to a wide range of neuropsychiatric or neurological impairment, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and malignant neoplasms. The psychiatric disorders which are associated with alcoholism include major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, suicide, neurologic deficits (e.g. impairments of working memory, emotions, executive functions, visuospatial abilities and gait and balance) and brain damage. Alcohol dependence is associated with hypertension, coronary heart disease, and ischemic stroke, cancer of the respiratory system, and also cancers of the digestive system, liver, breast and ovaries.

Over-consumption of alcohol causes many deaths worldwide.

Extensive research of Western cultures has consistently shown increased survival associated with light to moderate alcohol consumption.Di Castelnuovo A, Costanzo S, Bagnardi V, Donati MB, Iacoviello L, de Gaetano G.  Alcohol dosing and total mortality in men and women: an updated meta-analysis of 34 prospective studies.  Arch Intern Med. 2006 Dec 11-25;166(22) 2437-45. A 23-year prospective study of 12,000 male British physicians aged 48–78, found that overall mortality was significantly lower in current drinkers compared to non-drinkers even after correction for ex-drinkers.  This benefit was strongest for ischemic heart disease, but was also noted for other vascular disease and respiratory disease.  Death rate amongst current drinkers was higher for 'alcohol augmentable' disease such as liver disease and oral cancers,  but these deaths were much less common than cardiovascular and respiratory deaths. The lowest mortality rate was found for consumption of 8 to 14 'units' per week.  In the UK a unit is defined as 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Higher consumption increased overall mortality rate, but not above that of non-drinkers.[tpl]cite journal|author=Doll R, Peto R, Boreham J, Sutherland I|title=Mortality in relation to alcohol consumption: a prospective study among male British doctors|journal=Int J Epidemiol|volume=34|issue=1|pages=199–204|date=February 2005|pmid=15647313|doi=10.1093/ije/dyh369|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/199[/tpl] Other studies have found age-dependent mortality risks of low-to-moderate alcohol use: an increased risk for individuals aged 16-34 (due to increased risk of cancers, accidents, liver disease, and other factors), but a decreased risk for individuals ages 55+ (due to lower incidence of ischemic heart disease).[tpl]cite web|title=‘Optimal’ levels of alcohol consumption for men and women at different ages, and the all-cause mortality attributable to drinking.|authors=White IR, Altmann DR, Nanchahal K.|publisher=London: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

This is consistent with other research that found a J-curve dependency between alcohol consumption and total mortality among middle aged and older men. While the mortality rates of ex-drinkers and heavy drinkers are significantly elevated, the all-cause mortality rates may be 15-18% lower among moderate drinkers. Although the definition of a drink varies between studies and countries, this meta-analysis found that low levels of alcohol intake, defined as 1-2 drinks per day for women and 2-4 drinks per day for men, was associated with lower mortality than abstainers.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Di Castelnuovo|first1=A.|last2=Costanzo|first2=S.|last3=Bagnardi|first3=V.|last4=Donati|first4=MB.|last5=Iacoviello|first5=L.|last6=de Gaetano|first6=G.|title=Alcohol dosing and total mortality in men and women: an updated meta-analysis of 34 prospective studies|journal=Arch Intern Med|volume=166|issue=22|pages=2437–45|doi=10.1001/archinte.166.22.2437|pmid=17159008|year=2006[/tpl] This claim was challenged by another study[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Fillmore|first1=KM.|last2=Stockwell|first2=T.|last3=Chikritzhs|first3=T.|last4=Bostrom|first4=A.|last5=Kerr|first5=W.|title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: systematic error in prospective studies and new hypotheses|journal=Ann Epidemiol|volume=17|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S16–23|date=May 2007|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.01.005|pmid=17478320[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|last1=Chikritzhs|first1=T.|last2=Fillmore|first2=K.|last3=Stockwell|first3=T.|title=A healthy dose of scepticism: four good reasons to think again about protective effects of alcohol on coronary heart disease|journal=Drug Alcohol Rev|volume=28|issue=4|pages=441–4|date=Jul 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2009.00052.x|pmid=19594799[/tpl] that found that in certain low quality studies occasional drinkers or ex-drinkers were included as abstainers, resulting in the increased mortality in that group.

A 2010 study confirmed the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality. Subjects were grouped into abstainers, light, moderate, and heavy drinkers. The order of mortality rates from lowest to highest were moderate, light, heavy, and abstainers. The  increased risk for abstainers was twice the mortality rate as for moderate drinkers. This study specifically sought to control for confounding factors including the problem of ex-drinkers considered as non-drinkers.

==Death rates in various countries==

Many countries collect statistics on alcohol-related deaths. While some categories relate to short-term effects, such as accidents, many relate to long-term effects of alcohol.

===Russia===

One study claims that "excessive alcohol consumption in Russia, particularly by men, has in recent years caused more than half of all the deaths at ages 15-54 years."IARC Alcohol causes more than half of all the premature deaths in Russian adults However, there are some difficulties with this study. For instance the same study also found a protective effect of heavy drinking on breast cancer mortality. This contradicts the well established scientific view that alcohol increases breast cancer risk.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Tjønneland|first1=A.|last2=Christensen|first2=J.|last3=Olsen|first3=A.|last4=Stripp|first4=C.|last5=Thomsen|first5=BL.|last6=Overvad|first6=K.|last7=Peeters|first7=PH.|last8=van Gils|first8=CH.|last9=Bueno-de-Mesquita|first9=HB.|title=Alcohol intake and breast cancer risk: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)|journal=Cancer Causes Control|volume=18|issue=4|pages=361–73|date=May 2007|doi=10.1007/s10552-006-0112-9|PMID=17364225[/tpl] On this account in further correspondence it was advised that "careful interpretation of mortality statistics in relation to alcohol use is needed, taking into account other relevant risk factors, incidence, and survival."[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Soerjomataram|first1=I.|last2=de Vries|first2=E.|last3=Coebergh|first3=JW.|title=Did alcohol protect against death from breast cancer in Russia?|journal=Lancet|volume=374|issue=9694|pages=975; author reply 975–6|date=Sep 2009|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61657-3|PMID=19766875[/tpl]
The authors replied that "whether or not the apparent shortfall in breast cancer mortality among heavy drinkers is real, it accounts for only about 0·1% of adult deaths in Russia. Careful interpretation of it is therefore of little relevance to the findings for alcohol and overall mortality".

===United Kingdom===

A governmental report from Britain has found that "There were 8,724 alcohol-related deaths in 2007, lower than 2006, but more than double the 4,144 recorded in 1991.

Despite epidemiological evidence, many have cautioned against recommendations for the use of alcohol for health benefits. A physician from the World Health Organisation labeled such alcohol promotion as "ridiculous and dangerous".[tpl]cite journal|author=Abdulla S|title=Is alcohol really good for you?|journal=J R Soc Med|volume=90|issue=12|page=651|date=December 1997|pmid=9496287|pmc=1296731|doi=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Naimi TS, Brown DW, Brewer RD, et al.|title=Cardiovascular risk factors and confounders among nondrinking and moderate-drinking U.S. adults|journal=Am J Prev Med|volume=28|issue=4|pages=369–73|date=May 2005|pmid=15831343|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.01.011[/tpl] One reviewer has noted, "Despite the wealth of observational data, it is not absolutely clear that alcohol reduces cardiovascular risk, because no randomized controlled trials have been performed.

Some investigators hold that alcohol should be regarded as a recreational drug with potentially serious adverse effects on health and should not be promoted for cardio-protection.
Nevertheless, a large prospective non-randomized study has shown that moderate alcohol intake in individuals already at low risk based on body mass index, physical activity, smoking, and diet, yields further improvement in cardiovascular risk.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sesso HD, Stampfer MJ, Rosner B, Hennekens CH, Manson JE, Gaziano JM |title=Seven-Year Changes in Alcohol Consumption and Subsequent Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Men |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=160 |issue=17 |pages=2605–12 |year=2000 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/160/17/2605 |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.17.2605 |pmid=10999974[/tpl]  Furthermore, a multicenter randomized diet study published in 2013 found that a Mediterranean-diet, which included an encouragement to daily wine consumption in habitual drinkers, led to a dramatic reduction in cardiovascular events.http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303

==Nervous system==

Chronic heavy alcohol consumption impairs brain development, causes alcohol dementia, brain shrinkage, physical dependence, increases neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders and causes distortion of the brain chemistry.

The predominate form of stroke in Western cultures is ischemic, whereas non-western cultures have more hemorrhagic stroke.

===Brain===

Alcohol abuse is associated with widespread and significant brain lesions. Alcohol related brain damage is not only due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol; alcohol withdrawal, nutritional deficiency, electrolyte disturbances, and liver damage are also believed to contribute to alcohol-related brain damage.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.1998.tb04389.x|last1=Neiman|first1=J.|title=Alcohol as a risk factor for brain damage: neurologic aspects|journal=Alcohol Clin Exp Res|volume=22|issue=7 Suppl|pages=346S–351S|date=Oct 1998|pmid=9799959[/tpl] The long-term effects of alcohol on brain chemistry is an important cause of chronic fatigue.[tpl]Cite journal|last1=Avellaneda Fernández|first1=A.|last2=Pérez Martín|first2=A.|last3=Izquierdo Martínez|first3=M.|last4=Arruti Bustillo|first4=M.|last5=Barbado Hernández|first5=FJ.|last6=de la Cruz Labrado|first6=J.|last7=Díaz-Delgado Peñas|first7=R.|last8=Gutiérrez Rivas|first8=E.|last9=Palacín Delgado|first9=C.|title=Chronic fatigue syndrome: aetiology, diagnosis and treatment.|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=9 Suppl 1|pages=S1|year=2009|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-9-S1-S1|PMID=19857242|pmc=2766938[/tpl]

===Cognition and dementia===

Excessive alcohol intake is associated with impaired prospective memory. This impaired cognitive ability leads to increased failure to carry out an intended task at a later date, for example, forgetting to lock the door or to post a letter on time. The higher the volume of alcohol consumed and the longer consumed, the more severe the impairments.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.2174/1874473710801010036|last1=Heffernan|first1=TM.|title=The impact of excessive alcohol use on prospective memory: a brief review.|journal=Curr Drug Abuse Rev|volume=1|issue=1|pages=36–41|date=Jan 2008|pmid=19630703[/tpl] One of the organs most sensitive to the toxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption is the brain. In France approximately 20% of admissions to mental health facilities are related to alcohol-related cognitive impairment, most notably alcohol-related dementia. Chronic excessive alcohol intake is also associated with serious cognitive decline and a range of neuropsychiatric complications. The elderly are the most sensitive to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain.[tpl]cite journal|author=Pierucci-Lagha A, Derouesné C|url=|title=Alcoholism and aging. 2.

Acetaldehyde is produced from ethanol metabolism by the liver.  The acetaldehyde is further metabolized by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

Ethanol is known to activate aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are both implicated in essential tremor pathology [tpl]cite pmid|20721919[/tpl] and could underlie the ameliorative effects.[tpl]cite pmid|21640732[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|17366267[/tpl] Additionally, the effects of ethanol have been studied in different animal essential tremor models.

===Sleep===

Chronic use of alcohol used to induce sleep can lead to insomnia. Frequent moving between sleep stages occurs, with awakenings due to headaches and diaphoresis. Stopping chronic alcohol abuse can also lead to profound disturbances of sleep with vivid dreams. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with NREM stage 3 and 4 sleep as well as suppression of REM sleep and REM sleep fragmentation. During withdrawal REM sleep is typically exaggerated as part of a rebound effect.[tpl]Cite book|last1=Lee-chiong|first1=Teofilo|title=Sleep Medicine: Essentials and Review|date=24 April 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s1F_DEbRNMcC&pg=PT105|isbn=0-19-530659-7|page=105[/tpl]

===Mental health effects===

High rates of major depressive disorder occur in heavy drinkers and those who abuse alcohol. Whether it is more true that major depressive disorder causes self-medicating alcohol abuse, or the increased incidence of the disorder in alcohol abusers is caused by the drinking, is not known though some evidence suggests drinking causes the disorder.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fergusson DM, Boden JM, Horwood LJ |title=Tests of causal links between alcohol abuse or dependence and major depression |journal=Arch.

Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain.

Alcohol abuse has been shown to cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders.[tpl]cite journal|author=Tien AY, Anthony JC|title=Epidemiological analysis of alcohol and drug use as risk factors for psychotic experiences|journal=J.

Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130829214354.htm |title=A wine a day ... keeps the psychiatrist away?

While alcohol initially helps social phobia or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms and can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect is not unique to alcohol but can also occur with long term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with alcohol problems.[tpl]cite journal |author=Terra MB, Figueira I, Barros HM |title=Impact of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal syndrome on social phobia and panic disorder in alcoholic inpatients |journal=Rev Hosp Clin Fac Med Sao Paulo |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=187–92 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15361983 |doi=10.1590/S0041-87812004000400006[/tpl] Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence.

===Liver disease===

Alcoholic liver disease is a major public health problem. For example in the United States up to two million people have alcohol-related liver disorders. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause fatty liver, cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Treatment options are limited and consist of most importantly discontinuing alcohol consumption. In cases of severe liver disease, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant from alcohol abstinent donors. Research is being conducted into the effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Certain complementary medications, e.g., milk thistle and silymarin, appear to offer some benefit.[tpl]cite journal|author=Barve A, Khan R, Marsano L, Ravindra KV, McClain C|title=Treatment of alcoholic liver disease|journal=Ann Hepatol|volume=7|issue=1|pages=5–15|year=2008|pmid=18376362|url=http://www.annalsofhepatology.com/PDF/vol7n1/Hp081-03.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Fehér J, Lengyel G|title=Silymarin in the treatment of chronic liver diseases: past and future|language=Hungarian|journal=Orv Hetil|volume=149|issue=51|pages=2413–8|date=December 2008|pmid=19073452|doi=10.1556/OH.2008.28519|url=http://www.akademiai.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&doi=10.1556/OH.2008.28519[/tpl] Alcohol is a leading cause of liver cancer in the Western world, accounting for 32-45% of hepatic cancers.

Chronic alcohol ingestion can impair multiple critical cellular functions in the lung.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] These cellular impairments can lead to increased susceptibility to serious complications from lung disease. Recent research cites alcoholic lung disease as comparable to liver disease in alcohol-related mortality.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Alcoholics have a higher risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and experience higher rates of mortality from ARDS when compared to non-alcoholics.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Despite these effects, a large prospective study has shown a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption on respiratory mortality.

===Diabetes mellitus===

A meta-analysis found with data from 477,200 individuals determined the dose-response relationships by sex and end point using lifetime abstainers as the reference group. The search revealed 20 cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria. A U-shaped relationship was found for both sexes. Compared with lifetime abstainers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes among men was most protective when consuming 22 g/day alcohol (RR 0.87 CI 0.76–1.00) and became deleterious at just over 60 g/day alcohol (1.01 0.71–1.44). Among women, consumption of 24 g/day alcohol was most protective (0.60 0.52–0.69) and became deleterious at about 50 g/day alcohol (1.02 0.83–1.26).
Because former drinkers may be inspired to abstain due to health concerns, they may actually be at increased risk of developing diabetes, known as the sick-quitter effect. Moreover, the balance of risk of alcohol consumption on other diseases and health outcomes, even at moderate levels of consumption, may outweigh the positive benefits with regard to diabetes.
Additionally, the way in which alcohol is consumed (i.e., with meals or bingeing on weekends) affects various health outcomes. Thus, it may be the case that the risk of diabetes associated with heavy alcohol consumption is due to consumption mainly on the weekend as opposed to the same amount spread over a week.[tpl]cite web|author=USA |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768203/ |title=Alcohol as a Risk Factor for Type 2 Diabetes |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2014-04-22[/tpl] In the United Kingdom "advice on weekly consumption is avoided".
Also, a twenty year twin study from Finland has shown that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. However, binge drinking and high alcohol consumption was found to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.

===Common cold===

A study on the common cold found that "Greater numbers of alcoholic drinks (up to three or four per day) were associated with decreased risk for developing colds because drinking was associated with decreased illness following infection. However, the benefits of drinking occurred only among nonsmokers. ... Although alcohol consumption did not influence risk of clinical illness for smokers, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk for nonsmokers."[tpl]cite journal|author=Cohen S, Tyrrell DA, Russell MA, Jarvis MJ, Smith AP|title=Smoking, alcohol consumption, and susceptibility to the common cold|journal=Am J Public Health|volume=83|issue=9|pages=1277–83|date=September 1993|pmid=8363004|pmc=1694990|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/83/9/1277|doi=10.2105/AJPH.83.9.1277[/tpl]

==Cancer==

In 1988 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the World Health Organization classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, stating "There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans.... Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)."IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans: Volume 44 Alcohol Drinking: Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation  The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ National Toxicology Program in 2000 listed alcohol as a known carcinogen.National Toxicology Program Alcoholic Beverage Consumption: Known to be a human carcinogen First listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens (2000)(PDF)

Acetaldehyde, a metabolic product of alcohol, is suspected to promote cancer.  Typically the liver eliminates 99% of acetaldehyde produced.  However, liver disease and certain genetic enzyme deficiencies result in high acetaldehyde levels. Heavy drinkers who are exposed to high acetaldehyde levels due to a genetic defect in alcohol dehydrogenase have been found to be at greater risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ijc.21583 | author = Homann N, Stickel F, König IR et al. | year = 2006| title = Alcohol dehydrogenase 1C*1 allele is a genetic marker for alcohol-associated cancer in heavy drinkers | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112141765/HTMLSTART | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1998–2002 | pmid=16287084[/tpl] A review in 2007 found "convincing evidence that acetaldehyde... is responsible for the carcinogenic effect of ethanol... owing to its multiple mutagenic effects on DNA."Seitz HK, Stickel F.
