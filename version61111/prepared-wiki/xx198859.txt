[[Sony XEL-1]]

CATEGORIES: Television technology, Sony products, OLED televisions

Developed in 2007 and produced for sale in 2008, the Sony XEL-1 is the world's first OLED television. It was also the world's thinnest television during its production at just 3Â mm. It has a screen size of 11" with a native resolution 960x540. As the screen is too thin for I/O ports and buttons, Sony has connected the screen to an non-detachable base that contains these. The top of the base has the speaker, the Power, Volume, Channel, Input, and the Menu buttons, which are backlit so the symbols and abbreviations change when the XMB is accessed. The back of the panel has a DMeX service input, a 16 Volt DC input, a VHF/UHF/cable input, a Memory Stick slot, and two HDMI inputs. On the left side of the panel there is an Analog/Digital audio output. The XEL-1 has a very high contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, high color saturation, large viewing angles, high screen uniformity, and low power consumption[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]. On the other hand, it has poor primary color accuracy, a quarter of the Full HD resolution (1920x1080p), no anti-judder processing, a light-reflective screen, a minimal number of inputs, a non-detachable panel, a small screen and a MSRP of $2,499.99 USD.[tpl]cite news |title=The Future of HDTV:Sony's hot new TV's have gone organic |page=48 |work=Ur magazine |publisher=Rogers |accessdate=2008-08-01[/tpl] It was sold in the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, Europe and Australia.
