R/V ''Melville – originally built as the 'USNS Melville (T-AGOR-14)''' -- is a research vessel operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography for oceanographic research.  The R/V Melville is the oldest active vessel in the academic research fleet, collectively known as the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory Systemhttp://www.unols.org/info/unols.html | University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System: What is UNOLS?

==Construction==

The second ship to be so named by the Navy, Melville (AGOR 14) was laid down on 12 July 1967 by the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan, launched on 10 July 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Elford A. Cederberg, wife of Congressman Elford Cederberg; and was completed and delivered to the Navy on 1 August 1969, when she was placed in service with the Military Sea Transportation Service as USNS Melville (T-AGOR 14) chartered to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography for operation.
Though often listed as a Robert D. Conrad-class oceanographic research ship the ship is of an entirely different appearance, design and size as evidenced by Melville'shttp://shipsked.ucsd.edu/Ships/Melville/specs.php | Scripps Ship Operations, R/V Melville: Specifications 2,944 vs. Conrad'shttp://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r7/robert_d_conrad.htm | Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Vessels, Robert D.

==Designation==

Melville  was named for George Melville, a pioneer arctic explorer and Rear Admiral in the United States Navy, who was Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering from 1887 to 1903.

==Operating personnel==

A crew of 23 keeps the ship operational, and up to 38 scientists can be accommodated for the purposes of the scientific expedition.

==Operational history==

During a career now in its fourth decade, Melville has cruised over almost all the World's oceans in the pursuit of scientific knowledge.  Modernized in the early 1990s, Melville's hull was lengthened, increasing her displacement to 2670 tons (full-load), and a new propulsion system was installed.

==Sister ship==

Melville’s sister ship is the R/V Knorr, best known as the ship which located the wreck of the RMS Titanic in 1985, which was also launched in 1968.

==Role in the movie “King Kong”==

The Melville was used in the 1976 movie King Kong, starring Jessica Lange. It was used specifically because of its Hypoid propulsion drive (at that time), which allowed it to move sideways.  This type of drive is used, on research vessels, for station keeping in the  ocean over drill and coring sites.
