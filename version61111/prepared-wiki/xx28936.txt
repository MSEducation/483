Joseph Isadore "Joe" Lieberman (born February 24, 1942) is a former United States Senator from Connecticut.  A former member of the Democratic Party, he was the party's nominee for Vice President in the 2000 election.  Currently an independent, he remains closely associated with the party.
Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Lieberman is a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School.  He was elected as a "reform Democrat" in 1970 to the Connecticut Senate, where he served three terms as Majority Leader.  After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, he served as state Attorney General from 1983 to 1989. Lieberman defeated moderate Republican Lowell Weicker in 1988 to win election to the Senate and was re-elected in 1994 and 2000.  Lieberman was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in the 2000 United States presidential election, running with presidential nominee Al Gore, becoming the first Jewish candidate on a major American political party presidential ticket.[ref]

In the 2000 presidential election, Gore and Lieberman won the popular vote by a margin of more than 500,000 votes but lost the deciding Electoral College to the Republican George W. Bush / Dick Cheney ticket 271-266.  The U.S. Supreme Court settled the legal controversy over the Florida vote recount by ruling 5–4 to stop recounting votes, effectively ensuring Bush's election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html|title=George W.

Lieberman was officially listed in Senate records for the 110th and 111th Congresses as an "Independent Democrat" and sat as part of the Senate Democratic Caucus.

==Early life==

Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Marcia (née Manger) and Henry Lieberman, who ran a liquor store.http://books.google.ca/books?id=Nhyr-1x2hqgC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=JOE+LIEBERMAN+FATHER+STORE&source=bl&ots=SadJKzGOxG&sig=LgE6exyBCosi1dRo4ahAsAGCPdU&hl=en His family is Jewish; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Russian Poland and his maternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary.http://www.wargs.com/political/lieberman.html He received a B.A. in both political science and economics from Yale University in 1964 and was the first member of his family to graduate from college. At Yale he was editor of the Yale Daily News and a member of the Elihu Club. He later attended Yale Law School, receiving his law degree in 1967. After graduation from law school, Lieberman worked as a lawyer for the New Haven-based law firm Wiggin & Dana LLP.
A spokesperson told The Hartford Courant in 1994 that Lieberman received an educational deferment from the Vietnam War draft when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had one child, Matt.Lieberman: A history-making candidate. CNN.com. Retrieved October 10, 2006.

==Personal life==

Lieberman met his first wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children – Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric social worker. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with New York Magazine, Lieberman said, "one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance", adding, "I'm convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn't have gotten divorced."You Go, Joe. ''New York Magazine November 18, 2002.
In 1982, he met his second wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while he was running for Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors. According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it would be interesting to go out with someone named Hadassah.

thumb|Lieberman with Marty Markowitz at the 2011 Brooklyn Book Festival to discuss the role spirituality played in his life.Lieberman describes himself as an "observant" Jew. In 1965 he married Betty Haas, a Reform Jew. Since the death in 1967 of Lieberman's grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, he found renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant Modern Orthodox Jew. "Hadassah calls herself my right wing", says Lieberman. In Lieberman's 1988 upset of Republican Party incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker, his religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of inability to campaign on Shabbat. This changed when Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said:
The Liebermans keep a kosher home and observe Shabbat.Goodstein, Laurie. Lieberman Balances Private Faith With Life in the Public Eye New York Times August 18, 2000.

He also attends Congregation Agudath Sholom in Stamford.
Lieberman is an admirer of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He has said of Schneerson, "I was impressed by this man, by his obvious spirituality, by his soaring intellect, by the extent to which he was involved in the world."Joe Lieberman, speech.
He was the first observant Jew to run on a major party Presidential ticket.  (1964 Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater's father was repudiated by his Jewish relatives when he married an Episcopalian; the son was raised in that faith.)

==Early political career==

Lieberman was elected as a "reform Democrat" to the Connecticut Senate in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader. He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the Reagan landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the Third District Congressional seat to Republican Lawrence Joseph DeNardis, a state senator from suburban Hamden with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts. In 1981 he wrote an admiring biography of long-time Connecticut and national Democratic leader John Moran Bailey, reviewing also in the book the previous 50 years of Connecticut political history.Review of THE LEGACY: Connecticut Politics 1930–1980 Book by Joseph I.

==U.S. Senate==

===Tenure===

Lieberman was first elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in the 1988 election, defeating moderate Republican Lowell Weicker  by a margin of 10,000 votes. He scored the nation's biggest political upset that year, after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative Republicans, who were disappointed in three-term Republican incumbent Lowell Weicker's moderate voting record and personal style. During the campaign, he received support from the Connecticut's Cuban-American community which was unhappy with Weicker. Lieberman has since remained firmly anti-Castro.Toobin, Jeffrey. Joe Lieberman looks hopefully toward the White House. The New Yorker December 16, 2002.
Six years later, in 1994, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes.
Like Bill Clinton and Dick Gephardt, Lieberman served as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council from 1995–2001.  In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair with Monica Lewinsky.Senator Joe Lieberman Attacks Clinton. AustralianPolitics.com September 3, 1998. Retrieved October 10, 2006.  However, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment. In 2000, while concurrently running for the vice presidency, Lieberman was elected to a third Senate term with 64 percent of the vote easily defeating the Republican Philip Giordano.

===2006 Senate election===

====Primary====

Lieberman sought the Democratic Party's renomination for U.S. Senate from Connecticut in 2006 but lost to Ned Lamont, a Greenwich businessman and antiwar candidate.
Lieberman was officially endorsed by the Connecticut Democratic Convention, which met in May. However, Lamont received 33 percent of the delegates' votes, forcing an August primary.

Following the election, Lieberman struck a deal with Democratic leadership allowing him to keep his seniority and chairmanship of the Governmental Affairs Committee.

===Creation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)===

When control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of its Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property; the Armed Services Committee, where he chaired the Airland Subcommittee and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.Standing Committees of the Senate 108th Congress. Retrieved September 10, 2006.
2002, as Chairman of what was then known as the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman led the fight to create a new Department of Homeland Security. One month after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, he introduced legislation to reorganize the federal government to better protect the American people from terrorism and natural disasters and steered a bipartisan plan through his committee. After months of opposing the plan, the White House eventually endorsed the concept. Legislation that passed Congress in 2002 created a department incorporating key organizational elements Senator Lieberman advocated.http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/homeland-security-and-governmental-affairs
In 2006, Senators Lieberman and Collins drafted legislation to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated the head of FEMA to be the President's point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of the preparedness and response functions within FEMA, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. And the measure strengthened FEMA's regional offices, creating dedicated interagency "strike teams" to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006. As the 2007 hurricane season approached, Senator Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace.
Senator Lieberman actively oversaw the government response to the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. He has continually pressed the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute vaccines and antiviral medications at a quicker pace and to streamline the process.
In the 110th Congress, Lieberman was Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. In addition, he was a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Air Land Forces and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee.

===Fundraising===

Since 1989, Lieberman has received more than $31.4 million in campaign donations from specific industries and sectors. His largest donors have represented the securities and investment ($3.7 million), legal ($3.6 million), real estate ($3.1 million) and health professional ($1.1 million) industries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&cid=N00000616&type=I |title=Center for Responsive Politics profile |publisher=Opensecrets.org |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]

==Presidential politics==

===2000 Vice Presidential candidacy===

In August 2000, Lieberman was selected as the nominee for Vice President of the United States by Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President. Among the last round candidates were U.S. senators Bob Graham, John Kerry and John Edwards. The nomination committee was headed by Warren Christopher. Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate on a major political party ticket. The announcement of Lieberman's selection was unusual in that it did not cause a positive "bump" in the Gore campaign's poll numbers according to a Newsweek poll done at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64086109.html|title=Newsweek Poll: Naming Lieberman No Charm for Democrats – Bush Retains 10 Point Lead |date=August 12, 2000|accessdate=January 21, 2010[/tpl] Polling also indicated that Lieberman had badly lost his televised debate against Dick Cheney,[tpl]cite web|last=Langer|first=Gary|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=122760&page=1 |title=Poll: Cheney Beats Lieberman in Veep Debate|publisher=ABC News |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl] leading some to suggest later that Gore had lost the election due to choosing Lieberman as his running mate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2009/dec/22/shields/ |title=SHIELDS: If You Could Change One Thing, Al Gore|last=Shields|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Shields|publisher=St. Louis Globe-Democrat |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]
The Gore/Lieberman ticket won a plurality of the popular vote, with over half a million more votes than the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, but they were defeated in the Electoral College by a vote of 271 to 266 after an intense legal battle concerning the outcome in disputed counties (see Bush v. Gore).
Like Democratic VP candidates Lyndon B. Johnson in 1960, Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, John Edwards in 2004, and Joe Biden in 2008, Lieberman's Senate term was due to expire during the election cycle. He decided to run for re-election to maintain his seat, as Johnson, Bentsen and Biden did. Those four all won re-election to the Senate, but Johnson and Biden then gave up their Senate seats because they were also elected Vice-President.

===2004 primaries===

On January 13, 2003, Lieberman announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election.
Describing his Presidential hopes, Lieberman opined that his historically hawkish stance would appeal to voters. Indeed he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of liberal Democratic voters, who dominated the primaries.[tpl]cite web|author=JOHN E.

Subsequently, Lieberman announced that he will continue to caucus with the Democrats. Lieberman credited President-elect Barack Obama for helping him keep his chairmanship. Obama had privately urged Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid not to remove Lieberman from his position. Reid stated that Lieberman's criticism of Obama during the election angered him, but that "if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk out of here saying, 'Boy did we get even'?" Senator Tom Carper of Delaware also credited the Democrats' decision on Lieberman to Obama's support, stating that "If Barack can move on, so can we."Sources: Lieberman likely to keep top Democratic post, CNN.com, November 17, 2008.Lieberman credits Obama after Dems let him keep post, CNN.com, November 18, 2008.
Partisan members of the Democratic caucus were reportedly angry at the decision not to punish Lieberman more severely. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont (who is also an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats) stated that he voted to punish Lieberman "because while millions of people worked hard for Obama, Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush's policies."
Lieberman's embrace of certain conservative policies and in particular his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance, this however is also cited for his low approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving.http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/lieberman-prais.php As of October 2011, 51% of voters were approving of his performance along with 40% disapproving.

==Criticism==

While he officially considers himself a member of the Democratic party, Lieberman has been accused of being more conservative than many Republicans. In February 2007, Lieberman spoke before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the confirmation of Sam Fox as ambassador to Belgium. Fox, a prominent Republican businessman and political donor, was a contributor to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign in 2004.[ref]

In May 2010, while favoring the filibuster and threatening to use it in 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed it. In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the filibuster. “The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress,” Lieberman told the Hartford Courant (Jan 6, 1995).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/ns/msnbc_tv-rachel_maddow_show#34423698 |title=TV, Rachel Maddow Show, Dec 14, 2009 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]

Lieberman has favoured greater use of surveillance cameras by the federal government and referred to attempts by Congress to investigate illegal wire-tapping as "partisan gridlock". On June 19, 2010, Lieberman introduced a bill called "Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010",[tpl]Cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3480: |title=Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010 |work=THOMAS |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=December 18, 2012[/tpl] which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the "Kill switch bill", would grant the President emergency powers over the Internet. However, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill "narrowed existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks".Senators Say Cybersecurity Bill Has No 'Kill Switch', informationweek.com, June 24, 2010. Retrieved on June 25, 2010.   American computer security specialist and author Bruce Schneier objected to the "kill switch" proposal on the basis that it rests on several faulty assumptions and that it's "too coarse a hammer". Schneier wrote:
 
 Defending his proposal, Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this capability. It's debatable whether or not it actually does, but it's actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about its citizens. Here in the U.S., it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans in this way.[tpl]Cite web |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |title=Internet Kill Switch |work=Schneier on Security |date=July 12, 2010 |url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/07/internet_kill_s.html |accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl]

Sen. Lieberman has been a major opponent of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks. His staff "made inquiries"[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/amazon-stops-hosting-wikileaks-site/article1820859/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Amazon stops hosting WikiLeaks site | date=December 1, 2010[/tpl] of Amazon.com and other internet companies such as Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard which resulted in them suspending service to WikiLeaks. Blogger Glenn Greenwald called Lieberman's actions "one of the most pernicious acts by a U.S. Senator in quite some time," and accused Lieberman of "emulating Chinese dictators" by "abusing his position as Homeland Security Chairman to thuggishly dictate to private companies which websites they should and should not host—and, more important, what you can and cannot read on the Internet."Greenwald, Glenn (December 2, 2010) Joe Lieberman emulates Chinese dictators, Salon.com Lieberman has also suggested that "the New York Times and other news organisations publishing the US embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws."Owen, Paul; Adams, Richard; and McAskill, Ewen (December 7, 2010) WikiLeaks: US Senator Joe Lieberman suggests New York Times could be investigated, The Guardian
Along with Senators John Ensign and Scott Brown, Lieberman "introduced a bill to amend the Espionage Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of folks like Wikileaks."Wittes, Benjamin (December 6, 2010) Espionage Act Amendments, Lawfare Critics have noted that "leaking classified information in the first place is already a crime, so the measure is aimed squarely at publishers," and that "Lieberman’s proposed solution to WikiLeaks could have implications for journalists reporting on some of the more unsavory practices of the intelligence community."Poulsen, Kevin (December 2, 2010) Lieberman Introduces Anti-WikiLeaks Legislation, Wired Legal analyst Benjamin Wittes has called the proposed legislation "the worst of both worlds," saying:
 
 "It leaves intact the current World War I-era Espionage Act provision, 18 U.S.C. 793(e), a law with many problems... and then takes a currently well-drawn law and expands its scope to the point that it covers a lot more than the most reckless of media excesses. A lot of good journalism would be a crime under this provision; after all, knowingly and willfully publishing material 'concerning the human intelligence activities of the United States or any foreign government' is no small part of what a good newspaper does."

As a result of these statements and actions, Lieberman has been perceived as an opponent of Internet Free Speech and become the target of Anonymous attacks under Operation Payback.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1336806/WikiLeaks-hackers-Operation-Payback-cyber-war-targets-Swedish-Government.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first1=Colin | last1=Fernandez | first2=Laura | last2=Caroe | title=Army of hackers targets the Swedish government, Sarah Palin and credit card giants in WikiLeaks 'Operation: Payback' | date=December 9, 2010[/tpl]
