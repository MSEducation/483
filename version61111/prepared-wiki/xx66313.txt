[[Precipitation]]

CATEGORIES: Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena, Precipitation

In meteorology, precipitation is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravity.[tpl]cite web | work = Glossary of Meteorology | year = 2009 | url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=precipitation1 | title = Precipitation | publisher = American Meteorological Society | accessdate = 2009-01-02 [/tpl]  The main forms of precipitation include  drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail.  Precipitation occurs when a local portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapour, so that the water condenses and "precipitates".  Thus, fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions, because the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air. Generally, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga which evaporates before reaching the surface.   Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud.  Rain drops range in size from oblate, pancake-like shapes for larger drops, to small spheres for smaller drops. Unlike raindrops, snowflakes grow in a variety of different shapes and patterns, determined by the temperature and humidity characteristics of the air the snowflake moves through on its way to the ground.  While snow and ice pellets require temperatures close to the ground to be near or below freezing, hail can occur during much warmer temperature regimes due to the process of its formation.
Moisture overriding associated with weather fronts is an overall major method of precipitation production.  If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds such as cumulonimbus and can organize into narrow rainbands.  Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones.  Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.  Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands.  In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation.  On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by compressional heating.  The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.
Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing the fresh water on the planet. Approximately [tpl]convert|505000|km3|mi3[/tpl] of water falls as precipitation each year; [tpl]convert|398000|km3|mi3[/tpl] of it over the oceans and [tpl]convert|107000|km3|mi3[/tpl] over land.[tpl]cite web|author=Dr. Chowdhury's Guide to Planet Earth|year=2005|url=http://www.planetguide.net/book/chapter_2/water_cycle.html|title=The Water Cycle|publisher=WestEd|accessdate=2006-10-24[/tpl] Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is [tpl]convert|990|mm|in[/tpl], but over land it is only [tpl]convert|715|mm|in[/tpl]. Climate classification systems such as the Köppen climate classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
The urban heat island effect may lead to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally.
Precipitation may occur on other celestial bodies, e.g. when it gets cold, Mars has precipitation which most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.[tpl]cite web|author=Dr. Jim Lochner|year=1998|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/980403c.html|title=Ask an Astrophysicist|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=2009-01-16[/tpl]

==Types==

Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the planet. Approximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 mi3) of water falls as precipitation each year, 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans. Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally averaged annual precipitation is [tpl]convert|990|mm|in[/tpl].
Mechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform,[tpl]cite journal |title=A convective/stratiform precipitation classification algorithm for volume scanning weather radar observations|author=Emmanouil N. Anagnostou|journal=Meteorological Applications|year=2004|volume=11|pages=291–300|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S1350482704001409|issue=4|bibcode = 2004MeApp..11..291A [/tpl] and orographic rainfall.[tpl]cite journal |title=A model of annual orographic precipitation and acid deposition and its application to Snowdonia|author=A.J.

Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice.  Mixtures of different types of precipitation, including types in different categories, can fall simultaneously.  Liquid forms of precipitation include rain and drizzle.  Rain or drizzle that freezes on contact within a subfreezing air mass is called "freezing rain" or "freezing drizzle".  Frozen forms of precipitation include snow, ice needles, ice pellets, hail, and graupel.[tpl]cite web|author=Jan Jackson|year=2008|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rnk/Newsletter/Fall_2008/mixed_precip/Mixed_precip.html|title=All About Mixed Winter Precipitation|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=2009-02-07[/tpl]

==How the air becomes saturated==

===Cooling air to its dew point===

The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated, and (unless super-saturation occurs) condenses to water.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1|title=Dewpoint|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2011-01-31[/tpl]  Water vapour normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds.  An elevated portion of a frontal zone forces broad areas of lift, which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus.  Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.  It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.[tpl]cite web|author=FMI|year=2007|url=http://www.zamg.ac.at/docu/Manual/SatManu/main.htm?/docu/Manual/SatManu/CMs/FgStr/backgr.htm|title=Fog And Stratus - Meteorological Physical Background|publisher=Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik|accessdate=2009-02-07[/tpl]
There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=adiabatic-process1|title=Adiabatic Process|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2008-12-27[/tpl] The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,[tpl]cite web|author=TE Technology, Inc|year=2009|url=http://www.tetech.com/Cold-Plate-Coolers.html|title=Peltier Cold Plate|accessdate=2008-12-27[/tpl] usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land.  Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=radiational+cooling&submit=Search|title=Radiational cooling|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2008-12-27[/tpl]  Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.[tpl]cite web|author=Robert Fovell|year=2004|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf|title=Approaches to saturation|publisher=University of California in Los Angelese|accessdate=2009-02-07[/tpl]

===Adding moisture to the air===

The main ways water vapour is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas of upward motion,[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Penrose Pearce|year=2002|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QECy_UBdyrcC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=ways+to+moisten+the+atmosphere|title=Meteorology at the Millennium|publisher=Academic Press|page=66|isbn=978-0-12-548035-2|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] precipitation or virga falling from above,[tpl]cite web|author=National Weather Service Office, Spokane, Washington|year=2009|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/otx/outreach/ttalk/virga.php|title=Virga and Dry Thunderstorms|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land,[tpl]cite web|author=Bart van den Hurk and Eleanor Blyth|year=2008|url=http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf|title=Global maps of Local Land-Atmosphere coupling|publisher=KNMI|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] transpiration from plants,[tpl]cite book|author=H.

==Formation==

===Raindrops===

Coalescence occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the Bergeron process. The fall rate of very small droplets is negligible, hence clouds do not fall out of the sky; precipitation will only occur when these coalesce into larger drops.  When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain.[tpl]cite web|author=Paul Sirvatka|year=2003|url=http://weather.cod.edu/sirvatka/bergeron.html|title=Cloud Physics: Collision/Coalescence; The Bergeron Process|publisher=College of DuPage|accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl]
Raindrops have sizes ranging from [tpl]convert|0.1|mm|in[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|9|mm|in[/tpl] mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Contrary to the cartoon pictures of raindrops, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.[tpl]cite web|author=United States Geological Survey|year=2009|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html|title=Are raindrops tear shaped?|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|accessdate=2008-12-27[/tpl] Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.[tpl]cite web|author=J .

===Ice pellets===

Ice pellets or sleet are a form of precipitation consisting of small, translucent balls of ice. Ice pellets are usually (but not always) smaller than hailstones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=hail|title= Hail (glossary entry)|publisher= National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=2007-03-20[/tpl]  They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain.  The METAR code for ice pellets is PL.
Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air exists with sub-freezing air both above and below.  This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer.  As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets.  However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface.  A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season,[tpl]cite web|author=Weatherquestions.com|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_ice_pellets.htm|title=What causes ice pellets (sleet)?|accessdate=2007-12-08[/tpl] but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front.

===Hail===

Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with condensation nuclei, such as dust or dirt.  The storm's updraft blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud.  The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted again.  Hail has a diameter of [tpl]convert|5|mm|in[/tpl] or more.[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|title=Hail|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-15|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=American Meteorological Society[/tpl]  Within METAR code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least [tpl]convert|6.4|mm|in[/tpl].  GR is derived from the French word grêle.  Smaller-sized hail, as well as snow pellets, use the coding of GS, which is short for the French word grésil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alaska.faa.gov/fai/afss/metar+taf/sametara.htm |title=SA-METAR|author=Alaska Air Flight Service Station|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration via the Internet Wayback Machine|accessdate=2009-08-29|date=2007-04-10 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080501074014/http://www.alaska.faa.gov/fai/afss/metar+taf/sametara.htm |archivedate = 2008-05-01[/tpl]  Stones just larger than golf ball-sized are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf|title=P9.5 Evaluation of an Alberta Hail Growth Model Using Severe Hail Proximity Soundings in the United States|author=Ryan Jewell and Julian Brimelow|date=2004-08-17|accessdate=2009-07-15[/tpl]  Hailstones can grow to [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|0[/tpl] and weigh more than [tpl]convert|500|g|lb|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|title=Aggregate hailstone|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2009-07-15[/tpl]  In large hailstones, latent heat released by further freezing may melt the outer shell of the hailstone.  The hailstone then may undergo 'wet growth', where the liquid outer shell collects other smaller hailstones.[tpl]cite journal|title=Modeling Maximum Hail Size in Alberta Thunderstorms|journal=Weather and Forecasting|author=Julian C.

Once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the storm's updraft, it falls from the cloud.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/factsheets/Hail.html|title=Hail Fact Sheet|date=2000-04-10|author=Jacque Marshall|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research[/tpl]

===Snowflakes===

Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 μm in diameter) freeze. Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment. Because water droplets are more numerous than the ice crystals the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets.  This process is known as the Wegner-Bergeron-Findeison process.  The corresponding depletion of water vapour causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense.  These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates.  These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.[tpl]cite journal | author=M. Klesius| title=The Mystery of Snowflakes| journal=National Geographic| volume=211| issue=1| year=2007| id=ISSN 0027-9358|page=20[/tpl]  Guinness World Records list the world's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 38 cm (15 inches) wide.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/science/20snow.html |title=Giant Snowflakes as Big as Frisbees? Could Be |work= New York Times |author=William J. Broad| date=2007-03-20|accessdate=2009-07-12[/tpl] The exact details of the sticking mechanism remain a subject of research.
Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4T-aXFsMhAgC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39|title=Hands-on Science: Light, Physical Science (matter) - Chapter 5: The Colors of Light|page=39|author=Jennifer E. Lawson|isbn=978-1-894110-63-1|year=2001|accessdate=2009-06-28|publisher=Portage & Main Press[/tpl]  The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around [tpl]convert|-2|C|F|0[/tpl], snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry—triangular snowflakes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/class/class.htm|title=Guide to Snowflakes|author= Kenneth G. Libbrecht|publisher=California Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-06-28|date=2006-09-11[/tpl] The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing.  No two snowflakes are alike,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070213-snowflake.html|title="No Two Snowflakes the Same" Likely True, Research Reveals|author=John Roach|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2009-07-14|publisher=National Geographic News[/tpl] which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/issues/winter04-05/Snowflake.pdf|title=Snowflake Science|author=Kenneth Libbrecht|journal=American Educator|month=Winter|year=2004/2005|accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl]  The METAR code for snow is SN, while snow showers are coded SHSN.

===Diamond dust===

Diamond dust, also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching [tpl]convert|-40|C[/tpl] due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=diamond+dust&submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|title=Diamond Dust|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2010-01-21[/tpl]  They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape.[tpl]cite journal|publisher=California Institute of Technology|url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/Libbrecht%20Feature.pdf|page=12|year=2001|author=Kenneth G.

==Causes==

===Frontal activity===

Stratiform or dynamic precipitation occurs as a consequence of slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as over surface cold fronts, and over and ahead of warm fronts.  Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones.[tpl]cite web|author=B. Geerts|year=2002|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/con_str.html|title=Convective and stratiform rainfall in the tropics|publisher=University of Wyoming|accessdate=2007-11-27[/tpl]  A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass.  Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.[tpl]cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=2006|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf[/tpl]  Precipitation may occur on celestial bodies other than Earth.  When it gets cold, Mars has precipitation that most likely takes the form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.

===Convection===

Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=graupel&submit=Search|title=Graupel|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl]  In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.[tpl]cite book|author=Toby N.

===Orographic effects===

Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation.  In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.

Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (Ko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olau) and leeward (Kona) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains.  Windward sides face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.[tpl]cite web|author=Western Regional Climate Center|year=2002|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/HAWAII.htm|title=Climate of Hawaii|accessdate=2008-03-19[/tpl]

The band of precipitation that is associated with their warm front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band,[tpl]cite journal|version=PhD thesis|author=Owen Hertzman|year=1988|bibcode=1988PhDT.......110H|title=Three-Dimensional Kinematics of Rainbands in Midlatitude Cyclones Abstract|publisher=University of Washington[/tpl] which is wide and stratiform, meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds.[tpl]cite book|author=Yuh-Lang Lin |year =2007|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4KXtnQ3bDeEC&pg=PA405| page=405| title= Mesoscale Dynamics|publisher =Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80875-0|accessdate=2009-07-07[/tpl]  When moist air tries to dislodge an arctic air mass, overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the elongated precipitation band.  In the Northern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the North Pole, or north.  Within the Southern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the South Pole, or south.
Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall which can be understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13 °C or 23 °F) between the water surface and the air above.[tpl]cite news|author=B.

The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/sld010.htm|publisher=University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|title=Lake Effect Snow|date=1998-06-03|accessdate=2009-07-12|author=Greg Byrd[/tpl]
In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes, which in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow.  Because of the ruggedness of terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.avalanche.org/~nac/NAC/techPages/articles/96_MRD.pdf|title=Atmospheric Circulation Patterns Associated With Heavy Snowfall Events, Bridger Bowl, Montana, USA|author=Karl W.

==Measurement==

The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100 mm (4 in) plastic and 200 mm (8 in) metal varieties.[tpl]cite web|author=National Weather Service Office, Northern Indiana|year=2009|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/coop/8inch.php|title=8 Inch Non-Recording Standard Rain Gauge|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] The inner cylinder is filled by 25 mm (1 in) of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25 mm (0.01 in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25 mm (0.01 in) markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty. These gauges are used in the winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing snow and freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder.  Some add anti-freeze to their gauge so they do not have to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge.[tpl]cite web|author=Chris Lehmann|year=2009|url=http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/CAL/2000_reminders-4thQ.htm|title=10/00|publisher=Central Analytical Laboratory|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl]  Once the snowfall/ice is finished accumulating, or as 300 mm (12 in) is approached, one can either bring it inside to melt, or use lukewarm water to fill the inner cylinder with in order to melt the frozen precipitation in the outer cylinder, keeping track of the warm fluid added, which is subsequently subtracted from the overall total once all the ice/snow is melted.[tpl]cite web|author=National Weather Service Office Binghamton, New York|year=2009|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/bgm/spotters_skywarn/precip4.shtml|title=Rainguage Information|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl]
Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.[tpl]cite web|author=National Weather Service|year=2009|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|title=Glossary:  W|accessdate=2009-01-01[/tpl] The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow. Attempts to compensate for snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above freezing. Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow, but again, the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins. For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.[tpl]cite web|author=Discovery School|year=2009|url=http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/activities/weatherstation/itsrainingitspouring.html|title=Build Your Own Weather Station|publisher=Discovery Education|accessdate=2009-01-02|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20081226022910/http://school.discovery.com/lessonplans/activities/weatherstation/itsrainingitspouring.html |archivedate=2008-12-26[/tpl]

===Hydrometeor definition===

A concept used in precipitation measurement is the hydrometeor.  Bits of liquid or solid water in the atmosphere are known as hydrometeors.  Formations due to condensation, such as clouds, haze, fog, and mist, are composed of hydrometeors.  All precipitation types are made up of hydrometeors by definition, including virga, which is precipitation which evaporates before reaching the ground.  Particles blown from the Earth's surface by wind, such as blowing snow and blowing sea spray, are also hydrometeors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hydrometeor|author=Glossary of Meteorology|title=Hydrometeor|year=2009|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=American Meteorological Society[/tpl]

===Satellite estimates===

Although surface precipitation gauges are considered the standard for measuring precipitation, there are many areas in which their use is not feasible. This includes the vast expanses of ocean and remote land areas. In other cases, social, technical or administrative issues prevent the dissemination of gauge observations. As a result, the modern global record of precipitation largely depends on satellite observations.[tpl]cite web|author=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2012|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/news/overview.html#.Ut3LEnn0CqQ|title=NASA and JAXA's GPM Mission Takes Rain Measurements Global|accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl]
Satellite sensors work by remotely sensing precipitation—recording various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that theory and practice show are related to the occurrence and intensity of precipitation. The sensors are almost exclusively passive, recording what they see, similar to a camera, in contrast to active sensors (radar, lidar) that send out a signal and detect its impact on the area being observed.
Satellite sensors now in practical use for precipitation fall into two categories. Thermal infrared (IR) sensors record a channel around 11 micron wavelength and primarily give information about cloud tops. Due to the typical structure of the atmosphere, cloud-top temperatures are approximately inversely related to cloud-top heights, meaning colder clouds almost always occur at higher altitudes. Further, cloud tops with a lot of small-scale variation are likely to be more vigorous than smooth-topped clouds. Various mathematical schemes, or algorithms, use these and other properties to estimate precipitation from the IR data.[tpl]cite journal |title=Global Precipitation Measurement|author=C. Kidd, G.J. Huffman|journal=Meteorological Applications,|volume=18|year=2011|pages=334–353|doi=10.1002/met.284[/tpl]
The second category of sensor channels is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies in use range from about 10 gigahertz  to a few hundred GHz. Channels up to about 37 GHz primarily provide information on the liquid hydrometeors (rain and drizzle) in the lower parts of clouds, with larger amounts of liquid emitting higher amounts of microwave radiant energy. Channels above 37 GHz display emission signals, but are dominated by the action of solid hydrometeors (snow, graupel, etc.) to scatter microwave radiant energy. Satellites such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.
Additional sensor channels and products have been demonstrated to provide additional useful information including visible channels, additional IR channels, water vapor channels and atmospheric sounding retrievals. However, most precipitation data sets in current use do not employ these data sources.

===Satellite data sets===

The IR estimates have rather low skill at short time and space scales, but are available very frequently (15 minutes or more often) from satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit. IR works best in cases of deep, vigorous convection—such as the tropics—and becomes progressively less useful in areas where stratiform (layered) precipitation dominates, especially in mid- and high-latitude regions. The more-direct physical connection between hydrometeors and microwave channels gives the microwave estimates greater skill on short time and space scales than is true for IR. However, microwave sensors fly only on low Earth orbit satellites, and there are few enough of them that the average time between observations exceeds three hours. This several-hour interval is insufficient to adequately document precipitation because of the transient nature of most precipitation systems as well as the inability of a single satellite to appropriately capture the typical daily cycle of precipitation at a given location.
Since the late 1990s, several algorithms have been developed to combine precipitation data from multiple satellites’ sensors, seeking to emphasize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of the individual input data sets. The goal is to provide “best” estimates of precipitation on a uniform time/space grid, usually for as much of the globe as possible. In some cases the long-term homogeneity of the dataset is emphasized, which is the Climate Data Record standard.
In other cases, the goal is producing the best instantaneous satellite estimate, which is the High Resolution Precipitation Product approach. In either case, of course, the less-emphasized goal is also considered desirable. One key result of the multi-satellite studies is that including even a small amount of surface gauge data is very useful for controlling the biases that are endemic to satellite estimates. The difficulties in using gauge data are that 1) their availability is limited, as noted above, and 2) the best analyses of gauge data take two months or more after the observation time to undergo the necessary transmission, assembly, processing and quality control. Thus, precipitation estimates that include gauge data tend to be produced further after the observation time than the no-gauge estimates. As a result, while estimates that include gauge data may provide a more accurate depiction of the “true” precipitation, they are generally not suited for real- or near-real-time applications.
The work described has resulted in a variety of datasets possessing different formats, time/space grids, periods of record and regions of coverage, input datasets, and analysis procedures, as well as many different forms of dataset version designators.[tpl]cite web|author=International Precipitation Working Group|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/data/datasets.html|title=Global Precipitation Datasets|accessdate=2014-01-21[/tpl] In many cases, one of the modern multi-satellite data sets is the best choice for general use.

==Return period==

The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the return period or frequency.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=return-period1|title=Return period|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl] The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.[tpl]cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=return+period&submit=Search|title=Rainfall intensity return period|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2009-01-02[/tpl]  The term 1 in 10 year storm describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10 years, so it has a 10 percent likelihood any given year.
