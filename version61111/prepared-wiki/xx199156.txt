Graham Massey (born 4 August 1960, Manchester) was a member of experimental jazz rock group Biting Tongues once signed to Factory Records.  By 1988 he was a founding member of the British band, 808 State, formed in Manchester, England which by 1989 became the focus of his work and resulted in the demise of Biting Tongues.  Originally a hip-hop group called Hit Squad Manchester, 808 State shifted to an acid house sound, recording their debut album, Newbuild in 1988 under the new name 808 State.

808 State was named after Massey's favourite drum machine, the Roland TR-808, ironically later admitting that until the late 1980s they thought Roland drum machines were "severely uncool."Analogsuicide.coml Massey had also been a member of the D.I.Y. band Danny and the Dressmakers doing a mixture of "bad" music and Gong covers (living up to their tagline "We don't play our instruments, we abuse them") and also hippy - fusion band Aqua in the 1970s, along with violinist Graham Clark (also later of Gong).
Massey co-wrote and co-produced two tracks for Bjork's album Post .Army of Me and The Modern Things .
