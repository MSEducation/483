[[Fascinator]]

CATEGORIES: Headgear, Types of jewellery

A fascinator is a headpiece, a style of millinery. The word originally referred to a fine, lacy head covering akin to a shawl and made from wool or lace, but mostly feathers. In the modern usage, it refers to a woman's alternative to hat for formal attire; it is usually a large hair decoration on a band or clip with elaborate trimmings and decoration like a formal hat and it can incorporate a base to make it a miniature hat. 

==Uses==

Today, a fascinator may be worn instead of a hat on occasions where hats were traditionally worn—such as weddings—or as an evening accessory, when it may be called a cocktail hat. It is generally worn with fairly formal attire. 
A substantial fascinator is a fascinator of some size or bulk. Bigger than a barrette, modern fascinators are commonly made with feathers, flowers or beads.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/fashion/04iht-rhats04.html?pagewanted=all |title=Millinery Madness: Hat Makers With Attitude|publisher =New York Times[/tpl]  They need to be attached to the hair by a comb, headband or clip. The fun, fanciful decoration is often embellished with crystals, beads, or loops of ribbon, and attaches via a comb or headband; some have a small, stiff, flat base that can be secured with bobby pins.  They are particularly popular at premium horse-racing events, such as the Grand National, Kentucky Derby and the Melbourne Cup. Brides may choose to wear them as an alternative to a bridal veil or hat, particularly if their gowns are non-traditional.
At the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011, various female guests arrived wearing fascinators. Among them was Princess Beatrice of York, who wore a piece designed by the Irish milliner Philip Treacy. The unusual shape and colour caused quite a media stir and went on to become an internet phenomenon with its own Facebook page.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Princess-Beatrices-ridiculous-Royal-Wedding-hat/203705509669392 |title=Princess Beatrice's ridiculous Royal Wedding hat |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/fashion/the-75-things-new-yorkers-talked-about-in-2011.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stuart | last=Emmrich | title=The 75 Things New Yorkers Talked About in 2011 | date=2011-12-28[/tpl][tpl]Internetquelle | url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101344_2100875_2100913,00.html | titel= Princess Beatrice's Fascinator| titelerg= |autor= Nick Carbone | hrsg= Time  | seiten= | datum= 2011-12-07 | archiv-url= | archiv-datum= | zugriff=2012-04-05 | sprache=| format= | kommentar= | zitat=| offline= [/tpl] Princess Beatrice used the publicity to auction it off on eBay, where it garnered 99,000 Euros for charity.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/fashion/08noticed.html | work=The New York Times | first=Austin | last=Considine | title=Perched, Frothy, Headpieces Fascinate: Noticed | date=2011-05-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101344_2100875_2100913,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2011 | date=2011-12-07[/tpl]
