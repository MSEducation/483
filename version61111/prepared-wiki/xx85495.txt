==Other sites considered for selection==

The organization had considered several possible sites for the stadium's location before choosing the Charlotte center city site. Part of the site was occupied by the historic Good Samaritan Hospital.
One alternative was near NASCAR's Charlotte Motor Speedway and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in northeast Mecklenburg County. Another was at the intersection of I-85 and US 74 in western Gaston County. A popular option was to locate the facility near Carowinds amusement park, with the 50 yard line being on the state border of North Carolina and South Carolina.

==Naming==

The stadium, originally known as Carolinas Stadium (this name is used when the stadium hosts FIFA events), opened in 1996, as Ericsson Stadium after the Swedish telecom company LM Ericsson purchased the naming rights to the stadium in a ten year, $25 million agreement.[tpl]cite news |last=Hardin|first=Ed|title=Panthers' New Home Gets Name That Doesn't Quite Ring|newspaper=Greensboro News Record|pages=C1|date=June 27, 1996[/tpl] In 2004, the stadium received its current name after Bank of America purchased the naming rights for 20 years.Home of Carolina Panthers to be Called Bank of America Stadium Since Bank of America has acquired naming rights, many fans now refer to the stadium as, "The Bank", "The BOA", or "BOFA" and most recently "The Vault".[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==Carolina Panthers==

===Inaugural season===

The Panthers played their Inaugural Season at Clemson University's Memorial Stadium while the stadium was being completed. The Carolina Panthers played their first game at the stadium on September 14, 1996.

===Playoff games===

In 1996, on their way to their first NFC Championship Game, they defeated the defending Super Bowl Champion Dallas Cowboys. Again they defeated the Cowboys on their way to Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston in 2004. They were handed their first ever home playoff loss to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 33–13 on January 10, 2009.  The Panthers suffered another home playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers 23-10 on January 12, 2014.

==Impact on NFL venues==

At the time of its construction in the early 1990s, the stadium was a pioneering project for the use of Personal Seat Licenses. It was the first large-scale project funded in the United States chiefly through securing PSLs. The strength of PSL pledges impressed NFL owners and resulted in the Carolinas receiving the first new expansion team in nearly two decades.
The stadium is also credited with being a major cause for the recent round of new stadium construction in the NFL. Only a decade after its construction, it is now the eleventh oldest among current NFL stadiums. However, the stadium was considered so far ahead of its time that no significant renovations have been made since it opened. There are only four older NFL stadiums which have not received major renovations. The last four to open before the stadium broke ground were Candlestick Park in 1960, Ralph Wilson Stadium in 1973,  Sun Life Stadium in 1987, and the Georgia Dome in 1992.
Another addition came in 2007, when the original scoreboards and replay screens were replaced with high-definition monitors and ribbon boards.
In 2013, the City of Charlotte and the Panthers agreed to spend $200 million for additional renovations to the stadium. This decision came shortly after Charlotte announced interest in hosting a Super Bowl game in the near future.

==College football==

Bank of America Stadium does not serve as the primary home stadium for any college football team. However, it has hosted several college football games.

In February 2014, the ACC announced a 6 year contract extension to keep the game in Charlotte and through 2019.
