[[Pulled rickshaw]]

CATEGORIES: Human-powered vehicles, Vehicles for hire, Cycle types

A pulled rickshaw (or ricksha) is a mode of human-powered transport by which a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two persons.
In recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers. Pulled rickshaws have been replaced mainly by cycle rickshaw and auto rickshaws.

==Overview==

Rickshaws are commonly believed to have been invented in Japan in the 1860s, at the beginning of a rapid period of technical advancement.[tpl]cite book | title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 | publisher=NUS Press | author=James Francis Warren | pages=14 | isbn=997169266X [/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Amazing . . .

The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. In China, the rickshaw's popularity began to decline in the 1920s. In Singapore, the rickshaw's popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930.

==Description==

The initial rickshaws rode on iron-shod wooden wheels and the passenger sat on hard, flat seats. In the late 19th century and early 20th century. Rubber or pneumatic rubber tires, spring cushions, and backrests improved the passenger's comfort. Other features, such as lights were also added.[tpl] cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=69 | isbn=0520215648 [/tpl]
In the city of Shanghai, public rickshaws were painted yellow to differentiate from the private vehicles of the wealthy citizens, which were described as: 
 ... always shiny, were carefully maintained, and sported 'a spotless white upholstered double seat, a clean plaid for one's lap, and a wide protective tarpaulin to protect the passenger (or passengers, since sometimes up to three people rode together) against the rain.'[tpl] cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=69–70 | isbn=0520215648 [/tpl] 
The rickshaws were a convenient means of travel, able to traverse winding, narrow city streets. During monsoon season, passengers might be carried out of the carriage, above the flooded streets, to the door of their arrival. They offered door-to-door travel, unlike scheduled public bus and tram service.

====Madagascar====

Rickshaws, known as pousse-pousse, were introduced by British missionaries. The intention was to eliminate the slavery-associated palanquin. Its name pousse-pousse, meaning push-push, is reportedly gained from the need to have a second person to push the back of the rickshaw on Madagascar's hilly roads. They are a common form of transport in a number of Malagasy cities, especially Antsirabe, but are not found in the towns or cities with very hilly roads.[tpl] cite book | title=Madagascar | edition=10 | author=Hilary Bradt | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | page=98 |isbn=1841623415 [/tpl] They are similar to Chinese rickshaws and are often brightly decorated.[tpl]cite book | title=Madagascar, Volume 15 of Cultures of the World Cultures of the World - Group 15 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | author=Jay Heale, Zawiah Abdul Latif | year=2008 | pages=75–76 | isbn=0761430369 | edition=2[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yNax15GoPIkC&pg=PT59&dq=pousse-pousse | title=Madagascar Travel Guide | publisher=Lonely Planet | accessdate=2013-04-13 | year=2012 | edition=7 | isbn=1743213018 [/tpl]

====China====

In China, the rickshaw (pronounced renliche in Chinese) was first seen in 1886 and was used for public transportation in 1898. It was commonly called dongyangche for Japanese vehicle or "east- foreign-vehicle."[tpl] cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=68 | isbn=0520215648 [/tpl]
Rickshaw transportation was an important element in urban development in 20th century China, as a mode of transportation, source of employment and facilitation of migration for workers. According to author David Strand:
 Sixty thousand men took as many as a half million fares a day in a city of slightly more than one million.  Sociologist Li Jinghan estimated that one out of six males in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty was a puller.  Rickshaw men and their dependents made up almost 20 percent of Beijing's population.[tpl] cite book | title=Rickshaw Beijing: City People and Politics in the 1920 | author=David Strand | page=21 [/tpl] 
Shanghai's rickshaw industry began in 1874 with 1,000 rickshaws imported from Japan. By 1914 there were 9,718 vehicles. The pullers were a large group of the city's working poor: 100,000 men pulled rickshaws by the early 1940s, up from 62,000 in the mid-1920s.[tpl] cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | author=Hanchao Lu |publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 |pages=65–66, 68 | isbn=0520215648 [/tpl]

====Hong Kong====

Rickshaws were first imported to Hong Kong from Japan in 1880. They were a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 3,000 in the 1920s. However, their popularity waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and only a few old men—four as of 2009Section 3 Registration and Licensing of Vehicles and Drivers—still bear a license. It is reported that only one of them still offer rickshaw rides on The Peak, mainly for tourists.被遺忘的公交 The Forgotten Transportation: Rickshaw ride in Hong Kong

====India====

Around 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first in Simla.[tpl] cite book | title=Imperial Simla: the political culture of the Raj | author=Pamela Kanwar | edition=2| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | page=176 | isbn=0195667212 [/tpl] At the turn of the century it was introduced in Kolkata (Calcutta), India and in 1914 was a conveyance for hire.

=====Service availability=====

Though most cities offer auto rickshaw service, hand-pulled rickshaws do exist in some areas, such as Kolkata,[tpl]cite book | title=Frommer's India | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | author=Pippa de Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice, Shonar Joshi | location=2010 | pages=15, 57, 156 | isbn=0470645806 | edition=Fourth[/tpl] "the last bastion of human powered tana rickshaws".
 According to Trillin, most Kolkata rickshaws serve people "just a notch above poor" who tend to travel short distances. However, in a recent article by Hyrapiet and Greiner,Hyrapiet and Greiner, 2012. "CALCUTTA'S HAND–PULLED RICKSHAWS: CULTURAL POLITICS AND PLACE MAKING IN A GLOBALIZING CITY" Geographical Review. Volume 102, Issue 4, pages 407–426, October 2012 the authors found that rickshaws also transport middle-class residents who use their services out of convenience and for short distance trips to the local marketplace. Rickshaws are used to transport goods, shoppers, and school children.[tpl]#tag:ref|Trillin added that pullers told him that children enrolled in schools were the "steadiest" customers. Many middle-class families contract with rickshaw pullers to transport their children; a rickshaw puller who transports children becomes a "family retainer."|group="nb"[/tpl] It is also used as a "24 hour ambulance service." Also according to Hyrapiet and Greiner, rickshaw pullers have acted as peer-educators for the Calcutta Samaritans prodving critical information on HIV/AIDS because of their access to marginalized groups within Kolkata's red light districts.

There are several theories about the invention of the rickshaw. Japan historian Seidensticker wrote of the theories:
 Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention.[tpl]cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | publisher=University of California Press | author=Hanchao Lu | location=1999 | pages=348 | isbn=0520215648[/tpl]
