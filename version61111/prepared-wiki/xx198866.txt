Jape are an Irish electronic–rock band from Dublin. Formed as a side project by Richie Egan whilst part of The Redneck Manifesto,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drop-d.ie/article.php?article_id=626|title=Album Review: Jape - Ritual|date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=drop-d[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] they have released four albums to date; Cosmosphere (2003), The Monkeys in the Zoo Have More Fun Than Me (2004), Ritual (2008) and Ocean of Frequency (2011). Jape's wider discography includes the EP, Jape is Grape (2007), as well as a number of singles, including "Floating" and "Phil Lynott". The band have performed at festivals and events such as Glastonbury, Electric Picnic, Lovebox and Hard Working Class Heroes and provided support for The Flaming Lips at Belsonic in Belfast in August 2008.
The first and second albums received airplay on alternative national radio in Ireland. The Monkeys in the Zoo Have More Fun Than Me's opening track, "Floating", became a popular single on late night alternative music radio shows and attracted the attention of Brendan Benson during a visit to Dublin. Benson now covers the track whilst performing live with his band The Raconteurs, as do the Belgian bastard pop duo Soulwax during their DJ sets.
Jape's third album, Ritual, was released in June 2008, later winning the Choice Music Prize for Irish Album of the Year 2008. The album features the singles "I Was a Man", "Strike Me Down" and "Phil Lynott", the latter of which was subject to an unsuccessful petition by fans to have it named Ireland's Christmas number one single in December 2008.
The album Ocean of Frequency was released in 2011 and won Jape their second Choice Music Prize in March 2012.

==Background==

Richie Egan is the principal songwriter but refers to the overall band as Jape. This came about following his first few solo performances when he realised he did not wish people to consider him a singer-songwriter but as part of a band.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0306/1224242347208.html|title=A matter of Choice|date=2009-03-06|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] Egan has been part of many bands from a young age, and spent his youth experimenting with four-track tape recorders and sounds. He was previously a member of the bands Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2992&Itemid=10337&ed=285|title=May Music @ Electric Avenue|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=Waterford Today[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] After leaving Black Belt Jones he went on to become the bassist in the instrumental rock band The Redneck Manifesto of which he is still a member. He has occasionally toured as part of David Kitt’s live band, as well as in Conor J. O'Brien's band Villagers as a bass player and with his bandmates in The Redneck Manifesto.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2004/1202/jape.html|title=Jape - The Monkeys in the Zoo Have More Fun Than Me|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl] By 2003 Egan had developed Jape after spending a week at the family home of fellow Redneck, Niall Byrne, in Avoca, County Wicklow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2664855.html|title=Enter the cosmos|date=2003-06-24|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=Hot Press[/tpl]   “I’ve been playing in bands since I was really young but I’ve always been messing around on the side with four-track tape recorders, experimenting with sounds”.  "The chance to turn this “messing around” into something concrete came about when he was given the opportunity to decamp to Avoca, where fellow Redneck, Niall’s family own a house. Richie used it as a studio for a week."   “I listen to a lot of different styles of music, so I try to keep my finger in as many pies as possible. It keeps me interested,” he laughs."

==Style==

Egan has said that he started listening to music during puberty. He was initially influenced by 1960s melodic pop such as Simon & Garfunkel, later listened to American hardcore punk such as the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Black Flag but listens to many styles of music overall. The single "Strike Me Down" has been compared to MSTRKRFT and the French synthpop quartet Phoenix. Memories of a childhood show by heavy metal band Mastodon led him to write the song "Phil Lynott". He also enjoys newer Irish acts such as Villagers.

==Career==

Jape's debut album, Cosmosphere, was released on the Volta Sounds label in 2003. National broadcaster RTÉ suggested in its review that Jape was not a "convincing electronic producer" and that Egan did not have the voice of a singer-songwriter, indicating its desire to see him remain with The Redneck Manifesto and refrain from any further activities under the pseudonym Jape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/reviews/music/2003/0612/448902-jape/|title=Jape - Cosmosphere|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2014-02-21|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl] However, the album received airplay on national radio on shows such as Donal Dineen's Here Comes the Night on Today FM."Artist: Jape". Trust Me I'm a Thief. Accessed 7 March 2009.
Jape's second album, The Monkeys in the Zoo Have More Fun Than Me was released by Trust Me I'm A Thief Records in 2004. It enjoyed much more success than its predecessor and contains the well-known single "Floating" which was given much airplay on late night alternative radio shows. The lead single "Floating" was famously overheard being played in Whelan's in Dublin by the musician Brendan Benson. Benson immediately requested a copy of the album and then praised Jape in The Guardian – however, the newspaper spelt it "Jabe". He also rang Egan personally to inform him he would be covering "Floating" with his band The Raconteurs. However, Egan has stated that he did not give Benson personal permission to cover the song. He did witness the cover live at the Olympia Theatre and was later to describe it as "a great moment". The single is also covered by Soulwax during their DJ sets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/atl/news_specific183778.shtml|title=Flaming Lips Support Bill Confirmed|accessdate=2008-10-06|publisher=BBC[/tpl] Jape participated in two nationwide tours with both David Kitt and The Redneck Manifesto to promote the album's release.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2004/0901/jape.html|title=New album plus Irish tour for Jape|date=2004-09-01|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2752427.html|title=Jape launch their new album|date=2004-09-07|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=Hot Press[/tpl] Kitt was co-producer of "Floating".
