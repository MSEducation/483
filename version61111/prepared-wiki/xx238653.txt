==History==

===The beginning - Hollywood, Never On Sunday and the Orphan Child===

The band started in Hollywood, California, in 1993 under the name “Never On Sunday” with Roxy Saint and Sharmet sharing vocal duties. Although the roots of the band can be traced back a few years earlier and 3000 miles to the east… Boston, Ma is where Chris, Greg and Shawn would play parts in two different bands before heading west (Lost Angels and Touch Me Hooker).
After playing some show’s around Hollywood and building some Major Label interest from Hollywood Records. Internal conflict created mostly by the business side of the music industry would tear ‘Never on Sunday’ apart. 
Singer Roxy Saint would release the 'Orphan Child' CD in 1995[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00064ZAXC|title=Roxy Saints Orphan Child digital re-release 2007 on Amazon.|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl] that used many of the bands most popular songs, including "Bimbo On The Phone", "Sunshine", "I Rule the World", and "Best Friend/ I Can't Explain."

===Back to Boston, Soundtrack to a Suicide CD===

By the late 1990s the guys in the band had grown tired of the Hollywood lifestyle and returned to the East coast. Around 2001 bass player Greg 'Bang’ returned to Boston from New York City to join a revamped version of the band to be called ‘Stars Underground’. Long-time friend Ron Arsenault would be the singer and with a couple dozen songs already written the band quickly headed into the studio with Joe Laquidara (former sideman for Boston (band)).
The ‘Soundtrack to a Suicide’ CD would be the result, and the band started playing shows around Boston and the surrounding areas. Everything seemed to be going well, but as communication within the band started to dissolve Greg and Ron headed back to California where the ‘Soundtrack to a Suicide’ CD[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heavyharmonies.com/cgi-bin/glamcd.cgi?BandNum=4124&CDName=Soundtrack+To+A+Suicide|title=Stars Underground-Soundtrack To A Suicide CD information.|publisher=Heavy Harmonies|accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl] was released in an attempt to put together a new Stars Underground line-up on the West coast.

===Self-titled CD===

A couple years later a CD simply titled ‘Stars Underground’[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sleazegrinder.com/review_starunderground.htm|title=Stars Underground S/T CD Review.|publisher=Sleazegrinder|accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl] was released, and the band played some shows around Boston with Ron, Chris and Shawn as the only original members. The song "See You Around" was released to radio, and got airplay on Boston's WBCN.
The band's website and CD artwork would feature the four original members; even though bass player Greg 'Bang' was not present for any of the shows during this time period, and a fill-in bass player was used.

===2006 reunion===

The last re-emergence of the Stars Underground was 2006 when all four original members played Dragonfly Club in Hollywood, California. With this came the re-release of the Soundtrack to a Suicide CD,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glitzine.net/recensioner/starsunderground.htm|title=Stars Underground-Soundtrack To A Suicide CD re-release  Review.|publisher=Glitzine|accessdate=2010-03-18[/tpl] sold through the band's website. A couple new songs were played at the show along with talk of a new CD getting recorded. After a couple more live shows around the Boston area, the bands website was taken down and all has been quiet since.
