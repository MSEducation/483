Day 1 Studios was an American game developer that operated in Chicago, Illinois and Hunt Valley, Maryland.
They worked in tandem with developer FASA Interactive to create their first two games MechAssault, which Microsoft used to promote their Xbox Live service, and MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf. They worked with Monolith Productions to make the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console ports of F.E.A.R..
In 2006, they signed a deal with LucasArts to develop the science fiction video game Fracture. It had mixed reviews by the gaming press. In 2010, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that they would be developing the third installment in the F.E.A.R. franchise entitled F.E.A.R. 3, first announced using the title F.3.A.R., which was later confirmed as just for advertising.  When their subsequent project with Konami was cancelled, however, around 100 employees (the vast majority of the team working on that project) were laid off.[tpl]cite web|author=December 2, 2011 2:45PM PST |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/day-1-studios-loses-konami-publishing-deal-6347024 |title=Day 1 Studios loses Konami publishing deal |publisher=GameSpot.com |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]  The remaining team members moved forward with development on the free-to-play mech game Reign of Thunder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gametestlab.com/gaming-news/pc/1233-day-1-studios-announces-mech-combat-game-reign-of-thunder.html |title=Day 1 Studios Announces Mech Combat Game Reign of Thunder |publisher=Gametestlab.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]
