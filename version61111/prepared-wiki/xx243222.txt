===Early life and career===

Sándor Szurmay was born in 1860 at Boksánbánya (now: Bocşa, Romania) which located in the historical Krassó-Szörény County. He made the secondary school for sciences on Szeged, then breaking his studies he reported himself to the Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company, where he worked as a trainee later official.
In 1882 he chose the military way. Szurmay started his service at the Eighteenth Home Defence Battalion of Lugos. After the accomplishment of the Ludovica Military Academy's classes he serviced as adjutant in a rank of Second Lieutenant at the various corps of the Magyar Honvédség. Between 1886 and 1887 he finished the Academy's upper classes and between 1887 and 1889 the Imperial and Royal Staff College (K.u.k. Kriegsschule), that is the staff officer's academy. He was promoted to a First Lieutenant in 1889 and he was ordered onto the Fourth Army Corps' headquarters class of Budapest.

===Later career===

By November 1917 Szurmay held the rank of General der Infanterie and held the ministerial portfolio for the Hungarian branch of the armed forces, the Honvéd. In November 1917 he officially demanded the separation of the joint army of Austria-Hungary into separate Austrian and Hungarian formations. At a crown council chaired by the emperor the following month he again pressed for a full division of the k.u.k. army, adding that "all groups in Hungary are united on the issue of a Hungarian army."Rothenburg, G.
