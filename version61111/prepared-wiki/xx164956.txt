==History==

The area was well known to the First Nations, while the first European settlers arrived in 1844 following the construction of a sawmill by Edward Selvin, of Les Éboulements. In 1849, the mill was sold to William Price. One of the superintendents of the Price Company was Grant William Forrest (died November 15, 1878), after whom the new settlement was named. As written by Surveyor P.H. Dumais in 1873, the little village, "with its chapel and its windmills", was originally spelled Forrest-Ville, but the English version of his text showed the spelling Forestville. Being at the mouth of the Sault aux Cochons River, the place was also alternatively known as Sault-au-Cochon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=23117 |title=Forestville (Ville) |publisher=Commission de toponymie du Québec |accessdate=2010-06-21 |language=French[/tpl]
The Price Company owned large tracts of land in the area and prospered between 1870 and 1885, but went into decline about 1885, leading to the mill's closure in 1890. In 1937, the Forestville Post Office opened. That same year the forest industry was revitalized when the Anglo-Canadian Pulp & Paper Mills Company built a new mill, and in 1942, built the Arboriduc log flume that carried logs for several kilometers to the port at the mouth of the Sault aux Cochons River. Subsequently, the Town of Forestville and the Municipality of Saint-Luc-de-Laval were established in 1944 and in 1950 respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ville.forestville.ca/la-ville/ville-forestville.html |title=Un peu d'histoire |publisher=Ville de Forestville |accessdate=2010-06-21 |language=French[/tpl]
In 1980, Forestville and Saint-Luc-de-Laval were merged to form the new Town of Forestville.
