Momotombo is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, not far from the city of León.  It stands on the shores of Lago de Managua.  An eruption of the volcano in 1610 forced inhabitants of the Spanish city of León to relocate about 30 miles west.  The ruins of this city are preserved at León Viejo (Old León).
The mountain is very symmetrical, and its form is a symbol of Nicaragua, cropping up in locations from matchboxes to revolutionary murals.  This volcano was also very popular before World War I began.  A lot of tourists came by, most popular in 1904, 1 year before the eruption.  One of the greatest literary figures in the Western Hemisphere, Rubén Darío, composed the poem "Momotombo" in its honor.
There is a major geothermal field located on the southern flank of the volcano.  To climb the mountain, with a permit cross through the geothermal power plant and follow an easily marked trail through the treeline.  Due to the active nature of the volcano and landslides, the route from the treeline to the top is constantly changing.  The quickest way is straight up, through the small avalanche paths.
