==Early life==

Woodward was born on 1 May 1932 at Penzance, Cornwall, to a bank clerk. He was educated at Stubbington House School, preparatory school in Stubbington, Hampshire. He then went on to continue his education at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon.

==Naval career==

Having graduated from the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, Woodward joined the Royal Navy in 1946.Debrett's People of Today 1994 He became a submariner in 1954. In 1960 he passed the Royal Navy's rigorous Submarine Command Course known as The Perisher,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_18/perisher.htm |title=Perisher Submarine Command Training in the Royal Navy |work=JOC David Nagle, USN |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=5 August 2013[/tpl] and received his first command, the T Class submarine HMS Tireless. He then commanded HMS Grampus before becoming the second in command of the nuclear fleet submarine HMS Valiant. In 1967, he was promoted to Commander and became the Instructor (known as  Teacher) of The Perisher Course. He took command of HMS Warspite in December 1969. He was promoted to the rank of Captain in 1972. In 1974, he became Captain of Submarine Training and in 1976 he took command of HMS Sheffield.
He became Head of Naval Plans in the Ministry of Defence in 1978. In July 1981, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and appointed as Flag Officer First Flotilla.

===Falklands War===

In 1982, he commanded the Hermes aircraft carrier group, Task Force 317.8, in the Falklands War under the Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse. (The task force containing the amphibious ships which launched the actual invasion TF 317.0 was commanded by Commodore Michael Clapp, with Task Force 317.1 being the landing force itself.)
He worked out the timetable for the campaign, starting from the end and working to the start. Knowing that the Argentine forces had to be defeated before the (Southern Hemisphere) winter made conditions too bad, set a latest date by which the land forces had to be ashore, that in turn set a latest date by which control of the air was achieved, and so on.Woodward, Sandy; One Hundred Days
Possibly the best known single incident was the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano. He knew that Belgrano (and particularly her Exocet armed escorts) were a threat to the task force and he ordered that Belgrano be sunk
 Admiral Sir George Zambellas credited "Woodward's inspirational leadership and tactical acumen ... as a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic".[tpl]cite news |title=Falklands War admiral Sandy Woodward dies aged 81 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23575534 | work=BBC News | date=5 August 2013[/tpl]
