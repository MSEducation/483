Cedar Crest, also known as Cedar Crest Farms, is a Greek Revival plantation house located near Faunsdale, Alabama.  It was built for Kimbrough C. Dubose in 1850 by Albert Prince, a slave.  The house is one-and-a-half stories with side gables, but has been simplified.  It originally had side wings, with adjoining porches across the front. These were removed in 1939, leaving the small central front portico.  Another historic plantation house, Altwood, was moved from a nearby location to the Cedar Crest grounds in 1988.Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, page 15.
