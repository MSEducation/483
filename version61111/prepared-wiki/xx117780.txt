==History==

A Hapoel Ra'anana was in existence in the 1950s and 1960s. They were placed in the South Division of Liga Bet (then the second division) in 1951-52.
The modern club was established in 1972, and in the mid-1990s was playing in Liga Gimel, the lowest tier of Israeli football. In 1995 they started a remarkable period of success; in 1997 they won their division of Liga Gimel, and were promoted to Liga Bet. The following season they won their division of Liga Bet and were promoted to Liga Alef. In 1998–99 they won the North Division of Liga Alef to earn promotion to Liga Artzit. After finishing third in 1999–2000, they won the league the following season and were promoted to Liga Leumit.
In 2008–09, the club was promoted to the Israeli Premier League for the first time in their history. However, they had to play its home matches at Hapoel Kfar Saba's Levita Stadium, as its home ground, the Karnei Oren Memorial Field, did not meet Premier League requirements. In January 2010, the city council published plans for a 7,500-capacity new stadium in Lev HaPark neighborhood.
After a single season in the top division the club relegated to Liga Leumit.
After 4 seasons in Liga leumit, in 2012-2013, Ra'anana was promoted again to the Israeli Premier League.
