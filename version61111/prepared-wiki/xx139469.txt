Victorinus iunior (died 271) was an usurper against Roman Emperor Aurelian, according to the Historia Augusta. He is included in the list of the Thirty Tyrants.
According to the often unreliable list of Thirty Tyrants, the Emperor of the Gallic Empire Victorinus had a son called Victorinus who was made augustus by his father or grandmother (Victoria) just before Victorinus senior's death, but was himself soon killed by his soldiers.
