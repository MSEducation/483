==Etymology==

The etymology of the name Brno is disputed. It perhaps comes from Old Czech brnie 'muddy, swampy.'E.M. Pospelov, Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira (Moscow, 1998), p. 82. Alternative derivations are from a Slavic verb brniti (to armor or to fortify) or a Celtic language spoken in the area before it was overrun by Germanic peoples and later Slavic peoples (this theory would make it cognate with other Celtic words for hill, such as the Welsh word bryn). Throughout its history, Brno's locals also referred to the town in other languages, including Brünn in German, ברין (Brin) in Yiddish and Bruna in Latin.
The city was also referred to as Brunn ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|b|r|ʌ|n[/tpl])http://www.audioenglish.org/dictionary/brunn.htm in English, but this usage is not common today.http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Brunn&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=
The Asteroid 2889 Brno was named after the city, as well as the Bren light machine gun (Brno + Enfield), one of the most famous weapons of World War II.

==History==

The Brno basin has been inhabited since prehistoric times,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.brno.cz/index.php?lan=en&nav01=2222&nav02=5&nav03=1555|title=History of the City of Brno|publisher=the Statutory city of Brno|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl] but the town's direct predecessor was a fortified settlement of the Great Moravia Empire known as Staré Zámky which was inhabited from the Neolithic Age to the early 11th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.psh.ecn.cz/strany/mapa/14_stare_zamky.pdf|title=Naučná stezka Hády a údolí Říčky. Panel 14: Staré Zámky|publisher=ZO ČSOP Pozemkový spolek Hády|accessdate=30 September 2011|language=Czech[/tpl] In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with Olomouc and Znojmo.
In the 11th century a chapel was founded on the Petrov hill; since then, the chapel has undergone many changes which after centuries resulted in the current Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul. The Špilberk Castle was founded in the 13th century, originally as the main royal castle in Moravia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spilberk.cz/?lang=en&pg=zobraz&co=spilberk-castle|title=Spilberk Castle — Špilberk, Brno Castle, the home of Brno City Museum|accessdate=30 September 2011[/tpl] In 1243 Brno was granted the large and small city privileges[tpl]clarifyme|date=December 2013[/tpl] by the King, and thus it was recognized as a royal city. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland (cz: Eliška Rejčka) founded the current Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady which is now her final resting place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opatbrno.cz/opat_hist_en.htm|title=Opatství svatého Tomáše na Starém Brně|accessdate=3 October 2011[/tpl] In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century the Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia (Moravian rulers); one of them was elected the King of the Romans.
In the 1641 Brno became the sole capital of Moravia. During the 17th century Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque citadel. In 1777 the bishopric of Brno was established; Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske was the first Bishop.[tpl]#tag:ref|The cathedral of the bishopric of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brno, the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, is depicted on the 10CZK coin.|group="note"[/tpl] In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna, this was the beginning of rail transport in what is now the Czech Republic. In the years 1859-1864 the city fortification was almost completely removed. In 1869 a horsecar service started to operate in Brno, it was the first tram service in the Czech lands.

===Major battles===

===The capital of Moravia===

In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each one of them had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinated only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. Seats of these rulers and thus "capitals" of these territories were castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. Since then, until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was therefore "evenly" divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet (cz: Moravský Zemský sněm), the Moravian Land Tables (cz: Moravské Zemské desky), and the Moravian Land Court (cz: Moravský Zemský soud) were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc was larger than Brno as the population number is concerned, and it was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia. Since 1573, Olomouc was also the seat of the only Moravian university existing at that time (nowadays Palacký University of Olomouc).
In 1641, in the midst of the Thirty Years' War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia Ferdinand III commanded permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc's Collegium Nordicum made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies.[ref][tpl]en icon[/tpl] 
[/ref] In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish army which then stayed there for 8 years.[tpl]#tag:ref|This led to decline in population of Olomouc from over 30,000 people to mere 1,675 and total devastation of the city.|group="note"[/tpl] Meanwhile Brno, as the only Moravian city which under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches managed to defend itself from the Swedes, served as the sole capital of the state (Margraviate of Moravia). After the end of the Thirty Years' War (1648), Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution.[tpl]#tag:ref|However, Olomouc also had legal status of capital city, although this title was purely a honorary matter rather than a real role, sometimes it was referred to as "the Secondary Capital".|group="note"[/tpl] In 1948 the communist government of Czechoslovakia abolished Moravian autonomy, stripped Brno of its title, and transferred all political power in the country into one center which is Prague. At the present day, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive, and ranks among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/moravske-desky-zemske.aspx|title=Moravské desky zemské|publisher=Ministerstvo vnitra České republiky|accessdate=3 October 2011|language=Czech[/tpl]

===The 20th century and Greater Brno===

In 1919 two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno ([tpl]lang-cs|Velké Brno[/tpl]). This was done to dilute the German majority by addition of the Slavic communities of the city's neighborhood. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger with population of about 222,000 - before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spilberk.cz/?pg=zobraz&co=velke-brno|title=Výstava Velké Brno|accessdate=2 October 2011|language=Czech[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kirk.webzdarma.cz/statisticke_udaje_za_Zemi_Moravskoslezskou_k_roku_1930.pdf|title=Statistické údaje za Zemi Moravskoslezskou k roku 1930|accessdate=2 October 2011|language=Czech[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://portal.gov.cz/wps/portal/_s.155/701?number1=&number2=&name=o+slou%C4%8Den%C3%AD+sousedn%C3%ADch+obc%C3%AD+s+Brnem&text=|title=Zákon č. 213/1919 Sb., o sloučení sousedních obcí s Brnem|accessdate=2 October 2011|language=Czech[/tpl] In 1921 Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia (cz: země Moravská), before that it was the capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. Seven years later, Brno became the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (cz: země Moravskoslezská). In 1939 Brno was occupied by Nazi Germany, and in 1945 it was liberated by the Red Army.
When the First World War ended in 1918, the population of Brno included about 55,000 German speakers, including almost all inhabitants of Jewish origin. Most of Brno's Jewish population of about 12,000 was murdered by the Nazis during the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945. All Czech universities including those of Brno were closed by the Nazis in 1939, and the Faculty of Law was transformed into the headquarters of the Gestapo and the university dormitory was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war were imprisoned and tortured there, with about 800 civilians executed or dead. One source states that executions were public and local Germans attended for a 3 Reichsmark fee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fronta.cz/dotaz/popraviste-v-protektoratu-cechy-a-morava |title=Popraviště v protektorátu Čechy a Morava |publisher=Fronta.cz |date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308040948/http://www.zasvobodu.cz/clanek.php?c=101 |title=Kounicovi koleje v Brně |url=http://www.zasvobodu.cz/clanek.php?c=101 |work=zasvobodu.cz |archivedate=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2014-01-30 |author=JUDr. František Vašek |language=Czech[/tpl] After the end of the war in 1945, ethnic German residents were forcibly expelled, as throughout Czechoslovakia. In the so-called “Brünn death march”, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched [tpl]convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march.Bundesministerium für Vertriebene, Flüchtlinge und Kriegsgeschädigte & Theodor Schieder Hgg.: Die Vertreibung der Deutschen aus Ost-Mitteleuropa. Vorarbeiten Fritz Valjavec. Teil 4: Die Vertreibung der deutschen Bevölkerung aus der Tschechoslowakei. Bonn, 1957, 2 Bände. However, later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis.Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948

Brno is surrounded by woody hills from three sides; a significant part of the area of the city is forest, about [tpl]convert|6379|ha|2|abbr=on[/tpl], i.e. 28%. Due to its location between the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and the Southern Moravian lowlands, Brno has a moderate climate.

Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, it's the Reduta Theatre at Zelný trh (en: the Vegetable Market).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ndbrno.cz/o-divadle/historie-divadla-reduta|title=Historie divadla Reduta, Národní divadlo Brno|accessdate=21 September 2011|publisher=The National Theatre Brno|language=Czech[/tpl] So the city has a long tradition in theatre productions, the first theatre plays in Brno took place probably in 1660s in the City Tavern, today's Reduta Theatre, however, the first "real theatre" with theatre boxes was built in 1733 in this complex. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767 again in the Reduta Theatre, the play was called Zamilovaný ponocný (en: Watchmen in Love) performed by the Venice Theatre Company, the same year Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart performed in the theatre with his older sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brno.cz/sprava-mesta/magistrat-mesta-brna/usek-organizacni/odbor-zahranicnich-vztahu/mezinarodni-vztahy/mezinarodni-site-mest/evropske-mozartovy-cesty/evropske-mozartovy-cesty/mozart-v-brne/|title=Brno - Mozart v Brně|publisher=The Statutory City of Brno|accessdate=22 September 2011|language=Czech[/tpl] this rare visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre and also the Reduta's Mozart Hall (cz: Mozartův sál) was named after him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ndbrno.cz/photo_full/divadlo-reduta-mozartuv-sal|title=Divadlo Reduta, Mozartův sál, Národní divadlo Brno|accessdate=22 September 2011|publisher=The National Theatre Brno|language=Czech[/tpl]

Theatres in Brno experienced a long development and the current seats of the theatres and their artistic ensembles might be considerably different from the original ones, for example the Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and also it wasn't part of the National Theatre in Brno, there was similar situation regarding the Reduta Theatre. Between the years 1971 and 1978 some plays were performed at Brno Exhibition Centre due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre.[tpl]cite web|url=https://is.muni.cz/th/75405/ff_m/DP_Fenomen_Mestskeho_divadla_Brno.pdf|title=Fenomén Městského divadla v Brno v brněnské kultuře|publisher=Masarykova univerzita, Filozofická fakulta, Ústav hudební vědy|accessdate=22 September 2011|language=Czech[/tpl]

===Legends connected with Brno===

There are several legends connected with the City of Brno; one of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brnoinfo.com/old-town-hall/|title=Old Town Hall of Brno – Brno Tourist Informations|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl] It is said that there was a terrible creature terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen such a beast before, so they called it a dragon. They trembled in fear of the dragon until a brave man decided to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile motifs are common in Brno. A "krokodýl" (in Czech language) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl.
Next to the "dragon" at the Old Town Hall the town's second well-known emblem is displayed. This is a waggon wheel made from a tree found and felled fifty miles away from the city. According to the story, a local man waged to fell the tree, to make a wheel out of it, and to roll the wheel to the city of Brno, all this within a single day. Since the whole achievement was considered impossible by normal human means, the man was later believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and he died in poverty as a result.
As a historic memento to victory over the Swedish army in 1645, the local Petrov Cathedral rings noon an hour earlier, at 11 o'clock because the locals and Swedish army were in stalemate and the Swedish general said he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon and the bellringer tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early. Keeping his word, the general and his army left.[tpl]sfn|Henig|2000|p=93[/tpl]
