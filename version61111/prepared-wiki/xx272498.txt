==Career==

Little turned professional in 1996 having represented Scotland as an amateur. Having reached the final stage of qualifying school that year, he played qualified for the Challenge Tour and played steadily at that level for the next five seasons, finishing runner-up twice, before claiming his first win in 2001 at the Segura Viudas Challenge de Espa√±a.Little achieves his big breakthrough At the end of 2001 Little returned to the qualifying school and gained a place on the European Tour for 2002. After a difficult first season he returned successfully to the school in 2003, but once again failed to retain his status, despite recording a second Challenge Tour win, and returned to the Challenge Tour full-time for 2004. In recent years Little's form has slumped further, and he has made only occasional appearances on either tour since 2008.
Since 2009, Little has been the head professional at Dundrum House Golf Club in Ireland.Underachiever Little feels he let Torrance down after failing to achieve breakthrough
