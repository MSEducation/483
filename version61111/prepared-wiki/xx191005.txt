One of Steinberger's articles published by Slate in 2002, "Grape Rot: The New Wine Spectator's Distinct Aroma of Fishiness",[tpl]cite web|last= Steinberger |first=Mike, Slate | title= Grape Rot: The New Wine Spectator's Distinct Aroma of Fishiness;  Wine Spectator defends its Honor |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2075720/ |date= December 26, 2002 [/tpl] led to a harsh response by Wine Spectator executive editor Tom Matthews. Steinberger's articles were no longer published in Wine Spectator after the  article, and Matthews demanded a retraction of the article, while recommending that Slate "no longer accept Steinberger's unprofessional and potentially libelous contributions".

In a Slate article titled "Change We Can Taste", written concerning an interview with White House food and beverage operations usher Daniel Shanks published on Bloomberg.com,McCoy, Elin, Bloomberg.com (September 18, 2008).
