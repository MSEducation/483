[[Cachucha]]

CATEGORIES: Latin dances, Spanish dances

Cachucha is a Spanish solo dance in 3/4 to 3/8 time, similar to Bolero. Cachucha is danced to an Andalusian national song with castanet accompaniment. 

==Etymology==

From Spanish cachucha, small boat. Possibly from diminutive of cacho, shard, saucepan, probably from vulgar Latin cacculus, alteration of Latin caccabus, pot, from Greek kakkabos, a small container.

==History==

The Cachucha was created in Cuba though it is now considered a Spanish dance. Fanny Elssler (1810-1884, Vienna) popularized this dance when she introduced it to the public in the ballet The Lady of the Lake (1812) and later performed it in Jean Coralli's ballet Le Diable boiteux (1836, "the Lame Devil").
WS Gilbert makes reference to the dance in the Savoy Opera The Gondoliers as the chorus sings Dance a Cachucha.
