==Station overview==

===Facilities===

Alamein has only one bi-directional platform, so in order to reverse a train, the driver must change ends.
The station is one of only two terminus stations in Melbourne not to be classed as a "premium station" (the other being Hurstbridge, although Hurstbridge is staffed on a part-time basis, unlike Alamein). As a result, Alamein is not staffed, and is serviced only by a Myki ticket vending machine. It is only a small station with a weatherboard building in the centre in which a disused booking office and other facilities are continued, and there are no car parking spaces. As with most of the Melbourne rail network, Alamein is, however, fully wheelchair accessible, being at ground level with no ramps or stairs. The station is not serviced by any connecting bus services. 
Though it has not been staffed since the 1990s, Alamein is one of several stations across the network to be used for other purposes. Community groups operate a small craft market once a week. For most of the day it is one of the two least-used stations along the line, along with Willison.

===History===

Alamein was the last station to be built on what is now the line of the same name. It was opened in 1948 on the reservation of the former Outer Circle line, the section on which Alamein is now located having been closed to all traffic in 1895.[ref]

The station served a new Housing Commission estate that had been constructed for people who were displaced after the Second World War. The station still bears the name of the estate, which in turn had been named after the World War II battlefield in North Africa.
The Outer Circle Trail for cyclists and walkers (also called the "Anniversary Trail") continues along the Outer Circle alignment after Alamein station as far as Gardiners Creek and the Malvern Valley Public Golf Course, and then connects with the Gardiners Creek Trail and a path to East Malvern station.
In 2007 the toilets were reopened for use at the station, but they were then closed at an unknown date for an unknown reason.
