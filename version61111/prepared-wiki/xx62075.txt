Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is an enzyme that adds DNA sequence repeats ("TTAGGG" in all vertebrates) to the 3' end of DNA strands in the telomere regions, which are found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. This region of repeated nucleotide called telomeres contains noncoding DNA and hinders the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. As a result, every time the chromosome is copied, only 100–200 nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that carries its own RNA molecule, which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres, which are shortened after each replication cycle.
The existence of a compensatory mechanism for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973,[tpl]cite journal | author = Olovnikov AM | title = A theory of marginotomy.

Telomerase was discovered by Carol W.

The role of telomeres and telomerase in cell aging and cancer was established  by scientists at biotechnology company Geron with the cloning of the RNA and catalytic components of human telomerase [tpl]cite journal | author = Feng J, Funk WD, Wang SS, Weinrich SL, Avilion AA, Chiu CP, Adams RR, Chang E, Allsopp RC, Yu J | title = The RNA component of human telomerase | journal = Science | volume = 269 | issue = 5228 | pages = 1236–41 |date=September 1995 | pmid = 7544491 | doi = 10.1126/science.7544491| url = [/tpl] and the development of a PCR- based assay for telomerase activity called the TRAP assay allowing for a survey of telomerase activity in multiple types of cancer.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=N. |last2=Piatyszek |first2=M. |last3=Prowse |first3=K. |last4=Harley |first4=C. |last5=West |first5=M. |last6=Ho |first6=P. |last7=Coviello |first7=G. |last8=Wright |first8=W. |last9=Weinrich |first9=S. |title=Specific association of human telomerase activity with immortal cells and cancer |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5193 |pages=2011–5 |year=1994 |pmid=7605428 |doi=10.1126/science.7605428|display-authors=9 [/tpl]

==Structure==

Human telomerase consists of two molecules each of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), telomerase RNA (TR or TERC), and dyskerin (DKC1).[tpl]cite journal |author=Cohen S, Graham M, Lovrecz G, Bache N, Robinson P, Reddel R |title=Protein composition of catalytically active human telomerase from immortal cells |journal=Science |volume=315 |issue=5820 |pages=1850–3 |year=2007 |pmid=17395830 |doi=10.1126/science.1138596[/tpl] The genes of telomerase subunits, which are TERT,HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee(HGNC)- TERT TERC,HGNC - TERC DKC1,HGNC - DKC1 and TEP1HGNC - TEP1 etc, are located on different chromosomes in the human genome. Human TERT gene (hTERT) is translated into a protein of 1132 amino acids.NCBI - telomerase reverse transcriptase isoform 1 TERT proteins from many eukaryotes have been sequenced.NCBI - telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT polypeptide folds with TERC, a non-coding RNA (451 nucleotides long in human). TERT has a 'mitten' structure that allows it to wrap around the chromosome to add single-stranded telomere repeats.
TERT is a reverse transcriptase, which is a class of enzyme that creates single-stranded DNA using single-stranded RNA as a template. As stated above, TERT carries its own template, TERC.
The protein composition of human telomerase was identified in 2007 by Scott Cohen and his team at the Children's Medical Research Institute in Australia. The high-resolution protein structure of the Tribolium castaneum catalytic subunit of telomerase TERT was decoded in 2008 by Emmanuel Skordalakes and his team at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gillis AJ, Schuller AP, Skordalakes E | title = Structure of the Tribolium castaneum telomerase catalytic subunit TERT | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7213 | pages = 633–7 |date=October 2008 | pmid = 18758444 | doi = 10.1038/nature07283 | url =  [/tpl] The structure revealed that the protein consists of four conserved domains (RNA-Binding Domain (TRBD), fingers, palm and thumb), organized into a ring configuration that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA polymerases and bacteriophage B-family DNA polymerases.

==Function==

By using TERC, TERT can add a six-nucleotide repeating sequence, 5'-TTAGGG (in all vertebrates, the sequence differs in other organisms) to the 3' strand of chromosomes. These TTAGGG repeats (with their various protein binding partners) are called telomeres. The template region of TERC is 3'-CAAUCCCAAUC-5'.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gavory G, Farrow M, Balasubramanian S | title = Minimum length requirement of the alignment domain of human telomerase RNA to sustain catalytic activity in vitro | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 30 | issue = 20 | pages = 4470–80 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12384594 | pmc = 137139 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkf575 | url =  [/tpl] This way, telomerase can bind the first few nucleotides of the template to the last telomere sequence on the chromosome, add a new telomere repeat (5'-GGTTAG-3') sequence, let go, realign the new 3'-end of telomere to the template, and repeat the process. (For an explanation on why this elongation is necessary see Telomere shortening.)

==Clinical implications==

===Aging===

The enzyme telomerase allows for replacement of short bits of DNA known as telomeres, which are otherwise shortened when a cell divides via mitosis.
In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides recursively, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit,[tpl]cite journal |author=Hayflick L, Moorhead PS |title=The serial cultivation of human diploid cell strains |journal=Exp Cell Res |volume=25 |pages=585–621 |year=1961 |pmid=13905658 |doi=10.1016/0014-4827(61)90192-6 |issue=3[/tpl] which is believed to be between 50–70 in a person’s lifetime.Siegel, L (2013). Are Telomeres the Key to Aging and Cancer? Learn. Genetics.  The University of Utah. Retrieved 30 September 2013 from http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/traits/telomeres/. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth.[tpl]cite journal | author = Hanahan D & Weinberg RA | title = Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation | journal = Cell | volume = 144 | issue = 5 | pages = 646–74 |date=March 2011 | pmid = 21376230 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013 [/tpl]
Embryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly especially in male germ cells but also in activated lymphocytes and certain adult stem cells, whereas other somatic cells do not express it.[tpl]cite journal | author = Cong YS | title = Human Telomerase and It's Regulation | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 407-425 |date=2002 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.66.3.407-425.2002 [/tpl]
A variety of premature aging syndromes are associated with short telomeres.[tpl]cite journal | author = Blasco MA | title = Telomeres and human disease: ageing, cancer and beyond | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–22 |date=August 2005 | pmid = 16136653 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1656 [/tpl] These include Werner syndrome, Ataxia telangiectasia, Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome. However, the genes that have been mutated in these diseases all have roles in the repair of DNA damage and the increased DNA damage may, itself, be a factor in the premature aging (see DNA damage theory of aging). An additional role in maintaining telomere length is an active area of investigation.
However, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length of different mammalian species correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and it was concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE (2011). Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination. Aging Cell 10(5):761-768. doi: 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x. PMID 21518243  Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain.Cherif H, Tarry JL, Ozanne SE, Hales CN (2003). Ageing and telomeres: a study into organ- and gender-specific telomere shortening. Nucleic Acids Res 31(5):1576-1583. PMID 12595567 In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23 –74.Renault V, Thornell LE, Eriksson PO, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V (2002). Regenerative potential of human skeletal muscle during aging.  Aging Cell 1(2):132-139. Thorne Lars-Eric to Thornell Lars-Eric. PMID 12882343 In the baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age.Jeyapalan JC, Ferreira M, Sedivy JM, Herbig U (2007). Accumulation of senescent cells in mitotic tissue of aging primates. Mech Ageing Dev 128(1):36-44. PMID 17116315 Thus, telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle. In human liver, cholangiocytes and hepatocytes show no age-related telomere shortening.Verma S, Tachtatzis P, Penrhyn-Lowe S, Scarpini C, Jurk D, Von Zglinicki T, Coleman N, Alexander GJ (2012). Sustained telomere length in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes with increasing age in normal liver. Hepatology 56(4):1510-1520. doi: 10.1002/hep.25787. PMID 22504828 Furthermore, Harris et al. found little evidence that, in humans, telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal aging with respect to important cognitive and physical abilities.Harris SE, Martin-Ruiz C, von Zglinicki T, Starr JM, Deary IJ (2012). Telomere length and aging biomarkers in 70-year-olds: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.  Neurobiol Aging 33(7):1486.e3-8.  PMID 21194798
Some experiments have raised questions on whether telomerase can be used as an anti-aging therapy, namely, the fact that mice with elevated levels of telomerase have higher cancer incidence and hence do not live longer. Certain premature aging syndromes have been associated with telomere shortening. But telomerase also favors tumorogenesis, which leads to questions about its potential as an anti-aging therapy.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Magalhães JP, Toussaint O | title = Telomeres and telomerase: a modern fountain of youth? | journal = Rejuvenation Res | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15312299 | doi = 10.1089/1549168041553044 [/tpl] On the other hand, one study showed that activating telomerase in cancer-resistant mice by overexpressing its catalytic subunit extended lifespan.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tomás-Loba A, Flores I, Fernández-Marcos PJ, Cayuela ML, Maraver A, Tejera A, Borrás C, Matheu A, Klatt P, Flores JM, Viña J, Serrano M, Blasco MA | title = Telomerase reverse transcriptase delays aging in cancer-resistant mice | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = 609–22 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 19013273 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.034 [/tpl] The potential remains for telomerase activators to contribute to the development of cancer.
Exposure of T lymphocytes from HIV-infected human donors to a small molecule telomerase activator (TAT2) retards telomere shortening, increases proliferative potential, and, what is highly significant, enhances cytokine/chemokine production and antiviral activity.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fauce SR, Jamieson BD, Chin AC, Mitsuyasu RT, Parish ST, Ng HL, Kitchen CM, Yang OO, Harley CB, Effros RB | title = Telomerase-Based Pharmacologic Enhancement of Antiviral Function of Human CD8+ T Lymphocytes | journal = J.

A study that focused on Ashkenazi Jews found that those that live the longest inherit a hyperactive version of telomerase that rebuilds telomeres.[tpl]cite journal | author = Atzmon G, Cho M, Cawthon RM, Budagov T, Katz M, Yang X, Siegel G, Bergman A, Huffman DM, Schechter CB, Wright WE, Shay JW, Barzilai N, Govindaraju DR, Suh Y | title = Genetic variation in human telomerase is associated with telomere length in Ashkenazi centenarians | journal = Proc.

Mice engineered to block the gene that produces telomerase, unless they are given a certain drug, aged at a much faster rate and died at about six months, instead of reaching the average mouse lifespan of about three years.  Administering the drug at 6 months turned on telomerase production and caused their organs to be "rejuvenated," restored fertility, and normalized their ability to detect or process odors. The finding raises hope for treatment of conditions such as progeria and other accelerated aging disorders, as well as possible organ regeneration therapies, such as repair of liver damage due to hepatitis or alcoholism.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jaskelioff M, Muller FL, Paik JH, Thomas E, Jiang S, Adams AC, Sahin E, Kost-Alimova M, Protopopov A, Cadiñanos J, Horner JW, Maratos-Flier E, Depinho RA | title = Telomerase reactivation reverses tissue degeneration in aged telomerase deficient mice | journal = Nature | volume = 469| issue = 7328| pages = 102–6|date=November 2010 | pmid = 21113150 | doi = 10.1038/nature09603 | laysummary = http://news.discovery.com/animals/mouse-engineered-to-grow-younger.html#mkcpgn=emnws1 | laysource = news.discovery.com | pmc=3057569[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12207953 | work=BBC News | title=Stop, rewind: the scientists slowing the ageing process | date=2011-01-26[/tpl]

===Cancer===

When cells are approaching the Hayflick limit in cell cultures, the time to senescence can be extended by the inactivation of the tumor suppressor proteins - p53 and Retinoblastoma protein (pRb)[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]. Cells that have been so-altered will eventually undergo an event termed a "crisis" when the majority of the cells in the culture die. Sometimes, a cell does not stop dividing once it reaches crisis. In a typical situation, the telomeres are shortened,[tpl]cite book|last=Skloot|first=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|year=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-5218-9|pages=216, 217[/tpl] and the integrity of the chromosomes declines with every subsequent cell division. Exposed chromosome ends are interpreted as double-stranded breaks (DSB) in DNA; such damage is usually repaired by reattaching (religating) the broken ends together. When the cell does this due to telomere-shortening, the ends of different chromosomes can be attached together. This temporarily solves the problem of lacking telomeres; but, during anaphase of cell division, the fused chromosomes are randomly ripped apart, causing many mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. As this process continues, the cell's genome becomes unstable. Eventually, either sufficient damage will be done to the cell's chromosomes such that cell dies (via programmed cell death, apoptosis), or an additional mutation that activates telomerase will take place.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
With the activation of telomerase, some types of cells and their offspring become immortal; that is, their chromosomes will not become unstable no matter how many cell divisions they undergo (they bypass the Hayflick limit), thus avoiding cell death as long as the conditions for their duplication are met. Many cancer cells are considered 'immortal' because telomerase activity allows them to divide virtually forever, which is why they can form tumors. A good example of cancer cells' immortality is HeLa cells, which have been used in laboratories as a model cell line since 1951.
While this method of modeling human cancer in cell culture is effective and has been used for many years by scientists, it is also very imprecise. The exact changes that allow for the formation of the tumorigenic clones in the above-described experiment are not clear. Scientists have subsequently been able to address this question by the serial introduction of several mutations present in a variety of human cancers. This has led to the understanding of several combinations of mutations that are sufficient for the formation of tumorigenic cells, in a variety of cell types. While the combination varies depending on the cell type, a common theme is that the following alterations are required: activation of TERT, loss of p53 pathway function, loss of pRb pathway function, activation of the Ras or myc proto-oncogenes, and aberration of the PP2A protein phosphatase.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] That is to say, the cell has an activated telomerase, eliminating the process of death by chromosome instability or loss, absence of apoptosis-induction pathways, and continued activation of mitosis.
This model of cancer in cell culture accurately describes the role of telomerase in actual human tumors. Telomerase activation has been observed in ~90% of all human tumors,[tpl]cite journal | author = Shay JW, Bacchetti S | title = A survey of telomerase activity in human cancer | journal = Eur. J. Cancer | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 787–91 |date=April 1997 | pmid = 9282118 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-8049(97)00062-2 | url =  [/tpl] suggesting that the immortality conferred by telomerase plays a key role in cancer development. Of the tumors that have not activated TERT,[tpl]cite journal | author = Bryan TM, Englezou A, Gupta J, Bacchetti S, Reddel RR | title = Telomere elongation in immortal human cells without detectable telomerase activity | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 14 | issue = 17 | pages = 4240–8 |date=September 1995 | pmid = 7556065 | pmc = 394507 | doi = | url =  [/tpl] most have found a separate pathway to maintain telomere length termed ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres).[tpl]cite journal | author = Henson JD, Neumann AA, Yeager TR, Reddel RR | title = Alternative lengthening of telomeres in mammalian cells | journal = Oncogene | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 598–610 |date=January 2002 | pmid = 11850785 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1205058 | url =  [/tpl] The exact mechanism behind telomere maintenance in the ALT pathway has not been made clear, but likely involves multiple recombination events at the telomere.
There have been two telomerase vaccines developed: GRNVAC1 and GV1001. GRNVAC1 isolates dendritic cells and the RNA that codes for the telomerase protein and puts it back into the patient to make the cytotoxic T cells kill the telomerase-active cells. GV1001 comes from the active site of hTERT and is recognized by the immune system and subsequently reacts by killing the telomerase-active cells.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tian|first=X|author2=B Chen|author3= X Liu|title=Telomere and Telomerase as Targets for Cancer Therapy|journal=Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology|date=March 2013|volume=160|issue=5|pmid=17310277[/tpl]

===Additional roles in cancer, heart disease, diabetes and quality of life===

Additional roles for telomerase per work by Elizabeth Blackburn et al., include the upregulation of 70 genes known or suspected in cancers' growth and spread through the body, and the activation of glycolysis, which enables cancer cells to rapidly use sugar to facilitate their programmed growth rate (roughly the growth rate of a fetus).[tpl]cite journal | author = Blackburn EH | title = Telomeres and telomerase: their mechanisms of action and the effects of altering their functions | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 579 | issue = 4 | pages = 859–62 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15680963 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2004.11.036 | url =  [/tpl]

Elizabeth Blackburn et al. UCSF has shown work that reveals that mothers caring for their very sick children have shorter telomeres when they report that their emotional stress is at the greatest point.  She also found telomerase active at the site of blockages in coronary artery tissue.  This could be why heart attacks can come on so suddenly: Telomerase is driving the growth of the blockage.
In 2009, it was shown that the amount of telomerase activity significantly increased due to psychological stress. Across the sample of patients telomerase activity increased by 18% one hour after the end of the stress. Telomerase activity was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2009.11.018 |author=Epel ES, Lin J, Dhabhar FS, Wolkowitz OM, Puterman E, Karan L, Blackburn EH |title=Dynamics of telomerase activity in response to acute psychological stress |journal=Brain Behav Immun |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=531–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20018236 |pmc=2856774[/tpl]

Patients with DC have severe bone marrow failure manifesting as abnormal skin pigmentation, leucoplakia (a white thickening of the oral mucosa), and nail dystrophy, as well as a variety of other symptoms.  Individuals with either TERC or DKC1 mutations have shorter telomeres and defective telomerase activity in vitro than other individuals of the same age.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marrone A, Walne A, Dokal I | title = Dyskeratosis congenita: telomerase, telomeres and anticipation | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics & Development | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–57 |date=June 2005 | pmid = 15917199 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2005.04.004 | url =  [/tpl]
There has also been one family in which autosomal dominant DC has been linked to a heterozygous mutation in TERT.[tpl]cite journal | author = Armanios M, Chen JL, Chang YP, Brodsky RA, Hawkins A, Griffin CA, Eshleman JR, Cohen AR, Chakravarti A, Hamosh A, Greider CW | title = Haploinsufficiency of telomerase reverse transcriptase leads to anticipation in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita | journal = Proc.

===Telomerase as a potential drug target===

The immune system has trouble recognizing cancer {an exceedingly facile statement}. Telomerase is necessary for the immortality of so many cancer types, and so it is thought to be a potential drug target[tpl]By whom|date=January 2013[/tpl]. If a drug can be used to turn off telomerase in cancer cells, the above process of telomere-shortening will resume—telomere length will be lost as the cells continue to divide, mutations will occur and cell stability will decrease[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl].
Experimental drug and vaccine therapies targeting active telomerase have been tested in mouse models, and some have now entered early clinical trials[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Geron Corporation is currently conducting four human clinical trials involving telomerase inhibition and telomerase vaccination[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Merck, as a licensee of Geron, has recent approval of an IND for one vaccine type[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. The vaccine platform is being tested (and now jointly with Merck) using three different approaches[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. One vaccine is adenovirus/plasmid based (Merck IND). The second is an autologous dendritic cell based vaccine (GRNVAC1), formerly called TVAX when tested in Phase I clinical trials in Prostate Cancer, and it showed significant PSA doubling times as well as T-cell response[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Geron's embryonic stem cell derived dendritic cell vaccine targeting telomerase is the third approach and is currently at the pre-clinical stage[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl].
These vaccine methods attempt to teach the human immune system to attack cancer cells expressing telomerase[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Geron's telomerase inhibitor drug (GRN163L) attempts to stop cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting telomerase and it is in three separate early stage human clinical trials[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. Indeed, telomerase inhibition in many types of cancer cells grown in culture has led to the massive death of the cell population[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]. However, a variety of caveats, including the presence of the ALT pathway, complicate such therapies. Some have reported ALT methods of telomere maintenance and storage of DNA in cancer stem cells, however Geron claims to have killed cancer stem cells with their telomerase inhibitor GRN163L at Johns Hopkins. GRN163L binds directly to the RNA template of telomerase. Even a mutation of the RNA template of telomerase would render the telomerase unable to extend telomeres, and therefore not be able to grant replicative immortality to cancer, not allow glycolysis to be inititated, and not upregulate Blackburn's 70 cancer genes. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Since Blackburn has shown that most of the harmful cancer-related effects of telomerase are dependent on an intact RNA template[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl], it seems a very worthwhile target for drug development[tpl]POV-statement|date=January 2013[/tpl]. If indeed some cancer stem cells use an alternative method of telomere maintenance, it should be noted that they are still killed when the RNA template of telomerase is blocked.
According to Blackburn's opinion at most of her lectures, it is a big mistake to think that telomerase is involved with only extending telomeres. Stopping glycolysis in cancer stem cells and preventing the upregulation of 70 bad genes is probably what is killing cancer stem cells if they are using alternative methods.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
