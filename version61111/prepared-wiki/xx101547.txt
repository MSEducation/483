CATEGORIES: Publications associated with the University of Cambridge, Student newspapers published in the United Kingdom

Clareification is the weekly student newsletter of Clare College, a college of the University of Cambridge. One of the things that distinguishes Clare as a particularly friendly and informal college is the fellows' tolerance of the publication, even after the 2007 Muhammad cartoons controversy. Every week in term, Cambridge traditions are mocked, events of the weeks are satirised and silly student antics are reported on. The newsletter also chronicles college gossip in a column written by the Gossip Queen entitled Clareifornication.
Clareification evolved gradually in the mid-late 1990s as a newsletter of the Union of Clare Students. Named as a pun on the college's name, it was padded out with comedy articles, gradually turning into a weekly 8-page comedy paper with only the occasional piece of real news. Spoof formattings of real-life newspapers and magazines are common. It is widely read by Clare students, but academic opinion of it is sharply divided.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
In 2005, it won the 'Best College Paper' award in The Cambridge Student.
The current editors-in-chief are Euan Holmes, Morven Macaulay and Lizzie Walsh.

==Controversy==

In 2007, in a guest-edited edition devoted to religious satire, entitled Crucification, the magazine re-printed one of the Danish Muhammad cartoons which provoked an international incident when they were originally published 15 months earlier. 
The guest editor was taken into hiding due to the threat of violent reprisals http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2011340,00.html.  The college's senior tutor, Dr Patricia Fara, issued a statement saying, "The college finds the publication and the views expressed abhorrent." The college called a Court of Discipline to judge the student and suspended the newsletter's funding. The Cambridge Evening News described the issue as "racist" http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/city/2007/02/09/ef79ee97-fec1-4f00-babf-dbd17447b40b.lpf, in an article in which an "insider" suggested that the magazine might constitute "racial incitement". Two students were subsequently interviewed under caution by police in connection with the issue. http://www.indexonline.org/en/news/articles/2007/1/clare-college-students-questioned.shtml 
Following the incident, the Union of Clare Students published independently two further issues, predominantly devoted to satirising the coverage of the controversy. These issues were edited by the Union of Clare Students Executive.
