KKAM signed on in 1953 as a Class IV AM station with the call letters KDUB. KFYO originally occupied the 1340 frequency in Lubbock, but moved to 790 AM in January 1953. Other call letters used in KKAM's history include KLBK, KMKM and KFMX.  
KKAM became Lubbock's first All-Sports radio station in November 1996, segueing from a News/Talk/Sports/Ag News format. The station was branded 'SportsRadio 1340 KKAM'. Personalities that have worked at KKAM throughout its history include Ryan Hyatt, Mark Finkner, Jack Dale, Steve Dale, Don Williams (from the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal), Scott Fitzgerald, Johnny May, Paul R. Beane, Bill Maddux, Jim Stewart and Misty. 
KKAM became the flagship radio station for Texas Tech Football, Men's Basketball and Baseball in the 1994-95 athletic season, through Loyd Senn's All Sports Radio Network (ASRN).  The change ended the streak established by KFYO as the Texas Tech's flagship radio station, that was started with its first broadcast of Texas Tech Football in the 1940s. During KKAM's tenure as the Texas Tech flagship football games were simulcast on KFMX and Men's Basketball games simulcast on 99.5 FM, the present-day KQBR. SportsRadio 1340 remained the flagship radio station for Texas Tech Football, Men's Basketball and Baseball through the 2008-09 athletic season.
On May 4, 2009 SportsRadio 1340 rebranded itself SportsRadio 1340 The Fan and added Dan Patrick, Jim Rome and Tony Bruno to the daily lineup. On May 28, 2009 SportsRadio 1340 The Fan changed network affiliations from ESPN to Sporting News Radio. In February 2013, SportsRadio 1340 The Fan changed network affiliations again, switching from Yahoo! Sports Radio to CBS Sports Radio. The Dan Patrick Show and Jack Dale's Sportsline, hosted by Steve Dale, remained a part of the daily lineup.
