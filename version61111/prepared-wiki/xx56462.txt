Carpenteria californica [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɑr|p|ən|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə|_|ˌ|k|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɔr|n|ɨ|k|ə[/tpl],Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 the sole species in the genus Carpenteria, is a flowering evergreen shrub native to California. It is closely related to the genus Philadelphus. Common names include tree anemone and bush anemone.
It is a rare species, endemic to only seven sites in Fresno and Madera Counties, where it grows in chaparral between [tpl]convert|340|-|1340|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] altitude between the San Joaquin and King rivers. It is well adapted to wildfire, reproducing by stump sprouts after burning; natural seedlings are rare. 
It grows to [tpl]convert|1|-|3|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall, with flaky bark on older stems. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, 4–10 cm long and 1-2.5 cm broad, glossy green above, blue-green to whitish and downy beneath. The flowers are 3–7 cm diameter, with 5-8 pure white petals and a cluster of yellow stamens; flowering is from late spring to mid summer. The fruit is a leathery capsule 6–12 mm diameter, containing numerous seeds.
It is a popular ornamental plant in gardens with Mediterranean climates, grown for its decorative flowers; it is now much more common in cultivation than in the wild. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Bodnant', a cold-tolerant cultivar hardy to [tpl]convert|-15|C[/tpl] in the British Isles, and 'Ladham's' with large flowers.
The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=332
