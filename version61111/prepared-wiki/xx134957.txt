Other technical data include:
The MM-A920 was introduced in late 2005 around the same time as the MM-A900 (which was Samsung's first attempt to compete with the Motorola RAZR), and was fairly well received by critics upon its release. At that time, Sprint reps were recommending the A920 over the A900, due to a variety of glitches experienced by early A900 users. While the phone has bluetooth connectivity, many users have complained that it is crippled, allowing only certain types of devices to be used, and is unable to 
transfer files.
The Samsung MM-A920 ceased production in 2007.
