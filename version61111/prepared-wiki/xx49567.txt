Myst is a graphic adventure puzzle video game designed and directed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. It was developed by Cyan (now Cyan Worlds) and published by Brøderbund. The Millers began working on Myst in [tpl]vgy|1991[/tpl] and released it for the Mac OS computer on September 24, 1993; it was developer Cyan's largest project to date. Remakes and ports of the game have been released for Sega Saturn, PlayStation, 3DO, Microsoft Windows, Atari Jaguar CD, CD-i, AmigaOS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Nintendo 3DS.
Myst puts the player in the role of the Stranger, who uses a special book to travel to the island of Myst. There, the player uses other special books written by an artisan and explorer named Atrus to travel to several worlds known as "Ages". Clues found in each of these Ages help to reveal the back-story of the game's characters. The game has several endings, depending on the course of action the player takes.
Upon release, Myst was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in the fictional world. The game was the best-selling PC game until The Sims exceeded its sales in [tpl]vgy|2002[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-overtakes-myst/1100-2857556/|title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2014-04-27 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=GameSpot[/tpl] Myst helped drive adoption of the then-nascent CD-ROM format. Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay of Myst consists of a first-person journey through an interactive world. The player moves the character by clicking on locations shown on the screen; the scene then crossfades into another frame, and the player can continue to explore. Players can interact with specific objects on some screens by clicking or dragging them.[tpl]cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=Brøderbund|year=1993|edition=Windows version|pages=5–6|series="Manipulating Objects"[/tpl] To assist in rapidly crossing areas already explored, Myst has an optional "Zip" feature. When a lightning bolt cursor appears, players can click and skip several frames to another location. While this provides a rapid method of travel, it can also cause players to miss important items and clues.[tpl]cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=Brøderbund|year=1993|edition=Windows version|page=9|series="Zip Mode"[/tpl] Some items can be carried by the player and read, including journal pages which provide backstory. Players can only carry a single page at a time, and pages return to their original locations when dropped.[tpl]cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=Brøderbund|year=1993|edition=Windows version|page=13|series="Options Menu"[/tpl]
To complete the game, the player must explore the seemingly deserted island of Myst.[tpl]cite journal|author=Carroll, John|date=August 1994|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.08/myst_pr.html|title=Guerrillas in the Myst|journal=Wired|volume=2|issue=8[/tpl] There the player discovers and follows clues to be transported via "linking books" to several "Ages", each of which is a self-contained mini-world. Each of the Ages—named Selenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood—requires the user to solve a series of logical, interrelated puzzles to complete its exploration. Objects and information discovered in one Age may be required to solve puzzles in another Age, or to complete the game's primary puzzle on Myst. For example, in order to activate a switch, players must first open a safe and use the matches found within to start a boiler.
Apart from its predominantly nonverbal storytelling, Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player is provided with very little backstory at the beginning of the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, no physical violence, and no threat of "dying" at any point, although it is possible to reach a few "losing" endings. There is no time limit to complete the game. The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.

==Plot==

Players assume the role of an unnamed person known as the Stranger, who stumbles across an unusual book titled "Myst". The Stranger reads the book and discovers a detailed description of an island world called Myst. Placing his hand on the last page, the Stranger is whisked away to the world described, and is left with no choice but to explore the island.[tpl]cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=Brøderbund|year=1993|edition=Windows version|page=2|series=[/tpl] Myst contains a library where two additional books can be found, colored red and blue. These books are traps that hold Sirrus and Achenar, the sons of Atrus, who once lived on Myst island with his wife Catherine. Atrus writes special "linking books" that transport people to the worlds, or "Ages", that the books describe. From the panels of their books, Sirrus and Achenar both tell the Stranger that Atrus is dead, Sirrus hypothesizing that he must have died since he hasn't returned from looking for evidence against them, while Achenar claims Sirrus murdered him. Both plead for the Stranger to help them escape. However, the books are missing several pages, so the sons' messages are at first unclear, and riddled with static.
As the Stranger continues to explore the island, more books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then be placed in the corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can speak more clearly. Each brother maintains that the other brother cannot be trusted. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth page is hidden. If the Stranger gives either brother their fifth page, they will be free. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.[tpl]cite web|author=Poole, Stephen|date=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/myst_gg/index.html|title=Myst Game Guide|publisher=GameSpot|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000313005946/http://www.gamespot.com/features/myst_gg/index.html|archivedate=2000-03-13|accessdate=2009-02-08[/tpl]
Both brothers beg the Stranger not to touch the green book that is stored in the same location as their last pages. They claim that it is a book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.

It seemed having that depth was just as important as what the explorer would actually see.|source=—Rand Miller, on developing Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s fictional history[/tpl]
Work on Myst began in 1991.[tpl]cite web|author=Yoshida, Emily|date=2013-09-26|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9713372/looking-back-game-myst-20th-anniversary|title=Lost to the Ages|work=Grantland|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2013-09-26|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6JvoME936|archivedate=2013-09-26[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Rabin|first=Steve|title=Introduction to game development|date=June 2005|volume=1|page=26|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-58450-377-7[/tpl] The game's creative team consisted of the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator, Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and Ryan Miller, who together made up Cyan, Inc. The company had previously only made children's games. Myst was conceived by the brothers as a challenging but aesthetically simple game that would appeal to adults; Myst was not only the largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop.[tpl]cite book|title=Myst User Manual|publisher=Brøderbund|author=Cyan, Inc.|year=1993|edition=Windows version|page=15|series="About the Authors"|authorlink=Cyan Worlds[/tpl] According to Rand Miller, the brothers spent months solely designing the look and puzzles of the Ages,[tpl]cite video|people=Miller, Rand and Robyn; Cyan|date=1993|title=The Making of Myst| publisher=Cyan, Inc./Brøderbund|medium=CD-ROM[/tpl] which were influenced by earlier whimsical "worlds" made for children.[tpl]cite web|author=Stern, Gloria|date=1994-08-23|url=http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/myst.htm|title=Through the Myst|publisher=WorldVillage.com|accessdate=2014-04-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090217214159/http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/myst.htm|archivedate=2009-02-17[/tpl] According to the creators, the game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne.
At first, the developers had no idea how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages. Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed Myst to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating "A lot can be done with texture…Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don't necessarily notice, but if they weren't there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake."[tpl]cite journal|author=Gillen, Marilyn|title=Interactive Gamers Try to Follow Enveloping 'Myst'|journal=Billboard|volume=1|date=1994-07-09|page=100[/tpl]
Much of the early development time was spent devising puzzles and the Ages, but the story was secondary; "we were place designers ... and the maps kind of fueled the story," Rand said.
The game was created on Macintosh computers, principally Macintosh Quadras. The graphics were individual shots of fully rendered rooms. Overall, Myst contains 2,500 frames, one for each possible area the player can explore. Each scene was modeled and rendered in StrataVision 3D, with some additional modeling in Macromedia MacroModel. The images were then edited and enhanced using Photoshop 1.0.
The original Macintosh version of Myst was constructed in HyperCard. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and HyperTalk scripts, with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, Myst functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD-ROM drive read speeds, Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit PICT resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with Cinepak compression; in total, there were more than 66 minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like truecolor images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500 KB to around 80 KB.

===Audio===

Chris Brandkamp produced most of the ambient and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to wait until the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.
At first, Myst had no music, because the Millers did not want music to interfere with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, "seemed to really help the mood of certain places that you were at in the game." Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of synthesized music that was used in the game and later published as Myst: The Soundtrack. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s sequel, Riven, Virgin Records acquired the rights to release the soundtrack,[tpl]cite news|author=Thomas, David|date=1998-05-08|title=Mastermind of Myst, Riven also has a talent for music|publisher=The Denver Post[/tpl] and the CD was rereleased on April 21, 1998.[tpl]cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Tim|title=Myst: The Sequel to Myst|publisher=Allmusic|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r347826|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|accessdate=2010-01-13[/tpl]

==Reception==

Myst was commercially successful on release. Along with The 7th Guest, it was widely regarded as a killer application that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives.[tpl]cite web|date=2000-08-01|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/082/082913p1.html|title=PC Retroview: Myst|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-04-21[/tpl] The game's success also led to a number of games which sought to copy Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s success, referred to as "Myst clones". Myst was the bestselling PC game throughout the 1990s, until The Sims exceeded its sales in 2002. The PC version of Myst holds an average score of 82.57% at GameRankings based on seven reviews, although the subsequent remakes of the game and the console ports have generally received lower average scores. Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s success baffled some who wondered how a game some saw as "little more than 'an interactive slide show'" turned out to be a hit.[tpl]cite web|author=Miller, Laura|date=1997-11-06|url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1997/11/cov_06riven.html|title=Riven Rapt|work=Salon|accessdate=2008-05-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080402053903/http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1997/11/cov_06riven.html |archivedate=2008-04-02[/tpl]
Myst was generally praised by critics. Wired and The New York Times suggested that Myst was evidence that video games could in fact evolve into an art form.[tpl]cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-03-12[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly reported that some players considered Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s "virtual morality" a religious experience.[tpl]cite web|author=Daly, Steve|date=1994-10-07|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303937,00.html|title=The Land of 'Myst' Opportunity|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl] Aarhus University professor Søren Pold pointed to Myst as an excellent example of how stories can be told using objects rather than people.[tpl]cite web|author=Pold, Søren|url=http://imv.au.dk/~pold/publikat/writcode.htm|title=Writing With the Code - a Digital Poetics|publisher=Aarhus University|accessdate=2008-04-15[/tpl] Laura Evenson, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, pointed to adult-oriented games like Myst as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its "adolescent" phase.[tpl]cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36[/tpl]
GameSpot's Jeff Sengstack wrote that "Myst is an immersive experience that draws you in and won't let you go."[tpl]cite web|author=Sengstack, Jeff|date=1996-05-01|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/myst-review/1900-2542724/|title=Myst for PC Review|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2014-04-27[/tpl] Writing about Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s reception, Greg M. Smith noted that Myst had become a hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling "the hoary technology of the slideshow (with accompanying music and effects)".[tpl]cite book|author=Smith, Greg|year=2002|title=Hop on Pop: The Pleasures and Politics of Popular Culture|series=Navigating Myst-y Landscapes: Killer Applications and Hybrid Criticism|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-2737-6[/tpl] Smith concluded that "Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s primary brilliance lies in the way it provides narrative justification for the very things that are most annoying" about the technological constraints imposed on the game; for instance, Macworld praised Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game.[tpl]cite journal|author=Beekman, George and Ben|date=March 1994|title=Myst 1.0|journal=Macworld|page=76[/tpl] The publication went on to declare Myst the best game of 1994, stating that Myst removed the "most annoying parts of adventure games — vocabularies that you don't understand, people you can't talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over. You try to unravel the enigma of the island by exploring the island, but there's no time pressure to distract you, no arbitrary punishments put in your way".[tpl]cite journal|author=Levy, Steven|title=1994 Macintosh Game Hall of Fame|journal=Macworld|date=January 1995|volume=12|issue=1|pages=100–106[/tpl]
Some aspects of the game still received criticism. Several publications did not agree with the positive reception of the story; Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com noted that while Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, it helped usher in the death of the adventure game genre.[tpl]cite web|author=Parrish, Jeremy|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134600|title=When SCUMM Ruled the Earth|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl] Edge stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics. Heidi Fournier of Adventure Gamers noted a few critics complained about the difficulty and lack of context of the puzzles, while others believed these elements added to the gameplay.[tpl]cite web|author=Fournier , Heidi|date=2002-05-20|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/17473|title=Myst: Review|publisher=Adventure Gamers|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] Similarly, critics were split on whether the lack of a plot the player could actually change was a good or bad element.[tpl]cite journal|author=Smith, Andy|date=March 1998|title=Amiga Reviews Myst|journal=Amiga Format|url=http://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/myst.htm|issue=108|pages=35–37[/tpl] In a 2000 retrospective review, IGN declared that Myst had not aged well and that playing it "was like watching hit TV shows from the 70s. 'People watched that?,' you wonder in horror."

===Legacy===

In addition to the numerous remakes and ports of the game, Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s success led to several sequels. Riven was released on October 29, 1997, in which Atrus asks the Stranger to return to help him rescue his wife from Gehn. Myst III: Exile was released simultaneously for Macintosh and Windows systems in North America on May 7, 2001, and was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. Exile was not developed by Cyan; Presto Studios developed the title and Ubisoft published it.[tpl]cite web|date=2001-04-05|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/093/093192p1.html|title=News Briefs: Halo rumors fly, Tribes 2 event on Saturday, and no TF2 at E3?|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-05-03[/tpl] Taking place 10 years after the events of Riven, Exile reveals the reasons for Atrus' sons being imprisoned and the disastrous effects their greed caused.[tpl]cite web|date=2001-05-02|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/094/094134p1.html|title=New Myst III Trailer|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-04-12[/tpl] The fourth entry in the series, Myst IV: Revelation, was released on September 10, 2004, and was developed and published entirely by Ubisoft.

A parody computer game, Pyst, was released in 1996. The game does not exhibit any puzzles, but rather a satirical free roam of Myst island which had been apparently vandalized by frustrated visitors.

==Re-releases and ports==

Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s success led to the game being ported to multiple platforms, including the Saturn, PlayStation, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, iPhone, Nintendo 3DS, Jaguar CD, AmigaOS, CD-i, and 3DO consoles.

===PC remakes===

Myst: Masterpiece Edition was an updated version of the original Myst, released in May 2000. It featured several improvements over the original game, with the images re-rendered in 24-bit truecolor instead of the original Myst[tpl]'[/tpl]s 8-bit color. The score was re-mastered and sound effects were enhanced, and some cinematics were redone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=196|year=2000|publisher=Ubisoft|title=Myst: Masterpiece Edition|accessdate=2008-05-02[/tpl]
realMyst: Interactive 3D Edition was a remake of Myst released in November 2000 for Windows PCs, and in January 2002 for Mac. Unlike Myst and the Masterpiece Edition, realMyst featured free-roaming, real-time 3D graphics instead of pre-rendered stills.[tpl]cite web|author=Walker, Trey|date=2000-10-20|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/realmyst/news.html?sid=2643165&mode=recent|title=Real Myst Shipping in Early November|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2008-05-07[/tpl] Weather effects like thunderstorms, sunsets, and sunrises were added to the Ages, and minor additions were made to keep the game in sync with the story of the Myst novels and sequels. The game also added a new Age called Rime, which is featured in an extended ending. realMyst was developed by Cyan, Inc. and Sunsoft, and published by Ubisoft. While the new interactivity of the game was praised, realMyst ran extremely slowly on most computers of the time.[tpl]cite web|date=2000-11-13|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/165/165612p1.html|title=RealMyst Review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl] Robyn Miller expressed frustration with realMyst, saying: "I only saw realMyst after it was released. As a remake, it was a lapse of reason and directionless; overt merchandising of the original Myst. It definitely wasn't how we originally envisioned Myst, as was promoted."[tpl]cite book |title=retro GAMER Collection Volume Five |year=2011 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth, UK |isbn=978-1-908222-09-1 |page=130[/tpl]

The remake would include additional content that was not featured in the original Myst, including the Rime age that was earlier seen in realMyst.[tpl]cite web|date=2005-11-22|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/670/670041p1.html|title= Myst Set for PSP|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-03-29[/tpl] The game was released in Japan and Europe in 2006, and the US version was released in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/objects/786/786203.html|title=Myst (PSP)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2014-04-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120204101149/http://psp.ign.com/objects/786/786203.html|archivedate=2012-02-04[/tpl]
A version of Myst for the Nintendo DS was also released in December 2007. The version features re-mastered video and audio, using source code specifically re-written for the Nintendo DS. The remake features Rime as a playable Age, with an all new graphic set.[tpl]cite web |author=Purchese, Rob|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77459 |title=Myst heads to DS |publisher=Eurogamer |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-06-07[/tpl] This version of the game was released in Europe on December 7, 2007, courtesy of Midway. It was released in North America on May 13, 2008, originally published by Navarre and later reissued by Storm City Games.
