==Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory and Temasek==

Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) was founded in 2002 and funded by Temasek Trust, the philanthropic arm of Temasek. 

==Academic Programmes==

TLL offers various academic programmes at the tertiary level and is affiliated with the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University.
Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) offers an intensive PhD programme in Singapore that fosters productive scientific interactions between students, postdoctoral fellows, and PIs. Past candidates have had their work published in prestigious research journals and travelled widely to present their findings at international conferences. 
2. Internship Programmes[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.tll.org.sg/academics/internship-programs/|title = Home-Academics-Internship Programs[/tpl]
Research Attachment Programme (REAP)
The Research Attachment Programme (REAP) is jointly organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), National University of Singapore (NUS) and TLL to groom local life sciences research talents.
The eight-week programme is designed for first-year Biology and Chemistry students in local junior colleges (JCs) to encourage these budding young science students to pursue a career in life sciences in future by stimulating their interest with hands-on training in research environment and interactions with professional scientists.
Undergraduate Programme (UTP)[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.tll.org.sg/academics/internship-programs/undergraduate-training-program-utp/|title = Home - Academics - Internship Programs - Undergraduate Training Program[/tpl]
The Undergraduate Programme (UTP) promotes scientific exchange and research collaboration between TLL and the top-tier China and India universities, where final year undergraduates are given the opportunity to execute research projects at TLL for 3 to 4 months. 
Graduate Attachment Programme (GAP)[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.tll.org.sg/academics/internship-programs/graduate-attachment-program-gap/|title = Home- Academics-Internship Programs-Graduate Attachment Program[/tpl]
The Graduate Attachment Programme (GAP), which lasts for 3 to 6 months, exposes Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) fresh graduates to the R&D environment to encourage them to pursue a career in research.
Other Training
TLL also participates in the attachment programmes offered by Nanyang Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic,Singapore Polytechnic, and Temasek Polytechnic.

==Research Overview==

At Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL), 230 scientists from about 20 countries undertake basic and applied research in cellular,molecular, and genetic biology.
The research efforts aim to address both the immediate and long-term needs of the life sciences industry with a particular focus on cell biology, developmental biology, genomes structural biology and molecular pathogenesis. 
Notable research methodology includes the adaptation of a range of molecular and cell biology approaches and the use of computational data mining to understand the cellular mechanisms that underlie the development and physiology of plants, fungi and animals.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.tll.org.sg/research/research-overview/|title = Home- Research-Research Overview[/tpl]
One third of TLL’s research programmes is directed at practical research such as improving non-food biofuel sources and developing rapid diagnostic test kits, therapeutics and vaccines for emerging infectious diseases such as the H5N1 bird flu virus.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.temasek.com.sg/documents/report/downloads/20111110170650/Temasek%20Review%202007_Full.pdf|title = Temasek Review 2007- Creating Value[/tpl]
Under the PhD/Graduate Programme, TLL supervised 90 PhD candidates with their thesis research being carried out in various laboratories within TLL.

Notable Research Contributions
Medical
'Rapid diagnostic kits for the H5N1 Bird
Flu'
Since 2010, a TLL team has been conducting research into Avian Influenza virus (H5N1) after a worldwide epidemic bird flu outbreak in 2008. The research findings were patented and initial findings were published in the international journal, PLoS One, in June 2011. [tpl]Cite journal|title = A Novel Peptide ELISA for Universal Detection of Antibodies to Human H5N1 Influenza Viruses|date = June 10, 2011[/tpl]          
Hand, Food and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Vaccine Development
Since 2009, Professor Jimmy Kwang and his team have been conducting research into the Enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus—commonly known as Hand, Food and Mouth Disease—after Singapore experienced 30,000 cases in 2008, the largest epidemic at the time. The research findings were patented and initial findings were published in the international journal including PLoS One in July 2011 [tpl]Cite journal|title = Development of A Sensitive and Specific Epitope-Blocking ELISA for Universal Detection of Antibodies to Human Enterovirus 71 Strains|date = January 31, 2013[/tpl] and in Virology Journal on 1 March 2012.[tpl]Cite journal|title = RNA polymerase I-driven reverse genetics system for enterovirus 71 and its implications for vaccine production|date = October 17, 2012[/tpl]' 
Hand, Food and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Potential Vaccine Research'
A team led by Dr K B Chua, senior Public Health Pediatrician and Virologist, has identified the sensitive strains of the EV71 virus as a possible vaccine candidate after the discovery of its cold-adapted temperature sensitive strains which cause Hand, Food and Mouth Disease.
Cancer Treatment 
Dr Ian Cheong and his team have been developing a drug delivery approach with fewer side effects using Clostridium novyi-NT, a class of oxygen-sensitive bacteria,to deliver cancer treatment drugs directly to malignant tumours while leaving healthy cells intact.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.temasek.com.sg/documents/download/downloads/20120703190357/TR2012_Eng.pdf|title = Temasek Review 2012- Extending Pathways[/tpl]
Animal and Plant Cell Biology
Fish
In 2012, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and TLL received a S$10 million grant from the National Research Foundation to embark on a joint project to increase Singapore’s food fish production through aquaculture genomics R&D. The team aims to produce superior strains for both the Asian sea bass and Mozambique tilapia species that will have a significant impact on the productivity of food fish in Singapore and beyond.
Rice
In 2012, a joint TLL and National University of Singapore (NUS) team was awarded another S$10 million research grant for rice research, and partnered the International Rice Research Institute to develop new and improved varieties which can better adapt to plant diseases and climatic changes.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.temasek.com.sg/documents/download/downloads/20120703190357/TR2012_Eng.pdf|title = Temasek Review 2012- Extending Pathways[/tpl] The research team aims to develop new rice varieties with built-in protection against diseases, find efficient means to regulate water and fertiliser needs, and basically, devise smarter ways to sustain rice production and ensure long-term food security.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.nus.edu.sg/dpr/archived_news/rg198.html|title = Home- Research News- Enhancing Food Security through Rice Research[/tpl]
