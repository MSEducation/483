International business arrangements have led to the formation of multinational enterprises (MNE), companies that have a worldwide approach to markets and production or one with operations in more than one country. A MNE may also be called a multinational corporation (MNC) or transnational company (TNC). Well known MNCs include fast food companies such as McDonald's and Yum Brands, vehicle manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Toyota, consumer electronics companies like Samsung, LG and Sony, and energy companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP.  Most of the largest corporations operate in multiple national markets.
Businesses generally argue that survival in the new global marketplace requires companies to source goods, services, labor and materials overseas to continuously upgrade their products and technology in order to survive increased competition.[tpl]cite journal |last= Hitt |first= Michael A. |coauthors=Laszlo Tihanyi, Toyah Miller,  Brian L.

====International trade====

International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.dictionary.reference.com In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP). Industrialization, advanced transportation, multinational corporations, offshoring and outsourcing all have a major impact on world trade. The growth of international trade is a fundamental component of globalization.
An absolute trade advantage exists when countries can produce a commodity with less costs per unit produced than could its trading partner. By the same reasoning, it should import commodities in which it has an absolute disadvantage.[tpl]cite book |title= International economics: a European focus |last= Ingham |first= Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004 |publisher= Pearson Education |location= |isbn= 0-273-65507-8|page= 336 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=zIaS9R7HUGIC&printsec=frontcover#PPT37,M1 [/tpl]  While there are possible gains from trade with absolute advantage, comparative advantage – that is, the ability to offer goods and services at a lower marginal and opportunity cost – extends the range of possible mutually beneficial exchanges. In a globalized business environment, companies argue that the comparative advantages offered by international trade have become essential to remaining competitive.

=====Trade agreements, economic blocks and special trade zones=====

Establishment of free trade areas has become an essential feature of modern governments to handle preferential trading arrangements with foreign and multinational entities.[ref]
</ref>
A Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a geographical region that has economic and other laws that are more free-market-oriented than a country's typical or national laws. "Nationwide" laws may be suspended inside these special zones.  The category 'SEZ' covers many areas, including Free Trade Zones (FTZ), Export Processing Zones (EPZ), Free Zones (FZ), Industrial parks or Industrial Estates (IE), Free Ports, Urban Enterprise Zones and others. Usually the goal of a structure is to increase foreign direct investment by foreign investors, typically an international business or a multinational corporation (MNC). These are designated areas in which companies are taxed very lightly or not at all in order to encourage economic activity.  Free ports have historically been endowed with favorable customs regulations, e.g., the free port of Trieste. Very often free ports constitute a part of free economic zones.
A FTZ is an area within which goods may be landed, handled, manufactured or reconfigured, and reexported without the intervention of the customs authorities. Only when the goods are moved to consumers within the country in which the zone is located do they become subject to the prevailing customs duties. Free trade zones are organized around major seaports, international airports, and national frontiers – areas with many geographic advantages for trade.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/218417/free-trade-zone Definition of Free Trade Zone-Source-Britannica It is a region where a group of countries has agreed to reduce or eliminate trade barriers.[ref]
</ref>
A free trade area is a trade bloc whose member countries have signed a free-trade agreement, which eliminates tariffs, import quotas, and preferences on most (if not all) goods and services traded between them. If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade area, it would also be considered an open border.  The European Union, for example, a confederation of 27 member states, provides both a free trade area and an open border.
Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan and Egypt. They are a special free trade zones established in collaboration with neighboring Israel to take advantage of the free trade agreements between the United States and Israel. Under the trade agreements with Jordan as laid down by the United States, goods produced in QIZ-notified areas can directly access US markets without tariff or quota restrictions, subject to certain conditions. To qualify, goods produced in these zones must contain a small portion of Israeli input. In addition, a minimum 35% value to the goods must be added to the finished product. The brainchild of Jordanian businessman Omar Salah, the first QIZ was authorized by the United States Congress in 1997.
The Asia-Pacific has been described as "the most integrated trading region on the planet" because its intra-regional trade accounts probably for as much as 50-60% of the region's total imports and exports.Asia-Pacific leads world in integration of trade
It has also extra-regional trade: consumer goods exports such as televisions, radios, bicycles, and textiles into the United States, Europe, and Japan fueled the economic expansion.Vogel, Ezra F. 1991. The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.
The ASEAN Free Trade AreaAFTA & FTAs (ASEAN Secretariat) is a trade bloc agreement by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations supporting local manufacturing in all ASEAN countries. The AFTA agreement was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore. When the AFTA agreement was originally signed, ASEAN had six members, namely, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Vietnam joined in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997 and Cambodia in 1999.

====Tax havens====

A tax haven is a state, country or territory where certain taxes are levied at a low rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion.Dharmapala, Dhammika und Hines Jr., James R. (2006) Which Countries Become Tax Havens? Individuals and/or corporate entities can find it attractive to establish shell subsidiaries or move themselves to areas with reduced or nil taxation levels. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Different jurisdictions tend to be havens for different types of taxes and for different categories of people and companies.Moran Harari, Markus Meinzer and Richard Murphy (October 2012) "Financial Secrecy, Banks and the Big 4 Firms of Accountants" Tax Justice Network States that are sovereign or self-governing under international law have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Identifying_Tax_Havens_Jul_07.pdf |title=The Truth About Tax Havens – retrieved 28 December 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-03-22[/tpl] In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-157|title=International Taxation: Large U.S. Corporations and Federal Contractors with Subsidiaries in Jurisdictions Listed as Tax Havens or Financial Privacy Jurisdictions GAO:GAO-09-157 |publisher=Government Accountability Office|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-21[/tpl] the US Government Accountability Office was unable to find a satisfactory definition of a tax haven but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.
A 2012 report from the Tax Justice Network estimated that between USD $21 trillion and $32 trillion is sheltered from taxes in unreported tax havens worldwide. If such wealth earns 3% annually and such capital gains were taxed at 30%, it would generate between $190 billion and $280 billion in tax revenues, more than any other tax shelter.Tax Justice Network (July 22, 2012) "Revealed: Global super-rich has at least $21 trillion hidden in secret tax havens" If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt are shown to be net creditor nations.Canadian Broadcasting Co. (July 22, 2012) "Wealthy hiding $21 trillion in tax havens, report says" However, the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over the accuracy of the figures.John Whiting, tax policy director at the UK's Chartered Institute of Taxation commented "There clearly are some significant amounts hidden away, but if it really is that size what is being done with it all?" and "If the suggestion is that such amounts are actively hidden and never accessed, that seems odd – not least in terms of what the tax authorities are doing. In fact, the US, UK and German authorities are doing a lot", and noting that if the figures were accurate "you would expect the havens to be more conspicuously wealthy than they are".  However, he also admitted that "I cannot disprove the figures at all, but they do seem staggering" [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18944097|title=Tax havens: Super-rich 'hiding' at least $21tn|date=2012-07-22|accessdate=2012-10-03|work=BBC News[/tpl] Daniel J.

====International tourism====

Tourism is travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".[tpl]cite web|year=1995|url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf|title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics|page=14|publisher=World Tourism Organization|accessdate=26 March 2009[/tpl] There are many forms of tourism such as agritourism, birth tourism, culinary tourism, cultural tourism, eco-tourism, extreme tourism, geotourism, heritage tourism, LGBT tourism, medical tourism, nautical tourism, pop-culture tourism, religious tourism, slum tourism, war tourism, and wildlife tourism.
Globalization has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US. The Guardian. 28 April 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, international travel demand suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/barometer/UNWTO_Barom09_1_en.pdf|title=International tourism challenged by deteriorating global economy|publisher=World Tourism Organization|journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|date=January 2009|volume=7|issue=1|accessdate=17 November 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl] This negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/barometer/UNWTO_Barom10_update_august_en.pdf|title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer Interim Update|journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer|publisher=World Tourism Organization|date=August 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011|ref=harv[/tpl] One notable exception to more free travel is travel from the United States to bordering countries Canada and Mexico, which had been semi-open borders.

====International sports====

Modern international sports events can be big business for as well as influencing the political, economical, and other cultural aspects of countries around the world. Especially with politics and sports, sports can affect countries, their identities, and in consequence, the world.
The ancient Olympic Games were a series of competitions held between representatives of several city-states and kingdoms from Ancient Greece, which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events. During the Olympic games all struggles against the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished.[tpl]cite book|last=Swaddling|first=Judith|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=2000|edition=2|page=54|isbn=0-292-70373-2|oclc=10759486|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2-HQMnDiLqIC&printsec=frontcover#PPA54,M1|accessdate=6 June 2009[/tpl] The origin of these Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend.Young (2004), p. 12 During the 19th century Olympic Games became a popular global event.
While some economists are skeptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasizing that such "mega-events" often have large costs, hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.Rose, A. K., & Spiegel, M. M. (2011). The Olympic Effect*. The Economic Journal, 121(553), 652–677. Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector. This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently. This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.Tilcsik, A. and Marquis, C. 2013. “Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities.” Administrative Science Quarterly, 58(1): 111–148.. The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities; for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.Glynn, M. A. (2008). "Configuring the field of play: how hosting the Olympic Games impacts civic community." Journal of Management Studies, 45(6), 1117–1146.
Globalization has continually increased international competition in sports. The FIFA World Cup, for example, is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 700 million people watched the final match of the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa.[tpl]Cite news |title=700 million to watch World Cup Final |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/ |accessdate=12 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715052728/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/| archivedate= 15 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

Human trafficking differs from people smuggling.  In the latter, people voluntarily request or hire an individual, known as a smuggler, to covertly transport them from one location to another.  This generally involves transportation from one country to another, where legal entry would be denied at the international border.  There may be no deception involved in the (illegal) agreement.  After entry into the country and arrival at their ultimate destination, the smuggled person is usually free to find their own way. According to the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), human smuggling is a crime against the State due to violation of immigration laws and does not require violations of the rights of the smuggled migrants to be considered a crime. Human trafficking, on the other hand, is a crime against a person because of violation of the victim's rights through coercion and exploitation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anti-trafficking.net/differencebetweensmugglingand.html |title=Difference between Smuggling and Trafficking |publisher=Anti-trafficking.net |accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl]

===Economic globalization===

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, service, technology and capital.Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York ISBN 0-19-568909-7. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", page 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005 Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises the globalization of production, markets, competition, technology, and corporations and industries. Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of foreign direct investment, the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms and, in many cases, immigration.
In 1944, 44 nations attended the Bretton Woods Conference with a purpose of stabilizing world currencies and establishing credit for international trade in the post World War II era. While the international economic order envisioned by the conference gave way to the neo-liberal economic order prevalent today, the conference established many of the organizations essential to advancement towards a close-knit global economy and global financial system, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Trade Organization.
As an example, Chinese economic reform began to open China to globalization in the 1980s. Scholars find that China has attained a degree of openness that is unprecedented among large and populous nations, with competition from foreign goods in almost every sector of the economy. Foreign investment helped to greatly increase product quality and knowledge and standards, especially in heavy industry. China's experience supports the assertion that globalization greatly increases wealth for poor countries.[tpl]harvnb|Brandt|2008|p=13[/tpl]

====Global financial system====

By the early 21st century, a worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors came together to facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. This global financial system emerged during the first modern wave of economic globalization, marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets.[tpl]Cite book | title = Capitals of Capital: A History of International Financial Centres, 1780-2005 | author = Cassis, Youssef | year = 2006 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK | isbn = 978-0-511-33522-8[/tpl] The world economy became increasingly financially integrated throughout the 20th century as nations liberalized capital accounts and deregulated financial sectors. With greater exposure to volatile capital flows, a series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America had contagious effects on other countries. By the early 21st century, financial institutions had become increasingly large with a more sophisticated and interconnected range of investment activities. Thus, when the United States experienced a financial crisis early in that century, it quickly propagated among other nations. It became known as the global financial crisis and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession.

=====Austerity=====

Governments sometimes impose austerity policies to reduce budget deficits during adverse economic conditions. These can include spending cuts, tax increases, or a mixture of the two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=austerity-measure|title=Austerity measure|work=Financial Times Lexicon|accessdate=1 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/11/europe-deficit-crisis-austerity-budgets|title=Austerity Europe: who faces the cuts|last=Traynor|first=Ian|coauthors=Katie Allen|date=11 June 2010|publisher=Guardian News|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/government-spending-taxes-opinions-columnists-brian-wesbury-robert-stein.html|title=Government Austerity: The Good, Bad And Ugly|last=Wesbury|first=Brian S.|coauthors=Robert Stein|date=26 July 2010|work=Forbes|accessdate=29 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100929125657/http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/government-spending-taxes-opinions-columnists-brian-wesbury-robert-stein.html?| archivedate= 29 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Austerity policies demonstrate governments' liquidity to their creditors and credit rating agencies by bringing fiscal income closer to expenditure.
The economic effects of austerity are unclear due to its wide and non-specific definition, the limited historic sample of natural experiments and potential for conflation with the effects of other events that tend to precede austerity, such as recessions and financial crises. In macroeconomics, reducing government spending generally increases unemployment. This increases safety net spending and reduces tax revenues, to some extent. Government spending contributes to gross domestic product (GDP), so the debt-to-GDP ratio which signifies liquidity may not immediately improve. Short-term deficit spending, particularly, contributes to GDP growth when consumers and businesses are unwilling or unable to spend.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/opinion/krugman-europes-economic-suicide.html |title=Europe's Economic Suicide |last=Krugman |first=Paul |work=The New York Times |date=15 April 2012[/tpl] Under the theory of expansionary fiscal contraction (EFC), a major reduction in government spending can change future expectations about taxes and government spending, encouraging private consumption and resulting in overall economic expansion.[tpl]cite web http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/ardagna/files/Economic_Policy_1998_b.pdf, Tales of Fiscal Adjustments, Alberto Alesina & Silvia Ardagna[/tpl] Since 2011, the International Monetary Fund has issued cautionary guidance against austerity measures imposed without regard to underlying economic fundamentalsLuc Eyraud and Anke Weber.

====Capital flight====

Capital flight occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country because of that country's recent increase in taxes, tariffs, labor costs, or other unfavorable financial conditions such as government debt defaulting, which disturb investors. This leads to a sometimes very rapid disappearance of wealth and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country, leading in turn to depreciation in a variable currency exchange rate regime or a forced devaluation under fixed exchange rates. This can be particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss of faith in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods.
Capital flight can cause liquidity crises in the affected countries from which capital is flowing, the countries in which investors are trying to liquidate their assets, and other countries involved in international commerce such as shipping and finance. A 2008 paper published by Global Financial Integrity estimated capital flight or illicit financial flows out of developing countries to be at a rate of "some US$850 billion to $1 trillion a year."Illicit Financial Flows From Developing Countries: 2002–2006, Dev Kar and Devon Cartwright-Smith, 2008 Market participants in need of cash find it hard to locate potential trading partners to sell their assets. This may result as a consequence of limited market participation or because of a decrease in cash held by financial market participants. Thus, asset holders may be forced to sell their assets at a price below the long term fundamental price. Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and collateral requirements, compared to periods of ample liquidity, and unsecured debt is nearly impossible to obtain. Typically, during a liquidity crisis, the interbank lending market does not function smoothly either.
Capital flight affects advanced economies, as well. A 2009 article in The Times reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled the United Kingdom in response to recent tax increases, relocating in low tax destinations such as Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and the British Virgin Islands.Hundreds of bosses flee UK over 50% tax, The Times, December 13, 2009 In May 2012 the scale of Greek capital flight in the wake of the first "undecided" legislative election was estimated at €4 billion a weekGreek Euro exit looms closer as banks crumble and later that month the Spanish Central Bank revealed €97 billion in capital flight from the Spanish economy for the first quarter of 2012.€100 billion in Spanish capital flight and ECB inertia

====Measuring globalization====

=====Indices=====

Measurement of economic globalization focuses on variables such as trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), portfolio investment, and income.  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.[ref]Vujakovic, Petra. (2010). "How to Measure Globalization? A New Globalization Index (NGI)." Atlantic Economic Journal,
38(2): 237. [tpl]doi|10.1007/s11293-010-9217-3[/tpl][/ref]
One index of globalization is the KOF Index, which measures the three main dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.KOF Detailed country rankings, 2013 Another is the A.T. Kearney / Foreign Policy Magazine Globalization Index.October 16, 2006. Data for the year 2006. No longer published.

=====Free trade policies=====

The Enabling Trade Index measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destinations. It is made up of four sub-indexes: market access; border administration; transport and communications infrastructure; and business environment. The top 20 countries (as of the 2010 report) are:[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.weforum.org/pdf/GETR10/GETR10-Overall-Rankings.pdf |title = Rankings: Global Enabling Trade Report 2010| author = World Economic Forum[/tpl]

===Sociocultural globalization===

====Culture====

Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities.  For example, sushi is available in Germany as well as Japan but Euro-Disney outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=November 2011|ref=harv[/tpl]Nadeem, S (2009) Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India. Cultural SociologyHacker, Violaine (2011), "Building Medias Industry while promoting a community of values in the globalization: from quixotic choices to pragmatic boon for EU Citizens", Politické Védy-Journal of Political Science, Slovakia Globalization's contribution to the alienation of individuals from their traditions may be modest compared to the impact of modernity itself, as alleged by existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.  Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.
Religious movements were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, evangelists, imperialists and traders. Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and more recently sects such as Mormonism, which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.[ref]McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.
"Globalization and the Religious Production of Space." Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 44, No 3, September 2005, 249–255.[/ref]
Conversi claimed in 2010 that globalization was predominantly driven by the outward flow of culture and economic activity from the United States and was better understood as Americanization,Americanizationhttp://criticalglobalisation.com/Issue3/36_59_LIMITS_CULTURAL_GLOBALISATION_JCGS3.pdf or Westernization. For example, the two most successful global food and beverage outlets are American companies, McDonald's and Starbucks, are often cited as examples of globalization, with over 32,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000119312511046701/d10k.htm|title=2010 Form 10-K, McDonald's Corporation|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=3 March 2011[/tpl] and 18,000 locations operating worldwide, respectively as of 2008.Steger, Manfred.Globalization. New York: Sterling Publishing, 2009.
The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists must attempt to collect, record or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified. Local musicians struggle for authenticity and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.Clayton, Thomas. 2004. "Competing Conceptions of Globalization" Revisited: Relocating the Tension between World-Systems Analysis and Globalization Analysis. In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–294.
Globalization gave support to the World Music phenomenon by allowing locally-recorded music to reach Western audiences searching for new ideas and sounds. For example, Western musicians have adopted many innovations that originated in other cultures.Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives." Paper prepared for The Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity Division of Arts and Cultural Enterprise UNESCO, Paris.
The term "World Music" was originally intended for ethnic-specific music.  Now, globalization is expanding its scope such that the term often includes hybrid sub-genres such as World fusion, Global fusion, Ethnic fusion[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/ethnic-fusion-d224 |title=Ethnic fusion Music |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=[/tpl] and Worldbeat[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/worldbeat-d248 |title=Worldbeat |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/world_fusion_800/en_US#contents_top |title=World Fusion Music |publisher=worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=[/tpl]
Music flowed outward from the West as well. Anglo-American pop music spread across the world through MTV. Dependency Theory explained that the world was an integrated, international system. Musically, this translated into the loss of local musical identity.Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. World-Systems Analysis. An Introduction. London: Duke University Press, pp. 23–59.
Bourdieu claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each being having his own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural and economic factors.Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.
A 2005 UNESCO report[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl] showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia but Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America.  Americanization related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and object being brought into other countries.
So, globalization, a diverse phenomenon, relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the plurality of the impact of cultural globalization.Ghosh, Biswajit (2011). "Cultural Changes and Challenges in the Era of Globalisation." Journal of Developing Societies, SAGE Publications, 27(2): 153–175.

=====Multilingualism and the emergence of lingua francas=====

Multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world's population.A Global Perspective on Bilingualism and Bilingual Education (1999), G. Richard Tucker, Carnegie Mellon University Today most people in the world are multilingual.A Global Perspective on Bilingualism and Bilingual Education (1999), G. Richard Tucker, Carnegie Mellon University Language contact occurs when two or more languages or varieties interact. Language contact occurs in a variety of phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification. The most common products are pidgins, creoles, code-switching, and mixed languages.
Multilingualism is becoming a social phenomenon governed by the needs of globalization and cultural openness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://multilingualism.org/multilingualism/the-importance-of-multilingualism |title=The importance of multilingualism |publisher=multilingualism.org |accessdate=16 September 2010[/tpl] Thanks to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet, individuals' exposure to multiple languages is becoming more and more frequent, triggering, therefore, the need to acquire more and more languages.
A lingua franca is a language systematically used to make communication possible between people not sharing a mother tongue, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues.Viacheslav A. Chirikba, "The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund" in Pieter Muysken, ed., From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics, 2008, p. 31. ISBN 90-272-3100-1 Today, the most popular second language is English. Some 3.5 billion people have some acquaintance of the language.[ref]
</ref>
English is the dominant language on the Internet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/language/language_1.htm |title=Anthro.palomar.edu |publisher=Anthro.palomar.edu |date=27 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl]
About 35% of the world's mail, telexes, and cables are in English; approximately 40% of the world's radio programs are in English.Swain, Samarak. (2011). Social Issues of India.  Nrew Dheli: New Vishal Publications. ISBN 9781257094547.
While multilingualism is common among individuals, globally the number of spoken languages is decreasing.  The top 20 languages spoken by more than 50 million speakers each are spoken by some 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken in small communities, most with less than 10,000 speakers.[tpl]cite book|editor-first=Peter K|editor-last=Austin|editor2-first=Julia|editor2-last=Sallabank|chapter=Introduction|title=Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|first=Peter K|last=Austin|first2=Julia|last2=Sallabank|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88215-6[/tpl] Historically, these less widespread languages were afforded protection through geographical isolation.  Today, speakers of regional and minority languages are increasingly unable to compete with those who speak dominant languages such that these languages are now considered endangered languages. The total number of languages in the world is not precisely known and estimates vary depending on many factors. The current estimate is that there are between 6000 and 7000[tpl]cite web|title=Moseley, Christopher (ed.). 2010. Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, 3rd edn. Paris, UNESCO Publishing.

====Politics====

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of nation states. Supranational institutions such as the European Union, the WTO, the G8 or the International Criminal Court replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.[tpl]cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave[/tpl] Some observers attribute the relative decline in US power to globalization, particularly due to the country's high trade deficit. This led to a global power shift towards Asian states, particularly China, which unleashed market forces and achieved tremendous growth rates. As of 2011, the Chinese economy was on track to overtake the United States by 2025.[tpl]cite web|last=PriceWaterhouseCoopers|title=Beyond the BRICs|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/eng/publications/beyond_the_brics.html[/tpl]
Increasingly, Non-Governmental Organizations influence public policy across national boundaries, including humanitarian aid and developmental efforts.Pawel Zaleski Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector, in: Gawin, Dariusz & Glinski, Piotr ed.: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006 Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Accion International, the Acumen Fund (now Acumen) and the Echoing Green have combined the business model with philanthropy, giving rise to business organizations such as the Global Philanthropy Group and new associations of philanthropists such as the Global Philanthropy Forum.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multi-billion dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.Vaccine delivery strategy overview. and hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years to programs aimed at encouraging saving by the world's poor.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news? id=20601086&sid=aRYXnh3Vgh3w&refer=latin_america | work=Bloomberg | title=Gates Foundation to Promote Savings by World's Poor, WSJ Says | date=2008-07-31[/tpl] The Hudson Institute estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at US$59 billion in 2010.The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced isolationist policies. For example, the North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010[/tpl]

=====Media and public opinion=====

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52. In 2008 Greg Ip claimed this rise in opposition to globalization can be explained, at least in part, by economic self-interest.Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", Wall Street Journal. 17 July 2008. The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.
A number of international polls have shown that residents of developing countries tend to view globalization more favorably."Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006. The BBC found a growing feeling in developing countries that globalization was proceeding too rapidly. Only in a few countries, including Mexico, the countries of Central America, Indonesia, Brazil and Kenya, did a majority feel that globalization is increasing too slowly.
Philip Gordon stated that "of 2004 a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects."Gordon, Philip. 2004. "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace". Yale Global, 1 November 2004. http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists.
Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.Gordon, Philip. 2004. "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace". Yale Global, 1 November 2004. http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace
In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalisation is a good thing.Time Magazine: Why Denmark Loves Globalisation
Fiss, et al., surveyed U.S. opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the financial crisis of 2007. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the U.S. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.
According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, as of 1998 there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However Japan was resource poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as internationalization and globalization to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," Domestic Adjustments to Globalization; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.
The situation may have changed after the 2007 financial crisis. A 2008 BBC World Public Poll as the crisis began suggested that opposition to globalization in developed countries was increasing. The BBC poll asked whether globalization was growing too rapidly. Agreement was strongest in France, Spain, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. The trend in these countries appears to be stronger than in the United States. The poll also correlated the tendency to view globalization as proceeding too rapidly with a perception of growing economic insecurity and social inequality."Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization". BBC World Service Poll. http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf
Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty. Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of neo-colonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations.Shoa S. Rajgopal. 2002. Reclaiming Democracy, the Anti-globalization Movement in South Asia". Feminist review 70, 2002. http://visuality.org/globalization/wmst250_readings/the_antiglobalization_mvmnt.pdf Much of this criticism comes from the middle class; the Brookings Institute suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile low-income groups as threatening to their economic security.Carol Graham "Winners and Losers: Perspectives on Globalization from the Emerging Market Economies" Brookings. Saturday 1 January 2011 http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2001/fall_globaleconomics_graham.aspx

The Economist .12 February 2009. http://www.economist.com/node/13063298?story_id=13063298&source=hptextfeature Coupled with growing urbanization, this leads to increasing disparities in wealth between urban and rural areas."Globalization and the Rural-Urban Divide". IATRC Summer Symposium, 30 June – 2 July 2008.http://aede.osu.edu/programs/anderson/trade/Seoul_Symposium_Report.pdf In 2002, in India, 70% of the population lived in rural areas and depended directly on natural resources for their livelihood. As a result, mass movements in the countryside at times express objections to the process.Shoa S. Rajgopal. 2002. Reclaiming Democracy, the Anti-globalization Movement in South Asia".

The nonprofit Reporters Without Borders publishes a Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of the countries' press freedom records in the previous year. It reflects the degree of freedom that journalists, news organizations, and netizens enjoy in each country, and the efforts made by the authorities to respect and ensure respect for this freedom.

====Internet====

Both a product of globalization as well as a catalyst, the Internet connects computer users around the world. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.Internet users graphs, Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunications Union By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |title=Google Earth demonstrates how technology benefits RI`s civil society, govt |publisher=Antara News |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=13 June 2012[/tpl] According to research firm IDC, the size of total worldwide e-commerce, when

The world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350, when it stood at around 370 million.[ref]Jean-Noël Biraben, 1980, "An Essay Concerning Mankind's Evolution", Population, Selected Papers, Vol. 4, pp. 1–13.  Original paper in French: (b)  Jean-Noël Biraben, 1979, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", Population, Vol. 34 (no. 1), pp. 13–25.
[/ref] The highest rates of growth – global population increases above 1.8% per year – were seen briefly during the 1950s, and for a longer period during the 1960s and 1970s. The growth rate peaked at 2.2% in 1963, and had declined to 1.1% by 2011. Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 138 million,UN World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision: http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/DB01_Period_Indicators/WPP2010_DB1_F04_BIRTHS_BOTH_SEXES.XLS (686 million births from 1985–1990). and are now expected to remain essentially constant at their 2011 level of 134 million, while deaths number 56 million per year, and are expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/region.php?N=%20Region%20Results%20&T=7&A=aggregate&RT=0&Y=2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023,2024,2025,2026,2027,2028,2029,2030,2031,2032,2033,2034,2035,2036,2037,2038,2039,2040&R=1&C= |title=World Population estimates by the US Census Bureau[/tpl] Current projections show a continued increase in population (but a steady decline in the population growth rate), with the global population expected to reach  7.5 and 10.5 billion by 2050.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/ |title=World Population Clock – Worldometers |publisher=Worldometers.info |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl]

Growing populations, falling energy sources and food shortages will create a "perfect storm" by 2030, according to UK chief government scientist John Beddington, who noted that food reserves were at a 50-year low and the world would require 50% more energy, food and water by 2030."World faces 'perfect storm' of problems by 2030, chief scientist to warn".

=====Urbanization=====

Growth in population during the period of rapid industrialization and globalization in the 20th century was accompanied by increased urbanization on a global basis.  By 2011, the majority of the world's population lived in industrialized  urban areas featuring nearby factories and business offices rather than in traditional rural areas where agricultural activities predominate.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2013/2013-world-population-data-sheet.aspx | title=2013 World Population Data Sheet | publisher=Population Reference Bureau | year=2013[/tpl]  Certain cities began to emerge as global cities generally considered to be important centers of global economic activities. Megacities, cities having a population in excess of 10 million, grew in number from 3 in 1973 to 24 by 2013, with estimates of up to 27 by 2025.[tpl]cite book | title=The Real Population Bomb | publisher=Potomac Books | author=Liotta, P.H and James F.

====Health====

Global health is the health of populations in a global context that transcends the perspectives and concerns of individual nations.The World Health Organization and the Transition From "International" to "Global" Public Health. Brown et al., AJPH: Jan 2006, Vol 96, No 1. http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/96/1/62 Health problems that transcend national borders or have a global political and economic impact are emphasized.[tpl]cite book | last = Global Health Initiative | first = | authorlink = | title = Why Global Health Matters | publisher = FamiliesUSA | year = 2008 | location = Washington, DC| url = http://www.familiesusa.org/issues/global-health/matters/[/tpl] It has been defined as 'the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide'.Koplan JP, Bond TC, Merson MH, et al; Consortium of Universities for Global Health Executive Board. Towards a common definition of global health. Lancet. 2009;373:1993–1995. Thus, global health is about worldwide improvement of health, reduction of disparities, and protection against global threats that disregard national borders.Macfarlane SB, Jacobs M, Kaaya EE. In the name of global health: trends in academic institutions. J Public Health Policy. 29(4):383–401. 2008 The application of these principles to the domain of mental health is called Global Mental Health.Patel V, Prince M. Global mental health – a new global health field comes of age. JAMA. 2010;303:1976–1977.
The major international agency for health is the World Health Organization (WHO). Other important agencies with impact on global health activities include UNICEF, World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations University International Institute for Global Health and the World Bank. A major initiative for improved global health is the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the globally endorsed Millennium Development Goals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/ |title=Climate change deal reached in Durban |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=13 June 2012[/tpl]
International travel has helped to spread some of the deadliest infectious diseases.Dr. Daulaire. Globalization and Health. http://econpapers.repec.org/article/paldevelp/v_3a42_3ay_3a1999_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a22-24.htm Modern modes of transportation allow more people and products to travel around the world at a faster pace, but they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309100984/html/22.html |title=The Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control: Exploring the Consequences and Opportunities, Workshop Summary – Forum on Microbial Threats |publisher=Nap.edu |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl] One example of this occurring is AIDS/HIV."The virus from Africa reached the U.S. by way of Haiti, a genetic study shows". Los Angeles Times. 30 October 2007. Due to immigration, approximately 500,000 people in the United States are believed to be infected with Chagas disease."Chagas disease", HealthCentral.com. In 2006, the tuberculosis (TB) rate among foreign-born persons in the United States was 9.5 times that of U.S.-born persons."Trends in Tuberculosis Incidence – United States, 2006". CDC.gov. 23 March 2007 / 56(11);245–250. Starting in Asia, the Black Death killed at least one-third of Europe's population in the 14th century.Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, in L'Histoire n° 310, June 2006, pp.45–46, say "between one-third and two-thirds"; Robert Gottfried (1983). "Black Death" in Dictionary of the Middle Ages, volume 2, pp.257–67, says "between 25 and 45 percent". Even worse devastation was inflicted on the American supercontinent by European arrivals. 90% of the populations of the civilizations of the "New World" such as the Aztec, Maya, and Inca were killed by small pox brought by European colonization.

===Global natural environment===

The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth or some region thereof. It is an environment that encompasses the interaction of all living species.[tpl]cite journal |last=Johnson |first=D. L. |first2=S. H. |last2=Ambrose |first3=T. J. |last3=Bassett |first4=M.

It is difficult to find absolutely natural environments; it is common that the naturalness varies in a continuum, from ideally 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform[tpl]cite book |first=Donald |last=Symons |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=31 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1979 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-502535-0 [/tpl] but, instead, there exists a coupled human–environment system.
Human challenges to the natural environment, such as climate change, cross-boundary water and air pollution, over-fishing of the ocean, and the spread of invasive species require at least transnational and, often, global solutions. Since factories in developing countries increased global output and experienced less environmental regulation, globally there have been substantial increases in pollution and its impact on water resources.Globalization of Water: Sharing the Planet's Freshwater resources|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405163356.html

In a 2006 news story, BBC reported, "...if China and India were to consume as much resources per capita as United States or Japan in 2030 together they would require a full planet Earth to meet their needs.

Changes in natural capital are beginning to erode the economic logic of one major aspect of economic globalization: an international division of labor and production based on global supply chains.[tpl]cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Fred|title=Peak Globalization: Climate Change, oil depletion, and global trade|journal=Ecological Economics|date=December 2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=427–434|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.08.020[/tpl]  Planetary boundaries for several key environmental resources have been reached and others are near their limits. Over time, peak oil and climate change may result in "peak globalization," measured in terms of decreasing ton-miles of freight transported, particularly across oceans and continents. The economic logic of the comparative advantage of global supply chains could be overcome by both increasing transportation costs and interruptions and delays in the transit of freight.
China and India substantially increased their fossil fuel consumption as their economies switched from subsistence farming to industry and urbanization.Oil price 'may hit $200 a barrel', BBC News"Running Out of Planet to Exploit". The New York Times. 21 April 2008. Chinese oil consumption grew by 8% yearly between 2002 and 2006, doubling from 1996–2006. In 2007, China surpassed the United States as the top emitter of [tpl]chem|CO|2[/tpl]."China overtakes US as world's biggest CO2 emitter". Guardian.co.uk. 19 June 2007.
Only 1 percent of the country's 560 million city inhabitants (2007) breathe air deemed safe by the European Union. In effect, this means that developed countries may "outsource" some of the pollution associated with consumption in countries where pollution-intensive industries have been moved.
Societies utilize forest resources in order to reach a sustainable level of economic development. Historically, forests in earlier developing nations experience "forest transitions", a period of deforestation and reforestation as a surrounding society becomes more developed, industrialized and shift their primary resource extraction to other nations via imports. For nations at the periphery of the globalized system however, there are no others to shift their extraction onto, and forest degradation continues unabated. Forest transitions can have an effect on the hydrology, climate change, and biodiversity of an area by impacting water quality and the accumulation of greenhouse gases through the re-growth of new forest into second and third growth forests.[tpl]cite journal|author=Rudel,R.L. & Coomes, O.T|title=Forest transitions: towards a global understanding of land use change|year=2005|volume=15|pages=23–31.|ref=harv[/tpl]Meyfroidt, P., Lambin, E.F. 2011.

Other "peak" phenomena, such as peak oil, peak coal, peak gas, peak water, and peak wheat, also affect the availability and  sustainability of natural capital.
In 2003, 29% of open sea fisheries were in a state of collapse."'Only 50 years left' for sea fish", BBC News. 2 November 2006. The journal Science published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048.[ref]
