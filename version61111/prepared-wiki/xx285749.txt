==History==

The first match was played in 1878 and the event has been held annually with the exceptions of the two World Wars as well as 1894, 1900, 1960-61 and 1963.  The match was originally played at Hurlingham Club, but moved to Cowdray Park after World War II. From 1962 onwards, the venue for the match was decided annually, with the choice alternating with each university. Since 1994, the Varsity Match is played at Guards Polo Club.[tpl]cite web|title=Oxford Polo Club Archive|url=http://www.oxforduniversitypoloclub.com/index.php/archive|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

==Old Blues Match==

The main varsity match is preceded by a match between the two Old Blues teams. This match has a similar tradition to the Varsity Match as it was held annually and its records go back to 1879 (with major gaps in the statistic). It was known by the title Old Oxonians vs Old Cantabs. Both teams helped to promote British polo also in other tournaments and events and were seen as one of the strongest British polo teams until World War II brought an end to that.[tpl]cite book|last=Dale|first=T.F.|title=Polo.
