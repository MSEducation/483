[[Pep band]]

CATEGORIES: Pep bands

A pep band is an ensemble of instrumentalists who play at functions or events with the purpose of entertaining and "pepping" up a crowd.Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary  Often members of a pep band are a subset of people from a larger ensemble such as a marching band or a concert band.  Pep bands are generally associated with performing at pep rallies and sporting events (usually football, basketball or hockey).  With a few exceptions, pep bands are exclusive to the collegiate and high school level.  The typical instrumentation of a pep band is the same as most marching bands, using mainly woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments.  Pep bands typically don't use primarily orchestral instruments (double reeds, strings, etc.), but this is not a hard set limitation.
