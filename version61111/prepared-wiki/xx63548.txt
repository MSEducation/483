</ref> Their later survival in the Caribbean correlates with the later colonization of this area by humans. Some insular sloth populations persisted 5,000-6,000 years longer than their continental mainland relatives, in congruence with the global pattern of late Quaternary large vertebrate extinction due to human dispersal.<ref name = "Steadman_2005">

The bulk of ground sloth evolution took place during the mid to late Tertiary of South America while the continent was isolated.  At their earliest appearance in the fossil record, the ground sloths were already distinct at the family level.  The presence of intervening islands between the American continents in the Miocene allowed a dispersal of forms into North America.  A number of mid- to small-sized forms are believed to have previously dispersed to the Antilles islands either by making short swims or using land bridges.  Ground sloths were a hardy group as evidenced by their diverse numbers and dispersals into remote areas given the finding of their remains in Patagonia (Cueva del Milod√≥n)C.M. Hogan (2008) and parts of Alaska.
Sloths, and xenarthrans as a whole, represent one of the more successful South American groups during the Great American Biotic Interchange. During the interchange, many more taxa moved from North America into South America than in the other direction. At least five genera of ground sloths have been identified in North American fossils; these are examples of successful immigration to the north.

==Families==

Paleontologists assign more than 80 genera of ground sloths to multiple families.Modified from McKenna & Bell (1997)

===Megalonychidae===

The megalonychid ground sloths first appeared in the early Oligocene, about 35 million years ago, in Patagonia. Megalonychids first reached North America by island-hopping, prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Some lineages of megalonychids increased in size as time progressed. The first species of these were small and may have been partly tree-dwelling, whereas the Pliocene (about 5 to 2 million years ago) species were already approximately half the size of the huge Late Pleistocene Megalonyx jeffersonii from the last ice age. Some West Indian island species were as small as a large cat; their dwarf condition typified both tropical adaptation and their restricted island environment.  This small size also enabled them a degree of arboreality.
Megalonyx, which means "giant claw," was a widespread North American genus that lived past the close of the last (Wisconsin) glaciation, when so many large mammals died out.  Remains have been found as far north as Alaska[ref]
