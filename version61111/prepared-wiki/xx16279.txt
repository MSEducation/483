Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization that constitutes one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America. MLB teams play in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), which operated as separate legal entities from 1901 and 1876 respectively. In 2000, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2000n.shtml|title=Year In Review: 2000 National League|publisher=www.baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=September 5, 2008[/tpl] The organization oversees minor league baseball leagues, which operate about 240 teams affiliated with the major-league clubs. With the International Baseball Federation, the league also manages the international World Baseball Classic tournament.
Baseball's first professional team was founded in Cincinnati in 1869. The first few decades of professional baseball were characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to another. The period before 1920 in baseball was known as the dead-ball era; players rarely hit home runs during this time. Baseball survived a game-throwing incident known as the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series. Baseball rose in popularity in the 1920s, and survived potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, baseball's color barrier was broken by Jackie Robinson.
The 1950s and 1960s were a time of expansion for the AL and NL, then new stadiums and artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among MLB players in the mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the Mitchell Report, which implicated many MLB players in the use of performance-enhancing substances, including at least one player from each MLB team.
Today, MLB is composed of thirty teams: Twenty-nine in the United States and one in Canada. Teams in MLB play 162 games each season. Five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in the World Series, a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. Baseball broadcasts are aired throughout North America and in several other countries throughout the world. Games are aired on television, radio, and the internet. MLB has the highest season attendance of any sports league in the world with more than 74 million spectators in 2013.

==Organizational structure==

MLB is governed by the Major League Baseball Constitution. This document has undergone several incarnations since 1875, with the most recent revisions being made in 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2012/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf|title=MLB Constitution|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=October 17, 2013[/tpl] Under the direction of the Commissioner of Baseball, MLB hires and maintains the sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, and television contracts. MLB maintains a unique, controlling relationship over the sport, including most aspects of minor league baseball. This is due in large part to the 1922 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, which held that baseball is not interstate commerce and therefore not subject to federal antitrust law. This ruling has been weakened only slightly in subsequent years. The weakened ruling allowed more stability has returned to the owners and has resulted in values increasing at double-digit rates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/baseball.html|title=Policy Debate: Should the antitrust exemption for baseball be eliminated?|accessdate=September 4, 2008|publisher=www.swlearning.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/role-antitrust-laws-professional-sports-industry-financial-perspective|title=The Role of Antitrust Laws in the Professional Sports Industry From a Financial Perspective|accessdate=September 4, 2008|work=Howard Bartee, Jr|publisher=The Sport Journal[/tpl] There were several challenges to MLB's primacy in the sport between the 1870s and the Federal League in 1916; the last attempt at a new major league was the aborted Continental League in 1960.
The chief executive of MLB is the commissioner, Bud Selig. The chief operating officer is Rob Manfred. There are six executive vice-presidents in charge of the following areas: baseball development, business, labor relations and human resources, finance, administration (whose vice-president is MLB's Chief Information Officer), and baseball operations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8023312/major-league-baseball-executive-jimmie-lee-solomon-resigns-21-years|title=Manfred promoted; Jimmie Lee Solomon resigns|publisher=ESPN|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=29 November 2013[/tpl] As of November 19, 2013, the MLB website lists only five executive VPs; the office of executive VP for labor relations and human resources is not listed.[tpl]cite web|author=|title=MLB Executives|publisher=MLB.com|year=2013|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/executives.jsp|accessdate=November 19, 2013[/tpl]
The multimedia branch of MLB, which is based in Manhattan, is MLB Advanced Media. This branch oversees MLB.com and each of the 30 teams' websites. Its charter states that MLB Advanced Media holds editorial independence from the league, but it is under the same ownership group and revenue-sharing plan. MLB Productions is a similarly structured wing of the league, focusing on video and traditional broadcast media. MLB also owns 67 percent of MLB Network, with the other 33 percent split between several cable operators and satellite provider DirecTV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network|title=MLB Network|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=October 30, 2013[/tpl] It operates out of studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, and also has editorial independence from the league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/network/about/|title=About MLB Network|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=October 30, 2013[/tpl]

==League organization==

In 1920, the weak National Commission, which had been created to manage relationships between the two leagues, was replaced with the much more powerful Commissioner of Baseball, who had the power to make decisions for all of professional baseball unilaterally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_people.jsp?story=com|title=The Commissionership: A Historical Perspective |publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] For 60 years, the American and National Leagues fielded eight teams apiece.
In the 1960s, expansion added eight teams, including the first non-U.S. team (the Montreal Expos). Two teams were also added in the 1970s. From 1969 through 1993, each league consisted of an East and West Division. A third division, the Central Division, was added in each league in 1994. Through 1996, the two leagues met on the field only during the World Series and the All-Star Game. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997.[tpl]cite news|title=Interleague play ho-hum to some|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HjMfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=388EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,783864|accessdate=November 24, 2013|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=June 4, 2000[/tpl]
In March 1995, two new franchises — the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (now known simply as the Tampa Bay Rays) — were awarded by MLB, to begin play in 1998. This addition brought the total number of franchises to 30. In early 1997, MLB decided to assign one new team to each league: Tampa Bay joined the AL and Arizona joined the NL. The original plan was to have an odd number of teams in each league (15 per league, with 5 in each division). In order for every team to be able to play daily, this would have required interleague play to be scheduled throughout the entire season. It was unclear, though, if interleague play would continue after the 1998 season, as it had to be approved by the players' union. For this and other reasons, it was decided that both leagues should continue to have an even number of teams; one existing club would have to switch leagues. The Milwaukee Brewers agreed in November 1997 to move from the AL to the NL, thereby making the NL a 16-team league.At the same time, the Detroit Tigers agreed to move from the AL East to the AL Central (to replace Milwaukee), with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays joining the AL East.

See also Milwaukee Brewers#1994–98: Realignment / "We're taking this thing National".
In 2000, the AL and NL were dissolved as legal entities, and MLB became a single, overall league de jure, similar to the National Football League, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League—albeit with two components called "leagues" instead of "conferences". The same rules and regulations are used in both leagues, with one exception: the AL operates under the designated hitter rule, while the NL does not.[tpl]cite web|last=Adamson|first=Scott|title=Nothing more irritating than playing by one set of rules in one park and a different set in another|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2011/jul/01/nothing-more-irritating-playing-one-set-rules-one/|publisher=The Anderson Independent-Mail|accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl]  This difference in rules between leagues is unique to MLB; the other sports leagues of the US and Canada have one set of rules for all teams.
Starting with the 2013 season, the Houston Astros moved from the NL Central to the AL West,[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/teams|title=ESPN: MLB Baseball Teams|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl] resulting in both leagues having three divisions of five teams each and allowing all teams to have a more balanced schedule. (MLB required the Astros to accept this move as a condition of approving their sale to Jim Crane.) Interleague play is held throughout the season.[tpl]cite news|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|title=Astros' sale finalized; 2 more for playoffs|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=November 17, 2011|url= http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7246443/houston-astros-sale-approved-mlb|accessdate=November 17, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Founding===

In the 1860s, aided by the Civil War, "New York"-style baseball expanded into a national game and spawned baseball's first governing body, The National Association of Base Ball Players. The NABBP existed as an amateur league for twelve years. By 1867, more than 400 clubs were members. Most of the strongest clubs remained those based in the northeastern part of the country. For professional baseball's founding year, MLB uses the year 1869—when the first professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was established.History: Legend of the Cincinnati Red Stockings. 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings Vintage Base Ball Team (2007). Retrieved October 15, 2010.
A schism developed between professional and amateur ballplayers after the founding of the Cincinnati club. The NABBP split into an amateur organization and a professional organization. The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, often known as the National Association (NA), was formed in 1871.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/404475/National-Association-of-Professional-Base-Ball-Players|title=National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=britannica.com[/tpl] Its amateur counterpart disappeared after only a few years.[tpl]cite book|last=Rader|first=Benjamin|title=Baseball: A History of America's Game|year=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-07550-1|page=29|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6jplRWwEmVIC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=nabbp+baseball#v=onepage[/tpl] The modern Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves franchises trace their histories back to the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players in the 1870s.[tpl]cite book|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|title=Historical Dictionary of Baseball|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0-8108-7954-9|page=236|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ViiCha8LoBgC&pg=PA236&dq=cubs+braves+napbbp#v=onepage[/tpl]
In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later known as the National League or NL) was established after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club was no longer in the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt. The first game in the NL — on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the Jefferson Street Grounds, Philadelphia) — is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.[tpl]cite web|first=Marty|last=Noble|title=MLB carries on strong, 200,000 games later: Look what they started on a ballfield in Philadelphia in 1876|date=September 23, 2011|publisher=MLB.com|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110922&content_id=25060814&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb&partnerId=ed-5337375-55428157|accessdate=September 30, 2011|quote=Baseball is about to celebrate its 200,000th game — the division series on Saturday 1, 2011 ...[/tpl]Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876. Retrosheet. Retrieved September 30, 2011.
The early years of the NL were tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs. Competitive leagues formed regularly and also disbanded regularly. The most successful was the American Association (1882–1891), sometimes called the "beer and whiskey league" for its tolerance of the sale of alcoholic beverages to spectators. For several years, the NL and American Association champions met in a postseason championship series — the first attempt at a World Series. The resulting bidding war for players led to widespread contract-breaking and legal disputes. One of the most famous involved star second baseman Napoleon Lajoie, who in 1901 went across town in Philadelphia from the NL Phillies to the AL Athletics. Barred by a court injunction from playing baseball in the state of Pennsylvania the following year, Lajoie was traded to the Cleveland team, where he played and managed for many years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.docheritage.state.pa.us/documents/baseball.asp|title=The National Pastime|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=Doc Heritage|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080515035805/http://www.docheritage.state.pa.us/documents/baseball.asp|archivedate=May 15, 2008[/tpl]
The war between the AL and NL caused shock waves throughout the baseball world. At a meeting at the Leland Hotel in Chicago in 1901, the other baseball leagues negotiated a plan to maintain their independence. On September 5, 1901, Patrick T. Powers, president of the Eastern League, announced the formation of the second iteration of the NA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/history/|title=Minor League Baseball History|accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=MiLB.com[/tpl] While the NA continues to this day (known as Minor League Baseball), at the time Ban Johnson saw it as a tool to end threats from smaller rivals who might expand in other territories and threaten his league's dominance.
After 1902, the NL, AL and NA signed a new National Agreement which tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players became a commodity. The agreement also set up a formal classification system for independent minor leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of today's system that was refined by Branch Rickey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://roadsidephotos.sabr.org/baseball/1903NatAgree.htm|title=1903 National Agreement |accessdate=September 10, 2008|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research[/tpl] The agreement gave the NA great power. The agreement with the NA punished those independent leagues who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the "majors". The deal also helped to prevent more pilfering of NA players with little or no compensation for the players' development. Several leagues eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.
Several other early defunct baseball leagues are officially considered major leagues, and their statistics and records are included with those of the two current major leagues. These include the Union Association (1884), the American Association (1882–1891, not to be confused with later minor leagues of the same name),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/American_Association_(19th_Century)|title=American Association (19th Century)|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl] the Players' League (1890)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/PL/1890.shtml|title=1890 Players' League|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl] and the Federal League (1914–1915).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1914.shtml|title=1914 Federal League|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/FL/1915.shtml|title=1915 Federal League|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl] Both the UA and NA are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play and the number of star players featured. Researchers dispute the major-league status of the UA by pointing out that franchises came and went and that the St. Louis club was deliberately "stacked"; the St. Louis club was owned by the league's president and it was the only club that was close to major-league caliber.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=324|title=NerdFight: League Quality Adjustments|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Silver, Nate|year=2007|authorlink=Nate Silver[/tpl]

===Dead-ball era===

The period between 1900 and 1919 is commonly called the "dead-ball era". Games of this era tended to be low scoring and were often dominated by pitchers, such as Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Mordecai Brown, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. The term also accurately describes the condition of the baseball itself. The baseball was a soft ball made of yarn that was loosely wound and covered with cowhide, limiting the distance that it would travel.[tpl]cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The Evolution of Pitching in Major League Baseball|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2468-0|page=60|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6ODvYhwnhn0C&pg=PA60&dq=deadball+era+yarn#v=onepage[/tpl] A baseball cost three dollars, equal to $[tpl]Formatprice|[tpl]Inflation|US|3|1919|r=2[/tpl][/tpl] today (in inflation-adjusted U.S. dollars). Club owners were reluctant to purchase new balls. Baseballs were left in play despite becoming stained with tobacco juice, grass and mud.[tpl]cite news|last=Keating|first=Peter|title=The game that Ruth built|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/05/07/the_game_that_ruth_built/|publisher=Boston.com|accessdate=November 24, 2013|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
Also, pitchers could manipulate the ball through the use of the spitball. (In 1921 use of this pitch was restricted to a few pitchers with a grandfather clause). Additionally, many ballparks had large dimensions, such as the West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet to the center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox, which was 635 feet to the center field fence, thus home runs were rare, and "small ball" tactics such as singles, bunts, stolen bases and the hit-and-run play dominated the strategies of the time.Daniel Okrent, Harris Lewine, David Nemec (2000) "The Ultimate Baseball Book", Houghton Mifflin Books,ISBN 0-618-05668-8 , p. 33. Hitting methods like the Baltimore Chop were used to increase the number of infield singles.Burt Solomon (2000) "Where They Ain't: The Fabled Life And Untimely Death Of The Original Baltimore Orioles", Simon and Schuster, ISBN 0-684-85917-3 Excerpt. On a successful Baltimore chop, the batter hits the ball forcefully into the ground, causing it to bounce so high that the batter reaches first base before the ball can be fielded and thrown to the first baseman.[tpl]cite book|last=Lieb|first=Fred|title=The Baltimore Orioles: The History of a Colorful Team in Baltimore and St. Louis|year=1955|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=0-8093-8972-X|page=46|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BahcUaZZebYC&pg=PA46&dq=%22baltimore+chop%22#v=onepage[/tpl]
The adoption of the foul strike rule in the early twentieth century quickly sent baseball from a high-scoring game to one where scoring runs became a struggle. Prior to the institution of this rule, foul balls were not counted as strikes: a batter could foul off any number of pitches with no strikes counted against him; this gave an enormous advantage to the batter. In 1901, the NL adopted the foul strike rule, and the AL followed suit in 1903.Foul strike rule. Baseball-Reference.com.
After the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, baseball was rocked by allegations of a game fixing scheme known as the Black Sox Scandal. Eight players - Joe Jackson, Eddie Cicotte, Claude Williams, Buck Weaver, Arnold "Chick" Gandil, Fred McMullin, Charles Risberg, and Oscar "Happy" Felsch - intentionally lost the World Series in exchange for a ring of $100,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox/blk3.html|title=History Files - Chicago Black Sox: The Fix|publisher=Chicago History Museum|accessdate=October 26, 2013[/tpl] Despite being acquitted, all were permanently banned from Major League Baseball.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|title=History Files - Chicago Black Sox|publisher=Chicago History Museum|accessdate=October 26, 2013[/tpl]

===Rise in popularity===

Baseball's popularity increased in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 season was notable for the death of Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians. Chapman, who was struck in the head by a pitch and died a few hours later, became the only MLB player to die of an on-field injury. The following year, the New York Yankees made their first World Series appearance.[tpl]cite web|title=Indians uncover lost Chapman plaque|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2818187|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl]  By the end of the 1930s, the team had appeared in 11 World Series, winning eight of them.[tpl]cite web|title=New York Yankees: Team History and Encyclopedia|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=October 31, 2013[/tpl]  Yankees slugger Babe Ruth had set the single season home run record in 1927, hitting 60 home runs; a few years earlier, Ruth had set the same record with 29 home runs.[tpl]cite book|last=McNeil|first=William|title=The King of Swat: An Analysis of Baseball's Home Run Hitters from the Major, Minor, Negro, and Japanese Leagues|year=1997|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0362-4|page=32|url=http://books.google.com/?id=inW5x6SDgkYC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=babe+ruth+ned+williamson#v=onepage[/tpl]
Affected by the difficulties of the Great Depression, baseball's popularity had begun a downward turn in the early 1930s. By 1932, only two MLB teams turned a profit. Attendance had fallen, due at least in part to a 10% federal amusement tax added to baseball ticket prices. Baseball owners cut their rosters from 25 men to 23 men, and even the best players took pay cuts. Team executives were innovative in their attempts to survive, creating night games, broadcasting games live by radio and rolling out promotions such as free admission for women. Throughout the period of the Great Depression, no MLB teams moved or folded.[tpl]cite news|last=Belson|first=Ken|title=Apples for a Nickel, and Plenty of Empty Seats|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/sports/baseball/07depression.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=October 31, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2009[/tpl]

===World War II era===

The onset of World War II created a significant shortage of professional baseball players, as more than 500 men left MLB teams to serve in the military. Many of them played on service baseball teams that entertained military personnel in the US or in the Pacific. MLB teams of this time largely consisted of young men, older players and those with a military classification of 4F, indicating mental, physical or moral unsuitability for service. Men like Pete Gray, a one-armed outfielder, got the chance to advance to the major leagues. However, MLB rosters did not include any black players through the end of the war.[tpl]cite book|last=Anton|first=Todd and Bill Nowlin (eds.)|title=When Baseball Went to War|year=2008|publisher=Triumph Books|isbn=1-60078-126-8|pages=7–9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pYovAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=baseball+world+war+II#v=onepage[/tpl] Black players, many of whom served in the war, were still restricted to playing Negro league baseball.[tpl]cite book|last=Martin|first=Alfred|title=The Negro Leagues in New Jersey: A History|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-5192-0|pages=104–105|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FV0uF_RwC00C&pg=PA104&dq=negro+leagues+world+war+II#v=onepage[/tpl]
Wartime blackout restrictions, designed to keep outdoor lighting at low levels, caused another problem for baseball. These rules limited traveling and night games to the point that the 1942 season nearly had to be cancelled. On January 14, 1942, MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis wrote a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and pleaded for the continuation of baseball during the war in hopes for a start of a new major league season. President Roosevelt responded, "I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going. There will be fewer people unemployed and everybody will work longer hours and harder than ever before. And that means that they ought to have a chance for recreation and for taking their minds off their work even more than before."Roosevelt, Franklin. "Green Light Letter". January 15, 1942.
With the approval of President Roosevelt, spring training began in 1942 with few repercussions. The war interrupted the careers of stars including Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio, but baseball clubs continued to field their teams.[tpl]cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Robert|title=Three Reichs, You're Out|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/04/baseball_in_world_war_ii_the_amazing_story_of_the_u_s_military_s_integrated.html|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl]

===Breaking the color barrier===

Branch Rickey, president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began making efforts to introduce a black baseball player to the previously all-white professional baseball leagues in the mid-1940s. He selected Jackie Robinson from a list of promising Negro league players. After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to "turn the other cheek" to any racial antagonism directed at him, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month. In what was later referred to as "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s, joining the Dodgers' farm club, the Montreal Royals, for the 1946 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jackierobinson.org/about/jackie.php |title=The Jackie Robinson Foundation |publisher=Jackie Robinson Foundation|accessdate=July 4, 2013[/tpl]
The following year, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons. Black baseball fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams which they had followed exclusively. Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.

===Expanding west, south and north===

From 1903 to 1953, the two major leagues consisted of two eight-team leagues. The 16 teams were located in ten cities, all in the northeastern and midwestern United States: New York City had three teams and Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis each had two teams. St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city with a major league team. The longest possible road trip, from Boston to St. Louis, took about 24 hours by railroad. In 1953, the NL's Boston Braves became the Milwaukee Braves. In 1954, the St. Louis Browns became the Baltimore Orioles. In 1955, the Philadelphia Athletics became the Kansas City Athletics.
Baseball experts consider the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers' boss Walter O'Malley to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era."[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&content_id=5714&vkey=hof_pr|title=Veterans elect five into Hall of Fame: Two managers, three executives comprise Class of 2008|accessdate=January 19, 2008|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|date=December 3, 2007|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071204185637/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&content_id=5714&vkey=hof_pr|archivedate=December 4, 2007[/tpl] Before the 1958 Major League Baseball season, he moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles.

In 1961, the first Washington Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis–St. Paul to become the Minnesota Twins. Two new teams were added to the American League at the same time: the Los Angeles Angels (who soon moved from downtown L.A. to nearby Anaheim) and a new Washington Senators franchise. The NL added the Houston Astros and the New York Mets in 1962. The Astros (known as the "Colt .45s" during their first three seasons) became the first southern major league franchise since the Louisville Colonels folded in 1899. The Mets established a reputation for futility by going 40–120 during their first season of play in the nation's media capital—and by playing only a little better in subsequent campaigns—but in their eighth season (1969) the Mets became the first of the 1960s expansion teams to win a World Series.
In 1966, the major leagues moved to the "Deep South" when the Braves moved to Atlanta. In 1968, the Kansas City Athletics moved west to become the Oakland Athletics. In 1969, the American and National Leagues both added two expansion franchises. The American League added the Seattle Pilots (who became the Milwaukee Brewers after one disastrous season in Seattle) and the Kansas City Royals. The NL added the first Canadian franchise, the Montreal Expos, as well as the San Diego Padres.
In 1972, the second Washington Senators moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex to become the Texas Rangers. In 1977, baseball expanded again, adding a second Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, as well as the Seattle Mariners. Subsequently, no new teams were added and no teams moved until the 1990s. In 1993, the NL added the Florida Marlins in the Miami area and the Colorado Rockies in Denver. In 1998, the Brewers switched leagues by joining the National League and two new teams were added: the NL's Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and the American League's Tampa Bay Devil Rays in St. Petersburg, Florida.
After the 2001 season, the team owners voted in favor of contraction. Several MLB teams had been considered for elimination in early talks about contraction, but the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins were the two teams that came closest to folding under the plan. Plans for MLB contraction were halted when the Twins landlord was awarded a court injunction that required the team to play its 2002 home games at their stadium. MLB owners agreed to hold off on reducing the league's size until at least 2006.[tpl]cite web|title=Plans involving Angels and A's never seriously considered|url=http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/news/2003/0311/1522058.html|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 24, 2013[/tpl]
The Expos became the first franchise in over three decades to move when they became the Washington Nationals in 2005. This move left Canada with just one team, but it also returned baseball to the United States capital city after a 33-year absence. This franchise shift, like many previous ones, involved baseball's return to a city which had been previously abandoned. Not counting the short-lived Federal League, Montreal is the only city granted an MLB franchise since 1901 that does not currently host a team.

===Pitching dominance and rule changes===

By the late 1960s, the balance between pitching and hitting had swung in favor of the pitchers. In 1968 — later nicknamed "the year of the pitcher""1968 – The Year of the Pitcher" Sports Illustrated, August 4, 1998. — Boston Red Sox player Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with an average of just .301, the lowest in the history of Major League Baseball.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg3.shtml|title=Year by Year Leaders for Batting Average|accessdate=September 8, 2008|publisher=baseball-almanac.com[/tpl] Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain won 31 games, making him the only pitcher to win 30 games in a season since Dizzy Dean in 1934.[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=162|title=When Denny McLain stood baseball on its ear|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Bailey, Mary|year=2000|publisher=The Detroit News[/tpl] St. Louis Cardinals starting pitcher Bob Gibson achieved an equally remarkable feat by allowing an ERA of just 1.12.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gibsobo01.shtml|title=Bob Gibson Statistics|accessdate=September 8, 2008|publisher=baseball-reference.com[/tpl]
Following these pitching performances, in December 1968 the MLB Playing Rules Committee voted to reduce the strike zone from knees to shoulders to top of knees to armpits and lower the pitcher's mound from 15 to 10 inches, beginning in the 1969 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082211/index.htm|title=From Mountain To Molehill|accessdate=March 9, 2009|author=William Leggett|work=Sports Illustrated| date=March 24, 1969[/tpl]
In 1973 the American League, which had been suffering from much lower attendance than the National League, sought to increase scoring even further by initiating the designated hitter (DH) rule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2003/0327/1530427.html|title=Blomberg first permanent pinch-hitter|accessdate=September 8, 2008|author=Merron, Jeff|year=2003|publisher=ESPN.com[/tpl]

===New stadiums and artificial surfaces===

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, as baseball expanded, NFL football had been surging in popularity, making it economical for many of these cities to build multi-purpose stadiums instead of single-purpose baseball fields. Because of climate and economic issues many of these facilities had playing surfaces made from artificial turf, as well as the oval designs characteristic of stadiums designed to house both baseball and football.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/260764-timeline-artificial-turf-in-major-league-baseball|title=Timeline: Artificial turf in Major League Baseball|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] This often resulted in baseball fields with relatively more foul territory than older stadiums. These characteristics changed the nature of professional baseball, putting a higher premium on speed and defense over home-run hitting power, since the fields were often too big for teams to expect to hit many home runs and foul balls hit in the air could more easily be caught for outs.
Teams began to be built around pitching—particularly their bullpens—and speed on the basepaths. Artificial surfaces meant balls traveled quicker and bounced higher, so it became easier to hit ground balls "in the hole" between the corner and middle infielders. Starting pitchers were no longer expected to throw complete games; it was enough for a starter to go 6-7 innings and turn the game over to the team's closer, a position which grew in importance over these decades. As stolen bases increased, home run totals dropped. After Willie Mays hit 52 home runs in 1965, only one player (George Foster) reached that mark until the 1990s.

===Power age===

Routinely in the late 1990s and early 2000s, baseball players hit 40 or 50 home runs in a season, a feat that was considered rare even in the 1980s. It has since become apparent that at least some of this power surge was a result of players using steroids and other performance enhancing drugs. Many modern baseball theorists believe that the need of pitchers to combat the rise in power could lead to a pitching revolution at some point. New pitches, such as the mysterious[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-gyro031306&prov=yhoo&type=lgns|title=Searching for baseball's Bigfoot|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Passan, Jeff|year=2006|publisher=Yahoo Sports[/tpl] gyroball, could shift the balance of power back to the defensive side. A pitching revolution would not be unprecedented; several pitches have changed the game of baseball, including the slider in the '50s and '60s and the split-fingered fastball in the '70s to '90s. Since the 1990s, the changeup has made a resurgence, being thrown masterfully by pitchers such as Trevor Hoffman, Greg Maddux, Jamie Moyer, Tom Glavine, Johan Santana, Pedro Martínez and Tim Lincecum. Recently, pitchers such as Lincecum, Jonathan Sánchez, and Ubaldo Jiménez have been throwing changeups with a split-finger grip, creating a dropping movement, dubbed the "split change."[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FIH/is_n5_v65/ai_n18606862|title=What makes Greg Maddux so good and can we teach it?|accessdate=September 9, 2008|author=Mazzoni, Wayne|year=1995|publisher=findarticles.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/anatomy-of-a-player-tom-glavine/|title=Anatomy of a player: Tom Glavine|accessdate=September 9, 2008|author=Kalk, Josh|year=2007|publisher=hardballtimes.com[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/sports/baseball/03santana.html?_r=1&ex=1205211600&en=32bc22a3d855ca04&ei=5070&emc=eta1&oref=slogin|title=Santana's Changeup: Hitters Never See It Coming|accessdate=September 9, 2008|author=Curry, Jack|work=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Shaikin|first=Bill|title=Anaheim Sues the Angels|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/06/sports/sp-angels6|accessdate=June 28, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 6, 2005[/tpl]

==Uniforms==

A baseball uniform is a type of uniform worn by baseball players, and by some non-playing personnel, such as field managers and coaches. It is worn to indicate the person's role in the game and — through the use of logos, colors, and numbers — to identify the teams and their players, managers, and coaches.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/57907|title=History of Baseball Uniforms|work=Americanchronicle.com|accessdate=June 13, 2011|first=Robert|last=Riles|date=April 8, 2008[/tpl]
Traditionally, home uniforms display the team name on the front, while away uniforms display the team's home location. In modern times, however, exceptions to this pattern have become common, with teams using their team name on both uniforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportslogos.net/|title=MLB Logos|publisher=Sportslogos.net|accessdate=30 November 2013[/tpl] Most teams also have one or more alternate uniforms, usually consisting of the primary or secondary team color on the vest instead of the usual white or gray. In the past few decades throwback uniforms have become popular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/MLB-teams-wear-throwback-uniforms-for-select-games-in-2011-051711#photo-title=Retired+attire&photo=29811636|title=MLB tems wear throwback uniforms for select games in 2011|publisher=FOX Sports''|accessdate=1 December 2013[/tpl]

In the late 1880s, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association were the first to wear striped uniforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/database.htm|title=National Baseball Hall of Fame — Dressed to the Nines — Uniform Database|publisher=exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org|accessdate=May 2, 2008[/tpl] By the end of the 19th century, teams began the practice of having two different uniforms, one for when they played at home in their own baseball stadium and a different one for when they played away (on the road) at the other team's ballpark. It became common to wear white pants with a white color vest at home and gray pants with a gray or solid (dark) colored vest when away. By 1900, both home and away uniforms were standard across the major leagues.[tpl]cite web|title=Baseball Uniforms|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms.shtml|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=November 30, 2013[/tpl]

==Season structure==

===Spring training===

Spring training is a series of practices and exhibition games preceding the start of the regular season. Spring training allows new players to audition for roster and position spots, and gives existing team players practice time prior to competitive play. The teams are divided into the Cactus League[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cactusleague.com/|title=Cactus League|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] and the Grapefruit League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.floridagrapefruitleague.com/|title=Florida's Grapefruit League|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] Spring training has always attracted fan attention, drawing crowds who travel to the warmer climates to enjoy the weather and watch their favorite teams play, and spring training usually coincides with spring break for many college students. Autograph seekers also find greater access to players during spring training.
Spring training typically lasts almost two months, starting in mid February and running until just before the season opening day (and often right at the end of spring training, some teams will play spring training games on the same day other teams have opening day of the season), traditionally the first week of April. As pitchers benefit from a longer training period, pitchers and catchers begin spring training one or two weeks before the rest of the team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/spring-training|title=MLB: Spring Training|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl]

===Regular season===

The current MLB regular season consists of 162 games per team, which typically begins on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October. Each team's schedule is organized typically into 3-game series, with occasional two- or four-game series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_schedule#date=10/14/2013|title=MLB Schedule|work=MLB.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl] Postponed games or continuations of suspended games can result in an ad hoc one-game or five-game series. A team's series are organized into homestands and road trips that group multiple series together. Teams generally play games five to seven days per week, commonly having Monday or Thursday as an off day. Frequently, games are scheduled at night. Sunday games are generally played during the afternoon, allowing teams to travel to their next destination prior to a Monday night game. In addition, teams will play day games frequently on Opening Day, holidays, and getaway days.
With an odd number of teams in each league (15), it is necessary to have two teams participate in interleague play for most days in the season, except when two or more teams have a day off. Each team plays 20 interleague games throughout the season, usually with just one interleague game per day, but for one weekend in late May all teams will participate in an interleague series. Use of the DH rule is determined by the home team's league rules. Before 2013 interleague play was structured differently: there would be one weekend in mid-May and another period consisting typically of the last two-thirds of June in which all teams played interleague games (save for two NL teams each day), and no interleague games were scheduled outside those dates.
Over the course of a season, teams compete for one of the five playoff berths in their league. They can win one of these berths by either winning their division, or by capturing a wild card spot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp?tcid=mm_mlb_standings#20130930|title=MLB: Regular Season|work=MLB.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl]
After the conclusion of the 162-game season, an additional tie-breaking game (or games) may be needed to determine postseason participation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130904&content_id=59527184&c_id=mlb|title=MLB: Playoff Tiebreaker Rules|work=MLB.com|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl]

===All-Star Game===

In early-to-mid July, just after the midway point of the season, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game is held during a four-day break from the regular-season schedule. The All-Star game features a team of players from the National League (NL)—led by the manager of the previous NL World Series team—and a team of players from the American League (AL), similarly managed, in an exhibition game. From 1959 to 1961, two games were held, one in July and one in August. The designated-hitter rule was used in the All-Star game for the first time in 1989. Following games used a DH when the game was played in an AL ballpark. Since 2010, the DH rule has been in effect regardless of venue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/sports/baseball/29bats.html|work=The New York Times|title=Rosters Expanded For the All-Star Game|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl]
The first All-Star Game was held as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, and was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune.[tpl]cite web|url=http://baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game History|accessdate=September 7, 2008|publisher=Baseball Almanac[/tpl] Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the game an annual one. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the "Arch Ward Trophy", given to the All-Star Game's Most Valuable Player each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060710&content_id=1550905&vkey=allstar2006&fext=.jsp|last=Newman|first=Mark|title=All-Star MVP Awaits Your Vote|work=MLB.com|date=July 10, 2006|accessdate=June 13, 2011[/tpl] (In 2002, this was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award.)
Beginning in 1947, the eight position players in each team's starting lineup have been voted into the game by fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgmenu.shtml|title=All-Star Game|accessdate=September 6, 2008|work=baseball-almanac.com [/tpl] The fan voting was discontinued after a 1957 ballot-box-stuffing scandal in Cincinnati: seven of the eight slots originally went to Reds players, two of whom were subsequently removed from the lineup to make room for Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. Fan voting was reinstated in 1970 and has continued ever since, including Internet voting in recent years.
The 2002 contest in Milwaukee controversially ended in an 11-inning tie. Since 2003, the league which wins the All-Star game gets home-field advantage in the World Series: the league champion hosts the first two games at its own ballpark as well as the last two (if necessary).

===Postseason===

When the regular season ends after the first Sunday in October (or the last Sunday in September), ten teams enter the postseason playoffs. Six teams are division champions; the remaining four "wild-card" spots are filled by the two teams in each league that have the best record but are not division champions. Four rounds of series of games are played to determine the champion:
Within each league, the division winners are the #1, #2 and #3 seeds, based on win–loss records. The team with the best record among non division winners will be the first wildcard and the #4 seed. The team with the second best record among non division winners will be the second wildcard and the #5 seed. In the wildcard round, the #5 seed will play at the #4 seed in a one game playoff. For the division series, the matchup will be the #1 seed against the Wild Card Game winner and the #2 seed against the #3 seed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1784642-mlb-playoff-format-2013-tiebreak-scenarios-wild-card-games-and-seedings|title=MLB Playoff Format 2013: Tiebreaker Scenarios, Wild Card Games and Seedings|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] The team belonging to the league that won the mid-season All-Star Game receives home-field advantage in the World Series.
Because each postseason series is split between the home fields of the two teams, home-field advantage does not usually play a large role in the postseason unless the series goes to its maximum number of games, giving one team an additional game at home. However, the first two games of a postseason series are hosted by the same team. That team may have an increased chance of starting the series with two wins,World Series, sec. 3.2.2 (Game-by-Game), note 2; as of 2008, the 1981 Los Angeles Dodgers are the last team to win a World Series after losing the first two games on the road. thereby gaining some momentum for the rest of the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pressbox.mlb.com/pressbox/news/pressbox_story.jsp?ymd=20070514&content_id=1964536&vkey=pressbox&fext=.jsp|title=Major League Baseball announces revamped postseason schedule|accessdate=September 7, 2008|year=2007|publisher=MLB.com[/tpl]

==International play==

Between 1986 and 2006, a team of MLB All-Stars made a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, playing exhibition games against the Nippon Professional Baseball All-Stars in the MLB Japan All-Star Series.

MLB played the MLB Taiwan Series in Taiwan in November 2011.

The MLB All-Stars swept the series, five games to zero."Resilient Taiwan drop All-Stars series finale 6-4", Taipei Times, November 7, 2011 At the end of the 2011 season, it was announced that the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics would play their season openers in Japan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20110928&content_id=25337950&vkey=pr_sea&fext=.jsp&c_id=sea|title=Seattle Mariners open 2012 season in Japan vs. Oakland Athletics|publisher=MLB.com|date=September 28, 2011|accessdate= July 4, 2013[/tpl] In October 2013, Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune wrote that MLB was considering postseason all-star tours in Taiwan and Korea; baseball is increasing in popularity in both countries.

==Steroids in baseball==

In 1998, both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa hit more than the long-standing single-season MLB record of 61 home runs. Barry Bonds topped the record in 2001 with 73 home runs. McGwire, Bonds and Sosa became the subjects of speculation regarding the use of performance enhancing substances. McGwire later admitted that he used a steroid hormone that was still legal in baseball during the 1998 season.[tpl]cite web|title=The Steroids Era|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/topics/_/page/the-steroids-era|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] Baseball's original steroid testing policy, in effect from 2002 to 2005, provided for penalties ranging from a ten-game suspension for a first positive test to a one-year suspension for a fourth positive test.

==MLB in media==

===Television===

Several networks televise baseball games, including Fox, ESPN, and MLB Network. Since 2008, Fox Sports has broadcast MLB games on Fox Saturday Baseball throughout the entire season; Fox previously only broadcast games from May to September.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2516552|title=Fox, TBS have seven-year, $3 billion TV deal with MLB|accessdate=September 6, 2008|year=2006|publisher=ESPN.com [/tpl] Fox also holds rights to the All-Star Game each season. Fox also alternates League Championship Series broadcasts, broadcasting the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in odd-numbered years and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in even-numbered years. Fox broadcasts all games of the World Series. ESPN continues to broadcast MLB games through 2013 as well, beginning with national Opening Day coverage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=mlbespn&prov=st&type=lgns|title=MLB extends TV agreement with ESPN through 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2008|publisher=Yahoo! Sports[/tpl] ESPN broadcasts Sunday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball, Wednesday Night Baseball, and Baseball Tonight. ESPN also has rights to the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game each July.
TBS airs Sunday afternoon regular season games (non-exclusive) nationally. In 2007, TBS began its exclusive rights to any tiebreaker games that determine division or wild card champions; it also airs exclusive coverage of the Division Series round of the playoffs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-07-11-hiestand-mlb_x.htm?csp=34|title=TBS drops Braves games, joins Fox in rich TV deal|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Michael Hiestand|work=USA Today|date=July 11, 2006[/tpl] TBS carries the League Championship Series that are not included under Fox's television agreement; TBS shows the NLCS in odd-numbered years and the ALCS in even-numbered years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061017&content_id=1715532&vkey=ps2006news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=TBS signs on to air LCS games|accessdate=September 6, 2008|author=Barry M. Bloom|year=2006|publisher=MLB.com[/tpl]
In January 2009, MLB launched the MLB Network, featuring news and coverage from around the league, and airing 26 live games in the 2009 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051702492.html|author=Dave Sheinin|date=May 18, 2007|title=MLB Network Closer to Fruition|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 21, 2007[/tpl] Each team also has local broadcasts for all games not carried by Fox on Saturdays or ESPN on Sunday nights. These games are typically split between a local broadcast television station and a local or regional sports network (RSN), though some teams only air local games through RSNs or through their own team networks. As Canada only contains one team, Sportsnet broadcasts Toronto Blue Jays games nationally. The channel is owned by Rogers Communications, who is also the parent company of the Blue Jays.[tpl]cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130322&content_id=43127206&notebook_id=43139768&vkey=notebook_tor&c_id=tor|title=Sportsnet will carry all 162 games for Blue Jays|publisher=MLB.com|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] Additionally, it also airs Fox's Saturday afternoon games, other regular season games, and the post-season.

===Blackout policy===

MLB has several blackout rules.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/help/faq_blackout.jsp|title=Blackouts FAQ|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. Fox Sports Networks also show many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market during the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday ESPN or ESPN2 game and is shown on a local station will see ESPNews, or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2870960|title=Singin' the 'Baseball Blackout Blues'|last=Helyar|first=John|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 25, 2012[/tpl] MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules.

In addition, each team employs its own announcers, who broadcast during the regular season. Most teams operate regional networks to cover their fan bases; some of these supposedly regional networks (such as the New York Yankees Radio Network) have a national reach with affiliates located across the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freebaseballradio.com/NYyankeesAug.html|title=New York Yankees Radio Network|accessdate=October 13, 2013[/tpl] Major League Baseball has an exclusive rights deal with XM Satellite Radio, which includes the channel MLB Home Plate and live play-by-play of all games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/mlbnetworkradio|title=MLB Network Radio|publisher=Sirius XM Radio|accessdate=October 14, 2013[/tpl]
