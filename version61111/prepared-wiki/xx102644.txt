The Atlantic coastal plain is a physiographic region of low relief along the East Coast of the United States. It extends [tpl]convert|2200|mi|km[/tpl] from the New York Bight[tpl]cite web |last= Stoffer |first=Phil |author2=Messina, Paula |title = The Atlantic Coastal Plain | url = http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/bight/coastal.html | work = Geology and Geography of New York Bight Beaches [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/pl_03sum.htm | title = South Atlantic Coastal Plain [/tpl] southward to a Georgia/Florida section of the Eastern Continental Divide, which demarcates the plain from the ACF River Basin in the Gulf Coastal Plain to the west. The province is bordered on the west by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line and the Piedmont plateau, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Floridian province. The Outer Lands archipelagic region forms the insular northeasternmost extension of the Atlantic coastal plain.
The province's average elevation is less than 900 meters above sea level and extends some 50 to 100 kilometers inland from the ocean.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]  The coastal plain is generally wet, including many rivers, marsh, and swampland.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=This seems unbelievable since most of the land is farmable.|date=December 2008[/tpl] It is composed primarily of sedimentary rock and unlithified sediments and is primarily used for agriculture.Water table management in the eastern coastal plain  The area is subdivided into the Embayed and Sea Island physiographic provinces, as well as the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic coastal plains.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/pl_44sum.htm |title=Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain |accessdate=2010-08-11 |quote=The Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain extends from the Atlantic Ocean, south of Long Island, to the Fall Line, where the hilly Piedmont begins. It is arbitrarily sic separated from the 'South Atlantic Coastal Plain' at the Virginia-North Carolina border (with the exception of the Great Dismal Swamp in the southeast corner of Virginia, which is grouped in the southern area).[/tpl]
