Keepit Dam is a major gated mass concrete gravity dam with an earth fill abutment and a central gated concrete overflow crest and six radial gate spillways across the Namoi River upstream of its junction with the Peel River in the North West Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Keepit.

==Location and features==

Commenced in 1939, with construction halted during World War II, and completed in 1960, the Keepit Dam is a major dam on the Namoi River, located approximately [tpl]convert|56|km[/tpl] west of Tamworth and [tpl]convert|39|km[/tpl] north-east of Gunnedah, upstream of the confluence of the Namoi and Peel rivers. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission to supply water for irrigation, flood mitigation and potable water for the town of Walgett.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statewater.com.au/_Documents/Dam%20brochures/Keepit%20Dam%20Brochure.pdf|format=PDF brochure|title=Keepit Dam|publisher=State Water Corporation|year=2009|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ancold.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dams-Australia-2010-v1-for-website.xls|format=Excel (requires download)|title=Register of Large Dams in Australia|publisher=The Australian National Committee on Large Dams Incorporated|year=2010|accessdate=20 April 2013|work=Dams information[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statewater.com.au/Water%20delivery/Dams/Keepit+Dam|title=Keepit Dam|work=Water delivery: dams|publisher=State Water Corporation|year=|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl]
The dam wall height is [tpl]convert|55|m[/tpl] and is [tpl]convert|533|m[/tpl] long. The maximum water depth is [tpl]convert|48|m[/tpl] and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back [tpl]convert|425510|ML[/tpl] of water at [tpl]convert|329.6|m[/tpl] AHD. The surface area of Lake Keepit is [tpl]convert|4370|ha[/tpl] and the catchment area is [tpl]convert|5700|km2[/tpl]. The central gated overflow crest and six radial gates of the spillway are capable of discharging [tpl]convert|10480|m3/s[/tpl]. An [tpl]AUD[/tpl]146.6Â million upgrade of facilities commenced in 2009 and resulted in the construction of two spillways and three saddle dams, completed during 2011. A further upgrade is due to commence in 2014 for completion by 2016 that will involve raising the height of the main dam wall by [tpl]convert|3.4|m[/tpl] and enhancing post tension in the concrete section of the wall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statewater.com.au/_Documents/Dam%20Safety%20Upgrades/Keepit%20upgrade%20fact%20sheet%20Nov%2012.pdf|format=PDF brochure|title=Keepit Dam Safety Upgrade|publisher=State Water Corporation|date=November 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statewater.com.au/Current+Projects/Dam+Safety+Upgrades/Keepit+upgrade|title=Keepit upgrade|work=Projects: Dam safety upgrades|publisher=State Water Corporation|year=|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl]
Keepit Dam is operated in conjunction with Split Rock Dam. The two dams supply water requirements along much of the Namoi Valley, used for irrigation including cotton, cereal and wheat crops, lucerne, fodder and pasture, vegetables, vines, orchards and oil seeds.

===Power generation===

A hydro-electric power station generates up to [tpl]convert|7.2|MW[/tpl] of electricity from the flow of the water leaving Keepit Dam with an average output of [tpl]convert|10.2|GWh[/tpl] per annum. The station was completed in 1960 and upgraded in 1983. The facility is managed by Eraring Energy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eraring-energy.com.au/Default.aspx?aCateId=860|title=Keepit|work=Generation Portfolio: Hydro Power Stations|publisher=Eraring Energy|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Keepit originates after a riverside property called Keypit or Keepit, resumed for part of the storage area. The word probably means 'keep it', a derogatory remark about the apparent worthlessness of the pastoral run.[tpl]NSW GNR |id=MalplMsyan |title=Keepit Dam |date=30 December 1966 |accessdate=20 April 2013 [/tpl]
