Once Upon a Time… ("Il était une fois…") is a French educational animation franchise, created by Procidis. There are seven distinct series, each focusing on different aspects of knowledge. These are mostly historical, with Once Upon a Time… Man being focused on the overall history of mankind, and most of the others are more focused on specified historical fields, such as the lives and exploits of the explorers or inventors. Life, however, featured an explanation on the workings of the body.
All feature the same stock characters, in similar archetypal roles. "Life" is the only one to not feature the children as grown up or adolescent archetypes of said characters, but as parts of the human organism.
