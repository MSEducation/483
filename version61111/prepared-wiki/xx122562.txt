Mildred B. Davis is an American novelist whose books generally fall into the suspense/mystery genre.
Katherine (Davis) Roome, her daughter, and a published author herself, helped Mildred break a 30-year publishing silence by working with her to turn some previously unpublished manuscripts into the Murder in Maine series.  The third book of this series, however, was written by Mildred quite recently.
