==Background==

Sparks is a concept album.  Each song that is related to a certain project has been released every three months. On 14 March 2011, Heap started work on a new record as fans sent in nearly 900 'sound seeds' (short mundane field recordings, e.g. a dishwasher door, a bicycle, a burning match).  Heap stated that the procedure for the forthcoming album would be to produce tracks three-monthly, with each recorded over a fortnight and released with a video, successively, upon completion.
On 23 March 2011, Heap began referring to "Lifeline", which previously had the working title "#heapsong1".[ref]
</ref> Five days later, on the 28th, the track was mastered during the morning<ref>
