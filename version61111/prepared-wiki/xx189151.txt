==Biography==

Cappadocia was born[tpl]when|date=January 2012[/tpl] and raised in Hamilton. He began playing cello at the age of 3. Cappadocia went on to study classically at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec where he spent much of his spare time studying sounds and music from lesser-known musical traditions in the University's ethno-musicology department.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rufusmusic.com/rufus/bio.html |title=Biography of Rufus Cappadocia |publisher=www.rufusmusic.com |accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl] He left school, and traveled to the South of France and to Spain, where he played as a street musician. In his travels, Cappadocia continued to pick up new sounds and ethnic styles, which he blended into his own.  
Partly to improve his ability to compete with other street musicians Cappadocia decided to "add a bass register" to his cello. He left Europe, and is now based in New York. His musical style blends together "the similarities between seemingly diverse music forms such as blues, Sufi, Middle Eastern and even Gregorian chant. To him they are all compatible, microtonal modes of music."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89816124 |title=Rufus Cappadocia, Bowing a Globetrotting Cello |publisher=www.npr.org |accessdate=2008-04-28[/tpl]
Cappadocia's past collaborations have included participation in the jazz group, The Paradox Trio and the World Music group Trance Mission. He has also produced CDs with guitarist David Fiuczynski and singer/songwriter Bethany Yarrow.
