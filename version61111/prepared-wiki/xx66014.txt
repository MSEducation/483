Boite mac Cin치eda ("Boite son of Kenneth"; also, Bodhe, Boedhe, etc.; d. 1058) was a Scottish prince, son of King Kenneth III of Scotland (Cin치ed mac Duib).
He was the father of Gruoch of Scotland and friend to Findl치ech of Moray, Macbeth of Scotland's father. He arranged the marriage of Macbeth and Gruoch in 1032, which permitted Macbeth to assume the throne of Scotland in 1040. Later, he was behind the short-lived ascension of his grandson, Lulach, to the throne in 1057.
A fictional version of this character appeared in the animated television series Gargoyles.
