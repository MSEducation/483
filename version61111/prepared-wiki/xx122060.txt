==Life and career==

Jody Gnant first received attention when she co-composed and sang on the soundtrack to Cerise Casper's 1996 computer game, Treasure Quest starring Terry Farrell. Some of the songs were co-written by Grammy award-winning producer Richard Feldman. Gnant's tunes were instrumental during the game, and vocal excerpts appeared when certain objects were picked up. The full versions of the songs, though not the instrumentals, were included on a separate CD, Treasure Quest: The Soundtrack.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/reviews/treasurequest.htm |title=Treasure Quest |publisher=Thecomputershow.com |date=1996-04-10 |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl]
In the Phoenix area, she began performing her original, more personal work, which she labeled Bohemian Geek Soul, and moved to a newly renovated Phoenix arts district that was making the transition into a Bohemian artist community.
On July 12, 2005, Kyle MacDonald began a blog called One red paperclip in which he offered to trade a red paperclip and eventually traded up for a new place to live. One item he was eventually traded was a recording contract. When Gnant heard about this, she hurriedly looked for something to trade and eventually was able to offer MacDonald a room in her home with free rent for a year in exchange for the contract. The result of this was her second album, called Pivot, where she was supported by Adrian Goldenthal, Julian Goldenthal, Kris Hill, and Shea Marshall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Pivot-Jody-Gnant/dp/B000X3UHXO |title=Pivot: Jody Gnant: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl] Gnant was also able to meet numerous celebrities, including Alice Cooper and Corbin Bernsen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kjzz.org/news/arizona/archives/200709/afterthepaperclip |title=KJZZ Arizona News: "After the paperclip" |publisher=Kjzz.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.news.com/Blogger-asks,-Wanna-trade-a-paper-clip-for-a-house/2100-1025_3-6061438.html |title=Terdiman, Daniel.
