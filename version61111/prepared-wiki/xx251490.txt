==History==

Hombres G's original label, Lollipop, was unable to further support the band in early 1984.[tpl]Citation|title = HombresG.Net - Official| url=http://hombresg.net/EN/| accessdate = 16 June 2010 [/tpl]
At that time, Ricardo Chirinos, lead singer of Pistones, told Paco Martín that Hombres G would be present at Radio España for an interview regarding one of their concerts at Rock-Ola.  Paco had just established a new label, Twins, and signed a contract with the band after attending one of their concerts.[tpl]Citation|title = HombresG.Net - Official| url=http://hombresg.net/EN/| accessdate = 16 June 2010 [/tpl]
Hombres G began recording their new album two weeks later at Estudios Trak.  The band recorded "Venezia", a new version of the previous single, and the soon-to-be hit, "Devuélveme a mi chica".  Among the album's ballads was a cover of Alice Cooper's "I Never Cry", which they named "No lloraré".  They also adapted Vladimir Cosma's song "Reality" from the motion picture, La Boum, and called it "Sin ti".

Twins initial release attempts weren't very successful and Pepe Escribano, a partner of Paco Martín, decided to leave the company.  Weeks later, however, Hombres G broke into the mainstream and sales of the album leaped.[tpl]Citation|title = HombresG.Net - Official| url=http://hombresg.net/EN/| accessdate = 16 June 2010 [/tpl]

In 2010, the following statement appeared on HombresG.Net, referring to the controversial content of the song "Matar a Castro":  "If Fidel hears me, please know that I'm sorry, that even though I don't like him, I don't have an interest for his death, his or anyone's; that was a youth's naivety.  - David Summers" [tpl]Citation|title = HombresG.Net - Official - Contest: Original Hombres G Poster| url=http://hombresg.net/EN/reglascontest.html| accessdate = 16 June 2010 [/tpl]
