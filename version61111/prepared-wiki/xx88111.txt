[[Aichryson]]

CATEGORIES: Crassulaceae

Aichryson is a genus of about 15 species of succulent, subtropical plants, mostly native to the Canary Islands, with a few in the Azores, Madeira and Morocco, and one in Portugal.
The species of Aichryson are not frost-resistant. They are related to Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium and Monanthes, readily seen in their similar flowers.

==Relationships==

Recent phylogenentic studies of Crassulaceae indicate that Aichryson is closely related to Monanthes and Aeonium (both genera are also largely endemic to the Canary Islands).  Two other genera of Crassulaceae that have many-parted (polymerous) flowers (Sempervivum and Jovibarba) are not closely related to the three Canary Island genera.Ham and 't Hart. (1998).

Systematic Botany, 27: 271-288
On the Canary Islands, the center of species diversity seems to be the island of La Palma  Relationships within Aichryson were investigated by Fairfield et al. (2004) Systematics and Evolution248: 71-83.  They found that the five subspecies of A. pachycaulon were not each other's closest relatives (monophyletic) and additional species may need to be erected after additional study.
