==About==

Miller Park is named for Dr. George L. Miller, a founding father of the city of Omaha. He was the first physician in Omaha, and later in life, a major landowner throughout the city, including all of the area comprising the neighborhood today.Larsen and Cotrell. (1997) The Gate City: A history of Omaha. University of Nebraska Press. p 72. Miller was also the first president of the City of Omaha Board of Park Commissioners.
Once considered a possible location for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898.(nd) Locating the Exposition. Retrieved 5/29/07. It was a running consideration for the Expo because of its accessibility via the Florence Boulevard, a north-south thoroughfare once regarded as "The Prettiest Mile" because it captured the best views of the Missouri River valley, and because of the wide-open fields the area offered.(n.d.) Historic Omaha After losing out to Kountze Park to the south because of its distance from the city, the Miller Park neighborhood rebounded, quickly developing with upper-middle-class homes surrounding the perimeter of the park.Wakeley, Arthur.

Miller Park was established in 1891 after George Miller failed to locate the Trans-Mississippi Exposition there two years before. He convinced the city of Omaha to build Omaha's Prettiest Mile Boulevard to the park the following year, which later became known as Florence Boulevard.
