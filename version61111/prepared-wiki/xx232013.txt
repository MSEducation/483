==History==

Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.Stratasy company history, Funding Universe
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.Stratasys, Inc.

In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.Stratasys purchases IBM's rapid prototyping technology; PRNewswire, 3 Jan 1995

In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.[tpl]cite web |title=Wohlers Report 2008 |last=Wohlers |first=Terry |year=2008 |publisher=Wohlers Associates |url=http://wohlersassociates.com/[/tpl]
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers.Stratasys and HP join forces to make 3D printers; Shapeways, January 19. 2010  In August 2012, the 
HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew their license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".

===Merger with Objet===

On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.Stratasys and Objet Complete Merger; BusinessWire, December 3, 2012
