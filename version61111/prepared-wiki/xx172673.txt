Tekzilla is an American biweekly video podcast on the Revision3 network (Tekzilla is released every Tuesday and Thursday). It is hosted by Patrick Norton and Robert Heron, with Roger Chang (who also acts as the show's producer) as a frequent guest host.  For the first 14 episodes of Tekzilla, Patrick's co-host was Jessica Corbin, who made a guest appearance on episode 16 confirming she has left the show. In November 2013, Veronica Belmont left the show. She had been a host on Tekzilla since 2008.http://blog.revision3.com/2013/11/12/veronica-belmont-says-farewell-to-tekzilla-and-revision3/

==Format==

Tekzilla is a viewer question, review, and technology news show, a mix between The Screen Savers and Call for Help (and featuring some of the same on-air talent as those shows). Each show begins with a brief rundown of that episode's segments followed by an overview of the sponsors. After a short title sequence the hosts introduce themselves and talk about events that happened to them and events that are coming up, before moving onto questions. It has become a common trait of the show to have special guests answer specialist questions the hosts may be unable to provide answers for.
For a few weeks in 2008, Revision3 broadcast Tekzilla live; this has been stopped for uncited reasons. However, PA Serafina is quoted on the forums for saying, "There's details and red tape we still need to figure out. I'll keep you updated".Live taping of Tekzilla – Page 17
In more recent episodes viewers have been urged to upload video questions on YouTube; building on this Roger Chang mentioned during one of the 2008 live shows that he thinks having live Skype calls would be a good addition to the show. However, now that live shows have ceased this seems unlikely to happen.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Set==

Since Spring 2009, Tekzilla has had a change of set, as pictured to the left. This includes a new area with a cityscape with red sunrays (similar to the Tekzilla logo) behind it. In addition, the old faux brick wall has been painted white and has had various other cosmetic changes from the 2007-2009 set.Tekzilla Sneak Peek #6 | Flickr – Photo Sharing! The set has two Vizio televisions – on Tekzilla Daily they are used to show screenshots, on the main show they are mostly used to show the Tekzilla logo and occasionally the output of a monitor. Since January 2009, the Tekzilla set has occupied the space previously used by Internet Superstar, a previous Revision3 show.Revision3 Forums – View Single Post – Something's Coming to Tekzilla...
