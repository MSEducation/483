==Description==

Shell-mimic hydroids grow as calcified colonies of 0.5-2cm thick on shells of living snails. The colony has a pale chalky skeleton and cream to orange hydranths (feeding individuals).Millard, N.A.H. 1975. Monograph on the Hydroida of Southern Africa. Ann. S. Afr. Mus. 68:1-513

==Distribution==

This colonial animal is found only off the South African coast from the west coast to Durban subtidally and to 500m under water.

==Ecology==

After the death of the mollusc the colony may continue growing in an open spiral. The colony often develops into spines and outgrowths, growing to such an extent that the colonised shell becomes unrecognisable.
