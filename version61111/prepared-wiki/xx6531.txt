LimeWire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client program that ran on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other operating systems supported by the Java software platform.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.limewire.com/download/releases | title = Downloads[/tpl] LimeWire used the gnutella network as well as the BitTorrent protocol.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.limewire.com/features | title = Features[/tpl] A freeware version and a purchasable "enhanced" version were available.

On October 26, 2010, U.S. federal court judge Kimba Wood issued an injunction forcing LimeWire to prevent "the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality" of its software in Arista Records LLC v.

==Features==

Written  in the Java programming language, LimeWire is able to run on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers were provided for Apple's Mac OS X, Microsoft's Windows, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.
LimeWire offers the sharing of its library through the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP). As such when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it, any files shared will be detectable and downloaded on the local network by DAAP-enabled devices (e.g., Zune, iTunes). Beginning with LimeWire 4.13.9, connections can be encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Following LimeWire 4.13.11, TLS became the default connection option.[tpl]cite web | url=http://wiki.limewire.org/index.php?title=Changelog | title = Changelog[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl]

==Version history==

Until October 2010, Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based developer of LimeWire, distributed two versions of the program: a basic free version, and an enhanced version, LimeWire PRO, sold for a fee of US$21.95 with 6 months of updates, or $34.95 with 1 year of updates.Lime Wire PRO. The company claimed the paid version provides faster downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one time, whereas the free version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.Lime Wire » Download LimeWire.
Being free software, LimeWire has spawned forks, including LionShare, an experimental software development project at Penn State University, and Acquisition, a Mac OS X-based gnutella client with a proprietary interface. Researchers at Cornell University developed a reputation management add-in called Credence that allows users to distinguish between "genuine" and "suspect" files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005 report states that some of LimeWire's free and open source software contributors have forked the project and called it FrostWire."FrostWire Beta Released", from Slyck.com.
LimeWire was the second file sharing program after Frostwire to support firewall-to-firewall file transfers, a feature introduced in version 4.2, which was released in November 2004. LimeWire also now includes BitTorrent support, but is limited to three torrent uploads and three torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary downloads. As of LimeWire 5.0, an instant messenger has been added which uses the XMPP Protocol, an open source communication protocol. Users can now chat and share files with individuals or a group of friends in their buddy list.
From version 5.5.1, LimeWire has added a key activation, which requires the user to enter the unique key before activation the "Pro" version of the software. This has stopped people from illegally downloading the "Pro" versions. However, there are still ways to bypass this security feature, which was done when creating the pirate edition. For example, there are currently cracks available on the internet, and people can continue using the LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta, which also includes AVG for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.
Versions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11, however, do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional. As a result, neither the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) nor Lime Wire LLC have the ability to disable older versions of LimeWire, unless the user chooses to upgrade to a newer version of LimeWire.
On November 10, 2010, a secret group of developers called the "Secret Dev Team" sought to keep the application working by releasing the "LimeWire Pirate Edition".[tpl]cite web|url=http://limewireinfo.com/limewire-brought-back-to-life-by-secret-dev-team/|title=Limewire Brought Back to Life by Secret Dev Team|date=November 21, 2010|work=Limewire Info|accessdate=November 21, 2010[/tpl] The software is based on LimeWire 5.6 Beta, and is aimed to allow Windows versions to still work and remove the threat of spyware or adware. The exclusive features in LimeWire PRO were also unlocked, and all security features installed by Lime Wire LLC were removed.Andrew Lyle. LimeWire resurrected by Secret Dev Team. Neowin.net.

==Forks and alternatives==

A number of forks from LimeWire have appeared, with the goal of giving users more freedom, or objecting to decisions made by LimeWire LLC they disagreed with.

===FrostWire===

FrostWire was started in September 2004 by members of the LimeWire open source community, after LimeWire's distributor considered adding "blocking" code, in response to RIAA pressure and the threat of legal action, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.. When eventually activated, the code could block its users from sharing licensed files. This code was recently changed when lawsuits had been filed against LimeWire for P2P downloading. It had blocked all their users and redirected them to FrostWire.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] FrostWire has since completely moved to the BitTorrent protocol from Gnutella (LimeWire's file sharing network).

===LimeWire Pirate Edition===

In November 2010, as a response to the legal challenges regarding LimeWire, an anonymous individual by the handle of Meta Pirate released a modified version of LimeWire Pro, which was entitled LimeWire Pirate Edition.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp|title=Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team - News & Opinion |publisher= Pcmag.com|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|date=11.09.2010|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=November 30, 2010[/tpl] It came without the Ask.com toolbar, advertising, spyware, and backdoors, as well as all dependencies on LimeWire LLC servers.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/11/horde-of-piratical-monkeys-resurrects-limewire-pirate-edition.ars|title=Horde of piratical monkeys creates LimeWire: Pirate Edition|last=Anderson|first=Nate|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=November 30, 2010[/tpl]
In response to allegations that a current or former member of Lime Wire LLC staff wrote and released the software, the company has stated that: "is not behind these efforts. LimeWire does not authorize them. LimeWire is complying with the Court’s October 26, 2010 injunction."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/limewire-is-back-as-limewire-pirate-edition-2010119/|title=LimeWire is back as LimeWire Pirate Edition (UPDATED) – Tech Products & Geek News |last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=Nov 9, 2010  |publisher=Geek.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010[/tpl]

==Criticism==

On February 15, 2010, LimeWire reversed its previous anti-bundling stance and announced the inclusion of an Ask.com-powered browser toolbar which must be explicitly opted-out to prevent installation.Limewire Blog[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] The toolbar sends web and bittorrent searches to Ask.com, and LimeWire searches to an instance of LimeWire on the user's machine.
In LimeWire versions before 5.0, users could accidentally configure the software to allow access to any file on their computer, including documents with personal information. Recent versions of LimeWire do not allow unintentional sharing of documents or applications. In 2005, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a consumer warning regarding the dangers of using peer-to-peer file sharing networks, stating that using such networks can lead to identity theft and lawsuits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/06/p2p.shtm |title=FTC Issues Report on Peer-to-Peer File Sharing |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2011[/tpl] On May 5, 2009, a P2P industry spokesman represented Lime Wire and others at a U.S. House of Representatives legislative hearing on H.R. 1319, "The Informed P2P User Act."http://dcia.info/documents/testimony/5-5%20DCIA%20WrittenTestimony.pdf
One investigation showed that of 123 randomly selected downloaded files, 37 contained malware – about 30%.PC Pro Magazine, September 2008 issue, p. 109. In mid-2008, a Macintosh trojan exploiting a vulnerability involving Apple Remote Desktop was distributed via LimeWire affecting users of Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard.Firms discover Trojan horse targeted at Mac OS X. The ability to distribute such malware and viruses has also been reduced in versions of LimeWire 5.0 and greater, with the program defaulting to not share or search for executable files.
Prior to April 2004, the free version of LimeWire was distributed with a bundled program called LimeShop (a variant of TopMoxie), which was spyware. Among other things, LimeShop monitored online purchases in order to redirect sales commissions to Lime Wire LLC. Uninstallation of LimeWire would not remove LimeShop. With the removal of all bundled software in LimeWire 3.9.4 (released on April 20, 2004), these objections were addressed.Lime Wire » Features History. LimeWire currently has a facility that allows its server to contact a running LimeWire client and gather various information.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/golden/freedom-speech-based-approach-limiting-filesharing-part-ii-block-list |title=A Freedom-of-Speech-based Approach To Limiting Filesharing – Part II: The Block List |publisher=Freedom-to-tinker.com[/tpl]
An identity theft scheme involving LimeWire was discovered in Denver in 2006.Police: File sharing key to ID theft scheme By Howard Pankratz. Denver Post, October 27, 2006. On September 7, 2007, Gregory Thomas Kopiloff of Seattle was arrested in what the U.S. Justice Department described as its first case against someone accused of using file sharing computer programs to commit identity theft. According to federal prosecutors, Kopiloff used LimeWire to search other people's computers for inadvertently shared financial information and then used it to obtain credit cards for an online shopping spree.U.S. arrest puts spotlight on file-sharing risk.
LimeWire automatically receives a cryptographically signed file, called simpp.xml, containing an IP block list. Blocking certain IPs has become commonplace and even considered essential in P2P filesharing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

==Injunction==

According to a June 2005 report in The New York Times, Lime Wire LLC was considering ceasing its distribution of LimeWire because the outcome of MGM v. Grokster "handed a tool to judges that they can declare inducement whenever they want to."[tpl]Cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/technology/28peer.html?pagewanted=2 | last = Zeller | first = Tom | title = Sharing Culture Likely to Pause but Not Wither |work=New York Times | accessdate =April 15, 2008 | date=June 28, 2005[/tpl]
On May 12, 2010, Judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC that LimeWire and its creator, Mark Gorton, had committed copyright infringement, engaged in unfair competition, and induced others to commit copyright infringement.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/technology/13lime.html |title=Court Rules That LimeWire Infringed On Copyrights |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 13, 2010 | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck[/tpl][tpl]Citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10632737 |title=Music Biz Wins Big in LimeWire Copyright Case |work=ABC News [/tpl] On October 26, 2010, LimeWire was ordered to disable the "searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality" after losing a court battle with the RIAA over claims of copyright infringement.
