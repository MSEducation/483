CATEGORIES: 1996 albums, You Am I albums

Hourly, Daily is an album by the Australian rock band, You Am I, released in July 1996. The album is Tim Rogers' portrait of Australian life, spread across 15 tracks. Themes include childhood, suburbia and relationships. The album also seems to run the course of a day, "Good Mornin'" beginning with an alarm clock, ending with the question of "Who Takes Who Home" on a night out, and after a period of silence, the hidden track entitled "Forget It Sister" begins with 'good morning baby..'
The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. In October 2010, Hourly, Daily, was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums with their previous album, Hi Fi Way (1995) at No. 8.[tpl]Cite book | title = 100 Best Australian Albums | last1 = O'Donnell | first1 = John | authorlink1 = John O'Donnell (music journalist) | last2 = Creswell | first2=Toby | authorlink2 = Toby Creswell | last3 = Mathieson | first3 = Craig | authorlink3 = Craig Mathieson | publisher = Hardie Grant Books | date = October 2010 | location = Prahran, Vic | isbn = 978-1-74066-955-9 [/tpl]

==Track listing==

All songs written by Tim Rogers.

===Australian version===

===International version===

The international release (June 1997) replaced the songs "Someone Else's Home" and "Moon Shines on Trubble" with "Opportunities" and "Trike", supposedly to increase its overseas appeal by including songs that did not explicitly refer to Sydney or Australia. The international version also replaced the sleeve photo of the ubiquitous Australian overhead telegraph pole with a simpler photo of the band playing live. Unlike the original issue, the new cover also had the virtue of fitting in with You Am I's recurring theme of retro-styled album covers.

===Beat Party! (Live At Wiseold's)===

Some copies of the album came with a live bonus disc of songs recorded in May 1996 with Greg Hitchcock on second guitar and organ.
