==Technical highlights==

Peugeot has equipped the European-market 508 with its HDI common-rail diesel engines. The 1.6-litre HDI 112 can be fitted with the e-HDI 'micro hybrid' system, including an electronically-controlled automatic gearbox, which reduces fuel consumption to [tpl]convert|67.2|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on[/tpl] with CO2 emissions of 109 g/km.[tpl]cite web|author=weenedonpetrol wrote: |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Peugeot-508-1.6-e-HDi-112-Active/255139/ |title=Peugeot 508 1.6 e-HDi Active Review |publisher=Autocar |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl] Though this matches the Volkswagen Passat Bluemotion, it features a slightly larger fuel tank which allows it to cover a slightly longer range of 1017 miles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-reviews/peugeot/508-saloon/1-6-e-hdi-112-sr-4dr/summary/62348 |title=Peugeot 508 1 6 E Hdi 112 Sr 4dr Review | What Car? |publisher=Whatcar.com |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl]
At least two e-hdi engines are available in 2011 and 2012. The first engines had emission of 114 g/km. The later model reduces emissions to 109 g/km. A modified air intake is the cause.
The 508 range will also include PSA's HYbrid4 diesel-electric hybrid powertrain, which will reduce fuel consumption further, to [tpl]convert|74.3|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus|abbr=on[/tpl] with CO2 emissions of 99 g/km.[tpl]cite web|author=Kindsey says: |url=http://speedencounter.com/2011/10/30/peugeot-508-hybrid-4-road-tax-free/ |title=Peugeot 508 Hybrid 4 road tax free |publisher=Speed Encounter |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2012-05-25[/tpl]
The top GT version comes with a [tpl]Convert|201|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl], 2.2-litre turbodiesel engine which generates [tpl]Convert|338|lbft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. It comes mated solely to a six-speed torque converter automatic gearbox which offers manual shifts via paddles or a central selector.

At the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, Peugeot revealed a hybrid-electric crossover station wagon variant of the 508. To distinguish it from other 508s, the RXH features flared wheel arches, as well as a new color-coded grill with 3 columns of LED headlights on each side. The Hybrid4 powertrain combined a 120 kW 2.0 litre HDi FAP diesel engine with a 28 kW electric motor to lower fuel consumption to 4.2 l/100 km. The RXH was released in early 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Peugeot 508 RXH Revealed with Hybrid4 Power And All-wheel-drive|url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/52095/peugeot-508-rxh-brings-hybrid-power-and-all-wheel-drive|accessdate=17 September 2011|newspaper=TheMotorReport.com.au|date=12 July 2011[/tpl]
