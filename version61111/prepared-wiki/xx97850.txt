Pauline Julien, [tpl]Post-nominals|country=CAN|CQ[/tpl] (May 23, 1928[tpl]dash[/tpl]October 1, 1998) was a singer, songwriter, actress, feminist activist and Quebec sovereigntist.
Born in Trois-Rivières, Québec, Julien was the companion of the poet and Québec provincial MLA Gérald Godin, another Trifluvian and sovereigntist. Julien performed pro-independence songs in Montréal clubs as early as 1964.
In 1970, Julien and Godin were arrested during the October Crisis and were released eight days later without charge.
In 1994 France decorated her with the title Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres. Julien was made a Chevalière de l'Ordre national du Québec.
Diagnosed with a debilitating brain disease, Julien took her own life in late September 1998 in Montreal.
