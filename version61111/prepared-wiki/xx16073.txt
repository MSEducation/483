The exact origin of the Yorkshire pudding is, as yet, unknown. The first ever recorded recipe appears in a book in 1737.

==History==

When wheat flour began to come into common use for making cakes and puddings, cooks in the north of England devised a means of making use of the fat that dropped into the dripping pan to cook a batter pudding while the meat roasted in the oven. In 1737, a recipe for 'a dripping pudding' was published in The Whole Duty of a Woman:[tpl]cite book | last = Lady | first = A | first2 = William |last2 = Kenrick | title = The Whole Duty of a Woman | publisher = | year = 1737 | location = London | pages = | url =[/tpl]
Similar instructions were published in 1747 in The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse under the title of 'Yorkshire pudding'. It was she who re-invented and renamed the original version, called Dripping Pudding, which had been cooked in England for centuries, although these puddings were much flatter than the puffy versions known today.[tpl]cite book | last = Glasse | first = Hannah | authorlink = | title = The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy | publisher = Applewood Books | date = 1 June 1998 | location = | pages = | url = | isbn = 978-1-55709-462-9 [/tpl]
The Yorkshire pudding is meant to rise in a correctly executed preparation. A 2008 ruling by the Royal Society of Chemistry has it that "A Yorkshire pudding isn't a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than four inches tall".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/aboutus/news/pressreleases/2008/perfectyorkshire.asp |title=Yorkshire pudding must be four inches tall, chemists rule |date=12 November 2008 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=8 January 2014[/tpl]
The Yorkshire pudding is a staple of the British Sunday lunch and in some cases is eaten as a separate course prior to the main meat dish. This was the traditional method of eating the pudding and is still common in parts of Yorkshire today. Because the rich gravy from the roast meat drippings was used up with the first course, the main meat and vegetable course was often served with a parsley or white sauce.
Traditionally, though less so now, the Yorkshire Pudding could be served as a sweet, with sugar, golden syrup, jam, or even with orange juice as a sauce.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]
It is often claimed that the purpose of the dish was to provide a cheap way to fill the diners, thus stretching a lesser amount of the more expensive ingredients as the Yorkshire pudding was traditionally served first.[tpl]cite web |title=Secret of a perfect Yorkshire pud |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/7729470.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 November 2008 |date=14 November 2008[/tpl]

==Cooking method==

Yorkshire pudding is cooked by pouring a batter made from milk (or water), flour and eggs into preheated, oiled, baking pans, ramekins or muffin tins (in the case of miniature puddings). A basic formula uses [tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl] cup flour and [tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl] cup liquid per egg.
