==Music video==

The video starts out in a drive way with Rick Ross and a woman (played by video model Kia Samuel) in a car, parked at her house. He is talking to the woman and the woman's mother comes out of the house and yells for her to come back inside, because she does not like her daughter dating Rick Ross since he is a thug. The camera later flashfowards and shows them successful and at a mansion. Inside, men are with their girlfriends. Nelly and Avery Storm also make cameos rapping their verses. The video proceeds and it shows multiple parts of the house, which all show Rick Ross with the woman walking, laughing, and talking. It also shows flashbacks of when they were poor and the struggles of their relationship. After the song ends, the video cuts to Ross' other song, "Maybach Music."
DJ Khaled, Ace Hood, Pitbull, Brisco, Gunplay,  and Larry Hughes make cameo appearances.
