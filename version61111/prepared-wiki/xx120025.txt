The Katětov–Tong insertion theorem is a theorem of point-set topology proved independently by Miroslav KatětovMiroslav Katětov, On real-valued functions in topological spaces, Fundamenta Mathematicae 38 (1951), 85–91. http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/tresc.php?wyd=1&tom=38 and Hing TongHing Tong, Some characterizations of normal and perfectly normal spaces, Duke Mathematical Journal 19 (1952), 289–292. [tpl]doi|10.1215/S0012-7094-52-01928-5[/tpl] in the 1950s. 
The theorem states the following:
This theorem has a number of applications and is the first of many classical insertion theorems. In particular it implies the Tietze extension theorem and consequently Urysohn's lemma, and so the conclusion of the theorem is equivalent to normality.
