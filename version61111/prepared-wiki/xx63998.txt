James Busby (7 February 1802 – 15 July 1871) is widely regarded as the "father" of the Australian wine industry, as he took the first collection of vine stock from Spain and France to Australia.J. Robinson (ed) "The Oxford Companion to Wine" Third Edition  pg 116 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0-19-860990-6 Later he became a British Resident who traveled to New Zealand, involved in the drafting of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and the Treaty of Waitangi. As British Resident, he acted as New Zealand's first jurist, and the 'originator of law in Aotearoa', to whom New Zealand owes almost all of its underlying jurisprudence'.Jamieson, Nigel (1986), "The Charismatic Renewal of Law in Aotearoa", New Zealand Law Journal, July 1986, pp. 250-255

==Life==

He was born in Scotland, the son of English engineer John Busby and mother Sarah Kennedy.[tpl]DNZB|Claudia|Orange|1B54|Busby, James - Biography|4 April 2011[/tpl] His family emigrated from Britain to New South Wales in 1824.
On his arrival in Sydney, Busby was appointed a teacher of viticulture at the Male Orphans School at Bald Hills near Liverpool. The school closed in 1850. Busby served out his contract and taught the stipulated two hundred days at the Male Orphans' Farm. Busby then received a Grant of Land from the Governor and after much careful deliberation he chose a block in the Coal River area of the Hunter Region.
In 1828 Busby returned to England, before visiting Spain and France to further his study in viticulture. Busby returned to Australia in 1828.

===In New Zealand===

In March 1832 he was appointed to the position of British Resident of New Zealand and went to the Bay of Islands, taking with him some of the vine stock he had collected in Europe. He married Agnes Dow at Segenhoe, in the Hunter Region, New South Wales on 1 November 1832.
A house was completed for him at Waitangi where he planted a vineyard from which wine was being made before his vines were productive in Australia.
His duties were to protect British commerce, control, and mediate between the unruly Pākehā settlers and Māori in New Zealand.  However he was not provided with any resources to impose this authority.
James Busby proposed that New Zealand should have a national flag, after an unregistered New Zealand ship was seized in Australia.  A selection of three or four designs was sent from Australia, and one was chosen by the Māori chiefs at a meeting at his residency on 20 March 1834; see United Tribes of New Zealand.

====Independence and Treaty of Waitangi====

In 1835 Busby learned that Baron Charles Philippe Hippolyte de Thierry, a Frenchman, was proposing to declare French sovereignty over New Zealand.  He drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and at a meeting in October signed it together with 35 chiefs from the northern part of New Zealand.
After the arrival of William Hobson, he co-authored with him the Treaty of Waitangi.  It was signed on 5 and 6 February 1840 on the lawn outside his residence. Busby and his family left Waitangi that year. He declined an offer for a position in the new colonial government, and instead focused on farming interests, but became entangled in litigation over his land titles: the New Zealand Banking Company seized his Waitangi property without giving Busby's debtors an opportunity to pay what they owed, and Governor Grey expropriated Busby's land at Whangarei.  He also edited a newspaper and served as a member of the Auckland Provincial Council. He contested the 1860 general election for a seat in the House of Representatives for the Bay of Islands electorate, but was unsuccessful.[tpl]cite news|title=Page 6 Advertisements Column 1 |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=DSC18601207.2.30.1|accessdate=4 June 2010|newspaper=Daily Southern Cross|volume=XVII |issue=1356 |date=7 December 1860|page=6[/tpl]
