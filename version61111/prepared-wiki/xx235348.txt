Domaine de Bargylus is a wine estate on the slopes of the Al-Ansariyah mountains in Syria.  These mountains produced notable wines in pre-Islamic times.Rawlinson, George (2005) History of Phoenicia I.B. Tauris, London, page 184, ISBN 1-84511-019-6 

==History==

Work on the winery was begun in 2003[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] by the Johnny R.Saadé Family, and produced its first vintage in 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl].
The Saadé family, of orthodox Christian origins, is originally from the coastal city of Latakia, known in ancient times as Laodicea-by-the-sea.
The Saadé family traces its mercantile roots to the 18th and 19th century with prominent representatives such as Gabriel Saadé (1854-1939) and Rodolphe Saadé (1900-1956). 
With an initial involvement in commodities’ trading and various industries, the family developed maritime and land transport activities on the initiative of Johnny R. Saadé, Rodolphe’s son, in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and France. 
Diversification was to follow with new activities in the wine making, tourism, real estate and financial fields.

==The Cellar==

The Agence Epure, under the direction of Serge Lansalot, architect in Libourne (France), developed a winery concept, on behalf of Bargylus, with the latest equipment available in the field.
The facility is made of 3400 m2 of construction including a 2880 hectoliters capacity winery, two designated spaces for stocking wine with a capacity of 840 barrels. Bottling as well as stocking (600,000 bottles) are done in the estate.
Along with the development is a large tasting facility that will be open regularly to the public.
The modern architecture of Chateau Bargylus is inspired by the local architectural identity with the use of stones and predominantly planted terraces.

==Ingredients==

Bargylus uses Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot grapes for its red wines, and Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc grapes for its white wines.
