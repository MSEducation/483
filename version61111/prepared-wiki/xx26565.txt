Shepton Mallet is a small rural town and civil parish in the Mendip district of Somerset in South West England. Situated approximately [tpl]convert|18|mi[/tpl] south of Bristol and [tpl]convert|5|mi[/tpl] east of Wells, the town is estimated to have a population of 10,369.[tpl]cite web|title=Shepton Mallet Parish|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=11128402&c=Shepton+Mallet&d=16&e=61&g=6461369&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1388577201310&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2491|work=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl] It contains the administrative headquarters of Mendip District Council.
The Mendip Hills lie to the north, and the River Sheppey runs through the town. Shepton Mallet lies on the route of the Fosse Way, the principal Roman road into the south west of England, and there is evidence of Roman settlement. The town contains a fine parish church and a considerable number of listed buildings. Shepton Mallet Prison was England's oldest prison still in use until its closure in March 2013.
In medieval times, the wool trade was important in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century to be replaced by other industries such as brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider. Shepton Mallet is the closest town to the site of the Glastonbury Festival, the largest music festival in Europe. Also nearby is the Royal Bath and West of England Society showground which hosts the Royal Bath and West Show, and other major shows and festivals.

==History==

The name Shepton derives from the Old English scoep and tun, meaning 'the sheep enclosure'; the Domesday Book of 1086 records a settlement known as Sceaptun.[tpl]cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Bush (historian)|title=Somerset: The Complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|location=Wimborne|year=1994|pages=179–181|isbn=1-874336-26-1[/tpl] The current spelling is recorded at least as far back as 1496, in a letter from Henry VII. The second part of the name derives from that of the Norman Malet family who took a lease from Glastonbury Abbey around 1100. The second 'L' appears to have been added in the 16th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=9–10 and 102[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimborne, Dorset |isbn=1-874336-03-2[/tpl]

===Prehistoric settlement===

Archaeological investigations have found evidence for prehistoric activity in the Shepton Mallet area, with substantial amounts of Neolithic flint being found, as well as some pottery fragments from the late Neolithic period. The two barrows on Barren Down, to the north of the town centre, have been found to contain cremation burials from the bronze age, and a further bronze age burial site contained a skeleton as well as some pottery. The remains of iron age roundhouses were found at Cannard's Grave, in the vicinity of what would later become the Fosse Way, along with artefacts such as quernstones and beads, and a probable iron age farm settlement enclosure has been identified at Field Farm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_Shepton_MalletText.pdf |title=Shepton Mallet|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|year=2003|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] In the countryside surrounding the town, there is evidence of iron age cave dwellings in Ham Woods, to the north-west, and a number of burial mounds have been identified at Beacon Hill, a short distance north of the town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheptonmallet.info/site/index.php?page_id=194|title=Shepton Mallet Prehistory|publisher=Shepton Mallet Town Council|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl]

===Roman occupation===

Shepton Mallet is situated approximately half-way between the Roman towns of Bath and Ilchester on the Fosse Way, and, although there are no visible remains (apart from the line of the Roman road itself), there is archaeological evidence for both early military, and later civilian, settlement lasting into the 5th century. Domed pottery kilns, with pottery still in situ, were identified on the site of the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery in the mid-19th century, suggesting military activity in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Several hoards of Roman coins ranging from the 1st to 4th centuries have also been found, as well as over 300 fibula brooches, potsherds and other artefacts. In addition, a few isolated burials near the route of the Fosse Way were found during the 19th century.
A lead coffin within a rock-cut grave was discovered at a site adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave was found to be part of a larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was within a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.[tpl]cite book |last=Leach |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Shepton Mallet: Romano-Britons and Early Christians in Somerset |year=1991 |publisher=University of Birmingham Field Archaeology Unit and Showerings Ltd |location=Birmingham |isbn=0-7044-1129-6|pages=24–25[/tpl]
A particularly notable find in the Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at the time thought to be from the 5th century, and so held to be among the earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England. A copy of the amulet was presented to the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet now resides in the Museum of Somerset, analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as the silver within it dated to the 19th century or later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/19/archaeology.anglicanism|title='Roman' amulet adopted by archbishop is a fake|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=19 September 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 September 2008 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/2982490/Ancient-Christian-amulet-declared-a-fake.html|title='Ancient' Christian amulet declared a fake|last=Savill |first=Richard|date=18 September 2008|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 September 2008 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7622395.stm|title=New tests challenge age of amulet |date=18 September 2008|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4761172.ece|title=Romano-British silver Christian cross may be fake|last=de Bruxelles |first=Simon|work=Times Online|publisher=The Times|accessdate=18 September 2008 | location=London | date=16 September 2008[/tpl]
As well as the cemeteries, the excavations in the 1990s confirmed the presence of a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including both local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops and nail cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Romans' lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late 1st, or early 2nd, century to the late 4th, or early 5th, century, although as no public buildings were found the settlement was probably not, technically, a town.

===Saxon and Norman period===

There is a small amount of evidence of Saxon settlement in the town, including some Saxon stonework in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. In addition, a charter of King Ine of Wessex, dating from 706 and witnessed by nine Bishops including the Archbishop of Canterbury, records the granting of the area in which Shepton Mallet is now situated to Abbot Berwald of Glastonbury Abbey.[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=1–3[/tpl] According to some legends Indract of Glastonbury was buried in Shepton.[tpl]cite book |title=West Country Churches |last=Robinson |first=W.J. |year=1915 |publisher= Bristol Times and Mirror Ltd|location=Bristol |pages=144–149[/tpl] The town fell within the Whitstone Hundred, and the hundred courts were held at Cannard's Grave, a short distance to the south of the town.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|pages=31–32[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|page=16[/tpl]
The Exeter Domesday Book records that, at the death of Edward the Confessor in 1066, the site was held (probably by lease from the Abbey) by one Uluert, and by Roger de Corcella at the time of the survey in 1086. When Roger de Corcella died, sometime before or around 1100, the land passed to the Malets, a very prominent Norman family, who caused their name to be added to that of the settlement (and also of another of their holdings, Curi – now Curry Mallet).[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|page=10[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|page=23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheptonmallet.info/site/index.php?page_id=222|title=Shepton Mallet Norman History|publisher=Shepton Mallet Town Council|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheptonmallet.info/site/index.php?page_id=223 |title=Shepton Mallet Middle Ages History|publisher=Shepton Mallet Town Council|accessdate=13 February 2010[/tpl]

===Middle Ages===

The Malet family retained the estate until the reign of King John, when on the death of William Malet (fl. 1192–1215) (and on the payment by his sons-in-law of a fine of two thousand marks, due to William having participated in a rebellion against the King) it passed through his daughter Mabel to her husband Hugh de Vivonne. Some generations later, the part of the estate containing Shepton Mallet was sold to a relative, Sir Thomas Gournay. His son, also called Thomas, participated in the murder of Edward II, and his estates were confiscated by Edward III in 1337. However the family regained favour with the King some years later, and the lands were returned. When Mathew de Gournay died childless in 1406, the estate again reverted to the Crown, before being granted out to Sir John de Tiptoft. It was once again confiscated from his son by Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses (due to the family siding with Edward IV), but was restored to Sir John's grandson, Edward Tiptoft, when Edward IV regained the throne. However, he died without issue, and there followed a succession of grants and reversions until Glastonbury Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII, and the Abbey's lands, including Shepton Mallet, were granted to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1536.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|pages=7–11[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=23–24r[/tpl] (but with some probable errors due to confusing William Mallet (died 1071) with William Mallet (fl. 1192–1215))
Charters for the holding of markets and fairs were granted in 1235 (though this charter was swiftly revoked following objections by the Bishop of Wells to the competition it represented to the market in that city), 1260 and 1318, and indicate that the town was developing and prospering in the 13th and early 14th centuries.[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=26–29[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|page=32[/tpl] However the Black Death struck the town in 1348, reducing the population to about 300.[tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=32–33[/tpl] In the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the population and economy of the town were bolstered by the arrival of craftsmen and merchants from France and the Low Countries who came to England to escape wars and religious persecution in their home countries. They introduced cloth-making which, together with the local wool trade, became a major industry in Shepton and other towns in Somerset and Wiltshire.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|pages=13–14[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=33–34[/tpl] Indeed, it appears that wool became such a source of riches for the town that when, in 1496, Henry VII needed to raise money to fight the Scots, he called upon the wool-merchants of Shepton to contribute £10 to the cause:[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=32–34[/tpl]

===Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion===

In 1625, a House of Correction was established in Shepton Mallet.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.sheptonmallet.info/site/index.php?page_id=189 | work=Shepton Mallet Town Council | title= Historic Buildings of Shepton Mallet | accessdate=30 August 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Disney|first=Francis |title=Shepton Mallet Prison (2nd Ed) |year=1992 |publisher=Published by the Author|isbn=0-9511470-2-1[/tpl] Also in updated form as a CD-ROM (2001), see "Shepton Mallet Prison: 390 years of prison regime"
In the English Civil War the town supported the parliamentary side, although Shepton appears to have mostly escaped conflict apart from a bloodless confrontation between supporters of the King, led by Sir Ralph Hopton, and Parliament, led by Colonel William Strode, in the market place on 1 August 1642.[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=11–12[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=44–49[/tpl] which contains a full account of the events of 1 August 1642 In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax led the New Model Army through the town on the way to capturing Bristol, and in 1646 the church organ was apparently destroyed by Cromwellian soldiers.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|page=14[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|page=19[/tpl]
During the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, the Duke of Monmouth was welcomed when he passed through Shepton Mallet, staying in Longbridge House[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266493|title=Longbridge House|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] in Cowl Street on the night of 23 June, with his men quartered throughout the town, before setting out for Bristol the following day. Many Shepton men joined the cause, but Monmouth failed to take Bath or Bristol and had to return to Shepton on 30 June. Following the Battle of Sedgemoor, the Duke fled and spent the night of 6 July at Downside, a mile north of Shepton, before continuing his flight for two more days before his capture. Following the Bloody Assizes, twelve local supporters of Monmouth were hanged and quartered in the Market Place of the town.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|pages=16–20[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|pages=13–14[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=50–60[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=The hidden places of Somerset |last=Scott |first=Shane |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1995 |publisher=Travel Publishing Ltd |location=Aldermaston |isbn=1-902007-01-8 |page=56 [/tpl]
In 1699 Edward Strode built almshouses, close to the rectory his family had built to house the town's grammar school, which lasted until 1900.

===18th to 20th centuries===

In the 17th and 18th centuries the wool and cloth industries continued to thrive, powered by the waters of the River Sheppey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Documents/MinutesAndReports/Meetings%202004/Shepton%20Mallet%20&%20Wells%20Area%20Board/13.07.04/Agenda%20Item%2016%20-%20appendix%201.doc |title=The Inclusion of the Anglo Bavarian Brewery area In the Shepton Mallet Conservation Area |accessdate=3 January 2008 |format=Microsoft Word |work=Mendip District Council | date= June 2004 [/tpl] There were reputed to be 50 mills in the town and surrounding area in the early 18th century,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_Shepton_MalletText.pdf |title=Shepton Mallet|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|year=2003|accessdate=2 February 2010|pages=22–23[/tpl] and a number of fine clothiers' houses survive, particularly in Bowlish, a hamlet on the western edge of Shepton Mallet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266513&mode=quick|title=Old Bowlish House|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266480|work= Images of England|title=Bowlish House|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266481 |work= Images of England|title=Bowlish House Gate Piers and Mounting Block|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266483&mode=quick|work=Images of England|title=Combe House, Bowlish|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266511&mode=quick|work=Images of England|title=Park House, Bowlish|publisher=English Heritage[/tpl] Although  these industries  employed some 4,000 people towards the end of the century,[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|page=30[/tpl] they were already beginning to decline by this time. Discontent at the introduction of mechanisation into the mills resulted in the deaths of two men in a riot in the town in 1775, an event which apparently discouraged the mill-owners from pursuing modernisation,[tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|page=78[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|page=25[/tpl] a decision which resulted in Shepton's cloth trade losing out to the steam-powered mills in the north of England in the early 19th century.

While wool, cloth and silk were declining, other industries were growing, and in the 19th and 20th centuries brewing, in particular, became one of the town's major industries. The Anglo-Bavarian Brewery,[tpl]cite web | title=Anglo Trading Estate (former brewery, now warehouses) | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=266476|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010[/tpl] built in 1864 and still a local landmark, was the first brewery in England to brew lager. At its height, the brewery was exporting 1.8 million bottles a year to Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, South America and the West Indies. It closed in 1921.[tpl]cite book |title=The Anglo: The History of the Anglo Bavarian Brewery, Shepton Mallet, 1864–1994 |last=Davis |first=Fred |publisher=J H Haskins & Son Ltd |location=Shepton Mallet |year=1994[/tpl] However the town, which is the home of Babycham, is still an important centre for cider production.
For a period during World War II, Shepton Mallet Prison was used to store important national records from the Public Record Office, including Magna Carta, the Domesday Book, the logbooks of HMS Victory, dispatches from the Battle of Waterloo, and the "scrap of paper" signed by Hitler and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain at the Munich Conference of September 1938. The Prison also became a US Army detention facility, and between 1943 and 1945 eighteen American servicemen were executed within the prison walls, having been convicted by US court-martial of murder, rape or both.
The population of Shepton Mallet was fairly stable throughout the 19th century and first part of the 20th century: in 1801, the population was 5,104 and in 1851 it was only slightly more at 5,117, though in 1901 it had swelled to 5,446, before falling back to 5,260 in 1951.[tpl]cite book |last=Farbrother |first=John E. |authorlink= |title=Shepton Mallet: Notes on its History, Ancient, Descriptive and Natural (Memorial Edition) |year=1872 |place=Bridgwater|publisher=Reprinted by Somerset County Library 1977|isbn=0-9503615-3-4|page=45[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|page=39[/tpl] By 2001, however, it had increased significantly, to 8,981.

==Geography==

Shepton Mallet lies in the southern foothills of the Mendip Hills. The area is geologically founded on Forest Marble, Blue Lias and Oolitic limestone.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Publication.asp?id=SX9452-A7821E79|title=Shepton Mallet Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Proposals|year=2007|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=30 December 2008|page=12|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110927075028/http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Publication.asp?id=SX9452-A7821E79|archivedate=27 September 2011[/tpl]

===Nearby cave systems===

To the north of the town are several caves of the Mendip Hills, including Thrupe Lane Swallet which is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and the St. Dunstan's Well Catchment which is an important cave system including a series of spectacularly-decorated caves which in total extend to about [tpl]convert|4|mi|km[/tpl] of mapped passage. The caves at Fairy Cave Quarry were formed mainly by the erosive action of water flowing beneath the water-table at considerable pressure (so called 'phreatic' development), but as the water table has fallen many of the caves now lie well above it and the system now contains a variety of cave formations (stalagmites, stalactites and calcite curtains) which in their extent and preservation are amongst the best in Britain. Shatter Cave and Withyhill Cave are generally considered to be amongst the finest decorated caves in Britain in terms of their sheer abundance of pure white and translucent calcite deposits.Moseley, Gina (2005), A Study into the Microclimatology of Shatter Cave, southwest England with comparison to Uamh an Tartair, northwest Scotland, presented to the British Cave Research Association.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000377.pdf|title= St. Dunstan's Well Catchment | publisher= English Nature |accessdate=20 July 2006[/tpl] Small numbers of greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (R. hipposideros) and Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) hibernate in the cave system. An area of nationally rare species-rich unimproved calcareous grassland of the Sheep's-fescue-Meadow Oat-grass type occurs in the field to the east of Stoke Lane Quarry.[tpl]cite web | title=St. Dunstan's Well Catchment | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000377.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=20 July 2006[/tpl]

===Surrounding countryside===

The countryside surrounding the town is mostly given over to farming, although there are a few areas of nearby woodland. Approximately [tpl]convert|1.8|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] to the northeast of the town centre is Beacon Hill Wood (owned by the Woodland Trust),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/our-woods/Pages/wood-details.aspx?wood=4670|title=Beacon Hill Wood|publisher=The Woodland Trust|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl] Ordnance Survey [tpl]gbmapping|ST638460[/tpl] which is at the crossing of the Fosse Way and another Roman road which runs along the top of the Mendip Hills, and which contains a number of tumuli.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beaconhillsocietymendip.org.uk/M04.html|title=Archaeology in Beacon Hill Wood|publisher=Beacon Hill Society|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl] To the northwest of the town are Ham Woods,Ordnance Survey [tpl]gbmapping|ST605452[/tpl] within which are the Windsor Hill railway tunnels and a viaduct,[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=22878|title=Viaduct, Ham Woods|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|year=2007|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl] remnants of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdjr.net/locations/masbury.html|title=Masbury and Windsor Hill|publisher=Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl] The East Mendip Way long-distance path passes around the northern edge of Shepton Mallet and through Ham Woods.
South-west of the town is the Friar's Oven SSSI which is the site of herb-rich calcareous grassland classified as the Upright Brome (Bromus erectus) type,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1005579.pdf|title=Friar's Oven SSSI Citation Sheet|publisher=English Nature|accessdate=22 February 2010[/tpl] and north-east is the Windsor Hill Quarry geological SSSI, and also the Windsor Hill Marsh biological SSSI, a marshy silted pond with adjacent damp, slightly acidic grassland which is of interest for its diverse flora, in large part down to the varied habitats present within the small area. Two species are present which are rare in Somerset: Flat-sedge (Blysmus compressus) and Slender Spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis). Other marshland plants found here include Purple Loosestrife, Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus), Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus), Soft Rush (J. effusus), Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), three species of Horsetail Equisetum spp. and seven sedges Carex spp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001243.pdf|title=Windsor Hill Marsh SSSI Citation Sheet|publisher=English Nature|accessdate=22 February 2010[/tpl]

===River Sheppey===

The centre and oldest parts of Shepton Mallet are adjacent to the River Sheppey, and thus at the bottom of a valley, approximately [tpl]convert|115|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level. The edges of the town lie about [tpl]convert|45|m|abbr=on[/tpl] higher up. The river has cut a narrow valley, and between Shepton Mallet and the village of Croscombe, to the west, it is bounded by steeply-sloping fields and woodland. However the river flows through much of Shepton Mallet itself in underground culverts. The river occasionally floods after heavy rain, such as on 20 October 2006,[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/england/somerset/6068790.stm |title=Fifty homes struck by river flood|work=BBC|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=2 January 2009[/tpl] and again on 29 May 2008,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2053640/Floods-in-south-west-England-Clean-up-begins.html |title=Floods in South West England|work=Daily Telegraph|date=30 May 2008|accessdate=2 January 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Savill[/tpl] when rainfall was so heavy that  the culverts were unable to cope with the volume of water, resulting in the flooding of some of the lower-lying parts of the town.  Some houses around Leg Square, Lower Lane and Draycott Road were submerged to a depth of [tpl]convert|1|m[/tpl]. A study by the Environment Agency identified that the current standard of flood protection in those parts of the town was insufficient, being of a 5–10 year event standard; current guidelines require protection of a 50–200 year standard.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Download.asp?path=%2FDocuments%2FMinutesAndReports%2FMeetings+08%2FCMCP%2F09+Dec+08%2FFlooding+in+Shepton+Mallet%2Eppt|title=Flooding in Shepton Mallet|publisher=Presentation by the Environment Agency to the Central Mendip Community Partnership at Mendip District Council|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl] The Agency began construction of a flood alleviation scheme, costing about £1.3 million, in the summer of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Shepton_Mallet_LL_Factsheet_dec_11.pdf|title=Work to start on Shepton Mallet flood improvements|publisher=Environment Agency|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=June 2010|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120307171527/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Shepton_Mallet_LL_Factsheet_dec_11.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2012[/tpl]

===Areas of the town===

Within Shepton Mallet there are several distinct areas which originated as separate communities around the central point of the church and Market Place.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stone|first=Alan|title=Shepton Mallet: A Visible History|year=2005|publisher=Shepton Mallet Local History Group|isbn=0-9548125-1-4|page=26[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Fred |authorlink= |coauthors= Blandford, Alan|coauthors=Beckerleg, Lewis |title=The Shepton Mallet Story (2nd Ed) |year=1977 |publisher=The Shepton Mallet Society |location=Oakhill, Somerset|isbn=978-0-9500568-1-4|pages=36–37[/tpl] The town centre is small, basically consisting of two streets: High Street, which runs south from the Market Place towards the Townsend Retail Park, and the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge. To the east, separated from the Market Place by the Academy complex, is the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. Lower Lane, which runs under Waterloo Bridge along the bottom of the river valley to the north of the town centre, is one of the few parts of the town where the River Sheppey runs above ground. At the eastern end is Leg Square, which is surrounded by three large houses originally built by owners of some of the town's mills.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stone|first=Alan|title=Shepton Mallet: A Visible History|year=2005|publisher=Shepton Mallet Local History Group|isbn=0-9548125-1-4|page=16[/tpl] Very close by is Cornhill, on which the prison stands.
Moving roughly eastwards, Garston Street, also in the valley-bottom, consists of a long-row of weavers' and other artisans' cottages dating from the 17th century.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stone|first=Alan|title=Shepton Mallet: A Visible History| year=2005| publisher=Shepton Mallet Local History Group| isbn=0-9548125-1-4|pages=27–28[/tpl] The eastern end of this area, adjacent to Kilver Street, is now occupied by the cider breweries. Across Kilver Street (the A37) is Kilver Court, which over the course of the 20th century has been a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business and then the headquarters of the leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stone|first=Alan|title=Shepton Mallet: A Visible History| year=2005| publisher=Shepton Mallet Local History Group| isbn=0-9548125-1-4|pages=23–24[/tpl] Behind are the Kilver Court Gardens, originally built by Showerings for the recreation of their staff and set against the backdrop of part of the Charlton Viaduct, which are now open to the public.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.kilvercourt.com/garden|title=Kilver Court Gardens|accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl] On the eastern edge of the town is Charlton where there are former breweries and mills, now converted into a trading estate, and right on the edge of the town is to be found Charlton House, a luxury hotel and spa.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.charltonhouse.com/|title=Charlton House Hotel and Spa|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl]
On the southern side of the town, on a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by the line of the former East Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road, is Tadley Acres, a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The development has been praised for the quality of its design and the use of locally sourced natural building materials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/files/housing-audit-2006.pdf|title=Housing audit: Assessing the design quality of new housing in the East Midlands, West Midlands and the South West|publisher=Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment|pages=28–31, 50–53 and 62|year=2007|accessdate=19 February 2010[/tpl] North of the former railway line is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Immediately to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which, at the start of the 20th century, had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House[tpl]cite web|url= http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/Maps/OS62htm/4112.htm|title=Shepton Mallet: 2nd Edition Ordnance Survey Map|publisher=Somerset Record Office|year=1903|accessdate=23 February 2010[/tpl] and then a shoe-factory, is the Townsend Retail Park which was built in 2006-2007.
West Shepton, which forms the south-west corner of the town, is dominated by the former Shepton Mallet Union Workhouse, a grade II listed building originally constructed in 1848,[tpl]cite web|title=Norah Fry Hospital|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266600|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]  which later became the Norah Fry Hospital (a mental health hospital), and is now a housing development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norahfrysheptonmallet.co.uk/|title=Norah Fry (Shepton Mallet) Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] Nearby, on the western edge of the town, is the modern community hospital. Moving northwards, back down into the river valley, are two hamlets, Darshill, once the site of a number of mills,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_Shepton_MalletText.pdf |title=Shepton Mallet|last=Gathercole|first=Clare|work=Somerset Urban Archaeological Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council|year=2003|accessdate=2 February 2010|page=22[/tpl] and Bowlish, which contains several grand clothiers' houses. The steeply-sloping fields adjoining the river between Bowlish and the rest of the Shepton Mallet are known locally as The Meadows, to the east of which is Hillmead, a council housing estate built in the 1960s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Publication.asp?id=SX9452-A7821E79|title=Shepton Mallet Conservation Area Character Appraisal and Management Proposals|year=2007|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=30 December 2008|page=15|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110927075028/http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Publication.asp?id=SX9452-A7821E79|archivedate=27 September 2011[/tpl]

===Climate===

Along with the rest of South West England, Shepton Mallet has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.
Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.[tpl]cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=20 September 2010[/tpl]

==Demography==

In the 2001 census, the population was 8,981, comprising 4,482 (49.9%) males and 4,499 (50.1%) females. 1,976 (22%) residents were aged 16 or below, 5,781 (64.4%) between 16 and 65, and 1,224 (13.6%) aged 65 or over.[tpl]cite web|url= http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination |title=Neighbourhood Statistics (Shepton Mallet Civil Parish)|year=2001|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=30 December 2008[/tpl]
Of the population aged between 16 and 74, 4,200 (66%) were in employment, with only 224 (3.5%) unemployed (the remainder being economically inactive). About 69% of those in employment were in service industries, with the remainder in manufacturing. 1,459 people were employed in managerial or professional occupations, 522 were self-employed, and 1,888 in routine and semi-routine occupations.
3,714 households were recorded in the town, of which 2,621 (70.6%) were owner-occupied, 515 (13.9%) rented from private landlords, and 578 (15.6%) rented from the local authority or other social landlords. 3,688 (99.3%) heads of households were white.
In late 2008, Mendip District Council's estimate of the town's population was 9,700.

==Economy==

There is a local perception that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Documents/A%20Portrait%20of%20Shepton.pdf|title=A Portrait of Shepton Mallet|publisher=Mendip District Council and Strategic Partnership|date=December 2008|accessdate=17 February 2010|page=2|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110927072115/http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Documents/A%20Portrait%20of%20Shepton.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011[/tpl] Some 350 manufacturing jobs were lost in the late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a more balanced economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.
The town centre is fairly small with a high proportion of empty premises in Market Place and the north end of High Street adjacent to Market Place. However, the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge has had significant investment in its heritage in the last five years and now enjoys almost full occupancy of its shops.
Over the course of 2010 an 'artisan quarter' of independent shops is starting to emerge in Town Street and Market Place.
Since 2004, Shepton Mallet’s town centre buildings have benefitted from two conservation schemes, the Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mendip.gov.uk/Download.asp?path=%2FDocuments%2FMinutesAndReports%2FMeetings+2010%2FCMCP%2F20%2E04%2E10%2FItem+12+Shepton+Mallet+Heritage+Economic+Regeneration+Scheme%2Edoc |title=Central Mendip Community Partnership report: Shepton Mallet Heritage Economic Regeneration Scheme|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl] and the Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheptonthi.co.uk/site/|title=Shepton Mallet Townscape Heritage Initiative|publisher=Mendip District Council|accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl] which provided grants for the repair of buildings, reinstatement of architectural features and enhancement of public spaces, as well as community involvement, education and training. As the body which made the bid for the funding, Mendip District Council has administrated both schemes, but all decisions are made by a steering group comprising the main stakeholders in the town.
For centuries there has been a general market held each Friday in the Market Place. The market has been in decline for some years and in 2010 attempts were made to revitalise it. However, after initial interest the number of stallholders slowly decreased.[tpl]cite news|title=Use shops to boost town|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/shepton/text/Use-shops-boost-town/article-2829161-detail/article.html|accessdate=10 November 2010|newspaper=Shepton Mallet Journal|date=4 November 2010[/tpl]

Retail jobs in the town increased in number in 2006–2007 when a new shopping development, including a large supermarket owned by Tesco, clothes store and other retailers, was constructed on a site just south of the town centre which had once been a factory making Clarks shoes and later Doc Martens boots. This development attracted national media attention when protesters occupied the site to try to prevent the felling of an avenue of trees dating back to the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bristol.indymedia.org/newswire.php?story_id=24695|title=Tree Protest Camp established at Shepton Mallet, Somerset[/tpl] It has also divided opinion in the town, between those who hoped it would help to revitalise the town, and others who feared that local traders would be unable to compete, leading to a further decline of Shepton Mallet's high street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/backstage/2009/05/what-did-you-think-of-the-one-34.html|title=The One Show|date=18 May 2009|publisher=BBC One|accessdate=18 February 2010[/tpl] and [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/consumer/2009/05/18/is_your_high_street_healthy.html|title=Is you high street healthy?|date=18 May 2009|publisher=BBC One|accessdate=18 February 2010[/tpl] There is also the Mulberry Factory Shop[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mulberryfactoryshop.com/#/contactus/storesandstockists/|title=Mulberry Factory Shop Locator|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl] located on Kilver Street, near to the former location of the Mulberry headquarters.

As well as the annual Royal Bath and West Show and other agricultural shows, the Royal Bath & West Showground near Evercreech, [tpl]convert|2.5|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south-east of the town, hosts events  such as the New Wine and Soul Survivor christian festivals and the National Adventure Sports Show, fairs and markets including the Shepton Mallet International Antiques & Collectors' Fair, and exhibitions and trade shows such as the National Amateur Gardening Show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bathandwest.com|title=Royal Bath & West Society|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl]

==Transport==

The A37 road passes through Shepton Mallet from north to south; it follows the line of the Fosse Way between the south of the town and Ilchester.
The A361 from Frome skirts the eastern edge of Shepton Mallet on its way to Glastonbury, and the  A371 from Castle Cary passes through the town on its way west to Wells; for some distance, both routes follow the line of the A37.
Shepton Mallet had railway stations on two lines, both now closed. The first station, called Shepton Mallet (High Street) in British Railways days, was on the East Somerset Railway branch line from Witham and opened in 1859.[tpl]cite book|last=Oakley|first=Mike|title=Somerset Railway Stations|publisher=Dovecote Press|location=Wimborne|year=2002|isbn=978-1-904349-09-9[/tpl] The line was extended to Wells in 1862 and later connected to the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. Through services between Yatton and Witham started in 1870. The line was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s.
A second station, later called Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road), opened in 1874 with the building of the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.[tpl]cite book|last=Butt|first=RJV|title=The Directory of Railway Stations|publisher=Patrick Stevens Ltd|year=1995|isbn=978-1-85260-508-7[/tpl] This station was some distance east of the centre of the town and was approached on the Charlton Viaduct.
Both stations closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. Shepton Mallet (High Street) closed with the withdrawal of passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of the former East Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet.

Shepton benefits from a sizeable park, a gift of land from a local man, John Kyte Collett. As a boy he was thrown out of the grounds of local estates for trespass so in later life he purchased and gave land to the town to provide a public space; this park, which opened in 1906, is called Collett Park in his honour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sheptonmallet.info/site/index.php?page_id=398|title=Opening of Collett Park 1906|publisher=Shepton Mallet Town Council|accessdate=16 February 2010[/tpl]

==Religious sites==

The Grade I listed parish church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the 12th century, but the current building is largely from the 15th century, with further rebuilding in 1836. The oak wagon roof, made up of 350 panels of different designs, separated by 396 carved foliage bosses (supposedly every one different) and with 36 carved angels along the sides, was described by British historian Nikolaus Pevsner as "the finest 15th century carved oak wagon-roof in England". It was restored, at a cost of £5,000, in 1953–54.[tpl]cite book|last=Ford|first=Eric|title=Shepton Mallet: An Historical and Postal Survey|year=1958|publisher=Published by the Author|place=Oakhill, Somerset|page=19 and appendix 3[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0-906456-98-3 |page=20 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=266464 |title=Church of St Peter & St Paul |publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2010 |work=Images of England [/tpl]
