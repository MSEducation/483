[[De Sitter space]]

CATEGORIES: Exact solutions in general relativity, Riemannian geometry

De Sitter space was discovered by  Willem de Sitter, and, at the same time, independently by Tullio Levi-Civita.
More recently it has been considered as the setting for Special Relativity rather than using Minkowski space, since a group contraction reduces the isometry group of de Sitter space to the Poincaré group, allowing a unification of the spacetime translation subgroup and Lorentz transformation subgroup of the Poincaré group into a simple group rather than a semi-simple group. This alternate formulation of Special Relativity is called de Sitter relativity.

==Definition==

De Sitter space can be defined as a submanifold of a Minkowski space of one higher dimension. Take Minkowski space R1,n with the standard metric:
De Sitter space is the submanifold described by the hyperboloid of one sheet
De Sitter space can also be defined as the quotient O(1,n)/O(1,n−1) of two indefinite orthogonal groups, which shows that it is a non-Riemannian symmetric space.
Topologically, de Sitter space is R × Sn−1 (so that if n ≥ 3 then de Sitter space is simply-connected).

==Properties==

The isometry group of de Sitter space is the Lorentz group O(1,n). The metric therefore then has n(n+1)/2 independent Killing vectors and is maximally symmetric. Every maximally symmetric space has constant curvature. The Riemann curvature tensor of de Sitter is given by
De Sitter space is an Einstein manifold since the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric:
This means de Sitter space is a vacuum solution of Einstein's equation with cosmological constant given by
The scalar curvature of de Sitter space is given by
For the case n = 4, we have Λ = 3/α2 and R = 4Λ = 12/α2.
