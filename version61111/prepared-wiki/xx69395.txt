The FIFA Women's World Cup 2003, the fourth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, was held in the United States and won by Germany.[tpl]cite news|author=Jere Longman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/13/sports/soccer-golden-goal-proves-magical-as-germany-captures-women-s-world-cup.html |title=SOCCER; Golden Goal Proves Magical as Germany Captures Women's World Cup - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=13 Oct 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl] The tournament was originally scheduled for China. On 3 May 2003 the tournament was abruptly moved to the United States, as a result of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/07/sports/sp-socrep7 |title=SARS Threatens Staging of Women's World Cup - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=7 Apr 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl] Because the United States had hosted the 1999 World Cup, it was thought the United States could best organize the tournament in the little time remaining before the October scheduled start. In addition, women's soccer boosters in the United States hoped that interest generated by the tournament would save the U.S. women's professional league, the Women's United Soccer Association, from folding.[tpl]cite web|author=Jere Longman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/sports/soccer-us-replaces-china-as-host-of-soccer-s-women-s-world-cup.html |title=SOCCER; U.S. Replaces China As Host of Soccer's Women's World Cup - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=1 Nov 2012[/tpl]
In compensation for losing the tournament, China retained its automatic qualification as host, and was named as host for the 2007 event.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/17/sports/sp-womensoc17 |title=World Cup Leans to the West - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=17 Jun 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Jere Longman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/27/sports/soccer-us-replaces-china-as-host-of-soccer-s-women-s-world-cup.html |title=SOCCER; U.S. Replaces China As Host of Soccer's Women's World Cup - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=27 May 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/20/1063625250200.html |title=China paid $1.5m for losing women's world cup |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=20 Sep 2003 |accessdate=30 Oct 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2003/05/04/china_reax_ap/ |title=SI.com - Soccer - China 'respects' decision to move women's World Cup - Sunday May 04, 2003 07:46 AM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=30 Oct 2012[/tpl]
Mostly due to the rescheduling of the tournament on short notice, FIFA and the United States Soccer Federation were forced to creatively schedule matches. Nine doubleheaders were scheduled in group play (similar to the 1999 format). They also had to abandon the modern practice of scheduling the final matches of the group stage to kick off simultaneously. In Groups A and D, the final matches were scheduled as the two ends of a doubleheader. The final matches in Groups B and C were also scheduled as doubleheaders, but split between two cities, with a Group B match in each city followed by a Group C match. The four quarterfinals were also scheduled as two doubleheaders, and both semifinals were also a doubleheader.[tpl]cite news|author=Jere Longman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/17/sports/soccer-the-group-dynamics-of-the-women-s-world-cup.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=SOCCER; The Group Dynamics of the Women's World Cup - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=17 Sep 2003 |accessdate=31 Jul 2012[/tpl]
