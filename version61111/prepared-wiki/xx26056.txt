Mark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former swimmer, 9–time Olympic champion, and former world record holder.  He won seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, an achievement only surpassed by Michael Phelps who won eight golds at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.  Spitz set new world records in all seven events in which he competed, a record that still stands. Since the year 1900, no other swimmer has ever gained so great a percentage of all the medals awarded for Olympic events held in a single Games. 
Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds plus a silver and a bronze, five Pan American golds, 31 US Amateur Athletic Union titles, and eight US National Collegiate Athletic Association titles. During those years, he set 35 world records, but 2 were in trials and unofficial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishsports.net/BioPages/MarkSpitz.htm |title=International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame |publisher=Jewishsports.net |date=February 10, 1950 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~radiotv/wtiu/doc/people_spitz.html |title=www.indiana.edu |publisher=www.indiana.edu |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] With his 7-gold medal performance at Munich in 1972, he was the most decorated athlete in the history of the Olympic Games until Michael Phelp's 8-gold medal performance at Beijing 36 years later in 2008. He was named World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971, and 1972 by Swimming World magazine. He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals.

==Early life==

Spitz was born in Modesto, California, the first of three children[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Spitz.html |title=Jewish Virtual Library. ',Spitz', |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] of Arnold and Lenore (Smith) Spitz. His family is Jewish, the grandparents left Hungary after World War II.[tpl]cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1207/14/pmt.01.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com[/tpl]What are the reasons for the success of so many Hungarian Jewish Athletes When he was two years old, Spitz's family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki Beach every day. "You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide." Lenore Spitz told a reporter for Time (April 12, 1968). At age six his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored seven Olympic medal winners including Spitz.
Before he was 10, Spitz held 17 national age-group records, and one world record.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]
At 14 his family moved to Santa Clara so Spitz could train with George F. Haines of the Santa Clara Swim Club. From 1964 to 1968 Mark trained with Haines at SCSC and Santa Clara High School. During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]. It was a remarkable and unprecedented achievement. In 1966 at age 16 he won the 100 meter butterfly at the National AAU Championships, the first of his 24 AAU titles. The following year Mark set his first world record at a small California meet in the 400 meter freestyle with a time of 4:10.60, and emerged on the world swimming stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.santaclaraswimclub.org/alumni/spitzUpdate.html |title=Santa Clara Swim Club.

==Swimming career==

===Maccabiah Games===

The 1965 Maccabiah Games was his first international competition. At age 15 in Tel Aviv, Spitz, won four gold medals and was named the most outstanding athlete.
He returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete in the Maccabiah Games. This time he won six gold medals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/4523/Spitz-Mark--Swimming-Isn-t-Everything.html |title=Mark Spitz – "Swimming Isn't Everything" |publisher=Sports.jrank.org |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.Great Jewish Men By Elinor Slater, Robert Slater. Jonathan David Company, 1996. ISBN 0-8246-0381-8
In 1985 Spitz lit a torch to open the Maccabiah Games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Maccabiah.html |title=Jewish Virtual Library ',Maccabiah Games', |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
In 2005 he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 17th Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming.

===Pan American Games===

In 1967 he won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games, thereby setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira, won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.

===1968 Olympics===

Holder of ten world records already[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl], Spitz predicted brashly he would win six golds at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4 × 100 meter freestyle relay in 3:31:70, and the 4 × 200 meter freestyle relay in 7:52:33. In addition, Spitz finished second in the 100m butterfly in 00:56:40. In this event he was beaten by fellow American Doug Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.[ref]He also won a bronze medal in the 100m freestyle in 00:53:00 at the same games.
International Olympic Committee – Athletes[/ref] Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the world record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4 × 100 meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another World Record swim.

===College training===

Disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance, Spitz decided in January 1969 to swim for the Indiana University Hoosiers to train with legendary coach, Doc Counsilman,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~ocmhptst/051603/text/doc.html |title=Indiana University Archives |publisher=Indiana.edu |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] who was also his coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman "the biggest decision of my life (and) the best."[tpl]cite book|last1=Hammel|first1=Bob|last2=Klingelhoffer|first2=Kit|title=The Glory of Old Iu: 100 Years of Indiana Athletics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8uobLCQZlhAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=April 24, 2012|year=1999|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-068-1|page=156[/tpl] While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971 he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972.
He was nicknamed "Mark the Shark" by his teammates.

===1972 Olympics===

At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich (West Germany), Spitz was back to maintain his bid for the six gold medals. He did even more, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Further, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events (the 100 m freestyle 00:51:22, 200 m freestyle 01:52:78, 100 m butterfly 00:54:27, 200 m butterfly 02:00:70, 4 × 100 m freestyle relay 03:26:42, 4 x 200 m freestyle relay 07:35:78 and the 4 × 100 m medley relay 03:48:16). Originally Spitz was reluctant to swim the 100m freestyle fearing a less than gold medal finish. Minutes before the race he confessed on the pool deck to ABC's Donna de Varona, "I know I say I don't want to swim before every event but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure." Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record 51.22.[ref]Moore, K. Spitz's mark of seven world records in one Olympic meet was equaled by Michael Phelps in 2008 (This was because Phelps's 100 m butterfly win fell short of the world mark).

===Retirement===

Following the Munich Olympics, even though he was still only 22, Spitz retired from competition.
In 1999 Spitz ranked #33 on ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes, the only aquatic athlete to make the list.
At age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics after film maker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying. Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz did not beat the qualifying limit, despite his times being nearly as good as (and in some cases better than) his medal-winning times 20 years earlier. He was two seconds slower than the requisite qualifying time at the Olympic trials. Dara Torres made her successful Olympic comeback for the 2008 Summer Games, at the same age as Spitz.

===After swimming retirement===

After his retirement from swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency, which tried to get him into show business while his name was still familiar due to his athletic success.
A poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016480.html |title=Spitz lived up to enormous expectations | last=Roberts | first= M. B. | work=ESPN.com | publisher=ESPN |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. On the TV drama Emergency!, he portrayed Pete Barlow, who accidentally shoots his wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy). He also appeared briefly on the The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of then-Governor of California Ronald Reagan in September 1973. 
Spitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panasonic.com/olympics2004/sptiz_bio.html |title=Mark Spitz's biography |publisher=Panasonic.com |year=2004 |accessdate= January 30, 2011[/tpl] In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in Challenge of a Lifetime. He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a  public figure except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics. Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.

===Critical praise===

In 2006 he received critical praise[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] for his narration of Freedom's Fury, a Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's famous Blood in the Water match against Russia during the Revolution of 1956—considered the most famous match in water polo history. The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu, and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.

===Education===

From 1964 to 1968 Spitz attended Santa Clara High School.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] After graduating he went on to Indiana University. At Indiana University from 1968–72, he was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. TIME magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. "I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994874,00.html |first=Alice |last=Park | title=10 Questions For Mark Spitz |work=TIME  |date=August 16, 2004 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]

===Post-swimming career===

In 1972, soon after his return to the US, Spitz landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.[tpl]cite web|author=the ,United States |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/mark-spitz |title=Mark Spitz: Biography from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] However, as the memory of his feat receded, so did his endorsement and promotional deals. As his endorsements faded he started a successful real-estate company in Beverly Hills. He bought a Ferrari and says he made more than $1 million.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] "A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today," Spitz said. "I did very well, thank you very much."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/26/sports/AS-SPT-SWM-Worlds-Mark-Spitz.php?page=1 |title= The New York Times |work=International Herald Tribune |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] "I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts."http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/sports.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-07-27-0133.html
Per his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker.

===Iconic moustache during Olympics===

In an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated "I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one." Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. “It took a long time to grow,” he said.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/pizarro/2007/11/18/mark-spitz-reveals-the-story-behind-his-mustache/ |title=Mark Spitz reveals the story behind his mustache, Around Town |publisher=Blogs.mercurynews.com |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate= January 30, 2011[/tpl] It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a "good-luck piece."[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/4524/Spitz-Mark-Glory-Days.html |title=Mark Spitz – Glory Days – Mustache, World, Soviets, Swimmer, Stroke, and Swimming |publisher=Sports.jrank.org |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
Mark Spitz is quoted as saying, "When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' He's translating as fast as he can for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.healthline.com/blogs/exercise_fitness/labels/performance%20enhancing%20modality.html |title=Extremes, Survival, Injuries, Faster Higher Stronger – Fitness Fixer |publisher=Healthline.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
According to a Sports Illustrated article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. "He looked great with it, don't get me wrong," explained his wife Suzy, "but he looks so handsome without it."[tpl]cite news| title=Catching up with Mark Spitz | url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/2008/07/01/spitz.cuw/index.html?eref=si_topstories |publisher=CNN | date=July 21, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010[/tpl]
When he was asked why he shaved it off he responded "well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache... I'm happy it."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/sports/am-spitz0716,0,2248638.story?track=rss |title=Mark Spitz talks about his mustache (and Michael Phelps) |publisher=Amny.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz commented that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become "too gray."

===Health issues===

After retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease, a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/11653.php |title=Mark Spitz expresses health issues he faced while achieving Olympic dreams |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] "During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms acid reflux to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming," says Spitz. "It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening."
He has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] "People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact," said Spitz. "I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down."

==Olympic controversies==

===1972 medal podium incident===

In 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following the 200-meter freestyle race Spitz arrived to obtain his gold medal barefoot and carrying his shoes. He put them down when the American national anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner" was played. After the anthem played, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.[tpl]cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/spitz_mark.html | title=Spitz lived up to enormous expectations |first=M.B.|last=Roberts | publisher=ESPN Classic | accessdate=August 16, 2008[/tpl]

===Issues with 2008 Summer Olympics===

Spitz felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven gold medal record. In an article, he is quoted as saying, "I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am....I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is."
Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps. He is, however, unhappy that he was not invited to the 2008 Summer Olympics. As a result, Spitz refused to attend the games.[tpl]cite web|author=Related Topics: athletes, olympics, sports |url=http://www.mahalo.com/Mark_Spitz |title=Mark Spitz |publisher=Mahalo.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl] "They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me," he said. "Yes, I am a bit upset about it."[tpl]cite web|author=(AFP) – Aug 10, 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hLnTiMa1nwi9qHodVSMCWbP2WBdQ |title=AFP: Spitz, once the star, upset over Beijing snub |publisher=Google  |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
However, on August 14, 2008 Spitz appeared on NBC's Today Show where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps: [tpl]quote|It’s about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I’m very happy for him. I really, truly am...I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.[tpl]cite web|last=Considine |first=Bob |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26194898/ |title=Spitz on Phelps: ‘I’m rooting him on’ – TODAY in Beijing |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Also on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, Today in L.A., Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that, "Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever."[tpl]cite web|url=http://video.knbc.com/player/?id=285272 |title=Breaking News, NBC Los Angeles |publisher=Video.knbc.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2011[/tpl]
On August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps' performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was "epic". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas:

===Views on drug testing===

Mark Spitz has been consistent in criticism of both swimming's world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its "embarrassing" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/spitz_mark.html |title=ESPN Classic – Spitz lived up to enormous expectations |publisher=ESPN  |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
During a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying "They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s157350.htm |title=AM Archive – Champion swimmer attacks IOC over drug testing |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=July 31, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2011[/tpl]
In August 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported, that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying "the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/la-sp-dwyre2-2008aug02,0,5162507.column?page=2 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Spitz still a man apart, but not by own choice | first=Bill | last=Dwyre | date=August 2, 2008 | accessdate=May 2, 2010[/tpl]
