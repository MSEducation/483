The first single, "Falling in Love", was released and promoted on July 9, when she performed it for the first time at one of her promotional concerts for her beauty products and cosmetic range, SimplySiti in UiTM. It was performed live again a week later at the 10th Anugerah Planet Muzik. The album as of March 2012, has sold a total of more than 70 000 units from both digital and physical releases.

==Background and recording==

In an interview during Secretary Week in March 2011, she revealed that she was working on a fully English album, with six of 10 tracks having been recorded as early as late January of the same year.
For the first time, she worked under the management of What's Up Entertainment, which is owned by her stepson, Adib Khalid[tpl]cite web|title=Kerjasama dengan anak tiri|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&dt=0724&pub=utusan_malaysia&sec=Hiburan&pg=hi_11.htm&arc=hive|language=[tpl]ms icon[/tpl]|author=Mohd. Rasdan Ahmad|date=July 24, 2011|work=Utusan Malaysia| accessdate = 2011-09-23[/tpl] who is only 21 years old. Written and produced almost entirely by Christian Alexanda and Bryan Bouro, the tracks were mixed and mastered in various studios, including mixHaus studios in Los Angeles, Oasis Mastering in Burbank, California and WhyteHype Studios in Perth, Australia.
The idea behind the album began when Siti and her husband Datuk Seri Khalid Mohamad Jiwa visited her stepson's recording company, What's Up Entertainment, and expressed her interest in having few songs written by Alexanda (a recording artist under Adib's management). In less than two months, Alexanda finished writing 10 songs for Siti, and he and Bouro monitored Siti's English pronunciation throughout the recording process while maintaining her "Voice of Asia" identity. Apart from solo tracks, All Your Love also featured vocals from Alexanda, in "I'll Wait Forever", as well as Sean Kingston, who is featured in the final track of the album, "Remember You". Some consideration was given to featuring Pitbull on the album, but owing to financial constraints the idea was dropped.

==Artwork and title==

The main album cover is said to be influenced by the work of Andy Warhol with its brightly coloured hues and stylised portrait of the singer.[tpl]cite web|title=Siti commands All Your Love |url=http://www.ytlcommunity.com/commnews/shownews.asp?newsid=59048|author=YTLCommunity Staff|date=September 27, 2011|work=YTLCommunity.com| accessdate = 2013-02-18[/tpl] When she was asked why she choose "All Your Love" as the title, she said, "The title of the album is dedicated to all my fans, my family and friends who have been so supportive of me over the years. I want to make them proud by producing an album that could potentially break into the international market."[tpl]cite web|title=Siti Nurhaliza's first English album|url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/10/7/music/9630681&sec=music|author=Fiona Ho|date=October 7, 2011|work=The Star|accessdate=2013-02-18[/tpl]
