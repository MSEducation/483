[[Hypercoaster]]

CATEGORIES: Hypercoaster roller coasters, Types of roller coasters

A hypercoaster or megacoaster according to Intamin can mean one of two things:
Or, more narrowly:
Out and back steel coasters smaller than 200 feet in both height and drop such as Steel Eel at SeaWorld San Antonio have sometimes been erroneously referred to as hypercoasters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seaworldparks.com/en/seaworld-sanantonio/Attractions/Rides/Steel-Eel |title=Steel Eel |publisher=SeaWorld.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl]

==History==

The world's first hypercoaster was Magnum XL-200 by Cedar Point, costing $8,000,000 USD. Cedar Point chose Arrow Dynamics to design and construct Magnum XL-200. Construction on the world's tallest and fastest complete circuit roller coaster (at that time) began in 1988. By May 6, 1989, Magnum XL-200 was ready for riders. Since its debut, Magnum XL-200 has served more than 36 million guests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/park/rides/coasters/magnum/index.cfm |title=CP Mobile |publisher=Cedarpoint.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] Cedar Point's official blog states that after building the ride, "discussion was focused on just what a roller coaster such as Magnum should be called. After all, it had no loops like most of the other large steel coasters of the time and was so much bigger and faster than its non-looping brethren. After a couple of years, the name everyone agreed upon was hypercoaster."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/2009/5/23/More_Thoughts_on_Magnum.cfm |title=More Thoughts on Magnum |publisher=Cedarpoint.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-12[/tpl]

==Description==

Hypercoasters were originally built for speed and airtime, to counter the trend of constructing bigger and bigger looping coasters. To accomplish this the elements of a hypercoaster often include a large first drop, several additional drops of declining height, a large turn or helix and then many airtime-inducing hills. Hypercoasters are commonly designed with an out and back layout, although some hypercoasters, such as Raging Bull, are built with a twisted  design.
Hypercoasters dominate the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards. For 2006, Superman: Ride of Steel, now known as Bizarro, located at Six Flags New England was ranked highest at #1. Several hypercoasters followed such as Magnum XL-200 (#3), Nitro (#4), Apollo's Chariot (#5). The hypercoasters make up the majority of the 2006 Top 10 Steel Coasters, filling 8/10 positions.[tpl]cite news |title=The List: 2006 Top 50 Steel Roller Coasters |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/PDF/2006GTAissue.pdf |magazine=Amusement Today |page=26 |date=September 2006 |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl] By 2010, hypercoasters held all of the top 10 spots on Amusement Today's list of "Top 50 Steel Roller Coasters" and 16 of the top 20.[tpl]cite news |title=The List: 2010 Top 50 Steel Roller Coasters |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/PDF/GTA2010issue.pdf |magazine=Amusement Today |page=34 |date=September 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl]
Hypercoasters were first manufactured by Arrow Dynamics in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Since then, a number of companies, including Bolliger & Mabillard, Intamin, D. H. Morgan Manufacturing, Giovanola and others have designed and constructed hypercoasters.
Notably, there has only been one wooden hypercoaster built, Son of Beast at Kings Island. At the time, Son of Beast was the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster. Upon its opening, it was also the only wooden roller coaster to feature a vertical loop, thus disqualifying it from the narrower definition of "hypercoaster". However, the loop was removed in 2006 when Cedar Fair Entertainment Company purchased the park from Paramount. It was standing but not operating (SBNO) from 2009 to 2012 due to a number of problems, including guest complaints about the roughness of the ride.[tpl]cite news |title=What's next for Son of Beast?

==Hypercoasters==

The following are a list of all hypercoasters sorted by opening date:
 Denotes a hypercoaster that is also a giga coaster (any full circuit coaster over 300 ft).
 Denotes a hypercoaster that is also a strata coaster (any full circuit coaster over 400 ft).
 Denotes a coaster that fits the broad but not the narrow definition of a hypercoaster.

===By height===

The following are non-continuous circuit coasters that exceed 200 feet in height or drop, unlike coasters that conform to the hypercoaster "style." However, these shuttle roller coasters are not usually considered hypercoasters.
