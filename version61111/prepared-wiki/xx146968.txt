Imagine That is a country/pop song written for Patsy Cline by Justin Tubb. 
"Imagine That" was one of three minor hits produced by Patsy Cline in 1962. By this time as well, Patsy Cline was already a very successful Country/Pop singer, racking up a string of major hits like "I Fall to Pieces", "Walkin' After Midnight", "Crazy" and "She's Got You". "Imagine That" however was not as successful as its counterparts that were also minor hits for Cline. The song only reached to #21 on the Country charts and to #90 on the Pop charts, failing to gain big success. "Imagine That" was also never featured on her 1962 album either, called Sentimentally Yours. The song discusses how the singer is so devoted to her lover that nothing the lover may do will change that devotion.
"Imagine That" was featured on Sara Evans's album Three Chords and the Truth.
