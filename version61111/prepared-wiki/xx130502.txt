The Lytle Tunnel is a vehicular tunnel that carries InterstateÂ 71 (I-71) under the historic Lytle Park in Cincinnati, in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is a six-lane tunnel with three tubes. There is a two-lane southbound tube, a three lane-northbound tube, and a one-lane southbound tube that separates from the highway and serves as an exit ramp to the downtown area. The tunnel is ventilated by two grates in the northbound tube and the southbound exiting tube. It was completed in 1970.{{cite web|url=http://home.no.net/lotsberg/data/USA/li000.html|title=Road Tunnels in United States During the construction of the Lytle Tunnel, many historic buildings were razed for the project. The old Lytle Park was similar to a town square, with many Greek Revival buildings surrounding the park. On the park's east side is the Taft Museum of Art. A few of the original buildings remain, including the Literary Club of Cincinnati, the Anna Louise Inn, Guilford School building, and the Phelps Apartments.
