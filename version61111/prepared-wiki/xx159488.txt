==Release and promotion==

On June 27, 2007, "Future Baby Mama" was leaked to the Internet via an American online radio station. The first single, "Guitar", was distributed in partnership with Verizon Wireless.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051816/prince-links-with-verizon-for-new-single |title=Prince Links With Verizon For New Single |publisher=Billboard.com |date=[tpl]date|May 31, 2007|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] During the week of September 3, 2007, Prince flew to Prague, and then Spain to film a music video for "Somewhere Here on Earth". The clip was released but it has only been played on the TV channel BET.
Initially, Prince came to an agreement with Columbia Records to distribute the record worldwide. Prince and Columbia had previously teamed up for the release of his Musicology album in 2004.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43561-prince-reunites-with-wendy-lisa |title=Prince Reunites With Wendy & Lisa! |publisher=Pitchfork Media[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2011[/tpl]  However, Prince's management struck a deal with The Mail on Sunday to release Planet Earth as a free covermount CD with the July 15, 2007 edition of the paper. This move brought much criticism from UK record stores which resulted in Columbia refusing to distribute the album in the UK, though its release in the rest of the world remained unaffected.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.news.launch.yahoo.com/dyna/article.html?a=/070628/340/hbc3j.html&e=l_news_dm|title=Prince Album Drama|accessdate=[tpl]date|2007-06-28|mdy[/tpl]|date=[tpl]date|June 28, 2007|mdy[/tpl]|publisher=Yahoo!

Giving away albums for free was not new for Prince. In 2004, he gave free copies of Musicology to all concert goers during the tour of the same name.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.singersroom.com/news/entertainment-story-917.asp |title=Prince Free Album Causes BMG U.K. to Pull Distribution |date=[tpl]date|06/30/2007|mdy[/tpl] |publisher=singersroom.com |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070702132831/http://www.singersroom.com/news/entertainment-story-917.asp |archivedate=[tpl]date|2007-07-02|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Similarly, the Planet Earth album was given away with tickets to his 2007 concerts in London. As a result of the decision by Sony BMG to not distribute the album in the UK, record store chain HMV announced it would stock the 15 July 2007 edition of The Mail on Sunday in lieu of the CD, admitting that "selling the Mail on Sunday next week will be the only way to make the Prince album available to our customers, which, ultimately, has to be our overriding concern".[tpl]cite news| url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2122295,00.html | newspaper=The Guardian | location=London | title=HMV defends about-face over Prince giveaway | first=Stephen | last=Brook | date=[tpl]date|July 9, 2007|mdy[/tpl] | accessdate=[tpl]date|May 22, 2010|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] On July 10, 2007, several days before the official UK release through The Mail on Sunday, a low quality version (recorded from a stream) of Planet Earth was leaked onto the Internet.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Prince Vault |article=Planet Earth |url=http://www.princevault.com/index.php?title=Album:_Planet_Earth&oldid=83109 |date=[tpl]date|22 June 2011|mdy[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]date|2011-09-17|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Prince forwent $4.6 million in licensing fees, but the promotion paid off with his subsequent sold out 21 show concert run at London's O2 Arena, earning him a gross of $23.4 million, and thus a $18.8 million profit.[tpl]cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Terry|title=Loss Leaders: How Companies Profit By Losing Money|url=http://www.cbc.ca/undertheinfluence/season-2/2013/04/20/loss-leaders-how-companies-profit-by-losing-money-1/|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=CBC Radio: Under the Influence|date=20 April 2013[/tpl]
