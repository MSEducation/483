[[Streaking]]

CATEGORIES: Nudity, Streaking

Streaking is the act of running naked through a public place as a prank, a dare or an act of protest. It is often associated with sporting events but can occur in more secluded areas. It usually involves running quickly which also reflects the original meaning of the word before it became associated with nudity. Streakers are often pursued by sporting officials or by the police. 

==History==

On 5 July 1799, a Friday evening at 7 o'clock, a man was arrested at the Mansion House, London, and sent to the Poultry Compter. He confirmed that he had accepted a wager of 10 guineas (equal to £[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|UK|10.50|1799|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] today) to run naked from Cornhill to Cheapside.The Times, 8 July 1799, "Official Appointments and Notices"
The first recorded incident of streaking by a college student in the United States occurred in 1804 at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) when senior George William Crump was arrested for running naked through Lexington, Virginia, where the university is located.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110926214045/http://www.wlu.edu/x52674.xml |title=University Chronology  |publisher=Washington and Lee University  |year=2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011[/tpl] Retrieved from Internet Archive 9 February 2014. Robert E. Lee later sanctioned streaking as a rite of passage for young Washington and Lee gentlemen. Crump was suspended for the academic session, but later went on to become a U.S. Congressman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110917133205/http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000956 |title=CRUMP, George William, (1786 - 1848) |work=Biographical Directory of the United States congress |accessdate=July 1, 2011[/tpl] Retrieved from Internet Archive 9 February 2014.
Streaking seems to have been well-established on some college campuses by the mid-1960s. The magazine of Carleton College described the phenomenon in negative terms associating it with rock culture, drinking and destruction. At that time, streaking was a tradition on the Minnesota campus during January and February when temperatures hovered around zero degrees Fahrenheit.[tpl]cite news |title=Crash Syndrome |newspaper=The Carletonian |author=John Mollenkopf|date=January 26, 1967| accessdate=January 27, 2014[/tpl] 'Examples of that problem social problem are the large number of departing female students, the rise of class spirit, low grades, streaking, destruction, drinking, and the popularity of rock dances.'
In 1973, what the press called a "streaking epidemic" hit Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, with streakers being seen in residence halls, at football games and at various other on-campus locations and events, including Spring graduation. The trend continued until spring 1974, when Ralph W. Steen, University president, hoping to end the streaking fad, designated a day to streak the length of East College Street, a tradition that - with a few breaks - has continued to this day. The "epidemic" was covered by all of the major media outlets and became the first time streaking received concentrated national press coverage, including an article in Paris Match covering the phenomenon.[tpl]cite web |url=http://digital.sfasu.edu/cdm/search/searchterm/streaking |title=Student Movements: Nudes |author=Stephen F.|work=Digital Archives and Collections - Ralph W.

Time magazine, in December 1973, called streaking "a growing Los Angeles-area fad" that was "catching on among college students and other groups.""Takeoff", Time, December 10, 1973. A letter writer responded, "Let it be known that streakers have plagued the campus police at Notre Dame for the past decade", pointing out that a group of University of Notre Dame students sponsored a "Streakers' Olympics" in 1972."Letters", Time, December 31, 1973.

==Definitions and etymology==

The word is recorded in its modern sense only since 2000. Before that, to streak in English since 1768 meant "to go quickly, to rush, to run at full speed", and was a re-spelling of streek: "to go quickly" (c.1380); this in turn was originally a northern Middle English variant of stretch (c. 1250).[tpl]OED|streak, v.2[/tpl]
The term "streaking" was popularized by a reporter for a local Washington, D.C. news station as he watched a "mass nude run" take place at the University of Maryland in 1973. That nude run had 533 participants. As the collected mass of nude students exited Bel Air dorm, the reporter, whose voice was broadcast live over the station via a pay phone connection exclaimed... "they are streaking past me right now. It's an incredible sight!"  The next day it was out on the Associated Press wire as "streaking" and had nationwide coverage.Newsweek Mar 13, 1974, p. 42 col 1.  Also, "Fifty years among the new words: a dictionary of neologisms", p 173
Streaking is distinct from naturism or nudism in that streakers usually intend to be noticed and may choose a place with a large audience for their act, regardless of the risk of arrest (sometimes even intending to be remanded into police custody), whereas naturists and nudists generally prefer to be left in peace. It is also distinct from "flashing", in that the intent is generally not to shock or traumatize a victim. Streakers may streak only once or a few times, possibly as a result of a dare, or may streak so often it can be considered a hobby.
The most public form of streaking is running naked before huge crowds at sporting events. However, many streakers seek quieter venues, such as a neighborhood at night after most people have gone to bed. Some have even found it especially satisfying to streak on rural highways in the very early hours of the morning, when there are not many commuters on the road. A number of streakers do not intend to expose themselves to others, but find it thrilling to do it in places that often have people present, but do not at the time of their streak. Streaking may be an individual or a group activity. It is not uncommon for videos of some of the more daring streaks to find popularity on the internet.
Of note is that since its heyday in the 1970s, being caught streaking in the United States now involves a risk of being charged with indecent exposure and consequently the title of "sex offender" upon conviction. Many jurisdictions have precedents (for example, in California, In re Dallas W. (2000)), establishing that public nudity, even if offensive, may not rise to the level of indecent exposure unless it is sexually motivated. However, that does not preclude attempts at prosecution. The prevalence of streaking (and, more generally, public nudity) greatly varies from place to place. It is reportedly quite common in San Francisco, where the police are prohibited by local authorities from making arrests for public nudity absent an outright lewd act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-12-01/news/nudists-public-nudity-castro-san-francisco/|title=Nudists find opposition in an unlikely place: The Castro[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-09-15/opinion/30158376_1_public-nudity-nudists-naked-city|title=San Francisco, the Naked City | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2011-09-15[/tpl]

In the sport of cricket, it is not uncommon for a male streaker to run out to the field purely for shock and entertainment value or political purposes. One example was in the First Test of the Australia versus the I.C.C. World XI, when a rather drunken man darted out toward the field naked, shocking the Australian and World XI players, halting play until he was spear tackled to the ground by field personnel. In one notable incident in 1977, Australian test cricketer Greg Chappell spanked an invading streaker named Bruce McCauley with his cricket bat; McCauley then fell to the ground and was arrested by police.[tpl]cite web | title = Streakers and Streaking | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A9559678 | date = 2006-04-05 | accessdate = 2007-08-04[/tpl]

In Super Bowl XXXVIII, streaker Mark Roberts disrupted the game by running on to the field. He was eventually leveled by New England Patriots Linebacker Matt Chatham, and was subsequently apprehended.

==In popular culture==

The high point of streaking's pop culture significance was in 1974, when thousands of streaks took place around the world. A wide range of novelty products were produced to cash in on the fad, from buttons and patches to a wristwatch featuring a streaking Richard Nixon, to pink underwear that said "Too shy to streak."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.billkirkpatrick.net/scholarship/streaking/ |title='It Beats Rocks and Tear Gas': Streaking and Cultural Politics in the Post-Vietnam Era |author=Bill Kirkpatrick |date=October 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 12, 2014[/tpl] The prominence of streaking in 1974 has been linked both to the sexual revolution and a conservative backlash against feminism and the campus protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34-year-old Robert Opel, who streaked across the stage flashing the peace sign on national US television at the 46th Academy Awards in 1974. Bemused host David Niven quipped, "Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley, Jr.. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.[tpl]cite news |title=What You Won't See at Oscars On Cue: Behind Those Cameras on Oscar Night |author=Steve Harvey |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 29, 1993 |page=F1 [/tpl]  Niven's encounter with the streaker was voted the top Oscars moment by film fans in 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]
