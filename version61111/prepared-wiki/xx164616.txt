The housemates went home twice, firstly from 23 to 27 December and secondly from 30 December to 3 January to spend Christmas and New Year at home. Unlike all other Big Brother series, there were no evictions and no winner.  The only public vote was for who played Cinderella.
On 27 December, Channel 4 accidentally broadcast the first half of the late-night E4 show, containing adult language and content, pre-watershed on T4. They later apologised.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bigbrotherpanto/news/story.jsp?id=38|title=An Apology From Channel4| accessdate=2007-08-18|date=28 December 2004|publisher=Channel 4|quote=[/tpl] Big Brother Panto was sponsored by TalkTalk.

The Lodge was located in Bristol Studios.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/Big+Brother+Christmas+Panto-1581.html|title=The Big Brother Christmas Panto|accessdate=2007-08-18|date=3 December 2004|publisher=Female First|quote= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929104624/http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/Big+Brother+Christmas+Panto-1581.html |archivedate = 29 September 2007[/tpl] The great hall is the living room in which most of the housemates spent their time rehearsing. The great hall was cabin themed with red walls and wooden flooring. The mirrors used for the cameras were enlarged to resemble dance studio mirrors. Some polar bears and reindeer sit in exhibit boxes. The kitchen had bright pink carpet with turquoise blue walls with an igloo styled snow door leading to the bedroom. The diary room was located through the wardrobe in the kitchen based on the classic story The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. The inside of the diary room had two Christmas trees either side and skiers skiing down a mountain against the night sky full of stars. Once again there was only one bedroom cabin log themed with half of the beds being double wooden beds and the other half being snow looking beds on a raise platform. The garden was covered in snow and had a hot tub in it. It was situated through the kitchen but had a ceiling covering it.
