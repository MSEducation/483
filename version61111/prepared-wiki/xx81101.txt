After she criticized hip hop artist Akon for "degrading women" in a Vent episode, Akon's record label, Universal Music Group, forced YouTube to remove the video by issuing a DMCA takedown notice,[ref]Malkin, Michelle.

In an interview with BusinessWeek magazine in July 2007, Malkin said, "We’re doing what few other blogs can do. We serve up terabytes of bandwidth... I'm shelling out for gold-plated servers. That's expensive, and we want to be able to withstand huge traffic surges."Small Business. "Michelle Malkin and Hot Air", Businessweek.com, July 14, 2007.

====Jamil Hussein====

Malkin was among the first of several bloggers who questioned the credibility and even the existence of Iraqi police Captain "Jamil Hussein" who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war. The controversy started in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. In January 2007, Malkin visited Baghdad, and stated, "the Iraqi Ministry of Interior says disputed Associated Press source Jamil Hussein does exist. At least one story he told the AP just doesn’t check out: The Sunni mosques that as Hussein claimed and AP reported as 'destroyed,' 'torched' and 'burned and blown up' are all still standing. So the credibility of every AP story relying on Jamil Hussein remains dubious."Malkin, Michelle. "Fact-checking the AP and Jamil Hussein", MichelleMalkin.com, January 21, 2007. Malkin has since issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence.[tpl]cite web|author=Malkin, Michelle|url=http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006641.htm|title=Corrections|work=MichelleMalkin.com|date=January 6, 2007|quote=As I noted on the 4th, the AP reported that the Ministry of Interior in Iraq has now said a Captain Jamil Hussein does work in the al Khadra police station. I regret the error. But no blogger should apologize for raising legitimate questions about AP’s transparency, its reliance on local foreign stringers of dubious origins, and information that sources such as Hussein have provided the AP.[/tpl] Malkin contests the extent of damage to the mosques as reported by the AP. Malkin visited Iraq and stated, "several mosques did, in fact, come under attack by Mahdi Army forces." She further speculated that a corroborating witness to the Hussein account who had, according to the AP, recanted due to Iraqi government pressure, instead recanted because his story wasn't true. Malkin said the summary reports she obtained from US and Iraqi army officials didn't corroborate the claim about people being burned alive while Iraqi soldiers failed to intervene.

====Students Against War controversy====

In April 2006, Students Against War (SAW), a campus group at University of California, Santa Cruz, staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus, and sent out a press release containing contact details (names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses) of three student leaders for use by reporters. Malkin included these contact details in a blog column entitled "Seditious Santa Cruz vs. America".[ref]Malkin, Michelle.
"Seditious Santa Cruz vs. America", "michellemalkin.com", April 12, 2006[/ref] Malkin claimed the contact information was originally taken from SAW's own website, but that later SAW had removed it and had "wiped" the "cached version".Malkin, Michelle. "More Thuggery In Santa Cruz", MichelleMalkin.com, April 17, 2006 The students asked Malkin to remove the contact details from her blog, but Malkin reposted them several timesSentinel. "Malkin moves, takes child from school, as SC students retaliate", "Santa Cruz Indymedia", April 22, 2006. Retrieved July 20, 2009. writing in her blog: "I am leaving it up. If you are contacting them, I do not condone death threats or foul language. As for SAW, my message is this: You are responsible for your individual actions. Other individuals are responsible for theirs. Grow up and take responsibility."
SAW remarked: "Due to the continued irresponsible actions of some bloggers, members of the group have received numerous death threats and anti-Semitic comments through phone calls and emails."[ref]
Students Against The War. "Far-Right Threats Fail to Distract from Santa Cruz Protest Successes", April 19, 2006,[/ref] A blog war ensued. Malkin claimed that she received hostile e-mailsMalkin, Michelle."The Moonbats Strike Back", MichelleMalkin.com, April 17, 2006. then her private home address, phone number, photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house were published on several websites. The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported receiving an email from Malkin saying that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family.Sideman, Roger. "Cyber war over UCSC protest heats up", Santa Cruz Sentinel, April 22, 2006.
Another controversy involving private addresses began on July 1, 2006, when Malkin and other bloggers commented on a New York Times Travel section article that had featured the town where Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld owned summer homes. The article included a picture of Rumsfeld's long tree-lined driveway that showed a birdhouse and small portion of the housefront.Kilborn, Peter T."Weekends with the President's Men" The New York Times June 30, 2006. Malkin declared that this story was part of "a concerted, organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them."  The photos of Rumsfeld's house were taken with Rumsfeld's permission.[tpl]cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/07/what-is-left-of-malkin-hinderaker-and.html |title=What is left of Malkin, Hinderaker and Horowitz's credibility? |publisher=Unclaimed Territory |date=July 3, 2006 |accessdate=May 8, 2012[/tpl]

===Hot Air===

On April 24, 2006, Hot Air, a "conservative Internet broadcast network," went into operation, with Malkin as founder/CEO."Conservative Internet Broadcast Network Debuts", PR Web, April 24, 2006, Accessed July 18, 2009 She intended the blog to provide "content and analysis you can't get anywhere else on a daily basis–both on the blog and in our original video features".Malkin, Michelle.

Her staffers included 'Allahpundit' and Bryan Preston, though the latter was replaced by Ed Morrissey on February 25, 2008.Morrissey, Ed."The Road Goes Ever On" February 25, 2008 In February 2010, Hotair.com was bought by Salem Communications and is no longer administered by Malkin.Malkin, Michelle.

==Viewpoints==

===Citizenship===

Malkin believes that the custom of granting automatic citizenship at birth to U.S.–born children of foreign tourists, temporary foreign workers, and illegal aliens undermines the integrity of citizenship and national security. She argues that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, "originally intended to ensure the citizenship rights of newly freed slaves and their families after the Civil War, has evolved into a magnet for alien lawbreakers and a shield for terrorist infiltrators and enemy combatants".Malkin, Michelle. "What makes an American?", Jewish World Review, July 4, 2003. Retrieved July 18, 2009.

===Immigration enforcement===

Malkin also opposes sanctuary cities, in which local authorities do not enforce all national immigration laws or coordinate with agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Following the August 2007 execution-style murder of three college students in Newark, New Jersey, she repeated her criticisms of politicians' posture toward sanctuary cities. In particular, she criticized former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's proposal for a tamper-proof identification card with this comment:
She supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of Section 287(g) of the IIRIRA to investigate, detain, and arrest aliens on civil and criminal grounds.Malkin, Michelle.

===Unemployment benefits===

During an appearance as a news analyst on the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on August 2, 2009, she explained why she opposed another 13-week extension of unemployment benefits: "If you put enough government cheese in front of people they are going to just keep eating it and kicking the can down the road... people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out."[tpl]cite video|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=8233167|title=This Week with George Stephanopoulos|format=Flash|people=George Stephanopoulos, Al Hunt, Michelle Malkin, Gerald Seib, Cynthia Tucker|date=August 2, 2009|publisher=ABC News|medium=Television production[/tpl]

===Women's issues===

In a February 2012 column, Malkin called the "War on Women" a false narrative, arguing rather that "It's the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/guest-column/the-war-on-conservative-women/|title=The War on Conservative Women|author=Michelle Malkin|date=March 7, 2012|work=Accuracy In Media[/tpl]

She denied allegations that she had been insensitive to the "plight of minorities," listing several racial epithets that had been used against her, and by relating a lesson she learned from her mother for which she is "eternally grateful." When in kindergarten, Malkin went home in tears one day because her classmates had called her a racist name. But, her mother comforted Michelle by telling her that everyone has prejudices.Beckhardt, Jon. "Michelle Malkin, Alumna Pundit, Lambastes the Left", The Oberlin Review, February 17, 2006
