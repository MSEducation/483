Charles B. Coppen was a sports editor for the Providence Journal. However he is best remember for being a part owner of the Providence Steam Roller of the National Football League. He not only shared ownership of the team with Peter Laudati and James Dooley, but was also a co-founder of the team with Pearce Johnson, the team's general manager. In addition to his duties to the Steam Roller, he also had a budding law practice. His career with the Providence Journal ended with his involvement with the Steam Roller and in managing boxers. Coppen was also the manager of Providence's stadium, the Cyclodome.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Steam Roller | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=1980 | pages=1â€“13 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-03-029.pdf | authors=Hogrogian, John[/tpl]
It was also Coppen who named the Steam Roller. During halftime against a game between the Steam Roller and the Providence Pros, Coppen who was getting a hot dog, heard a remark that the opposing team was "getting steam-rolled". Coppen loved the remark so much named his team the Steam Roller.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rCnbhSRZpgIC | title=Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football | first=Robert W. | last=Peterson | isbn=0-19-511913-4 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997[/tpl]
