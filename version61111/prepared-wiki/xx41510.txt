In Zen Buddhism, zazen (literally "seated meditation"; [tpl]lang-ja|坐禅[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|s=坐禅|t=坐禪|p=zuò chán|w=tso4-ch'an2[/tpl]) is a meditative discipline practitioners perform to calm the body and the mind, and be able to concentrate enough to experience insight into the nature of existence and thereby gain enlightenment.

==Significance==

Zazen is considered the heart of Zen Buddhist practice. The aim of zazen is just sitting, that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.

==Methods==

===Setting===

In Zen temples and monasteries, practitioners traditionally sit zazen as a group in a meditation hall, usually referred to as the zendo. The practitioner sits on a cushion called a zafu, which itself is usually placed on top of a low, flat mat called a zabuton.
Before taking one's seat, and after rising at the end of the period of zazen, a Zen practitioner performs a gassho bow to their seat, and a second bow to fellow practitioners.
The beginning of a period of zazen is traditionally announced by ringing a bell three times (shijosho), and the end of a round by ringing the bell either once or twice (hozensho).
Long periods of zazen may alternate with periods of kinhin (walking meditation).

===Posture===

The posture of zazen is seated, with folded legs and hands, and an erect but settled spine. The hands are folded together into a simple mudra over the belly.  In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the hara (the center of gravity in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.
The legs are folded in one of the standard sitting styles:
In addition, it is not uncommon for modern practitioners to practice zazen in a chair, often with a wedge or cushion on top of it so that one is sitting on an incline, or by placing a wedge behind the lower back to help maintain the natural curve of the spine. While each of these styles is commonly taught today, Master Dogen recommended only Kekkafuza and Hankafuza.

===Types of zazen===

In his book Three Pillars of Zen, Philip Kapleau says that practitioners in the Rinzai school face in, towards each other with their backs to the wall, and in the Soto school, practitioners face the wall or a curtain.[tpl]cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip | title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |page=10(8)| isbn = 0-385-26093-8[/tpl] Kapleau quotes Hakuun Yasutani's lectures for beginners. In lecture four, Yasutani describes the five kinds of zazen: bompu, gedo, shojo, daijo, and saijojo (he adds the latter is the same thing as shikantaza).[tpl]cite book  |ref=harv | last1 = Kapleau | first1 = Philip | title = The Three pillars of Zen: teaching, practice, and enlightenment | year = 1989 | publisher = Anchor Books | location = New York |pages=48-53| isbn = 0-385-26093-8[/tpl]

===Instruction===

Very generally speaking, zazen practice is taught in one of three ways.
Koan  practice is usually associated with the Rinzai school and Shikantaza with the Sōtō school.  In reality many Zen communities use both methods depending on the teacher and students.

====Concentration====

The initial stages of training in zazen usually emphasize concentration, by focusing on the breath at the hara, often aided by counting. This counting meditation is called susokukan, and has several variations. Through this practice one builds up the power of concentration, or joriki. At some Zen centers, the practice of mentally repeating a mantra with the breath is used in place of counting breaths for beginners.  In some communities, or  sanghas, the practice is continued in this way until there is some initial experience of samadhi  or "one-pointedness" of mind.  At this point the practitioner moves to one of the other two methods of zazen.

====Koan Introspection====

Having developed awareness, the practitioner can now focus his or her consciousness on a koan as an object of meditation.  Since koans are, ostensibly, not solvable by intellectual reasoning, koan introspection is designed to shortcut the intellectual process leading to direct realization of a reality beyond thought.

====Shikantaza====

Shikantaza is a form of meditation, in which the practitioner does not use any specific object of meditation; rather, practitioners remain as much as possible in the present moment,  aware of and observing what passes through their minds and around them. Dogen says, in his Shobogenzo, "Sitting fixedly, think of not thinking. How do you think of not thinking? Nonthinking. This is the art of zazen."[tpl]cite web|title=Principles of Zazen|author=Dogen|url=http://scbs.stanford.edu/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/zazengi/zazengi.translation.html|publisher=Soto Zen Text Project|accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl]
