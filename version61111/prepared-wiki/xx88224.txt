Tarrawarra is a station on the former Healesville line between Yarra Glen and Healesville in Australia. The station, opened in 1889, closed along with the Healesville line in December 1980. The section of track through the location of the station is now maintained by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, which is based out of Healesville. A tourist service operates on weekends, and school and public holidays using restored 153 hp Walker railmotor RM22 to the estate Winery through the Tarrawarra tunnel, approx 3 km. before the former station. This service may be extended to Tarrawarra station in future.
In the 1970s, timetables showed "stop if required" because of the small number of passengers.
A new crossing loop was recently suggested near the site of the station.
