Şen was interviewed in April 2006 by a Turkish newspaper Vakit. Şen reported that female interrogators sexually abused him and desecrated the Koran, and that guards beat him with iron bars, and allowed him to be mauled by dogs, when he was in the Kandahar detention facility.  He reported that camp authorities would amputate wounded limbs rather than trying to provide less radical medical care.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] Şen reported being left for days in what he called "the insanity room", where captives were subjected to loud noise. Şen also claimed that most GIs in Guantanamo were Jewish, and wore skullcaps, and that a Rabbi was present during each interrogation. A Turkish columnist, Aslı Aydintaşbaş, criticized Şen for the "crude antisemitism" he showed in his interview. Şen and several other former captives are suing several current and former US officials for the inhumane and illegal conditions of their detention.[tpl]cite news |url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/celikgogus-v.-rumsfeld|title=Celikgogus v. Rumsfeld|publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights|accessdate=2008-05-25[/tpl]mirror The other former captives include two other former Turkish captives: Yuksel Celikgogus, Nuri Mert, a former Uzbek named Zakirjan Hasam, and a former Algerian captive Fethi Boucetta.  Like Sen, the two other Turkish captives were repatriated prior to the institution of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals, in August 2004. The Algerian and Uzbek were among the 38 captives who were freed after their CSR Tribunals determined they never should have been classified as "enemy combatants". According to the DIA, İbrahim Şen was transferred to Turkey in November 2003. In January 2008, Şen was arrested in Van, Turkey, and charged as the leader of an active al-Qaida cell.
