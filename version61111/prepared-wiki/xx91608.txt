==Media career==

By the age of 21 Mike was a news cameraman at NBN Television and at age 18 Mal was working as a cadet at Newcastle's now defunct newspaper The Sun 
Their first regular TV series, Ask the Leyland Brothers, ran on Australian television from 1976 to 1980, and again from 1983 to 1984. The show often provided Australian viewers with their first look at outback Australia.
A following documentary series called Leyland Brothers' World appeared on Australian TV. Rather than viewers writing in and asking the Leyland Brothers to visit a particular place in Australia and provide information about it as in "Ask The Leyland Brothers", it focused on exploration by the Leyland Brothers in Australia and featured a double-decker Bus. 
The television show is not to be confused with the theme park of the same name.

===Honours===

In 1980 the brothers were awarded the MBE for services to the film industry.[tpl]cite news |first= Georgina |last= Safe |title= Leylands out of the Wilderness |work= The Australian |publisher= Nationwide News Proprietary Ltd |date= 2 July 1997[/tpl]
