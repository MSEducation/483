[[Salacca]]

CATEGORIES: Salacca, Flora of Asia, Arecales genera

Salacca is a genus of 20 species of palms native to Indonesia and Malaysia. They are very short-stemmed palms, with leaves up to 6â€“8 m long. The leaves have a spiny petiole; in most species they are pinnate with numerous leaflets, but some species, notably S. magnifica, have undivided leaves.
The fruit grow in clusters at the base of the plants, and are edible in many species, with a reddish-brown scaly skin covering a white pulp and one to two large inedible seeds. The Salak (S. zalacca) or snakefruit is the species most widely grown for its fruit; the firm white pulp has a slight acidic taste. The skin of the snakefruit has a unique texture not unlike that of a snake's skin, rough to the touch in one direction but smooth in the other.
