Krapina-Zagorje County ([tpl]lang-hr|Krapinsko-zagorska županija[/tpl]) is a county in northern Croatia. It encompasses most of the historic region called Hrvatsko Zagorje.
The Krapina-Zagorje County is a candidate for being the most idyllic county in Croatia: the many villages and small towns spread out across the hillsides are perfect for agriculture (vineyards in particular) and summer houses. Although beautiful, the many hills rivers, creeks and lakes through many valleys cause a peculiar effect throughout Zagorje: 15% of the year, fog significantly lowers visibility in the area.
Bordering with Slovenia this region was a part of the Austrian Empire. From those times originates the majority of many castles spread around the county.
Perhaps the most astonishing landmark of the area is the excavation site of a 100,000-year-old Neanderthal man in caves near the central town of Krapina. Existence of "modern"-day Krapina itself has been verified since 1193, and was always a favorite site for castles and other country houses of Croatian and Hungarian rulers.
Other towns of the county are Zabok, Pregrada, Zlatar, Oroslavje, Donja Stubica, Klanjec. The town of Stubica features another thermal spring, the Stubičke toplice ("toplice" means spa). Also in the area are the medieval castles Veliki Tabor, Miljana, Bežanec, Hellenbach, Milengrad etc.
The Krapina-Zagorje County borders on the Varaždin County in the northwest, Zagreb County in the southwest and southeast, and the city of Zagreb in the south.
