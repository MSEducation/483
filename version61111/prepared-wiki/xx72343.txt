</ref> Brewster spoke to the faculty at Yale. His remarks, which were leaked to the press, made that a day which would follow him for the rest of his life: “I am appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass in this country that I am skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States.”<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10614FF355517768FDDAC0A94DC405B808BF1D3&scp=28&sq=kingman%20brewster&st=cse "Brewster doubts fair Black Panthers Trails"] ''New York Times.'' April 25, 1970.</ref> This remark, made one week before the tumultuous May Day protests of the Black Panther trials, was decried in editorials and speeches across the country.

McGeorge Bundy, the president of the Ford Foundation, addressed the Yale Club of Boston just days before the May Day demonstrations and assured his fellow alumni that "one of the things I have observed about my friend Brewster is that he will deal with anyone and surrender his responsibilities to nobody."Kabaservice, 7
Brewster inevitably would be judged on May Day's outcome because he had opened his university to all those coming to New Haven to support the Panthers, even offering them food and shelter. Brewster knew that, in the face of potential catastrophe, he had the support of other leaders cast from the same mold, friends and colleagues who shared his background and outlook.Kabaservice, 3
On May 1, 1970, at ten minutes before midnight, bombers exploded three devices in the Yale hockey rink. Protesters threw rocks and bottles at the National Guardsmen and taunted the New Haven police. The authorities responded by tear-gassing the demonstrators. Yale chaplain, William Sloane Coffin, stated, "All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts." Fortunately, there were no fatalities that evening.Kabaservice, 3Kabaservice, 9
President Richard Nixon commenting on the events of May 1, 1970 to the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, stated that to be fair to the students, they were not entirely to be blamed for their actions that day.  "What can we expect of students if a person in that position and of that stature (Brewster) engages in such acts?"Kabaservice, 420Kabaservice, 421 Henry Kissinger, sitting just a few chairs away mused aloud that Brewster was the one man whose assassination would benefit the United States.Kabaservice, 420Kabaservice, 421 It was Brewster's handling of the May Day demonstrations and his actions after the crisis that made him a target of the Nixon White House.Kabaservice, 420Kabaservice, 421Kabaservice, 6

=====Vietnam War=====

He is also well known for his skillful handling of the student protests on the Yale campus during the Vietnam War era, a war that he openly criticized and opposed. He never allowed such convictions to disrupt the University’s operations, especially classes. His bold stewardship of the University during an era of political unrest is widely regarded as successful."Trustees Praise Brewster's Rule " New York Times. September 28, 1970.
On May 12, 1972, Brewster made a public statement, printed in full on the front page of the Yale Daily News, prior to a campus visit by Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State William P. Rogers. He is at once uncompromising about upholding free speech and unrestrained in showing his discontent with the Nixon administration. Brewster, on the one hand, threatened to expel students who might bar Rogers from speaking. Still, he also said that he “expects” disciplined picketing and asked that students appropriately protest the Rogers’ appearance. In the end, Rogers unexpectedly canceled his appearance for unknown reasons.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]

=====Admissions=====

As Yale's president, he appointed R. Inslee Clark, Jr. ("Inky")Karabel, 8–332–226–440Karabel, 349 as Director of Undergraduate Admissions. Under his tenure, he established academic credentials in the admissions process and the proportion of undergraduate African-Americans, Jews, and public high school graduates at Yale rose. Despite the alumni outrage over these policy changes, Clark held the position from 1965 to 1970.Karabel, 349
No aspect of Brewster's presidency stirred more anger and debate than the overhaul of Yale's undergraduate admissions policy in the 1960s.Karabel, 421–343  He also had made it clear from the beginning of his presidency that he was not going to preside over a finishing school on Long Island Sound.Kabaservice, 266 Admissions became the battleground over the university's true purpose. The outcome of the battle, which was felt far beyond New Haven, was only a part of larger struggles in American society, the thorny debate over race, class, gender and leadership.

===Diplomatic career===

While serving as Yale's president, he was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 7, 1977 to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 29, 1977 and he served from 1977 to 1981.[ref]

"Senate Confirms Brewster To Be U.S. Ambassador to Britain" New York Times. April 30, 1977. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, a member of the Yale Corporation, and a close personal friend, recommended him to President Carter for the position.Kabaservice, 445 Despite his lack of diplomatic experience, the British press was pleased with the appointment, calling Brewster potentially the best ambassador since David K. E. Bruce. They described him as a "New England Patrician" and expressed delight at his gold ring with his family motto in Norman French. My role, he said at the time, is trying to advise my Government on British attitudes and concerns in the fullest way possible.
He wasted no time in beginning his new responsibilities. He was called to step in and resolve difficulties between United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and the British Foreign Office. This was followed by smoothing out American/British difficulties over policy toward Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), which helped lead to the end of minority white rule in that country. He reveled in the "good life" of London and took advantage of the range of social occasions from dinner with Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom to quaffing a pint of ale in a working class pub, saying, "Becoming aware of the richness and variety here is a lot of fun."Kabaservice, 450
