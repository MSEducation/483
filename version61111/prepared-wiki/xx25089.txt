==Role in The Simpsons==

===Biography===

In the episode Homer and Apu, Apu claimed to be from "Ramatpur." "Ramatpur" is possibly an amalgamation of the names of the rural village Ramapur, the large Kanpur suburb of Rawatpur, and the city of Rampur, all of which are in Uttar Pradesh.
Apu is a naturalised US citizen. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science. He graduated first in his class of seven million at 'Caltech' — Calcutta Technical Institute — going on to earn his doctorate at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.).
Apu began working at the Kwik-E-Mart during graduate school to pay off his student loan, but he stayed afterward as he had come to enjoy his job and the friends he had made. He remained an illegal immigrant until Mayor Quimby proposed a municipal law to expel all undocumented aliens. Apu responded by purchasing a forged birth certificate from the Springfield Mafia that listed his parents as US citizens Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon, but when he realized he was forsaking his origins, he abandoned this plan and instead successfully managed to pass his citizenship test with help from Lisa and Homer Simpson. Thus, he refers to himself as a "semi-legal immigrant".[tpl]cite episode |title=Much Apu About Nothing |episodelink=Much Apu About Nothing |series=The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David S.; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=1996-05-05 |season= 7 |episode= 23 [/tpl]
During 1985, Apu was a member of the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps along with Homer Simpson, Barney Gumble, and Seymour Skinner. Upon the advice of the band manager Nigel, Apu took the stage name Apu de Beaumarchais (a reference to Beaumarchais, author of The Barber of Seville).[tpl]cite episode |title= Homer's Barbershop Quartet |episodelink=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |series=The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1993-09-30 |season=5 |episode= 1 [/tpl] Apu is a vegan, and enjoys the Cheap Trick song "Dream Police" even though he knows the words imperfectly. He also claims the title of the Fifth Beatle, although Paul McCartney (who first met Apu during The Beatles' stay in India) rolls his eyes at that claim. Apu is a massive cricket fan, as shown in the episode "Moe Letter Blues".

===Family===

In the episode "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons", Apu enjoys a brief period as Springfield's leading ladies' man after being spontaneously drawn into a bachelor auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates. These come to a sudden halt when his mother announces it is time for his arranged marriage to a woman named Manjula, whom he had not seen in years. Apu tries to wriggle out of the arrangement at first, with Homer making Marge pretend to be his wife until Apu's mother finds her with Homer, but is won over when he meets Manjula face-to-face at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try (Manjula notes nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce). Later the two actually do fall in love. In the episode "Eight Misbehavin'", Manjula receives too many doses of fertility drugs from herself, Apu, and the well-meaning, but unsynchronized, Simpsons, due to difficulties with having a baby. This leads to her giving birth to octuplets: Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Priya, Sandeep, Sashi, and Gheet. This causes difficulties for the family, but finally they decide to get on with their life. During the episode "Bart-Mangled Banner", when the town changes its name to Libertyville to be patriotic after it is claimed Springfield hates America, Apu temporarily changes his children's names to Lincoln, Freedom, Condoleezza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Apple Pie, and Superman.
Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's workaholic nature and long hours, and the strain of caring for eight children. A further strain came up when Apu was unfaithful to Manjula with the Squishee delivery lady, causing him to briefly move out and even making him contemplate suicide, and one of his punishments was to legally change his name to Slime Q. Slimedog.[tpl]cite episode |title=The Sweetest Apu |episodelink=The Sweetest Apu |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2002-05-05 |season=13 |episode=19 [/tpl] He and his family are devout Hindus, and he particularly venerates Ganesha."I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge."
Sanjay (voiced by Harry Shearer), Apu's brother, helps run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay has a daughter named Pahasatira, and a son named Jamshed. They all share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, who is only mentioned in "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons". When Apu's and Manjula's parents were first arranging their marriage, Apu was shown on a chart as the oldest of three. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, also voiced by Hank Azaria, who helped Homer while he was in India. Kavi works for several American companies taking service calls using General American, cowboy, and Jamaican accents.[tpl]cite episode |title=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore |episodelink=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Castallaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=2006-04-09 |season=17 |episode=17 [/tpl]

==Character==

Apu first appeared in the season one episode "The Telltale Head". While creating the character, the writers decided they would not make him ethnic. They felt it would be too offensive and stereotypical and did not want to offend viewers.[tpl]cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "The Telltale Head"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] However, at a table read for an episode, Hank Azaria's reading of the line "Hello, Mr. Homer" received a huge laugh from the writers, so the concept stayed.[tpl]cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|date=2000-10-21|publisher=TV Guide|author=Joe Rhodes[/tpl] Azaria took Apu's voice from the many Indian convenience store workers in Los Angeles whom he had interacted with when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party, whom Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu.[tpl]cite interview|last=Azaria|first=Hank| interviewer = Terry Gross| title = Fresh Air| program = National Public Radio| callsign = WHYY-FM| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-06| accessdate = 2007-08-15[/tpl] Apu's first name is an homage to the main character in The Apu Trilogy directed by Satyajit Ray. His surname is Nahasapeemapetilon, and it was first used in the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge". It is a morphophonological blend of the name Pahasadee Napetilon, the full name of a schoolmate of Simpsons writer Jeff Martin.[tpl]cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] In the season seven episode "Lisa the Vegetarian" it is revealed that Apu is vegan.
Apu married Manjula in the episode "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons". Rich Appel first constructed the idea for Apu's marriage.[tpl]cite video | people=Appel, Rich|date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Andrea Martin provided the voice of Apu's mother in the episode, recording her part in New York. She wanted to get the voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, to make sure her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's.[tpl]cite video | people=Scully, Mike|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Ninth Season DVD commentary for the episode "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]

==Reception==

Apu is one of the most prominent South Asian characters on primetime television in the United States.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=321[/tpl] Hank Azaria has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, winning in 1998 for his performance as Apu, again in 2001 for "Worst Episode Ever," and a third time in 2003 for "Moe Baby Blues" for voicing several characters, including Apu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=Emmys.org|accessdate=2008-09-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080914045417/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php| archivedate= 14 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Apu's image has been widely licensed, on items ranging from board games to auto air fresheners. In July 2007, convenience store chain 7-Eleven converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to celebrate the release of The Simpsons Movie. There was a mild controversy when the promotion offended members of the Indian-American community who felt that Apu is a caricature that plays on too many negative stereotypes. Despite this, 7-Eleven reported that many of its Indian employees reacted positively to the idea,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=4082c01a-a201-4b22-8c30-1f51e4a41a5a|title=Cowabunga! 7-Elevens Get Kwik-E Makeover|accessdate=2007-10-30|date=2007-07-02|publisher=E!
