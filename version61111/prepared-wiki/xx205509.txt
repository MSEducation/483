==Career==

===Rotherham United and loans===

Born in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Taylor began his career as a trainee at Rotherham United in July 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=42967|title=Ryan Taylor  |work=Soccerbase|publisher=Racing Post|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] making his first team debut as an 81st minute substitute in a 1–0 home defeat to Swindon Town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=42967&seasonid=135|title=Games played by Ryan Taylor in 2005/2006|work=Soccerbase|publisher=Racing Post|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] He made twelve first team appearances in the 2006–07 season before glandular fever ruled him out for the rest of the season in November 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rotherham_utd/6614873.stm|title=Rotherham tie Taylor to new deal |date=2007-05-02|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl]
Following Rotherham's relegation to League Two at the end of the 2006–07 season, he signed a new two-year contract, and then joined Conference National side, Burton Albion, on a one-month loan in September 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burton_albion/7010396.stm|title=Clough hints at start for Taylor|date=2007-09-24|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] On his return to Rotherham, he established himself in the first team and scored his first goal for Rotherham in a 2–0 win over Shrewsbury Town in November 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/7099936.stm|title=Rotherham 2-0 Shrewsbury |date=2007-11-24|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] By the end of the 2007–08 season, Taylor had made 38 appearances for Rotherham, scoring six goals.
Mark Robins twice extended Taylor's contract; in May 2008 and then the following year, each time by one year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rotherham_utd/7400771.stm|title=Six sign new deals at Rotherham |date=2008-05-14|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-05-23[/tpl] This surprised some supporters and critics, who questioned Robins' persistence with the young striker. Ronnie Moore again took charge of the Millers at the start of the 2009/10 season, by which time Taylor had scored 10 games in almost 100 appearances, sending him out on loan to Exeter City.Rotherham loan striker Ryan Taylor to Exeter City; BBC Sport, 25 March 2010
Taylor made an immediate impact to the Exeter squad helping them avoid relegation and receiving Man of the Match awards on several occasions. He returned to his hometown club in time for the play-off finals, where he went straight into the starting line up on the strength of his performances at Exeter, and scored two goals in the final at Wembley.

===Bristol City===

On 20 June 2011, Taylor signed a three-year deal with Championship side Bristol City for an undisclosed fee.Bristol City sign Rotherham United striker Ryan Taylor; BBC Sport, 20 June 2011 He made his Robins debut on 17 August, but in a 1–2 loss to Leicester City;Leicester 1–2 Bristol City; BBC Sport, 17 August 2011 Taylor netted his first goal for the club on 28 April 2012, in a 1–1 away draw against Burnley.Burnley 1–1 Bristol City; BBC Sport, 28 April 2012
Despite featuring more regularly in his second season, Taylor failed to make an impression and left the club in January 2014, with the Robins being relegated to League One in the process.

===Portsmouth===

On 9 January 2014, Taylor left Bristol City and signed an 18-month deal with League Two side Portsmouth, being handed the number 20 shirt.Transfer window: Portsmouth sign Jake Jervis and Ryan Taylor; BBC Sport, 9 January 2014 He made his debut for Pompey two days later, starting in a 0–0 draw against Oxford United.Oxford 0–0 Portsmouth; BBC Sport, 11 January 2014
