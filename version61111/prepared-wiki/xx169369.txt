===Bus crash===

In January 2006, at around 6:30 AM, Cherry Beach Sound was hit by a Gray Line bus which lodged 3 metres into the building and damaged support columns. To prevent the building from collapsing and to clean up fuel spill, structural engineers and a hazardous materials team were sent to handle the situation.  There were no passengers on the bus and the driver escaped with minor injuries.  The bus penetrated the building, destroying the front facade and damaging an interior main wall, requiring serious repair. The bus came to rest just inches from the studio's recently constructed Control Room A, fortunately no one was in the building at the time. Soon after, the building was completely repaired and carried on business as normal.

===Renovation===

In January 2005, a considerable amount was invested in the renovation and addition of a new state-of-the-art studio to Cherry Beach. The new studio, Control Room A, was designed by Martin Pilchner of renowned facility designers Pilchner-Schoustal International Cherry Beach Sound-Toronto recording studio-HOME and includes four Genelec 1034B monitors, a Genelec 1034BC in the center-speaker position and a Genelec 7073A sub installed beneath the 56-input SSL6000 console in Cherry Beach's newly designed control room. Carman Guerrieri, owner of Cherry Beach states that the studio's new 5.1 array: "is capable of producing the fullrange of musical audio to the threshold of feeling at both the frequency extreme—19 Hz at the bottom end—and at the amplitude extreme—over 125 dB SPL per unit. It's quite remarkable." http://mixonline.com/news/headline/Genelec-Cherry-Beach-1109043/
