The Bachelorette is a spin-off from the American competitive reality dating game show The Bachelor. In its January 2003 debut on ABC, the first season featured Trista Rehn, the runner-up date from the first season of The Bachelor, offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a husband among 25 bachelors. The 2004 season of The Bachelorette again took a runner-up from the previous season of The Bachelor. After last airing on February 28, 2005, the series returned to ABC during the spring of 2008, following an absence of three years.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/abc-confirms-bachelorette-return-this-summer-with-fourth-season-6370.php|publisher = Reality TV World|title = ABC Confirms Bachelorette Return this Summer with Fourth Season[/tpl]

==Plot==

All of the rules are adopted from its parent show, The Bachelor. The series revolves around a single bachelorette (deemed eligible) and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25; 30 in season 5), which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette. The format is the same as the parent show. Unlike The Bachelor, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette for the final selection.
Unlike The Bachelor, all eight seasons of The Bachelorette have ended with a proposal whether or not the Bachelorette decided to accept or decline. Trista Rehn's marriage to Ryan Sutter and Ashley Hebert's marriage to JP Rosenbaum have been the only marriages to result.

==Questions of authenticity==

Mike Fleiss, creator of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, as well as former contestants, have come forth saying that both shows are scripted.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Bachelorette Season 4 winner, Jesse Csincsak, commented that contestants must follow producers' orders and that a storyline was fabricated in the editing room.[tpl]cite journal | title = Jesse Csincsak Talks About Ashley Hebert And Last Night’s The Bachelorette | journal = Reality TV Magazine | date = Jun 28, 2011 | first = Christine | last = McDow| id = | url = http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/06/28/jesse-csincsak-talks-about-ashley-hebert-and-last-nights-the-bachelorette/ | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | quote = "The viewers are seeing the PRODUCED side of her show and not so much the genuine stuff, and she looks silly because of it... A LOT TAKES PLACE IN THE EDITING ROOM!"[/tpl]
Season 13 contestant Megan Parris said in 2009 that the producers edited footage to create a false storyline. "I don't think producers showed any real conversation I had with anyone... The viewers fail to realize that editing is what makes the show... You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face to make it look like that is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story."[tpl]cite web | url = http://realitysteve.com/2009/02/27/update-on-the-megan-interview-and-more-news-coming-later-tonight | title = My Interview with Megan Parris | accessdate = July 16, 2012 | last = Carbone | first = Steve | date = Feb 26, 2009[/tpl] Parris said not only is the show scripted, but that producers "bully" contestants into saying specific things to the camera that the contestants do not want to say.[tpl]cite journal | title = Megan Parris says Bachelor producers "berate," "curse at" contestants | journal = Reality Blurred | date = Mar 29, 2009 | first = Andy | last = Dehnart| id = | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_bachelor_13/2009_Mar_29_megan_parris_criticism | accessdate = July 16, 2012[/tpl] She said, "There's nothing real about "confessionals," in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. It is scripted. They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you to say what they want you to say.[tpl]cite news | first = Bobby | last = Cherry | title = 'Bachelor' candidate from Sewickley Hills goes off script | date = Mar 26, 2009 | url = http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_617830.html | work = Trib Live | accessdate = July 16, 2012[/tpl]
On March 15, 2010, The Bachelorette creator Mike Fleiss appeared on 20/20 to confess that he developed the show's contestants into characters that catered to his audience's tastes, and that they "need their fair share of villains every season."[tpl]cite journal | title = Bachelors have sex with an average of three women, but Bob Guiney has the record with 5.5 | journal = Reality Blurred | date = Mar 16, 2010 | first = Andy | last = Dehnart| id = | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_bachelor/2010_Mar_16_20_20_special | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | quote = “We need our fair share of villains every season. And now we’re very careful in our casting…to develop characters that the audience is going to root for and root against”[/tpl] Fleiss has come under fire for admitting that The Bachelor has less to do with reality than it does making good television.[tpl]cite journal | title = Today’s TV Addict Top 5: Wildly Disturbing Quotes from THE BACHELOR creator/executive producer Mike Fleiss | journal = Today’s TV Addict | date = Mar 18, 2010| id = | url = http://www.thetvaddict.com/2010/03/18/todays-tv-addict-top-5-wildly-disturbing-quotes-from-the-bachelor-creatorexecutive-producer-mike-fleiss/ | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | quote = “We are very careful in our casting to develop characters that the audience is going to root for and root against.” Fleiss admits that his show has less to do with “reality” than it does making good television. Which is all fine and good… if a few moments later he hadn’t claimed that the whole premise was romance and the search for love.[/tpl]
By Season 7 of The Bachelorette, some believe that actors were being hired by ABC to play specific roles on the show. Some viewers were becoming tired of the show's scripted nature and speaking out.[tpl]cite journal | title = The Bachelorette is Back – More Addictive & Ridiculous Than Ever | journal = The Jewish Journal | date = May 24, 2011 | first = Ilana | last = Angel| id = | url = http://www.jewishjournal.com/keepingitreal/item/the_bachelorette_is_back_more_addictive_ridiculous_than_ever_20110524 | accessdate = July 16, 2012 | quote = The only thing lamer than this show is the people who make it. They take it so seriously and think we do, but we don’t. It’s a scripted reality show, not real life. We watch with hope and no expectations, just as we lead our lives, the difference is we are decent and they are not.[/tpl]  By Season 8 there were numerous complaints when the entire cast of The Bachelorette overtly acted out the show's written script with the cast of The Muppets.[tpl]cite journal | title = The Bachelorette Recap: Rainbow Connections | journal = The Hollywood Gossip | date = May 21, 2012 | first = T | last = Taylor| id = | url = http://m.thehollywoodgossip.com/2012/05/the-bachelorette-recap-rainbow-connections/ | accessdate = July 16, 2012 | quote = The Bachelorette is back in full swing, and with it, all the scripted drama, misleading promos and man tears we've come to expect over the years... This Muppets thing is weird. Beyond weird. Emily asks Kermit to help zip her dress and the Miss Piggy throws a tantrum. Mr. Hostman has a conversation with one half of the cranky old man duo. They're all pretending the Muppets are real people. Really, producers? REALLY?... Miss Piggy has Joe write a poem on the spot. Charlie starts sweating bullets. Jef has to propose to Miss Piggy.[/tpl]
