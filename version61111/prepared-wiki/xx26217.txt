Lockheed Martin ([tpl]nyse|LMT[/tpl]) is an American global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technology company with worldwide interests.

===1990s===

Merger talks between Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10 billion planned merger on August 30, 1994.[tpl]cite news |first=Floyd |last=Norris|title=A 'merger of equals,' with Martin Marietta the most equal |work=The New York Times |date=August 31, 1994 |accessdate=May 3, 2008 [/tpl] The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995 when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger.[tpl]cite news|title=Martin Marietta-Lockheed merger is approved|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 1995 |accessdate=May 3, 2008[/tpl] The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for the present L-3 Communications, a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company Martin Marietta Materials.
Both companies contributed important products to the new portfolio. Lockheed products included the Trident missile, P-3 Orion, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor, C-130 Hercules, A-4AR Fightinghawk and the DSCS-3 satellite. Martin Marietta products included Titan rockets, Sandia National Laboratories (management contract acquired in 1993), Space Shuttle External Tank, Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers, the Transfer Orbit Stage (under subcontract to Orbital Sciences Corporation) and various satellite models.
On April 22, 1996, Lockheed Martin completed the acquisition of Loral Corporation's defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1 billion, the deal having been announced in January.

I want them to do the things that will build a better relationship.

==Government contracts==

Lockheed Martin is active in many aspects of government contracting. It received $36 billion in government contracts in 2008 alone, more than any company in history. It now does work for more than two dozen government agencies from the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. It's involved in surveillance and information processing for the CIA, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the National Security Agency (NSA), The Pentagon, the Census Bureau and the Postal Service."

The board of directors consists of 14 members:

===Criticism===

Lockheed is listed as the largest US government contractor and "ranks third for number of incidents, and twenty-first for size of settlements on the 'contractor misconduct' database maintained by the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-DC-based watchdog group." Since 1995, the company has agreed to pay $606 million to settle 59 instances of misconduct.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.contractormisconduct.org/ |title=Federal Contractor Misconduct Database |publisher=Project on Government Oversight |accessdate=January 15, 2014[/tpl]

==Lobbying==

The company's 2010 lobbying expenditure by the third quarter was $9.9 million (2009 total: $13.7 million).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?year=2010&lname=Lockheed+Martin&id= |title=Lockheed Martin Lobbying Expenditure |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=January 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=chooseFields |title=Lobbying Disclosure Act Database |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=January 5, 2011[/tpl]

===Maryland Senator Rob Garagiola and tax rebate===

In March 2013, Maryland State Senate Majority Leader Rob Garagiola cosponsored a resolution which would give Lockheed Martin tax rebate worth millions of dollars, related to hotel taxes paid at their CLE facility in Bethesda, MD, even while he was allegedly dating Lockheed Martin's lobbyist.  This was after Montgomery County Council refused to pass a similar resolution.Garagiola-Powers Affair[tpl]Self-published inline|This source is a blog and self-published.|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Management theories==

Along with the Board, the CEO, COO and CFO lead Lockheed Martin and provide oversight of the corporation“Leadership.”  LockheedMartin.com. http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/who-we-are/leadership.html  These executives oversee Executive Vice Presidents (EVP) of four business areas.“What we do.” LockheedMartin.com. http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do.html.  The EVPs are responsible for managing major programs.
Lockheed Martin separates its employees based on their assigned program. Each program uses an integrated product development model to organize its employees into four tiers: Tier1 –Program Manager/VP, Tier2-Functional Teams, Tier3-Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), and Tier4-detailed product development.  The floor or touch workers are in a particular component assembly team that culminates in the final deliverable product.Cox, James D., "Organizational Challenges in the Integrated Product Team Implementation", Proceedings of the Third Annual International Symposium of the National Council on Systems Engineering, 26–28 July 1993, Arlington, VA. http://libsys.uah.edu/library/incose/Contents/Papers/93/9366.pdf Lockheed Martin manages and maintains its relationship with these touch workers through its supervisors and unions.“Job search-Labor Relations Representative in Marietta Georgia United States.” LockheedMartin.com.  http://lockheedmartin-veterans.jobs/marietta-ga/labor-relations-representative/30654895/job/

Retrieved on October 5, 2012. LM21 program relies on Six Sigma principles, which are techniques to improve efficiency. Senior management constructs leadership councils and assigns managers to facilitate Kaizen events, which target specific processes for improvement.  A manager facilitates teams and processes stakeholders and suppliers to attempt to streamline process implementation.Joyce, Michael and Bettina Schechter, “The Lean Enterprise- A Management Philosophy at Lockheed Martin.” Defense Acquisition Review Journal. pp. 173-181. 2004.  http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA435279.E.

They work with a variety of customers on multiple contracts including end item delivery, design enhancements, support and training.Cox, James D. "Organizational Challenges in the Integrated Product Team Implementation", Proceedings of the Third Annual International Symposium of the National Council on Systems Engineering, 26–28 July 1993, Arlington, VA. http://libsys.uah.edu/library/incose/Contents/Papers/93/9366.pdf
Tier2 Functional Leads (Finance, Chief Engineer, Quality, Operations, etc.) and Tier3 IPT Leads (Weapon System Development, Weapon System Integration, etc.) report to Tier1. Functional leads ensure appropriate resources are provided to programs.  IPT leads are responsible for entire systems or products defined by the contract’s Statement of Work.
At Tier3, management separates employees into different lower level IPTs that are responsible for a subset of the Tier2 requirements.  For example, the Tier3 Software Engineering IPT resides under Tier2 Weapon System Development. Tier3 IPTs develop major components under the Tier2 team management.  IPT Leads oversee daily performance of the multi-functional IPTs. Engineers reside within the IPTs. Across the integrated product teams, tasks such as quality assurance, subcontracting, manufacturing and design are performed. To control quality, Lockheed Martin trains and builds IPT teams.  Lockheed Martin ensures that work is executed correctly through a Technical Performance Measure (TPM) system which emphasizes Lockheed Martin’s Lean and 6 Sigma processes. Lockheed Martin middle management uses commitment mechanisms that parallel high commitment and human relations theory. Also, access to different levels of training allows IPT members to remain committed as outlined in the Human Commitment theory.Walton, Richard E. “From Control to Commitment in the Workplace,” Harvard Business Review, March–April, 1985, pp. 77-84.
