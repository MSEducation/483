==Foundation==

The Rutherford Institute was named after Samuel Rutherford, a 17th-century theologian who wrote a book, Lex, Rex, which challenged the concept of the divine right of kings.[tpl]cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Ted|title=The Dragon Slayer|journal=Christianity Today|date=December 7, 1998|volume=42|issue=14|pages=4|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1998/december7/8te036.html?start=4|accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl]  When the Rutherford Institute was founded, conservative Protestants[tpl]who|date=November 2012[/tpl] in the United States were reconsidering their role in American political and legal life, perceiving that the federal government was intent on encroaching on Americans' religious liberties.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Organizations such as the Rutherford Institute pursued matters of religious liberties in the courts, and the Rutherford Institute became the model for groups such as the National Legal Foundation, the Liberty Counsel, and the American Center for Law and Justice.[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

==History and legal actions==

Since its founding, the Rutherford Institute has expanded its aims from defending the religious liberties of Christians to include defending the religious liberties of all Americans, as well as working to preserve rights such as free speech and the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.

===Religious liberty===

In 2004, the group filed a lawsuit against Muskogee Public Schools in Oklahoma on behalf of Nashala Hearn, an 11-year-old Muslim student who was suspended for wearing a religious headscarf to school.[tpl]cite news|title=Justice Dept. to fight school barring Muslim's scarves|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-04-15-school-lawsuit_x.htm|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 15, 2004[/tpl]
In 2007, the group filed a lawsuit against Freehold Township, New Jersey on behalf of an orthodox rabbi, Avraham Bernstein, alleging that the town was persecuting Bernstein for holding prayer meetings in his home on the Sabbath.[tpl]cite news|title=Rabbi expands lawsuit against N.J. town|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-19-3957487833_x.htm|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 19, 2007|first=Chris|last=Newmarker[/tpl]
In 2011, the group took up the cause of Laura George, founder of the Oracle Institute, who wanted to build a "Peace Pentagon", a proposed interfaith study center and retreat, on the banks of the New River in Independence, Virginia. When George was refused a building permit when the local Board of Supervisors voted to deny the project on health, safety and welfare grounds, attorneys acting on behalf of the Rutherford Institute pursued a legal action to acquire the permit, alleging religious discrimination.[tpl]cite news|last=Kinzie|first=Susan|title=Proposed interfaith retreat center in Virginia tests founder, community|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/proposed-interfaith-retreat-center-in-virginia-tests-founder-community/2011/06/27/gIQARMPm2H_story.html|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 7, 2011[/tpl] Eventually the building permit was granted.[tpl]cite web|title=VICTORY: Grayson County Board of Supervisors Green-Lights Development of Spiritual Retreat Center in Response to Rutherford Institute Lawsuit|url=https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/on_the_front_lines/victory_grayson_county_board_of_supervisors_green_lights_development_of_spi|publisher=The Rutherford Institute|accessdate=April 17, 2012[/tpl]

===Freedom of speech===

In 2012, the Rutherford Institute filed a lawsuit on behalf of Harold Hodge, a man arrested in January 2011 for standing outside the United States Supreme Court Building carrying a sign which read, "The U.S. Gov allows police to illegally murder and brutalize African-Americans and Hispanic people."  Other cases include defending an Albemarle High School student's right to wear a National Rifle Association t-shirt to school and contesting the firing of a California teacher who referred to "Zionist Jews" during an Occupy Movement protest.

===Search and seizure===

In 2008, the Rutherford Institute joined a coalition of civil libertarians and activists who called upon President George W. Bush to release a number of Muslim Uighurs who were being detained indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.[tpl]cite news|title=Conservatives call on Bush to free Muslim Uighurs|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/executive/president/2008-11-20-uighurs-guantanamo_N.htm|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=November 20, 2008[/tpl]
In 2010, the group took on a number of cases regarding the Transportation Security Administration's controversial security procedures at American airports. The organization filed a lawsuit in November 2010 against Janet Napolitano, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security as well as John Pistole, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, on behalf of airline pilots Michael Roberts and Ann Poe. The pair of pilots objected to being subjected to "whole body imaging" scanners, which reveal the nude body of the subject being searched, as well as a pat-down. John W. Whitehead said of the matter, "Forcing Americans to undergo a virtual strip search as a matter of course in reporting to work or boarding an airplane when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing is a grotesque violation of our civil liberties."[tpl]cite news|last=Provence|first=Lisa|title=Rutherford Institute sues over 'virtual strip searches' and 'rub-downs'|url=http://www.readthehook.com/66013/rutherford-institute-sues-over-virtual-strip-searches-and-rub-downs|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=The Hook|date=November 16, 2012[/tpl] The next month, the Rutherford Institute filed another lawsuit on the behalf of three passengers that took issue with the TSA screening procedures: a 12-year-old girl placed in a body scanner without parental consent, a man who was subjected to an invasive pat down in his genital area due to an abnormality caused by a childhood injury, and a woman who had undergone a mastectomy and was forcibly patted down in her breast area.[tpl]cite news|title=Rutherford Institute files second suit over TSA procedures|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2010/dec/07/rutherford-institute-files-second-suit-over-tsa-pr-ar-701379/|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=The Daily Progress|date=December 7, 2010[/tpl]
In 2010, President John W. Whitehead sent a letter to Ken Cuccinelli, the Attorney General of Virginia, decrying his legal opinion that school officials may seize and search student cell phones and laptops upon suspicion that a student has broken school rules or the law.[tpl]cite news|last=Helderman|first=Rosalind S.|title=Rutherford Institute: Cuccinelli opinion could turn schools into 'authoritarian police states'|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/12/rutherford_institute_cuccinell.html|accessdate=April 18, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 2, 2010[/tpl] 
In 2011, the group filed a friend of the court brief in the case U.S. v. Jones, imploring the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that the placement of a GPS tracking device on the defendant's car without first obtaining a warrant constituted an illegal search. In January 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must first obtain a warrant before placing a physical GPS tracking unit on a suspect's car.[tpl]cite news|title=Supreme Court rules police must get search warrant to use GPS|url=http://www.pressandguide.com/articles/2012/01/23/news/doc4f1de1a8c56ee579570600.txt|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=Press and Guide|date=January 23, 2012[/tpl]
