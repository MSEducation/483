Shimon (Moni) Fanan (11 May 1946 – 19 October 2009) was the team manager of the Israeli basketball team Maccabi Tel-Aviv during the years 1992–2008.

==Career==

Fanan began his career with the Maccabi in the club's football team as chairman of the youth department. Being a devoted fan of the basketball team, he sat close to the players benches during games. He became a member of the group's management in 1986, and with the retirement of the team manager Shmuel Maharovsky in 1992, Fanan was appointed to replace him. In December 2006 Fanan announced his retirement but shortly renounced it, ultimately retiring in 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1255694844695&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Mac TA icon Fanan commits suicide|date=19 October 2009|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2009-11-16[/tpl]
