The Finnish Meteorological Institute ([tpl]lang-fi|Ilmatieteen laitos[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Meteorologiska institutet[/tpl], or simply FMI) is the government agency responsible for gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts in Finland. It is a part of the Ministry of Transport and Communications ([tpl]lang-fi|Liikenne- ja viestintäministeriö[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Kommunikationsministeriet[/tpl]) but it operates semi-autonomously. 
The Institute is an impartial research and service organisation with expertise covering a wide range of atmospheric science activities other than gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts. The headquarters of the Institute is in Kumpula Campus, Helsinki, Finland.

==Staff==

The number of full-time staff of the Finnish Meteorological Institute is about 540. Permanent staff members account for about 2/3 of the Institute's personnel and those with contractual posts account for the remainder. The Institute operates in on a round-the-clock basis and about 30 percent of the full-time staff work in shifts.
54 percent of the staff have university degrees and 15 percent have a licentiate or PhD degree. The average age of the staff is 43 years.

==Air quality activities==

The Finnish Meteorological Institute has investigated air quality processes and air pollution prevention techniques since the early 1970s. Their staff members have comprehensive competence within the areas of meteorology, physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. Integrated work is done in cooperation with many other European research institutes and universities.
The air quality activities conducted by the Institute include:
The suite of local-scale (0 - 30 km) dispersion models available at the Institute includes: 
Dispersion models for larger scales (30 to 3000 km) are also available.

==Space Research==

The Finnish Meteorological Institute is one of the few places in Finland where space research takes place. The institute has been a part of several high-profile NASA and ESA missions, such as Phoenix, Mars Science Laboratory, Rosetta and BepiColombo, in addition to leading a lander mission of their own, MetNet.
