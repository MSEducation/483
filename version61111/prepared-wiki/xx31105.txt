==Early life and career==

Zinedine Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille in southern France. Zidane is of Kabyle Berber descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/apr/04/sport.features|title=ZZ top|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 April 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/john-lichfield-why-france-still-loves-zidane-407511.html|title=Why France still loves Zidane|publisher=The Independent|date=11 July 2006|location=London[/tpl] His parents, Smaïl and Malika, emigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city's tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of la Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille. In 1972, Zidane was born there as the youngest of five siblings. His father Smaïl worked as a warehouseman at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife. The family live a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighborhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates.
It was in Castellane that Zidane had his earliest introduction to football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood's children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex.In the footsteps Of Zidane, The Independent (uk) In July 2011, Zidane named former Olympique Marseille players Blaž Slišković, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/110702058 |title=Zidane: Slišković mi je bio idol, uživao sam gledati ga - Klix.ba |publisher=Sarajevo-x.com |accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://scsport.ba/v2/tekst.php?ID=21674 |title=Zinedine Zidane: Kad porastem želim biti Baka Slišković! |publisher=Scsport.ba |accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl]
At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player's license after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri. After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO Septèmes-les-Vallons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club's Director to get Zidane.
Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of fourteen, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout, and former player, Jean Varraud who recommended him to the training center director of the club.

==Club career==

===Cannes===

Zidane went to Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family at the age of fourteen to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes director Jean-Claude Elineau, to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that it was in living with the Elineaus that he found equilibrium.
It was at Cannes where Zidane's first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family.Andrew Hussey (Sunday 4 April 2004). "ZZ Top".  The Guardian. Retrieved 24 April 2014 His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins. The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being a French-Algerian suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.
Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 at the age of sixteen in a French Division 1 match against Nantes."Zidane swansong", BBC Sport He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991Agence France-Press from 10 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2–1 win. After the match during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club.Virebayre, Jean. Zinedine Zidane: A diamond in the rough. FIFA magazine Portrait, September 2006, p. 16. On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game. In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club's highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wildstat.com/p/2601/club/FRA_AS_Cannes |title=Club Cannes (Cannes), France |publisher=Wildstat.com |accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl]

Zidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup,[tpl]cite news |title=1995: Bordeaux lay down Intertoto gauntlet |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/intertotocup/history/season=1995/intro.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 August 1995 |accessdate=15 April 2012 [/tpl] and finishing runner-up in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup in four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which team owner and chairman Jack Walker reportedly replied, "Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?"The Ones That Got Away...Zidane – VitalFootball.co.uk, 2006 Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £1.2 million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division.[tpl]cite news |title=Sport.co.uk meets...Football agent Barry Silkman |url=http://www.sport.co.uk/features/sportcouk-meetsfootball-agent-barry-silkman/896 %7C |publisher=sport.co.uk |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2013 [/tpl] In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.Heinz Duthel.
