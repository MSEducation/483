The British Champions Long Distance Cup is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres), and it is scheduled to take place as part of British Champions Day each year in October.

==History==

The event was originally held at Newmarket under the title Jockey Club Cup. It was established in 1873, and was initially contested over 2¼ miles.
The distance of the race was shortened to 1½ miles in 1959. It was extended to its current length in 1963. The event was given Group 3 status in 1971.
For a period the Jockey Club Cup was staged during Newmarket's Cambridgeshire Meeting. It was switched to the venue's Champions Day fixture in 2000. It had a prize fund of £65,000 in 2010.[tpl]cite web | title = 2010 Jockey Club Cup | url = http://www.horseracingintfed.com/racingDisplay.asp?section=8&racepid=48396 | publisher = International Federation of Horseracing Authorities | accessdate = 27 August 2012[/tpl]
The race was transferred to Ascot and given its present name in 2011. It became part of the newly created British Champions Day, and its purse was increased to £200,000. It now serves as the long-distance final of the British Champions Series and was upgraded from Group 3 to Group 2 from its 2014 running.[tpl]cite web|title=European Pattern Committee announces changes to the 2014 European Black Type Programme|url=http://www.britishhorseracing.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/European-Pattern-Committee-announces-changes-to-the-2014-European-Black-Type-Programme-479.aspx|work=britishorseracingauthority.com|accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl]
