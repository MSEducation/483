The Wayne Route 23 Transit Center is a mass transportation hub located in Wayne, New Jersey, USA. Operated by New Jersey Transit, the complex consists of two major components. One is a bus terminal that provides service to Port Authority Bus Terminal, Newark Penn Station, and intermediate points in the surrounding area. The other is a train platform that is connected to the Montclair-Boonton Line and offers service to New York Penn Station, Hoboken Terminal, and local service to points between Montclair State University and Hackettstown.Description of Wayne-Route 23 Park and Ride project from njtransit.com It is located off of the southbound lanes of New Jersey Route 23 on West Belt Road, near the interchange where Route 23, Interstate 80, and U.S. Route 46 meet, across from the Willowbrook Mall. The station opened in January 2008 and has 1,000 parking spaces.New Wayne/Route 23 Transit Center Opens January 12, 2008 New Jersey Transit intends for this combined rail and bus station to become an "interceptor station," that will help relieve the habitual congestion at the West Belt Road Interchange, where the three major highways meet. In addition, the construction of the station was meant to also ease the congestion at what was then Route 23 Park & Ride, a bus depot on Route 23 North that has since been renamed Mother's Park & Ride, and the Willowbrook Mall Park & Ride; the now-Mother's site had limited parking while NJT was having trouble with overfull parking areas at Willowbrook.
The Wayne Township bus garage is located on the opposite side of Route 23.  There has been a proposal to build a parking deck with another thousand spots and develop the land at the station.
In addition to Montclair-Boonton trains, the Transit Center is served by the following New Jersey Transit bus lines:
