Thousands of years ago, urbanisation and mercantile activity along the western and eastern coast of what is today Kerala and Tamil Nadu led to the development of four large Tamil political states (Chera, Chola, Pandya and Pallavas) and a number of smaller states warring amongst themselves for dominance. Between the 3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD, Tamil people also produced native literature that came to be called Sangam literature.
Tamils were noted for their martial, religious and mercantile activities beyond their native borders. Pandyas and Cholas were historically active in Sri Lanka. Pallava traders and religious leaders travelled to South East Asia and played an important role in the cultural Indianisation of the region. Locally developed scripts such as Grantha and Pallava script induced the development of many native scripts such as Khmer, Javanese and Thai.
Tamil visual art is dominated by stylised Temple architecture in major centres and the productions of images of deities in stone and bronze. Chola bronzes, especially the Nataraja sculpture of the Chola period, have become notable as a symbol of Hinduism. Tamil performing arts are divided into popular and classical. Classical form is Bharatanatyam whereas the popular forms are known as Kuthus and performed in village temples and on street corners. Tamil cinema known as Kollywood is an important part of the Indian cinema industry. Music too is divided into classical Carnatic form and many popular genres. Although most Tamils are Hindus, most practice what is considered to be folk Hinduism, venerating a plethora of village deities. A sizeable number are Christians and Muslims. A small Jain community survives from the classical period as well. Tamil cuisine is informed by varied vegetarian and non-vegetarian items usually spiced with locally available spices. The music, the temple architecture and the stylised sculptures favoured by the Tamil people as in their ancient nation are still being learnt and practised. English historian and broadcaster Michael Wood called the Tamils the last surviving classical civilisation on Earth, because the Tamil mainstream preserved substantial elements of their past regarding belief, culture, music and literature despite of the modern globalised world.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/india/gal_india_south_03.shtml |title=Michael Wood, BBC |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=A South Indian Journey: The Smile of Murugan|publisher=Penguin UK|url=http://books.google.at/books?id=sK4hIRAdIJ8C&dq=tamil+last+classical+civilization&source=gbs_navlinks_s[/tpl]

==Etymology==

It is unknown as to whether the term Tamilar and its equivalents in Prakrit such as Damela, Dameda, Dhamila and Damila was a self designation or a term denoted by outsiders. Epigraphic evidence of an ethnic group termed as such is found in ancient Sri Lanka where a number of inscriptions have come to light datable from the 6th to the 5th century BC mentioning Damela or Dameda persons. In the well-known Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga ruler Kharavela, refers to a Tramira samghata (Confederacy of Tamil rulers) dated to 150 BC. It also mentions that the league of Tamil kingdoms had been in existence 113 years before then. In Amaravati in present day Andhra Pradesh there is an inscription referring to a Dhamila-vaniya (Tamil trader) datable to the 3rd century AD. Another inscription of about the same time in Nagarjunakonda seems to refer to a Damila. A third inscription in Kanheri Caves refers to a Dhamila-gharini (Tamil house-holder). In the Buddhist Jataka story known as Akiti Jataka there is a mention to Damila-rattha (Tamil dynasty). There were trade relationship between the Roman Empire and Pandyan Empire.  As recorded by Strabo, Emperor Augustus of Rome received at Antioch an ambassador from a king called Pandyan of Dramira.The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia By Edward Balfour Hence, it is clear that by at least the 300 BC, the ethnic identity of Tamils has been formed as a distinct group.Indrapala, K The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p.155-156 Tamilar is etymologically related to Tamil, the language spoken by Tamil people. Southworth suggests that the name comes from tam-miz > tam-iz 'self-speak', or 'one's own speech'.[tpl]Citation | last=Southworth | first=Franklin C. | title=On the Origin of the word tamiz | year=1998 | journal=International Journal of Dravidial Linguistics | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=129–132[/tpl] Zvelebil suggests an etymology of tam-iz, with tam meaning "self" or "one's self", and "-iz" having the connotation of "unfolding sound". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of tamiz  Dramila > Damila > Tamila > TamilarGustav Salomon Oppert, On the Original Inhabitants of Bharatavarsa Or India: The Dravidians, p 41

==History==

===Tamils in India===

====Pre-historic period====

Possible evidence indicating the earliest presence of Tamil people in modern day Tamil Nadu are the megalithic urn burials, dating from around 1500 BC and onwards, which have been discovered at various locations in Tamil Nadu, notably in Adichanallur in Tirunelveli District[tpl]Citation | last = John | first = Vino|title =Reading the past in a more inclusive way: Interview with Dr. Sudharshan Seneviratne| publisher =Frontline| date =27 January 2006|url= http://www.flonnet.com/fl2301/stories/20060127003610200.htm| accessdate =9 July 2008|quote= But Indian/south Indian history/archaeology has pushed the date back to 1500 B.C., and in Sri Lanka, there are definitely good radiometric dates coming from Anuradhapura that the non-Brahmi symbol-bearing black and red ware occur at least around 900 B.C. or 1000 B.C.[/tpl]Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Thirunelveli district and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture – K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, pp49–51 which conform to the descriptions of funerals in classical Tamil literature.
Various legends became prevalent after the 10th century AD regarding the antiquity of the Tamil people. According to Iraiyanar Agapporul, a 10th/11th century annotation on the Sangam literature, the Tamil country extended southwards beyond the natural boundaries of the Indian peninsula comprising 49 ancient nadus (divisions). The land was supposed to have been destroyed by a deluge. The Sangam legends also added to the antiquity of the Tamil people by claiming tens of thousands of years of continuous literary activity during three Sangams.Nilakanta Sastri, A history of South India, p 105

====Classical period====

From around the 3rd century BC onwards, three local royal dynasties—the Cholas, the Cheras and the Pandyas—rose to dominate the ancient Tamil country. Each of these dynasties had its own realm within the Tamil-speaking region. Classical literature and inscriptions also describe a number of Velirs, or minor chieftains, who collectively ruled over large parts of central Tamil Nadu. Wars between the kings and the chieftains were frequent, as were conflicts with ancient Sri Lanka. These wars appear to have been fought to assert hegemony and demand tribute, rather than to subjugate and annexe those territories. The kings and chieftains were patrons of the arts, and a significant volume of literature exists from this period. The literature shows that many of the cultural practices that are considered peculiarly Tamil date back to the classical period.
Agriculture was important during this period, and there is evidence that networks of irrigation channels were built as early as 2nd century AD. Internal and external trade flourished, and evidence of significant contact with Ancient Rome exists. Large quantities of Roman coins and signs of the presence of Roman traders have been discovered at Karur and Arikamedu. There is evidence that at least two embassies were sent to the Roman Emperor Augustus by Pandya kings.[tpl]Citation| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058245/Pandya-Dynasty|title= Pandya Dynasty|work= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate =3 May 2007[/tpl] Potsherds with Tamil writing have also been found in excavations on the Red Sea, suggesting the presence of Tamil merchants there.[tpl]Citation | title= Archaeologists Uncover Ancient Maritime Spice Route Between India, Egypt | work= Veluppillai, Prof. A., | url= http://www.dickran.net/history/india_egypt_trade_route.html|publisher=dickran.net | accessdate=15 November 2006[/tpl] An anonymous 1st century traveller's account written in Greek, Periplus Maris Erytraei, describes the ports of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms in Damirica and their commercial activity in great detail.

The classical period ended around the 4th century AD with invasions by the Kalabhra, referred to as the kalappirar in Tamil literature and inscriptions. These invaders are described as evil kings and barbarians coming from lands to the north of the Tamil country.'Kalabhraas were denounced as 'evil kings' (kaliararar) – K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, pp 130 This period, commonly referred to as the Dark Age of the Tamil country, ended with the rise of the Pallava dynasty.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India According to Clarence Maloney, during the classical period Tamils also settled the Maldive Islands.[tpl]Citation|title=Maldives People|author=Maloney, Clarence|url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|accessdate=22 June 2008[/tpl]

====Imperial and post-imperial periods====

The Pallavas were followers of Hinduism, though for a short while one of their kings embraced Jainism and later converted to Hinduism.(Source- K.A.Nilakanta Sastri's "History of South India") The Bhakti movement in Hinduism was founded at this time, and rose along with the growing influence of Jainism and Buddhism.[tpl]Citation|last = Chandra|first= Satish|title=  Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526) – I|year=1997|publisher= Har-Anand Publications|page = 250|isbn = 81-241-1064-6|quote = ...Starting from the Tamil lands under the Pallava kings, bhakti spread to different parts of south India...[/tpl] The Pallavas pioneered the building of large, ornate temples in stone which formed the basis of the Dravidian temple architecture. They came into conflict with the Kannada Chalukyas of Badami. During this period, The great Badami Chalukya King Pulakesi II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the Pallava kingdom and defeated the Pallavas in several battles.Chopra, Ravindran and Subramanian (2003), p. 74 part 1 Pallava Narasimhavarman however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily.Sastri (1955), p. 136 However a later Chalukya King Vikramaditya II took revenge by repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava Nandivarman II and the annexation of Kanchipuram.Sastri 1955, p. 140 The Pallava dynasty was overthrown in the 9th century by the imperial Kannada Rashtrakutas who ruled from Gulbarga. King Krishna III, the last great Rashtrakuta king consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.Sastri (1955), p162
Under Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas became dominant in the 10th century and established an empire covering most of South India and Sri Lanka. The empire had strong trading links with Chinese Song Dynasty and Southeast Asia.[tpl]Citation|last = Srivastava|first= Balram|title=  Rajendra Chola|year=1973|publisher=  National Book Trust, India|page = 80|quote = The mission which Rajendra sent to China was essentially a trade mission,...[/tpl][tpl]Citation|last = D.

They conquered the coastal areas around the Bay of Bengal and turned it to Chola lake. Rajendra Chola improved his father's fleet and created the first notable marine of the Indian subcontinent. The Chola navy conquered the Sri Vijaya Empire of Indonesia and the Philippines and secured the sea trade route to China. Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer Kingdom of Cambodia.Om Gupta, Encyclopaedia of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, pp 532 The power of the Cholas declined around the 13th century and the Pandyan Empire enjoyed a brief period of resurgence thereafter during the rule of Sundara Pandya. The Pandyan Empire was threatened by the constant Islamic invasions of South India. In the early 14th Century, Madurai, the capital of Pandyans was conquered by Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan and an independent Madurai Sultanate was established. The short-lived Madurai Sultanate was captured in 1378 by the Vijayanagara Empire. During the 15th century became the Vijayanagara Empire a dominant power of South India. After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1646, was Tamil Nadu dominated by small states like the Madurai Nayaks.
The western Tamil lands became increasingly politically distinct from the rest of the Tamil lands after the Chola and Pandya empires lost control over them in the 13th century.[tpl]Citation |last=Freeman |first=Rich |date=February 1998 |title=Rubies and Coral: The Lapidary Crafting of Language in Kerala |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=38–65 |doi=10.2307/2659023 |publisher=Association for Asian Studies |jstor=2659023[/tpl] at pp. 41–43.

===Tamils in Sri Lanka===

There is little scholarly consensus over the presence of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka, prior to the medieval Chola period (c. 10th century AD). One theory states that there was not an organised Tamil presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 10th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were the original inhabitants of the island.Natarajan, V., History of Ceylon Tamils, p. 9Manogaran, C.  Ethnic Conflict and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka, p. 2 Yet according to another theory cultural diffusion, rather than migration of people, spread the Tamil language from peninsular India into an existing Mesolithic population, centuries before the Christian era.Indrapala, K. The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, pp. 53–54
However according to Tamil tradition in Sri Lanka, they believe that they are lineal descendants of the aboriginal Naga and Yaksha people of Sri Lanka. The "Nakar" used the cobra totem known as "Nakam" in the Tamil language, which is still part of the Hindu Tamil tradition in Sri Lanka today as a subordinate deity.[tpl]Citation|first=South Asia Association|title=South Asia Bulletin|year=1987|publisher=Google|location=University of California, Los Angeles|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W9kuAQAAIAAJ&dq=Sri+Lankan+tamil+naga&q=%22According+to+tradition%2C+the+Tamils+of+India+and+Sri+Lanka+are+the+lineal+descendants+of+the+Naga+and+Yaksha+people.+The+aboriginal+Nagas%2C+called+Nakar+in+Tamil+had+the+cobra+%28Nakam+in+Tamil%29+as+their+totem.%22#search_anchor[/tpl]

"Two different nations from a very ancient period have divided between them the possession of the island. First the Sinhalese, inhabiting the interior in its Southern and Western parts, and secondly the Malabars name for Tamils who possess the Northern and Eastern districts. These two nations differ entirely in their religion, language, and manners." McConnell, D., 2008; Ponnambalam, S. 1983[/ref]
The caste structure of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century AD. This led to the emergence of three new Sinhalese caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava.Spencer, Sri Lankan history and roots of conflict, p. 23Indrapala, K., The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p. 275 The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century.[tpl]harvnb|de Silva|1997|p= 121[/tpl]

===Modern period===

British colonists consolidated the Tamil territory in southern India into the Madras Presidency, which was integrated into British India. Similarly, the Tamil speaking parts of Sri Lanka joined with the other regions of the island in 1802 to form the Ceylon colony. They remained in political union with India and Sri Lanka after their independence, in 1947 and 1948 respectively.
When India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became the Madras State, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, northern Kerala, and the southwest coast of Karnataka. The state was subsequently split along linguistic lines. In 1953, the northern districts formed Andhra Pradesh. Under the States Reorganization Act in 1956, Madras State lost its western coastal districts. The Bellary and South Kanara districts were ceded to Mysore state, and Kerala was formed from the Malabar district and the former princely states of Travancore and Cochin. In 1968, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu.
There was some initial demand for an independent Tamil state following the adoption of the federal system.[tpl]Citation |first = P.C. |last = Vinoj Kumar  |author =  |coauthors = |url = http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=op092306Tamil_Nadu.asp |title = Tamil Nadu at the Crossroads |work =  |publisher = www.tehelka.com |pages =  |page =  |date =  |accessdate =2 December 2006 |language = [/tpl] In Sri Lanka, however, the unitary arrangement led to legislative discrimination of Tamils by the Sinhalese majority. This resulted in a demand for federalism, which in the 1970s grew into a movement for an autonomous Tamil country. The situation deteriorated into civil war in the early 1980s. A ceasefire in effect since 2002 broke down in August 2006 amid shelling and bombing from both sides; in 2009 the Tamil Tigers were defeated amid accusations of war crimes committed against the Tamil populace by the Sri Lankan state. Today Tamils make up 18% of Sri Lanka's population (3.8 Million).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tourism-srilanka.com/population.html |title=Population of Sri Lanka – Srilanka People |publisher=Tourism-srilanka.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl]

===Indian Tamils===

Most Tamils in India live in the state of Tamil Nadu. Tamils are the majority in the union territory of Puducherry, a former French colony. Puducherry is a subnational enclave situated within Tamil Nadu. Tamils account for at least one-sixth of the population in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
There are significant Tamil communities in other parts of India. Most of these have emerged fairly recently, dating to the colonial and post-colonial periods, but some—particularly the Hebbar and Mandyam Tamils of southern Karnataka (2.9 million), Pune, Maharashtra (1.4 million), Andhra Pradesh (1.2 million), Palakkad and Trivandrum in Kerala (0.6 million), and Delhi (0.1 million) — date back to at least the medieval period.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement3.htm |title=Almost 5 million Tamils live outside Tamil Nadu, inside India |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |date= |accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl]

===Sri Lankan Tamils===

There are two groups of Tamils in Sri Lanka: the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Indian Tamils. The Sri Lankan Tamils (or Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded labourers sent from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.[tpl]harvnb|de Silva|1997|pp= 177, 181[/tpl] Furthermore, there is a significant Tamil-speaking Muslim population in Sri Lanka; however, unlike Tamil Muslims from India, they are not ethnic Tamils and are therefore listed as a separate ethnic group in official statistics.[tpl]harvnb|de Silva|1997|pp= 3–5, 9[/tpl]
Most Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and in the capital Colombo, whereas most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands.[tpl]Citation|title=Population by Ethnicity according to District|author=Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/PDF/Population/p9p8%20Ethnicity.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=statistics.gov.lk|accessdate=3 May 2007[/tpl] Historically both groups have seen themselves as separate communities, although there is a greater sense of unity since the 1980s.[tpl]Citation |author=V.

Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about 40 percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and many of the remainder were repatriated to India.[tpl]harvnb|de Silva|1997|p= 262[/tpl] By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.

===Tamil diaspora===

Significant Tamil emigration began in the 18th century, when the British colonial government sent many poor Tamils as indentured labourers to far-off parts of the Empire, especially Malaya, South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius and the Caribbean. At about the same time, many Tamil businessmen also migrated to other parts of the British Empire, particularly to Burma and East Africa.[tpl]Citation | title= The Tamil Migration Cycle 1830–1950 |author=Christophe Z Guilmoto | work= |publisher= Economic and Political Weekly| jstor= 4399307 | pages= 111–120 | volume= 28 | issue= 3 | journal= Economic and Political Weekly | year= 1993[/tpl]
Many Tamils still live in these countries, and the Tamil communities in Singapore, Reunion Island, Malaysia and South Africa have retained much of their original culture and language. Many Malaysian children attend Tamil schools, and a significant portion of Tamil children in Mauritius and Reunion are brought up with Tamil as their first language. In Singapore, Tamil students learn Tamil as their second language in school, with English as the first. To preserve the Tamil language, the Singapore government has made it an official language despite Tamils comprising only about 5% of the population, and has also introduced compulsory instruction of the language for Tamils. Other Tamil communities, such as those in South Africa and Fiji, no longer speak Tamil as a first language, but still retain a strong Tamil identity, and are able to understand the language, while most elders speak it as a first language.[tpl]Citation | title= Tamil diaspora – a trans state nation |author=| work= | url= http://searchko.in/literature/ta-cached.jsp?id=82&idx=0|publisher= Tamilnation.org  | accessdate=4 December 2006[/tpl]
A large emigration also began in the 1980s, as Sri Lankan Tamils sought to escape the ethnic conflict there. These recent emigrants have most often fled to Australia, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia.[tpl]Citation | first= Chris | last= McDowell | authorlink= | coauthors= | year= 1996| title= A Tamil Asylum Diaspora: Sri Lankan Migration, Settlement and Politics in Switzerland | edition= | publisher= Berghahn Books| location= New York | isbn=1-57181-917-7 [/tpl] Today, the largest concentration of Tamils outside southern Asia is in Toronto, Canada.[tpl]cite web | last = Foster | first = Carly | title = Tamils: Population in Canada | publisher = Ryerson University|year=2007 | url = http://www.diversitywatch.ryerson.ca/backgrounds/tamils.htm| accessdate =25 June 2008|quote = According to government figures, there are about 200,000 Tamils in Canada[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Language and literature===

Tamils have strong attachment to the Tamil language, which is often venerated in literature as "Tamil̲an̲n̲ai", "the Tamil mother".See Sumathi Ramasamy, Passions of the Tongue, 'Feminising language: Tamil as Goddess, Mother, Maiden' Chapter 3.  It has historically been, and to large extent still is, central to the Tamil identity.(Ramaswamy 1998) Like the other languages of South India, it is a Dravidian language, unrelated to the Indo-European languages of northern India. The language has been far less influenced by Sanskrit than the other Dravidian languages, and preserves many features of Proto-Dravidian, though modern-day spoken Tamil in Tamil Nadu, freely uses loanwords from Sanskrit and English.[tpl]Citation | last=Kailasapathy | first=K.| title=The Tamil Purist Movement: A Re-Evaluation | journal=Social Scientist | volume=7 | issue=10 | year=1979 | pages=23–51| doi=10.2307/3516775 | publisher=Social Scientist | jstor=3516775[/tpl] Tamil literature is of considerable antiquity, and is recognised as a classical language by the government of India. Classical Tamil literature, which ranges from lyric poetry to works on poetics and ethical philosophy, is remarkably different from contemporary and later literature in other Indian languages, and represents the oldest body of secular literature in South Asia.See Hart, The Poems of Ancient Tamil: Their Milieu and their Sanskrit Counterparts (1975)

Muslims across Tamil Nadu follow Hanafi and Shafi'i schools. Most Tamil Muslims are Shadhilis. Erwadi in Ramanathapuram district and Nagore in Nagapattinam districtIndian Dargah's All Cities are the major pilgrimage centres for Muslims in Tamil Nadu.
The most important Tamil festivals are Pongal, a harvest festival that occurs in mid-January, and Varudapirappu, the Tamil New Year, which occurs on 14 April. Both are celebrated by almost all Tamils, regardless of religion. The Hindu festival Deepavali is celebrated with fanfare; other local Hindu festivals include Thaipusam, Panguni Uttiram, and Adiperukku. While Adiperukku is celebrated with more pomp in the Cauvery region than in others, the Ayyavazhi Festival, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, is predominantly celebrated in the southern districts of Kanyakumari District, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi.Information on declaration of holiday on the event of birth anniversary of Vaikundar in The Hindu, The holiday for three Districts:  Daily Thanthi, Daily(Tamil), Nagercoil Edition, 5 March 2006

The Saivist sect of Hinduism is significantly represented amongst Tamils, more so among Sri Lankan Tamils, although most of the Saivist places of religious significance are in northern India. The Alvars and Nayanars, who were predominantly Tamils, played a key role in the renaissance of Bhakti tradition in India. In the 10th century, the philosopher Ramanuja, who propagated the theory of Visishtadvaitam, brought many changes to worshiping practices, creating new regulations on temple worship, and accepted lower-caste Hindus as his prime disciples.[tpl]Citation | title= Redefining secularism |author= | work=The Hindu, 18 March 2004 | url= http://www.hindu.com/2004/03/18/stories/2004031801941000.htm | accessdate=5 December 2006 | location=Chennai, India | date=18 March 2004[/tpl]
Tamil Jains constitute around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu. Many of the rich Tamil literature works were written by Jains.Jaina Literature in Tamil, Prof. A. Chakravartis According to George L. Hart, the legend of the Tamil Sangams or "literary assemblies: was based on the Jain sangham at Madurai."There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 A.D. in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend."

The most important form of Tamil painting is Tanjore painting, which originated in Thanjavur in the 9th century.

Contemporary dance forms such as Bharatanatyam have recent origins but are based older temple dance forms known as Catir Kacceri as practised by courtesans and a class of women known as Devadasis
One of the Tamil folk dances is karakattam. In its religious form, the dance is performed in front of an image of the goddess Mariamma.Sharma, Manorama (2004). Folk India: A Comprehensive Study of Indian Folk Music and Culture, Vol. 11 The kuravanci is a type of dance-drama, performed by four to eight women. The drama is opened by a woman playing the part of a female soothsayer of the kurava tribe(people of hills and mountains), who tells the story of a lady pining for her lover. The therukoothu, literally meaning "street play", is a form of village theater or folk opera. It is traditionally performed in village squares, with no sets and very simple props.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html|title=Therukoothu|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=16 February 2013[/tpl] The performances involve songs and dances, and the stories can be either religious or secular.[tpl]Citation | title= Tamil Art History |author= | work= | url= http://www.eelavar.com/jaffna/pageview.php?ID=578&SID=119|publisher= eelavar.com | accessdate=5 December 2006[/tpl] The performances are not formal, and performers often interact with the audience, mocking them, or involving them in the dialogue.

===Martial arts===

Various martial arts including Kuttu Varisai, Varma Kalai, Silambam Nillaikalakki, Maankombukkalai (Madhu) and Kalarippayattu, are practised in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Zarrilli, Phillip B. (1992) "To Heal and/or To Harm: The Vital Spots in Two South Indian Martial Traditions" The weapons used include Silambam, Maankombukkalai, Yeratthai Mulangkol (double stick), Surul Pattai (spring sword), Val Vitchi (single sword), and Yeretthai Val (double sword).[tpl]Citation|last=Raj|first=David Manuel|title=Silambam fencing from India | edition=2nd | place=Palayamkottai | publisher=Fatima Printing Press | year=1975[/tpl] at pp. 54–62
In Ancient times, Two bullfighting sports were conducted. 1.Manjuvirattu and 2. Yeruthazhuval.  These sports were organised to keep the people's temperament always fit and ready for the war at anytime. Each has its own techniques and rules. These sports acted as one of the criteria to marry girls of warrior family. There were traditions where the winner would be chosen as bridegroom for their daughter or sister.
Mr. Gandhirajan, who is a post-graduate in Art History from Madurai-Kamaraj University, said the ancient Tamil tradition was “manju virattu” (chasing bulls) or “eruthu kattuthal” (lassoing bulls) and it was never “jallikattu,” that is baiting a bull or controlling it as the custom obtained today. In ancient Tamil country, during the harvest festival, decorated bulls would be let loose on the “peru vazhi” (highway) and the village youth would take pride in chasing them and outrunning them. Women, elders and children would watch the fun from the sidelines of the “peru vazhi” or streets. Nobody was injured in this. Or the village youth would take delight in lassoing the sprinting bulls with “vadam” (rope).
It was about 500 years ago, after the advent of the Nayak rule in Tamil Nadu with its Telugu rulers and chieftains, that this harmless bull-chasing sport metamorphosed into “jallikattu,” said Mr. Gandhirajan. 

The ancient Tamil art of unarmed bullfighting, popular amongst warriors in the classical period, has also survived in parts of Tamil Nadu, notably Alanganallur near Madurai, where it is known as Jallikaṭṭu  and is held once a year around the time of the Pongal festival.
