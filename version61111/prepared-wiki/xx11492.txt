VAX  was an instruction set architecture (ISA), developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the mid-1970s. The VAX-11/780 introduced on October 25, 1977 was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing that architecture.
A 32-bit complex instruction set computer based on DEC's earlier PDP-11, VAX ("Virtual Address eXtension"), was designed to extend or replace DEC's various PDP ISAs. The VAX architecture's primary features were virtual addressing (for example demand paged virtual memory) and its orthogonal instruction set.
VAX has been perceived as the quintessential CISC ISA, with its very large number of programmer-friendly addressing modes and machine instructions, highly orthogonal architecture, and instructions for complex operations such as queue insertion or deletion and polynomial evaluation.

==Name==

"VAX" is originally an acronym for virtual address extension, both because the VAX was seen as a 32-bit extension of the older 16-bit PDP-11 and because it was (after Prime Computer) an early adopter of virtual memory to manage this larger address space.  Early versions of the VAX processor implemented a "compatibility mode" that emulated many of the PDP-11's instructions, and were in fact called VAX-11 to highlight this compatibility and the fact that VAX-11 was an outgrowth of the PDP-11 family. Later versions offloaded the compatibility mode and some of the less used CISC instructions to emulation in the operating system software.

==Instruction set==

The VAX instruction set was designed to be powerful and orthogonal.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] When it was introduced, many programs were written in assembly language, so having a "programmer-friendly" instruction set was important.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] In time, as more programs were written in higher-level language, the instruction set became less visible, and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers.
One unusual[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] aspect of the VAX instruction set is the presence of register masks at the start of each subprogram. These are arbitrary bit patterns that specify, when control is passed to the subprogram, which registers are to be preserved. Since register masks are a form of data embedded within the executable code, they can make linear parsing of the machine code difficult. This can complicate optimization techniques that are applied on machine code.

==Operating systems==

The  "native" VAX operating system is DEC's VAX/VMS
(renamed to OpenVMS in 1991 or 1992 when it was ported to Alpha,
"branded" by the X/Open consortium,
and modified to comply with POSIX standards[ref]
