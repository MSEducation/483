Zimrat ([tpl]lang-he-n|זִמְרָת[/tpl], lit. Song) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located near Netivot and covering 4,500 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 271.
The village was established in 1957 by immigrants from Tunisia after a split in nearby Shuva. Initially called Shuva Bet, it was later renamed Zimrat, which was taken from the Book of Exodus 15:2;
 The LORD is my strength and song, and He is become my salvation; this is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him.
