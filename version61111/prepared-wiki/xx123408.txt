The Mural Arts Program is an anti-graffiti mural program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1986 and directed by Jane Golden as a division of the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network. Its roots began in a 1984 meeting between Tim Spencer and Golden. Golden asked to run a program within the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network. Spencer envisioned a program that would entice kids towards other arts and crafts, but Golden envisioned what is now the current Mural Arts Program.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=13201 |publisher= Philadelphia Weekly Online |date= October 18, 2006 |title=Philadelphia Weekly Online: Hit the Wall[/tpl]

==History==

In 1984, Golden met with Tim Spencer, who was head of the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network, in hopes of creating a program under the umbrella project. Spencer had originally envisioned a program that would rehabilitate graffiti artists and into other arts and crafts. Golden's vision won out and the Mural Arts Program was created. The Mural Arts Program works with community groups to educate and involve children in arts and in creation of murals throughout the city.
In 1986, the Mural Arts Project, headed by artist Jane Golden,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Temple University | title =Jane Golden, Robin Rice, Natalie Pompilio: More Philadelphia Murals and the Stories They Tell | url= http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1863_reg.html |accessdate=November 14, 2006[/tpl] was founded as a division of the Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Mural Arts Program |title=Mural Arts Program: About Us |url= http://www.muralarts.org/about/ | accessdate=November 14, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Philadelphia Department of Recreation: Cultural Programs: Mural Arts |publisher=Philadelphia Department of Recreation |accessdate=November 14, 2006 | url=http://www.phila.gov/revenue/cultural/murals.html[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In 1991, Philadelphia was awarded the Innovations in American Government Award due to the success of the Mural Arts Project and Mural Arts Program in surrounding communities.[tpl]cite web|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture: National Agriculture Library |accessdate=November 14, 2006 |url= http://www.nal.usda.gov/pavnet/ce/cepagn.htm |title=Philadelphia Anti-Graffiti Network (PAGN) |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060827162118/http://www.nal.usda.gov/pavnet/ce/cepagn.htm  |archivedate = August 27, 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/awards.html?id=3525 |publisher= John F.
