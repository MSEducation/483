==History==

Nexopia evolved from the community site called Enternexus.com, a website built by Timo Ewalds. This initial beta site was limited to 70 members and eventually led to the current website, Nexopia.com. When Enternexus.com was relaunched as Nexopia.com, initial growth is reported as follows: 100 users joined within four days, and within 22 months the site grew to 225,000 users.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theadminzone.com/forums/showpost.php?p=39819&postcount=11 |title=Admin Zone Forums - View Single Post - How long did the '1000 members' milestone take you? |deadurl=no |accessdate=January 25, 2013[/tpl] For a brief period during that time, Nexopia.com maintained a level of growth of 10% or 3500 average new members per day.Admin Zone Forums - View Single Post - Most new members on one day Other available statistics are for the month of January 2005, bandwidth was estimated at 8â€“10 terabytes.Admin Zone Forums - View Single Post - How much bandwidth have you used so far this month?
In October 2010, the site had just under 1.5 million users and nearly 35 billion hits. As for January 2012, the site reports 1,636,990 users and 35,517,895,992 hits. That means a growth of roughly 140,000 users in just under 14 months, which is about half as many new users in half the amount of time as when the site started. In other words, the site is still growing by nearly the same amount of users per year as it was since its inception.
The website initially had problems using PayPal as a payment method for their premium service (Plus) reportedly due to their demographic and issues with stolen credit cards.2checkout.com - Using Them? - Admin Zone Forums It now uses Interac Online, a service that allows account holders at participating banks to make payments online through online banking.

==Update==
