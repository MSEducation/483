Mi'ar ([tpl]lang-ar|ميعار[/tpl]), known to the Crusaders as Myary, was a Palestinian village located 17.5 kilometers east of Acre. It was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

==History==

Mi'ar contained the archaeological remains of buildings, fragments of columns, olive presses, and cisterns.Khalidi, 1992, p.26.
In 1596, Mi'ar  was part of the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka under the Liwa of Safad, with a population of 55. It paid taxes on wheat and barley, fruit, as well as on goats and beehives.Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 193. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 26
In the late nineteenth century, the village of Mi'ar   was described as a large village situated on high ground that was rough and uncultivated. The villagers, whose number was estimated to be 1500 (in 1859), cultivated some 30 faddans.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, Vol. I, p.271. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 26 An elementary school was founded by the Ottomans in 1888, however, it closed its doors in the final years of the Empire.
During the Arab Revolt in October 1938, the village was entirely destroyed by the British army for its alleged support of the rebels.Hughes, M. (2009) The banality of brutality: British armed forces and the repression of the Arab Revolt in Palestine, 1936–39, English Historical Review Vol. CXXIV No. 507, 314–354.
All the villagers were Muslim. In 1944/45 a total of 2,878 dunams of village land was used for cereals, while 113 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards.Hadawi, 1990, p.81

===1948 War and aftermath===

On 20 June 1948 Israeli soldiers  entered the village of Mi'ar and shot indiscriminately against the villagers while they were working in their fields.  According to  Ilan Pappé, the houses were destroyed. 40 villagers were killed. One witness was the writer Muhammad Ali Taha, then a 17 year old boy. The villagers later returned to Mi'ar and continued living there until the Israeli troops re-occupied it in mid-July 1948 and expelled them for good.Pappé, 2006, p. 150
Its 893 inhabitants fled an attack by the Israeli Sheva Brigade, part of the second stage of Operation Dekel, on 15 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.Morris, Benny, (second edition 2004 third printing 2006) The Birth Of The Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-00967-7 p 421[tpl]Cite web|title=Welcome to Mi'ar|publisher=Palestine Remembered|accessdate=2007-12-04|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Mi'ar/index.html[/tpl]
The Jewish localities of Segev and Ya'ad currently lie upon the former village's lands. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the village in 1992 was: "Some truncated stone walls, simple graves, and fig and olive trees remain on the site, which is covered by cypress trees. The area has been turned into recreational and picnic grounds."
