[[Magnesium perchlorate]]

CATEGORIES: Perchlorates, Magnesium compounds, Oxidizing agents

Magnesium perchlorate is a powerful oxidizing agent, with the formula Mg(ClO4)2. It is also a superior drying agent for gas analysis.
Magnesium perchlorate decomposes at 250 °C.CRC Handbook The heat of formation is -568.90 kJ mol-1.Lange's
The enthalpy of solution is quite high, so reactions are done in large amounts of water to dilute it.
It is sold under the trade name anhydrone. Manufacture of this product on a semi-industrial scale was first performed by G. Frederick Smith Ph.D. in his garage in Urbana Illinois, but later at a permanent facility in Columbus, OH called G. Frederick Smith Chemical Co. He sold the magnesium perchlorate to A. H. Thomas Co., now Thomas Scientific, under the trade name Dehydrite. 
It is used as desiccant to dry gas or air samples, but is no longer advised, for use as a general desiccant, due to hazards inherent in perchlorates.[tpl]cite book | author = W. L. F. Armarego and C.

Magnesium perchlorate is created by the reaction of magnesium hydroxide and perchloric acid.
