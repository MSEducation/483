Yoga (Sanskrit: [tpl]lang|inc|योग[/tpl] [tpl]Audio|Yoga pronounce.ogg|pronunciation[/tpl]) is the physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India with a view to attain a state of permanent peace of mind in order to experience one's true self.Bryant 2009, p. 10.Bryant 2009, p. 457.  The term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate).[tpl]cite book |last= Dasgupta |first= Surendranath |title= A History of Indian Philosophy | volume =1 |year= 1975 |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |location= Delhi, India |isbn= 81-208-0412-0 |page= 226[/tpl] The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali defines yoga as "the stilling of the changing states of the mind" (Sanskrit: योग: चित्त-वृत्ति निरोध:). Yoga has also been popularly defined as "union with the divine" in other contexts and traditions.Bryant 2009, p. xvii.
Various traditions of yoga are found in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.Denise Lardner Carmody, John Carmody, Serene Compassion.

Pre–philosophical speculations and diverse ascetic practices of first millennium BCE were systematized into a formal philosophy in early centuries CE by the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.Whicher, pp. 38–39. By the turn of the first millennium, hatha yoga emerged from tantra.James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 28 June 2012.  19 September 2013 pg.1 "Scholarship on hathayoga, my own included, unanimously declares it to be a reformation of tantric yoga introduced by the gurus of the Nath sampradaya, in particular their supposed founder, Goraksa."Burley, Mikel (2000). Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. p. 16. "It is for this reason that hatha-yoga is sometimes referred to as a variety of 'Tantrism'." It, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word yoga today. Vajrayana Buddhism, founded by the Indian Mahasiddhas,Davidson, Ronald. Indian Esoteric Buddhism. Columbia University Press. 2002, pg.169-235. has a parallel series of asanas and pranayamas, such as caṇḍālī and trul khor.
Gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west,[tpl]sfn|White|2011|p=2[/tpl] following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century.[tpl]sfn|White|2011|p=2[/tpl] In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world. This form of yoga is often called Hatha yoga. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma, and heart disease.[tpl]cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kelly B.|first2=Caroline F. |last2=Pukall|title=An evidence-based review of yoga as a complementary intervention for patients with cancer|journal=Psycho-Oncology|date=May 2009|volume=18|issue=5|pages=465–475|doi=10.1002/pon.1411|pmid=18821529[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last1=Vancampfort | first1=D. | last2=Vansteeland | first2=K. | last3=Scheewe | first3=T. | last4=Probst | first4=M. | last5=Knapen | first5=J. | last6=De Herdt | first6=A. | last7=De Hert | first7=M. | title=Yoga in schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials | journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |date=July 2012 | volume=126 | issue=1 | pages=12–20[/tpl], art.nr. 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2012.01865.x[tpl]cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Manoj|first2=Taj|last2= Haider|title=Yoga as an Alternative and Complementary Treatment for Asthma: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary & Alternative Medicine|date=October 2012|volume=17|issue=3|pages=212–217|doi=10.1177/2156587212453727[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Innes|first=Kim E.|first2=Cheryl |last2=Bourguignon|title=Risk Indices Associated with the Insulin Resistance Syndrome, Cardiovascular Disease, and Possible Protection with Yoga: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine|date=November–December 2005|volume=18|issue=6|pages=491–519[/tpl] In a national survey, long-term yoga practitioners in the United States reported musculo–skeletal and mental health improvements.

==Terminology==

In Vedic Sanskrit, the more commonly used, literal meaning of the Sanskrit word [tpl]IAST|yoga[/tpl] which is "to add", "to join", "to unite", or "to attach" from the root [tpl]IAST|yuj[/tpl], already had a much more figurative sense, where the yoking or harnessing of oxen or horses takes on broader meanings such as "employment, use, application, performance" (compare the figurative uses of "to harness" as in "to put something to some use"). All further developments of the sense of this word are post-Vedic. More prosaic moods such as "exertion", "endeavour", "zeal", and "diligence" are also found in Epic Sanskrit.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
There are very many compound words containing yog in Sanskrit. Yoga can take on meanings such as "connection", "contact", "method", "application", "addition", and "performance". 
In simpler words, Yoga also means "combined".
For example, guṇá-yoga means "contact with a cord"; chakrá-yoga has a medical sense of "applying a splint or similar instrument by means of pulleys (in case of dislocation of the thigh)"; chandrá-yoga has the astronomical sense of "conjunction of the moon with a constellation"; puṃ-yoga is a grammatical term expressing "connection or relation with a man", etc. Thus, bhakti-yoga means "devoted attachment" in the monotheistic Bhakti movement. The term kriyā-yoga has a grammatical sense, meaning "connection with a verb". But the same compound is also given a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras (2.1), designating the "practical" aspects of the philosophy, i.e. the "union with the Supreme" due to performance of duties in everyday lifeWhicher, p. 6–7.
In Hindu philosophy, the word yoga is used to refer to one of the six orthodox (āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy.
 The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are often labelled as Rāja yoga.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, pp. 19–20. According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology.Bryant 2009, p. 5. In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa (c. 4th or 5th century CE), who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras,Bryant 2009, p. xxxix. states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).[tpl]cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page= 1[/tpl] In other texts and contexts, such as the Bhagavad Gītā and the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the word yoga has been used in conformity with yujir yoge (to yoke).[tpl]cite book |last= Dasgupta |first= Surendranath |title= A History of Indian Philosophy | volume =1 |year= 1975 |publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |location= Delhi, India |isbn= 81-208-0412-0 |page= 227[/tpl]
Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a male or a female) or yogini (traditionally denoting a female).American Heritage Dictionary: "Yogi, One who practices yoga." Websters: "Yogi, A follower of the yoga philosophy; an ascetic."

==Purpose==

The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha (liberation) though the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated. In Shaiva theology, yoga is used to unite kundalini with Shiva.Larson, p. 142. Mahabharata defines the purpose of yoga as the experience of uniting the individual Ātman with the universal Brahman that pervades all things.Jacobsen, p. 9.
In the specific sense of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, yoga is defined as citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ (the cessation of the perturbations of the mind). This is described by Patanjali as the necessary condition for transcending discursive knowledge and to be one with the divinely understood "spirit" ("purusha"): "Absolute freedom occurs when the lucidity of material nature and spirit are in pure equilibrium."Patanjali, Yoga Sutra III, 55, ed.: Miller, Barbara Stoler (transl., intr.), Yoga - Discipline of Freedom. The Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali, New York, 1998: Bantam Books, p. 73  In the Yoga Sutras, Patanjali indicates that the ultimate goal of yoga is a state of permanent peace or Kaivalya in order to experience one's true self.
Apart from the spiritual goals, the physical postures of yoga are used to alleviate health problems, reduce stress and make the spine supple in contemporary times. Yoga is also used as a complete exercise program and physical therapy routine.Dupler, Douglas; Frey, Rebecca. Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine, 3rd ed (2006). Retrieved 30 August 2012.

==History==

The origins of yoga are a matter of debate. It may have pre-Vedic origins.[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4-7[/tpl] Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization sites depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose.Possehl (2003), pp. 144–145 Ascetic practices, concentration and bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct Vedic ritual of fire sacrifice may have been precursors to yoga. Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE. Between 200 BCE–500 CE philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.Larson, p. 36. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.

===Origins===

The origins of yoga are a matter of debate.[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=87-90[/tpl] According to Crangle, Indian researchers have generally favoured a linear theory, which attempts "to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis",[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|See also Gavin Flood (1996), Hinduism, p.87-90, on "The orthogenetic theory" and "Non-Vedic origins of renunciation".[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=87-90[/tpl][/tpl] just like traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas to be the source of all spiritual knowledge.[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=5[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Post-classical traditions consider Hiranyagarbha as the originator of yoga.[tpl]cite book |last= Feuerstein |first= Georg |title= The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |year= 2001 |publisher=  Hohm Press|location= Arizona, USA |isbn= 978-1890772185 |page= Kindle Locations 7299–7300[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Aranya |first= Swami Hariharananda |authorlink= Swami Hariharananda Aranya |title= Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali with Bhasvati |year= 2000 |publisher= University of Calcutta |location= Calcutta, India |isbn= 81-87594-00-4|page=xxiv | chapter = Introduction[/tpl][/tpl] Other scholars acknowledge the possibility of non-Aryan components.[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=4[/tpl] Some argue that yoga originates in the Indus Valley Civilization.[tpl]sfn|Samuel|2008|p=2-3[/tpl] According to Zimmer, Yoga is part of the pre-Vedic heritage, which also includes Jainism, Samkhya and Buddhism.[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217, 314[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Zimmer: "Jainism does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India - being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems."[tpl]sfn|Zimmer|1951|p=217[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Zimmer's point of view is supported by other scholars, such as Niniam Smart, in Doctrine and argument in Indian Philosophy, 1964, p.27-32 & p.76,[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=7[/tpl] and S.K. Belvakar & R.D. Ranade in History of Indian philosophy, 1974 (1927), p.81 & p.303-409.[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=7[/tpl] See Crangle 1994 page 5-7.[tpl]sfn|Crangle|1994|p=5-7[/tpl][/tpl] Samuel argues that yoga derives from the Śramana tradition.[tpl]sfn|Samuel|2008|p=8[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Geofffrey Samuel: "Our best evidence to date suggests that practice developed in the same ascetic circles as the early sramana movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE."[tpl]sfn|Samuel|2008|p=8[/tpl][/tpl] Gavin Flood notes that such "dichotomization is too simplistic":[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=77[/tpl] 
[tpl]quote|This dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=77[/tpl][tpl]refn|group=note|Gavin Flood: "These renouncer traditions offered a new vision of the human condition which became incorporated, to some degree, into the worldview of the Brahman householder. The ideology of asceticism and renunciation seems, at first, discontinuous with the brahmanical ideology of the affirmation of social obligations and the performance of public and domestic rituals. Indeed, there has been some debate as to whether asceticism and its ideas of retributive action, reincarnation and spiritual liberation, might not have originated outside the orthodox vedic sphere, or even outside Aryan culture: that a divergent historical origin might account for the apparent contradiction within 'Hinduism' between the world affirmation of the householder and the world negation of the renouncer. However, this dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal. Indeed there are continuities between vedic Brahmanism and Buddhism, and it has been argued that the Buddha sought to return to the ideals of a vedic society which he saw as being eroded in his own day."[tpl]sfn|Fllod|1996|p=76-77[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl]

===Indus Valley Civilization===

Several seals discovered at Indus Valley Civilization sites, dating to the mid 3rd millennium BCE, depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose, showing "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga," according to archaeologist Gregory Possehl. Ramaprasad Chanda, who supervised Indus Valley Civilization excavations, states that, 
[tpl]quote|Not only the seated deities on some of the Indus seals are in yoga posture and bear witness to the prevalence of yoga in the Indus Valley Civilization in that remote age, the standing deities on the seals also show Kayotsarga (a standing posture of meditation) position. It is a posture not of sitting but of standing.[tpl]cite news | first=Ramaprasad | last=Chanda | title=Mohen-jo-Daro: Sindh 5000 Years Ago | work=Modern Review | date=August 1932[/tpl][/tpl]
Some type of connection between the Indus Valley seals and later yoga and meditation practices is speculated upon by many scholars, though there is no conclusive evidence.{{#tag:ref|See:
[tpl]quote|Prior to the end of the first millennium CE, detailed descriptions of āsanas were nowhere to be found in the Indian textual record. In the light of this, any claim that sculpted images of cross-legged figures—including those represented on the famous clay seals from third millennium BCE Indus Valley archeological sites—represent yogic postures are speculative at best.[tpl]sfn|White|2011|p=17[/tpl][/tpl]

====Textual references====

According to White, the first use of the word "yoga" is in the Rig Veda, where it denotes a yoke, but also a war chariot.[tpl]sfn|White|2011|p=3[/tpl] Yoga is discussed quite frequently in the Upanishads, many of which predate Patanjali's Sutras.P. 132 A Student's Guide to A2 Religious Studies for the OCR Specification By Michael Wilcockson The actual term "yoga" first occurs in the Katha Upanishad[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p=95[/tpl] and later in the Shvetasvatara Upanishad.P. 99 The Wisdom of the Vedas By Jagadish Chandra Chatterji White states: 
[tpl]quote|The earliest extant systematic account of yoga and a bridge from the earlier Vedic uses of the term is found in the Hindu Kathaka Upanisad(Ku), a scripture dating from about the third century BCE... It describes the hierarchy of mind-body constituents—the senses, mind, intellect, etc.—that comprise the foundational categories of Sāmkhya philosophy, whose metaphysical system grounds the yoga of the YS, Bhg, and other texts and schools (Ku3.10–11; 6.7–8).[tpl]sfn|White|2011|p=4[/tpl][/tpl]

====Ascetic practices====

Ascetic practices (tapas), concentration and bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (Vedic ritual of fire sacrifice), might have been precursors to yoga.{{refn|group=note|
The Vedic Samhitas contain references to ascetics, and ascetic practices known as (tapas) are referenced in the [tpl]IAST|Brāhmaṇas[/tpl] (900 BCE and 500 BCE), early commentaries on the Vedas.[tpl]sfn|Flood|1996|p = 94[/tpl] The Rig Veda, the earliest of the Hindu scripture mentions the practice.P. 51 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Yoga By Joan Budilovsky, Eve Adamson Robert Schneider and Jeremy Fields write,

===Preclassical era===

Diffused pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE such as the middle Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Mokshadharma of the Mahabharata. The terms samkhya and yoga in these texts refer to spiritual methodologies rather than the philosophical systems which developed centuries later.Larson, p. 34–35, 53.

====Upanishads====

Alexander Wynne, author of The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, observes that formless meditation and elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition.Wynne, pp. 44–45,58. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the oldest Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses.Whicher, p. 17.
The term "yoga" first appears in the Hindu scripture Katha Upanishad (a primary Upanishad c. 400 BCE) where it is defined as the steady control of the senses, which along with cessation of mental activity, leads to the supreme state.[tpl]#tag:ref|For the date of this Upanishad see also Helmuth von Glasenapp, from the 1950 Proceedings of the "Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur"[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/vonglasenapp/wheel002.html | title=Vedanta and Buddhism, A Comparative Study | accessdate=29 August 2012[/tpl]|group=note[/tpl] Katha Upanishad integrates the monism of early Upanishads with concepts of samkhya and yoga. It defines various levels of existence according to their proximity to the innermost being Ātman. Yoga is therefore seen as a process of interiorization or ascent of consciousness.Whicher, p. 18–19.Jacobsen, p. 8. It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga. Shvetashvatara Upanishad (c. 400-200 BCE) elaborates on the relationship between thought and breath, control of mind, and the benefits of yoga. Like the Katha Upanishad the transcendent Self is seen as the goal of yoga. This text also recommends meditation on Om as a path to liberation.Whicher, p. 20. Maitrayaniya Upanishad (c. 300 BCE) formalizes the sixfold form of yoga. Physiological theories of later yoga make an appearance in this text.Whicher, p. 21.[tpl]cite journal | title=Introducing Yoga's Great Literary Heritage | last=Feuerstein|first= Georg | journal=Yoga Journal |date=January–February 1988 | issue=78|authorlink=Georg Feuerstein|pages=70–5[/tpl]
While breath channels (nāḍis) of yogic practices had already been discussed in the classical Upanishads, it was not until the eighth-century Buddhist Hevajra Tantra and Caryāgiti, that hierarchies of chakras were introduced.White, David Gordon. Yoga in Practice. Princeton University Press 2012, page 14.[tpl]cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|page=224[/tpl] Further systematization of yoga is continued in the Yoga Upanishads of the Atharvaveda (viz., Śāṇḍilya, Pāśupata, Mahāvākya)[tpl]clarify|date=June 2013[/tpl].Werner, p. 24.

====Bhagavad Gita====

The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term "yoga" extensively in a variety of ways. In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,Jacobsen, p. 10. it introduces three prominent types of yoga:[tpl]#tag:ref|Flood writes, "...Bhagavad Gita, including a complete chapter (ch. 6) devoted to traditional yoga practice. The Gita also introduces the famous three kinds of yoga, 'knowledge' (jnana), 'action' (karma), and 'love' (bhakti)." Flood, p. 96.|group=note[/tpl]
In Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna about the essence of yoga as practiced in daily lives:
 [tpl]IAST|योगस्थ: कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनंजय ।  सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्यो: समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ।।   (yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmani sanyugam tyaktvā dhananjay  siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhutvā samatvam yoga ucyate)[/tpl] - Bhagavad Gita 2.48 
A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada translates it as "Be steadfast in yoga ([tpl]IAST|yoga-sthaḥ[/tpl]), O Arjuna. Perform your duty ([tpl]IAST|kuru karmani[/tpl]) and abandon all attachment ([tpl]IAST|sangam[/tpl]) to success or failure ([tpl]IAST|siddhy-asiddhyoḥ[/tpl]). Such evenness of mind ([tpl]IAST|samatvam[/tpl]) is called yoga.""Ch. 2.48" "Bhagavad-Gita As It Is" by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International.
Madhusudana Sarasvati (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita into three sections, with the first six chapters dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six with Bhakti yoga, and the last six with Jnana (knowledge).Gambhirananda, p. 16. Other commentators ascribe a different 'yoga' to each chapter, delineating eighteen different yogas.Jacobsen, p. 46. Aurobindo, a freedom fighter and philosopher, describes the yoga of the Gita as "a large, flexible and many-sided system with various elements, which are all successfully harmonized by a sort of natural and living assimilation".Fowler, p. xlv.

====Mahabharata====

Description of an early form of yoga called nirodha–yoga (yoga of cessation) is contained in the Mokshadharma section of the 12th chapter (Shanti Parva) of the Mahabharata epic. The verses of the section are dated to c. 300–200 BCE. Nirodha–yoga emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts, sensations etc. until purusha (Self) is realized. Terms like vichara (subtle reflection), viveka (discrimination) and others which are similar to Patanjali's terminology are mentioned, but not described.Whicher, p. 25–26. There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata. Separation of self from matter, perceiving Brahman everywhere, entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga. Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical. Mokshadharma also describes an early practice of elemental meditation.Wynne, p. 33.

===Classical yoga===

During the period between the Mauryan and the Gupta era (c. 200 BCE–500 CE) philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.

====Early Buddhist texts====

Werner notes that "only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the Pali Canon" do we have the oldest preserved comprehensive yoga practice: [tpl]quote|"But it is only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the Pali Canon that we can speak about a systematic and comprehensive or even integral school of Yoga practice, which is thus the first and oldest to have been preserved for us in its entirety"Werner p. 119-20[/tpl]
Another yoga system that predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is difficult to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools.
Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time.[tpl]cite journal|last=Douglass|first=Laura|title=Thinking Through The Body: The Conceptualization Of Yoga As Therapy For Individuals With Eating Disorders|journal=Academic Search Premier|year=2011|page=83|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&sid=1d8495be-1c1c-4423-ad48-1f6054f42876%40sessionmgr111&hid=103|accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: devraj to jyoti|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1809|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1809 [/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|On the dates of the Pali canon, Gregory Schopen writes, "We know, and have known for some time, that the Pali canon as we have it — and it is generally conceded to be our oldest source — cannot be taken back further than the last quarter of the first century BCE, the date of the Alu-vihara redaction, the earliest redaction we can have some knowledge of, and that — for a critical history — it can serve, at the very most, only as a source for the Buddhism of this period. But we also know that even this is problematic... In fact, it is not until the time of the commentaries of Buddhaghosa, Dhammapala, and others — that is to say, the fifth to sixth centuries CE — that we can know anything definite about the actual contents of Pali canon."Wynne, pp. 3–4.|group=note[/tpl]
The early Buddhist texts describe meditative practices and states, some of which the Buddha borrowed from the ascetic (shramana) tradition.Richard Gombrich, "Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo." Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, p. 44.Barbara Stoler Miller, "Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords." University of California Press, 1996, p. 8. One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition.Wynne, p. 92. Meditative states alone are not an end, for according to the Buddha, even the highest meditative state is not liberating. Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought, some sort of mental activity must take place: a liberating cognition, based on the practice of mindful awareness.Wynne, p. 105. The Buddha also departed from earlier yogic thought in discarding the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.Wynne, p. 95. While the Upanishads thought liberation to be a realization at death of a nondual meditative state where the ontological duality between subject and object was abolished, Buddha's theory of liberation depended upon this duality because liberation to him was an insight into the subject's experience.
The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage.Mallinson, James. 2007. The Khecarīvidyā of Adinathā. London: Routledge. pg.17-19. However there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 6 March 2012.  10 June 2012 pgs. 20-21 "The Buddha himself is said to have tried both pressing his tongue to the back of his mouth, in a manner similar to that of the hathayogic khecarīmudrā, and ukkutikappadhāna, a squatting posture which may be related to hathayogic techniques such as mahāmudrā, mahābandha, mahāvedha, mūlabandha, and vajrāsana in which pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, in order to force upwards the breath or Kundalinī."

====Samkhya====

Samkhya emerged in the first century CE.Larson, p. 38. When Patanjali systematized the conceptions of yoga, he set them forth on the background of the metaphysics of samkhya, which he assumed with slight variations. In the early works, the yoga principles appear together with the samkhya ideas. Vyasa's commentary on the Yoga Sutras, also called the Samkhyapravacanabhasya (Commentary on the Exposition of the Sankhya Philosophy), brings out the intimate relation between the two systems.Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 342. Yoga agrees with the essential metaphysics of samkhya, but differs from it in that while samkhya holds that knowledge is the means of liberation, yoga is a system of active striving, mental discipline, and dutiful action. Yoga also introduces the conception of god. Sometimes Patanjali's system is referred to as Seshvara Samkhya in contradistinction to Kapila's Nirivara Samkhya.Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 344.

====Yoga Sutras of Patanjali====

In Hindu philosophy, yoga is the name of one of the six orthodox (which accept the testimony of Vedas) philosophical schools.For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents," and pp. 453–487.For a brief overview of the yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43. The yoga school was founded by Patanjali. Karel Werner, author of Yoga And Indian Philosophy, believes that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.[tpl]#tag:ref|Werner writes, "The word Yoga appears here for the first time in its fully technical meaning, namely as a systematic training, and it already received a more or less clear formulation in some other middle Upanishads....Further process of the systematization of Yoga as a path to the ultimate mystic goal is obvious in subsequent Yoga Upanishads and the culmination of this endeavour is represented by Patanjali's codification of this path into a system of the eightfold Yoga."|group=note[/tpl] Scholars also note the influence of Buddhist and Samkhyan ideas on the Yoga Sutras.Karel Werner, The Yogi and the Mystic. Routledge 1994, page 27. "Patanjali's system is unthinkable without Buddhism. As far as its terminology goes there is much in the Yoga Sutras that reminds us of Buddhist formulations from the Pāli Canon and even more so from the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma and from Sautrāntika."Larson, pp. 44–45. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras reminds us of Buddhist formulations from the Pāli Canon, Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma and Sautrāntika.Karel Werner, The Yogi and the Mystic. Routledge 1994, page 27. "Patanjali's system is unthinkable without Buddhism. As far as its terminology goes there is much in the Yoga Sutras that reminds us of Buddhist formulations from the Pāli Canon and even more so from the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma and from Sautrāntika." The yoga school accepts the samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the samkhya, as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the samkhya's twenty-five elements of reality.For yoga acceptance of samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.For yoga as accepting the 25 principles of samkhya with the addition of God, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43. The parallels between yoga and samkhya were so close that Max Müller says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...."Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy," p. 104. The intimate relationship between samkhya and yoga is explained by Heinrich Zimmer:
[tpl]quote|These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. [tpl]IAST|Sāṅkhya[/tpl] provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage ("bandha"), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release ("[tpl]IAST|mokṣa[/tpl]"), while yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or "isolation-integration" ("kaivalya").|Zimmer (1951), p. 280.[/tpl]
Patanjali is widely regarded as the compiler of the formal yoga philosophy.For Patanjali as the founder of the philosophical system called yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42. The verses of Yoga Sutras are terse and are therefore read together with the Vyasa Bhashya (c. 350–450 CE), a commentary on the Yoga Sutras.Larson, p. 21–22. Patanjali's yoga is known as Raja yoga, which is a system for control of the mind.For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96–98. Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, which is the definitional sutra for his entire work:
 [tpl]IAST|योग: चित्त-वृत्ति निरोध:   (yogaś citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ)[/tpl] - Yoga Sutras 1.2 
This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. I. K. Taimni translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition ([tpl]IAST|nirodhaḥ[/tpl]) of the modifications ([tpl]IAST|vṛtti[/tpl]) of the mind ([tpl]IAST|citta[/tpl])".For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind." See: Taimni, p. 6. The use of the word [tpl]IAST|nirodhaḥ[/tpl] in the opening definition of yoga is an example of the important role that Buddhist technical terminology and concepts play in the Yoga Sutras; this role suggests that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and wove them into his system.Barbara Stoler Miller, "Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords." University of California Press, 1996, page 9. Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis)."Vivekanada, p. 115.
Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept derived from the 29th Sutra of the 2nd book, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today. The Eight Limbs are:
In the view of this school, the highest attainment does not reveal the experienced diversity of the world to be illusion. The everyday world is real. Furthermore, the highest attainment is the event of one of many individual selves discovering itself; there is no single universal self shared by all persons.[tpl]cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=12–13[/tpl]

====Yoga Yajnavalkya====

The Yoga Yajnavalkya is a classical treatise on yoga attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya.

====Jainism====

According to Tattvarthasutra, 2nd century CE Jain text, yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body. Umasvati calls yoga the cause of "asrava" or karmic influxTattvarthasutra 6.2 as well as one of the essentials—samyak caritra—in the path to liberation. In his Niyamasara, Acarya Kundakunda, describes yoga bhakti—devotion to the path to liberation—as the highest form of devotion.Niyamasara 134-40 Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain Indologists like Prof. Robert J. Zydenbos to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.Zydenbos, Robert. "Jainism Today and Its Future." München: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66 The five yamas or the constraints of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali bear a resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism, indicating a history of strong cross-fertilization between these traditions.Zydenbos (2006) p.66[tpl]#tag:ref|Worthington writes, "Yoga fully acknowledges its debt to Jainism, and Jainism reciprocates by making the practice of yoga part and parcel of life."Worthington, p. 35.|group=note[/tpl]
Mainstream Hinduism's influence on Jain yoga is noticed as Haribhadra founded his eightfold yoga and aligned it with Patanjali's eightfold yoga.P. 313 The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of the Classical Yoga By Ian Whicher

====Yogacara school====

In the late phase of Indian antiquity, on the eve of the development of Classical Hinduism, the
Yogacara movement arises during the Gupta period (4th to 5th centuries).
Yogacara received the name as it provided a "yoga," a framework for engaging in the practices that lead to the path of the bodhisattva.Dan Lusthaus. Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun. Published 2002 (Routledge). ISBN 0-7007-1186-4. pg 533 The yogacara sect teaches "yoga" as a way to reach enlightenment.Simple Tibetan Buddhism: A Guide to Tantric Living By C. Alexander Simpkins, Annellen M. Simpkins. Published 2001. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0-8048-3199-8

===Middle Ages===

Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Hatha yoga emerged as a dominant practice of yoga in this period.Larson, pp. 136–139.

====Bhakti movement====

The Bhakti movement was a development in medieval Hinduism which advocated the concept of a personal God (or "Supreme Personality of Godhead"). The movement was initiated by the Alvars of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries, and it started gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries.[tpl]cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|page=1|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=veSItWingx8C&pg=PA1[/tpl] Shaiva and Vaishnava bhakti traditions integrated aspects of Yoga Sutras, such as the practical meditative exercises, with devotion.Larson, p. 137. Bhagavata Purana elucidates the practice of a form of yoga called viraha (separation) bhakti. Viraha bhakti emphasizes one pointed concentration on Krishna.Jacobsen, p. 22.

====Tantra====

By the turn of the first millennium, hatha yoga emerged from tantra.
Tantrism is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of its practitioners to the ordinary social, religious, and logical reality in which they live. Through Tantric practice, an individual perceives reality as maya, illusion, and the individual achieves liberation from it.Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press, 1991. pp 313 Both Tantra and yoga offer paths that relieve a person from depending on the world. Where yoga relies on progressive restriction of inputs from outside; Tantra relies on transmutation of all external inputs so that one is no longer dependent on them, but can take them or leave them at will. They both make a person independent.Your ayurvedic constitution: Prakruti by Robert Svoboda Motilal Banarsidass Publication,2005; ISBN 978-81-208-1840-8 Google Books This particular path to salvation among the several offered by Hinduism, links Tantrism to those practices of Indian religions, such as yoga, meditation, and social renunciation, which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes.
During tantric practices and studies, the student is instructed further in meditation technique, particularly chakra meditation. This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere, but is more elaborate than the initiate's previous meditation. It is considered to be a kind of Kundalini yoga for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the chakra located in the "heart", for meditation and worship.Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press, 1991. pp 317

====Vajrayana====

While breath channels (nāḍis) of yogic practices had already been discussed in the classical Upanishads, it was not until the eighth-century Buddhist Hevajra Tantra and Caryāgiti, that hierarchies of chakras were introduced.

====Hatha Yoga====

The earliest references to hatha yoga are in Buddhist works dating from the eighth century.[ref]James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 28 June 2012.  19 September 2013 pgs. 2 "The earliest references to hathayoga are scattered mentions in Buddhist canonical
works and their exegesis dating from the eighth century onwards, in
which it is the soteriological method of last resort."[/ref] The earliest definition of hatha yoga is found in the 11th century Buddhist text Vimalaprabha, which defines it in relation to the center channel, bindu etc.[ref]James Mallinson, "Sāktism and Hathayoga," 28 June 2012.  19 September 2013 pgs. 2 "In its earliest definition,
in Pundarīka’s eleventh-century Vimalaprabhā commentary on the Kālacakratantra, hathayoga is said to bring about the "unchanging moment" (aksaraksana) "through the practice of nāda by forcefully making the breath enter the central channel and through restraining the bindu of the bodhicitta in the vajra of the lotus of wisdom". While the means employed are not specified, the ends, in particular restraining bindu, semen, and making the breath enter the central channel, are similar to those mentioned in the earliest
descriptions of the practices of hathayoga, to which I now turn."[/ref] The basic tenets of Hatha yoga were formulated by Shaiva ascetics Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath c. 900 CE. Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras with posture and breathing exercises.Larson, p. 140. Hatha yoga, sometimes referred to as the "psychophysical yoga",Raub, James A.. Psychophysiologic Effects of Hatha Yoga on Musculoskeletal and Cardiopulmonary Function: A Literature Review. was further elaborated by Yogi Swatmarama, compiler of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika in 15th century CE. This yoga differs substantially from the Raja yoga of Patanjali in that it focuses on shatkarma, the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind (ha), and prana, or vital energy (tha).Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice – Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)"Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers" – Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein Compared to the seated asana, or sitting meditation posture, of Patanjali's Raja yoga,"Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind" – Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio it marks the development of asanas (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage[tpl]cite book|last=Burley|first=Mikel|title=Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120817067|page=16|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ezxQHzjwUosC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mikel+burley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2ZUVUp2WMuHWiwKipYEg&ved=0CDMQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=mikel%20burley&f=false[/tpl] and, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word yoga today.Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). "The Shambhala Guide to Yoga." Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.
It is similar to a diving board – preparing the body for purification, so that it may be ready to receive higher techniques of meditation. The word "Hatha" comes from "Ha" which means Sun, and "Tha" which means Moon.Hatha Yoga "Hatha Yoga - Art of Living"

====Sikhism====

Various yogic groups had become prominent in Punjab in the 15th and 16th century, when Sikhism was in its nascent stage. Compositions of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, describe many dialogues he had with Jogis, a Hindu community which practiced yoga.Dhillon, p. 249. Guru Nanak rejected the austerities, rites and rituals connected with Hatha Yoga.Dhillon, p. 255. He propounded the path of Sahaja yoga or Nama yoga (meditation on the name) instead.[tpl]cite book |last=Mansukhani|first=Gobind Singh|title=Introduction To Sikhism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5_SirMuPr54C&pg=PA66|year=2009|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-181-9|page=66 [/tpl] The Guru Granth Sahib states:

===Modern history===

====Reception in the West====

Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid-19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. In the context of this budding interest, N. C. Paul published his Treatise on Yoga Philosophy in 1851.
The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s.[ref]Shaw, Eric. 35 mOMents, Yoga Journal, 2010-09.
[/ref] The reception which Swami Vivekananda received built on the active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England Transcendentalists, among them R. W. Emerson (1803-1882), who drew on German Romanticism and the interest of philosophers and scholars like G. F. W. Hegel (1770-1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767-1845) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829), Max Mueller (1823-1900), A. Schopenhauer (1788-1860) and others who had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.Goldberg, Philip, American Veda. From Emerson and the Beatles to Yoga and Meditation. How Indian Spirituality Changed the West, New York, 2010: Harmony Books, pp.21ff., Von Glasenapp, Hellmuth, Die Philosophie der Inder, Stuttgart, 1974: A. Kroener Verlag, p. 166f.
Theosophists also had a large influence on the American public's view of Yoga.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/2007-03-01/Mind-Body/Fear-of-Yoga.aspx?page=2#axzz2bnQLbp2o |title=Fear of Yoga |publisher=Utne.com |accessdate=28 August 2013[/tpl]
[/ref] Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the spiritual and the physical.[ref]De Michelis, Elizabeth, A History Of Modern Yoga. Patanjali and Modern Esotericism. London, 2004: Continuum Books, pp. 19ff.
[/ref] The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the (mostly Neoplatonism-based) currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. M. Eliade, himself rooted in the Romanian currents of these traditions,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] brought a new element into the reception of Yoga with the strong emphasis on Tantric Yoga in his seminal book: Yoga: Immortality and Freedom.[tpl]#tag:ref|Eliade, Mircea, Yoga - Immortality and Freedom, Princeton, 1958: Princeton Univ.Pr. (original title: Le Yoga. Immortalité et Liberté, Paris, 1954: Libr. Payot)|group=note[/tpl] With the introduction of the Tantra traditions and philosophy of Yoga, the conception of the "transcendent" to be attained by Yogic practice shifted from experiencing the "transcendent" ("Atman-Brahman" in Advaitic theory) in the mind to the body itself.Flood, Gavin D., Body and Cosmology in Kashmir Saivism, San Francisco, 1993: Mellen Research University Press, pp.229ff.
The modern scientific study of yoga began with the works of N. C. Paul and Major D. Basu in the late 19th century, and then continued in the 20th century with Sri Yogendra (1897-1989) and Swami Kuvalayananda.Singleton, Mark (12 January 2010).

Title: A History of Modern Yoga. Author: Elizabeth De Michelis. Published: Continuum, 2005
[/ref] During the 1910s and 1920s in the USA, yoga suffered a period of bad publicity due largely to the backlash against immigration, a rise in puritanical values, and a number of scandals. In the 1930s and 1940s yoga began to gain more public acceptance as a result of celebrity endorsement.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] In the 1950s the United States saw another period of paranoia against yoga, but by the 1960s, western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak, giving rise to a great number of Neo-Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public. During this period, most of the influential Indian teachers of yoga came from two lineages, those of Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963) and of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888–1989).Bryant 2009, p. xviii.
Teachers of Hatha yoga who were active in the west in this period included B.K.S. Iyengar (1918- ), K. Pattabhi Jois (1915-2009), Swami Vishnu-devananda (1927-1993), and Swami Satchidananda (1914-2002).[ref]

A second "yoga boom" followed in the 1980s, as Dean Ornish, a follower of Swami Satchidananda, connected yoga to heart health, legitimizing yoga as a purely physical system of health exercises outside of counter-culture or esotericism circles, and unconnected to any religious denomination. Numerous asanas seemed modern in origin, and strongly overlapped with 19th and early-20th century Western exercise traditions.Singleton, Mark. (2010).

The American College of Sports Medicine supports the integration of yoga into the exercise regimens of healthy individuals as long as properly-trained professionals deliver instruction. The College cites yoga's promotion of "profound mental, physical and spiritual awareness" and its benefits as a form of stretching, and as an enhancer of breath control and of core strength.[ref]

=====Potential benefits for adults=====

While much of the medical community views the results of yoga research to be significant, others argue that there were many flaws that undermine results. Much of the research on yoga has been in the form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality, including small sample sizes, inadequate blinding, lack of randomization, and high risk of bias.[tpl]cite journal | last = Krisanaprakornkit|first= T.|last2= Ngamjarus|first2= C.|last3= Witoonchart|first3= C.|last4= Piyavhatkul|first4= N.| title = Meditation therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) | volume = | issue = 6 | pages = CD006507 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20556767 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006507.pub2 | url = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Ospina|first=M.

There has been an emergence of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and increase anxiety control.DeStasio, Susan A. Integrating Yoga Into Cancer Care. Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing. February 2008, Volume 12 Issue 1. p125-130 Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs include yoga as a mind-body technique to reduce stress. A study found that after seven weeks the group treated with yoga reported significantly less mood disturbance and reduced stress compared to the control group. Another study found that MBSR had showed positive effects on sleep anxiety, quality of life, and spiritual growth in cancer patients.Smith K, Pukall C.

Among the main reasons that experts cite for causing negative effects from yoga are beginners' competitiveness and instructors' lack of qualification. As the demand for yoga classes grows, many people get certified to become yoga instructors, often with relatively little training. Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries. In turn, a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them.
Vertebral artery dissection, a tear in the arteries in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from rotation of the neck while the neck is extended. This can occur in a variety of contexts, for example, in a beauty shop while your hair is being rinsed, but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices. This is a very serious condition which can result in a stroke.[tpl]cite journal|last=Biffl|first=Walter L.|first2=Ernest E. |last2=Moore|first3= J.

=====Pediatrics=====

It is claimed that yoga can be an excellent training for children and adolescents, both as a form of physical exercise and for breathing, focus, mindfulness, and stress relief: Many school districts have considered incorporating yoga into their P.E. programs. The Encinitas, California school district gained a San Diego Superior Court Judge's approval to use yoga in P.E., holding against the parents who claimed the practice was intrinsically religious and hence should not be part of a state funded program.http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/07/02/california-judge-says-yoga-is-secular-approves-its-use-in-schools/

==Yoga compared with other systems of meditation==

===Zen Buddhism===

Zen, the name of which derives from the Sanskrit "dhyaana" via the Chinese "ch'an"[tpl]#tag:ref|"The Meditation school, called 'Ch'an' in Chinese from the Sanskrit 'dhyāna,' is best known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation 'Zen'"The Buddhist Tradition in India, China, and Japan. Edited by William Theodore de Bary. pp. 207–208. ISBN 0-394-71696-5|group=note[/tpl] is a form of Mahayana Buddhism. The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with yoga.Dumoulin, Heinrich & Knitter, p. 22. In the west, Zen is often set alongside yoga; the two schools of meditation display obvious family resemblances.Dumoulin, Heinrich & Knitter, p. xviii. This phenomenon merits special attention since yogic practices have some of their roots in the Zen Buddhist school.[tpl]#tag:ref|Exact quote: "This phenomenon merits special attention since yogic roots are to be found in the Zen Buddhist school of meditation."Dumoulin, Heinrich & Knitter, p. 13.|group=note[/tpl] Certain essential elements of yoga are important both for Buddhism in general and for Zen in particular.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

In the Nyingma tradition, the path of meditation practice is divided into nine yanas, or vehicles, which are said to be increasingly profound.[ref]The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra
by Chogyam Trungpa. Shambhala, 2001 ISBN 1-57062-895-5[/ref] The last six are described as "yoga yanas": "Kriya yoga," "Upa yoga," "Yoga yana," "Mahā yoga," "Anu yoga" and the ultimate practice, "Ati yoga.""Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet" by Ray, Reginald A. Shambhala: 2002. pp. 37–38 ISBN 1-57062-917-X The Sarma traditions also include Kriya, Upa (called "Charya"), and Yoga, with the Anuttara yoga class substituting for Mahayoga and Atiyoga."Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet" by Ray, Reginald A. Shambhala: 2002. p. 57 ISBN 1-57062-917-X
Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm. The Nyingma tradition also practices Yantra yoga (Tib. "Trul khor"), a discipline that includes breath work (or pranayama), meditative contemplation and precise dynamic movements to centre the practitioner."Yantra Yoga: The Tibetan Yoga of Movement" by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Snow Lion, 2008. ISBN 1-55939-308-4 The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of Lukhang. A semi-popular account of Tibetan yoga by Chang (1993) refers to caṇḍalī (Tib. "tummo"), the generation of heat in one's own body, as being "the very foundation of the whole of Tibetan yoga."Chang, G.C.C. (1993). "Tibetan Yoga." New Jersey: Carol Publishing Group. p. 7 ISBN 0-8065-1453-1 Chang also claims that Tibetan yoga involves reconciliation of apparent polarities, such as prana and mind, relating this to theoretical implications of tantrism.

===Christian meditation===

Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&sec=&spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=7 January 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 December 2008[/tpl] The Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm | title=Vatican sounds New Age alert | publisher=BBC | date=4 February 2003 | accessdate=27 August 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | first=Wayne | last=Teasdale | title=Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | year=2004 | page=74 | isbn=0-7425-3178-3[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.albertmohler.com/2010/09/20/the-subtle-body-should-christians-practice-yoga/ | first=R. Albert Jr. | last=Mohler | title=The Subtle Body – Should Christians Practice Yoga? | accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]
In 1989 and 2003, the Vatican issued two documents: Aspects of Christian meditation and "A Christian reflection on the New Age," that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices. The 2003 document was published as a 90 page handbook detailing the Vatican's position.Handbook of vocational psychology by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas 2005 ISBN 0-8058-4517-8 page 358 The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations." Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge. The letter also says, "one can see if and how prayer might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm |title=1989 Letter from Vatican to Bishops on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation |publisher=Ewtn.com |accessdate=28 November 2012[/tpl] but maintains the idea that "there must be some fit between the nature of approaches to prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality." Some fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity.Dr Ankerberg, John & Dr Weldon, John, Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs, Harvest House Publishers, 1996
Another view holds that Christian meditation can lead to religious pluralism. This is held by an interdenominational association of Christians that practice it. "The ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains, enhances, and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed."

===Islam===

The development of Sufism was considerably influenced by Indian yogic practises, where they adapted both physical postures (asanas) and breath control (pranayama).[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S1356186304004675[/tpl] The ancient Indian yogic text Amritakunda ("Pool of Nectar)" was translated into Arabic and Persian as early as the 11th century.
Several other yogic texts were appropriated by Sufi tradition, but typically the texts juxtapose yoga materials alongside Sufi practices without any real attempt at integration or synthesis. Yoga became known to Indian Sufis gradually over time, but engagement with yoga is not found at the historical beginnings of the tradition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/pdf/jras2.pdf |title=Situating Sufism and Yoga |format=PDF |accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Yoga is a growing industry in Islamic countries (Two Bikram Yoga studios in Iran). Also, yoga is used in developing countries like Palestine to help the population manage stress.

Malaysia's top Islamic body in 2008 passed a fatwa, which is legally non-binding, against Muslims practicing yoga, saying it had elements of "Hindu spiritual teachings" and that its practice was blasphemy and is therefore haraam.
