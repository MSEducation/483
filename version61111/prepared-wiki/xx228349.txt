The houses are of a type that, while common elsewhere in Maryland, were not extensively built in Cumberland., in which individual and semi-detached houses were more common. The houses exhibit plain but consistent detailing of a neoclassical nature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=315&COUNTY=Allegany&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Allegany|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-10-06|work= National Register of Historic Places: Properties in Allegany County|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust| accessdate= 19 November 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091120232310/http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=315&COUNTY=Allegany&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Allegany| archivedate= 20 November 2009| deadurl= no[/tpl]
