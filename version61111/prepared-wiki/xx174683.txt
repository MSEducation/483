[[HMS Sapphire (1651)]]

CATEGORIES: Ships of the line of the Royal Navy, 1650s ships

Sapphire was a 38-gun fourth-rate frigate of the English Royal Navy, originally built for the navy of the Commonwealth of England by Peter Pett I at Ratcliffe, and launched in 1651.
Unlike many of her half-sisters, Sapphire seems to have never had additional guns added to her after completion; indeed by 1666 she carried just 36 in wartime (and 30 in peacetime), with 12 culverins and 10 demi-culverins on the lower deck, and 14 sakers on the upper deck. Sapphire was wrecked on 31 March 1670 when she was deliberately run aground at Sicily to escape from what her captain, John Pearce, thought were four Algerian corsairs. They weren't, and Pearce and his lieutenant, Andrew Logan, were shot for cowardice at Deptford on 26 August 1670.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
