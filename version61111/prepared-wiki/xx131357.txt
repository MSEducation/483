The Libbey Cowboys were founding members of the Toledo City League from 1926 until the school closed.  Their colors were royal blue and gold. The Cowboys were most famous for their boys basketball teams and had a strong basketball rivalry with Scott High School in Toledo.  Prior to the Shoe Bowl championship for the City League football title, Libbey had an annual Thanksgiving Day football game with Woodward High School from 1923-1932,[tpl]cite web | last = Buckley| first = Frank| title = Turkey Day Grid Clashes Bring Out Old Rivalries| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = November 19, 1930 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YO9XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AUUNAAAAIBAJ&dq=woodward%20high%20history%20toledo&pg=6049%2C5059713| accessdate = February 7, 2011[/tpl] and with DeVilbiss High School[tpl]cite web | last = Hackenberg| first = Dave| title = Scott-Waite game kicked off great tradition of high school feasts| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = November 27, 2003 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/article/20031127/COLUMNIST08/111270131| accessdate = February 7, 2011[/tpl] from 1933-1963.

==Fate of Libbey==

Libbey High School had been rumored to be potentially closing since the 1980s, but was recommended to stay open by the school district each time the issue was brought up. In 1991, TPS decided to close two high schools that were to be chosen from a list of Libbey, DeVilbiss and Macomber-Whitney high schools.[tpl]cite web | last = Krauth| first = Laurie| title = Macomber, DeVilbiss, Libbey on list for possible closings| publisher = Toledo Blade | date = December 27, 1990| url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eScxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6204,8420335&dq=macomber+devilbiss&hl=en| accessdate = May 31, 2010[/tpl]  Libbey was spared while DeVilbiss and Macomber-Whitney were shuttered.    
In April 2009, Libbey High Schoolâ€™s Student Council President had strong words for administrators and school board members with regard to saving their school.  The proposal to eventually send some Libbey neighborhood students to Scott, Bowsher, and Waite high schools is "segregation of different populations and is racist", they claimed.  Libbey always had been the "unwanted stepchild" of Toledo Public Schools and 'their positive news is always overshadowed by the negative", students added.  Libbey was left open for the 2009-10 school year, but the issue of closing the school was brought up again in March 2010.  After a failed levy early in May, Toledo Public Schools ultimately voted 3-2 in favor of closing school at the end of the 2009-10 school year.  The final class of 2010 graduated on June 3 in the fieldhouse.  All remaining Libbey students were divided geographically, between Scott, Bowsher, Waite and especially Rossford and Central Catholic High Schools.
On July 15, 2011 Libbey High School was vetted by the Ohio Historic Site Preservation Board for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places,.Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board
On August 15, 2011 two large dumpsters were placed (one at the south entrance and one at the east entrance) of the Career Center.  These were to be used in the asbestos abatement of Libbey High School.  On August 24, 2011 large poles were driven into the ground and concrete surrounding the buildings and parking lots.  On August 25, 2011 chain-link fence was strung from these posts to keep the public away from the areas were asbestos would be removed.
