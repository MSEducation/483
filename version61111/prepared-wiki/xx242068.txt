CATEGORIES: Fortran compilers, Programming tools for Windows

Silverfrost FTN95: Fortran for Windows is a Fortran compiler for Microsoft Windows. It generates code for native IA-32 Win32 executables and for Microsoft's .NET platform. FTN95 comes in three licensed editions: Commercial, Academic and Personal. The Personal edition is free and is designed for personal use. Programs written with the Personal edition show a banner for a short time when they are run.

==CHECKMATE==

FTN95, like it predecessor FTN77, has strong run-time checking options, collectively called CHECKMATE. Compiler switches can turn on various levels of run-time checking. These include array bound checks, constant modification, DO LOOP modification, argument checking and undefined variable use. Program run-times are increased when checking is used.

==ClearWin+==

ClearWin+ is a library built into the FTN95 run-time system. It offers an easy to use interface to the Windows API and is not available when producing .NET code. It makes use of a set of format codes and call-backs. The format codes resemble C style printf codes. ClearWin+ is used to power the UI for Simfit. From FTN95 version 7.00 a 64-bit version of ClearWin+ is included. This can be used with existing, free, 64-bit compilers.
A simple ClearWin+ program:

==Visual Studio==

FTN95 was the first Fortran compiler capable of producing code for Microsoft .NET. In addition plug-ins are available that allows FTN95 programs to be written, compiled and debugged inside Visual Studio. The plug-ins fully support Win32 and .NET code generation. The current release has plug-ins for Visual Studio 2005,  2008, 2010 and 2012.
FTN95 is also available in an Express form which includes the Visual Studio 2008 Shell. Installing FTN95 Express effectively installs a customised version of Visual Studio allowing users to edit, compile and debug in an environment similar to full Visual Studio owners.

==Plato==

Plato is the Integrated Development Environment supplied with FTN95. It can edit, compile and debug programs in a manner similar to the Visual Studio plug-ins. Although Plato specialises in Fortran it is not limited to it and can be tuned to work with any compiler. It is designed to stand-alone from FTN95.

==Salford Fortran==

FTN95 was developed by Salford Software Limited, a company owned by University of Salford, and is the successor to their Fortran 77 compiler FTN77. In August 2004 Salford Software relinquished control of FTN95 to Silverfrost Limited. Silverfrost FTN95 is often referred to as Salford FTN95 because of its University of Salford pedigree.
