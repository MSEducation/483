==Plot==

Takeru Ohyama has enrolled at Tenbi Academy, a high school that converted from all-girls to co-ed. Hoping to have a life full of ogling pretty girls, he reunites with childhood friend Haruko Amaya, who shows him around school. However, he learns that the school is for students who possess magical and spiritual energies called Elements and who wield crafted weapons known as Makens. The students engage in school sanctioned combat matches that showcase their powers. While his own ability and Maken is not apparent at first, Takeru soon finds himself surrounded by girls, including Inaho Kushiya, an attractive girl who says she's his fiancée, and Kodama Himegami, a popular blonde who says she wants to kill him. He joins the [tpl]Nihongo|Security Committee |魔導検警機構|madō kenkei kikō|lit. "anti-evil organization"[/tpl], also known as Maken-ki, which supports the student council's operations.

===Characters===

====Takeru Ohyama====

[tpl]nihongo|Takeru Ohyama|大山 タケル|Ōhyama Takeru[/tpl] is the protagonist of Maken-ki! At the beginning of the series, he is a first-year boy who enrolls at Tenbi Academy after having attended an all-boys middle school. He is childhood friends with Haruko Amaya, who trained with him at the dojo, and Inaho Kushiya, who says that she is his fiancee. He ends up sharing his room with the two girls, as well as Kodama Himegami.[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl]
Years before the series' present, Takeru's family dojo is challenged by Tesshin Kushiya when Takeru is ten years old. After witnessing the death of Atsuma at the hands of Tesshin, Takeru has resented his father and uncle for not being around to protect them.[tpl]gnr|ch|7[/tpl] As a result, he tends to take the girl's side whenever a girl fights a guy. His abilities originally manifest in extreme situations as in the case where he protects Azuki.[tpl]gnr|ch|3[/tpl] When he defends Kodama, he uses Blood Pointer,[tpl]gnr|ch|5[/tpl] which is later described as absorbing Element from the people around him through his mouth.[tpl]gnr|ch|23[/tpl] Following the battle with the Venus unit, he undergoes extra training with Minori in order to try to control and to increase his powers.[tpl]gnr|ch|28|-|29[/tpl] Takeru later learns that he is blood related to Kodama's brother and father.[tpl]gnr|ch|53[/tpl]
Takeru was one of the three students that Gen's Element Detector, Keronbo, could not initially identify, but a month later, he gets his Maken, Overblow, which causes his target's Maken to overflow with Element and be rendered useless "like a car engine that blows out". However, it can have the opposite effect, and empower the opponent with an evolved Maken if the opponent can perfectly control or contain the surge.[tpl]gnr|ch|19[/tpl]
Takeru is voiced by Tomoaki Maeno,[tpl]cite web | url = http://j-entonline.com/blu-ray-dvd-reviews/blu-ray-reviews/anime-blu-ray-reviews/maken-ki-complete-series-a-j-ent-anime-blu-ray-disc-review/ | title = Maken-ki! – Complete Series (a J!-ENT Anime Blu-ray Disc Review) } date = October 29, 2013 | work = J!-ENT | last = Amith | first = Dennis [/tpl] and English dubbed by Ian Sinclair.

====Haruko Amaya====

[tpl]nihongo|Haruko Amaya|天谷 春恋|Amaya Haruko[/tpl] is a second-year student who is the student body vice-president, and the head of one of the dorms.[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl] She is a childhood friend of Takeru Ohyama, whom she trained with at the dojo, and with whom she harbors romantic feelings but is not willing to admit it.[tpl]gnr|ch|1|,|12[/tpl] After learning that Kodama and Inaho are moving into Takeru's room, she becomes their roommate. She is very jealous of the other girls, and almost automatically beats up Takeru whenever he does anything perverted such as groping one of her breasts or inappropriately touching or leering at other women.[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl] Kodama considers Haruko well-endowed[tpl]gnr|ch|4[/tpl] and the strongest maiden at Tenbi Academy.[tpl]gnr|ch|5[/tpl] Haruko's Maken, [tpl]Nihongo3|||Murakumo|lit. Gathering Clouds[/tpl], is a sword that is suspected to be one of the original Eight legendary Maken.[tpl]gnr|ch|6[/tpl] Murakumo cannot be unsheathed unless Haruko has strong feelings and fights an opponent with comparable power. Haruko unleashes a little of Murakumo's power when she fights a student named Amio.[tpl]gnr|ch|6[/tpl] In her battle with Demitra, she unsheathes it to reveal a blade surrounded with light; it can make incredibly large slices that destroy barriers, but is controllable where Haruko can spare the life of someone in the sword's path.[tpl]gnr|ch|20[/tpl]
Haruko is voiced by Noriko Shitaya, and English dubbed by Monica Rial.

====Kodama Himegami====

[tpl]nihongo|Kodama Himegami|姫神 コダマ|Himegami Kodama[/tpl] is a petite blonde-haired second-year student who is part of the kenkeibi (later Maken-ki) club which officiates the duels at school.[tpl]gnr|ch|1|-|4[/tpl] Her ability is to command shikigami: doll-sized spirits who follow her around and call her "ojou-sama", and who possess powers such as picking up people, and shooting fire or lightning.[tpl]gnr|ch|1|,|2|,|5[/tpl] She regularly steps on the boys for their annoying and lecherous antics.[tpl]gnr|ch|2|,|5[/tpl] She initially takes an interest in Takeru as a potential enemy, but rooms with him after noticing that he bears a special mark on his chest.[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl] She notices that Takeru's scent is similar to her brother's. Takeru stole her first kiss when she fell from a tree,[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl] but she later thanks him with a kiss for rescuing her from a suspicious member of the Kamigari.[tpl]gnr|ch|5[/tpl] When asked about whom she likes, Kodama responds that she loved someone long ago but it was an impossible love, possibly implying her brother.[tpl]gnr|ch|12[/tpl]
Kodama's hobbies include shopping, especially for lingerie and rare stuffed animals.[tpl]gnr|ch|5[/tpl] When on night patrol, she is attracted to a rare King Penguin stuffed animal, and is captured by the Finnian twins of Venus.[tpl]gnr|ch|14[/tpl]Kodama forgives the Finian twins when they offer her the penguin stuffed animal.[tpl]gnr|ch|16[/tpl] She later shows a fear of ghosts and spirits outside her own magic;[tpl]gnr|ch|30|,|31[/tpl] in one instance she is frightened by a ghost story that Haruto Kirishima admitted that he had embellished.[tpl]gnr|ch|34[/tpl]
Kodama later reveals that she has extraordinary abilities. In the battle with Venus, Kodama uses her Maken to summon larger spirits that are as powerful as the Eight Maken.[tpl]gnr|ch|23[/tpl] The spirits can only be matched by strong fighters such as Minerva or Minori[tpl]gnr|ch|24[/tpl] She attracts the interest of the Kamigari, who have seen her as a key to unleashing the power in Amanohara. She was kidnapped by the Venus unit, and Ouken orders the Kamigari to capture her on the summer training island, where she confronts Kamigari members Leo and then Hakuto. Ouken reveals that Kodama is not human and is older than she appears to be.[tpl]gnr|ch|49|,|50[/tpl] She is the daughter of Yatsune, the former Yamata no Orochi,Kodama's mother reveals that the shikigami that serve her are actually her previous incarnations; each of which had generated one of the original Eight Maken when born. She becomes mortal after bearing her children but was able to pass on her shikigami powers to Kodama. Kodama's father suggests a different name for her mother, who is then referred to as Yatsune.[tpl]gnr|ch|51[/tpl] and Oousu no Mikoto, the first prince of the Yamato court.[tpl]gnr|ch|50|,|51[/tpl]  When their family is attacked by Oousu's brother, Yatsune and Oousu sacrifice themselves to defend Kodama and her brother Yabiko.[tpl]gnr|ch|51[/tpl]. Yabiko then seals Kodama, who has inherited her mother's powers,[tpl]gnr|ch|51[/tpl] away on top of Mount Amanohara.[tpl]gnr|ch|52[/tpl] Many years later, after her seal is weakened by Minori, Kodama uses her element to manifest an incarnation of herself.[tpl]gnr|ch|53[/tpl] She realizes that Takeru Ohyama is related to her brother and father.[tpl]gnr|ch|53[/tpl]
Kodama is voiced by Sayuri Yahagi and is English dubbed by Chloe Ragnbone

====Inaho Kushiya====

[tpl]nihongo|Inaho Kushiya|櫛八 イナホ|Kushiya Inaho[/tpl] is the self-proclaimed fiancée of Takeru Ohyama.[tpl]gnr|ch|1[/tpl] She feels strongly for Takeru, and although he does not remember her much, she has decided to wait until he fully does.[tpl]gnr|ch|12[/tpl] She holds Takeru's father in high regard. Upon revealing this, Takeru gets upset and ignores her, which causes her to cry. Takeru later apologizes to her after Kengo confronts him.[tpl]gnr|ch|7[/tpl] However, in the anime, she cries after Takeru tells her that he cannot remember a childhood promise. At first, Inaho was one of the three students that the Element detector, Keronbo, could not measure. However, she manifests her Maken when she saves Takeru and a cat from a falling boulder. She names the cat Monji and usually wears it on her head. Her Maken, Kamudo, is a gauntlet that greatly increases her strength and speed.[tpl]gnr|ch|7[/tpl] She is the star of the bonus four panel series of Maken-Ki comics where she is presented in super deformed mode. She is voiced by Iori Nomizu in the anime series, and English dubbed by Tia Ballard.

Venus is a mercenary unit that joins Tenbi Academy with the mission to search for the person who is trying to revive Yamata no Orochi. It is headed by Akaya Kodai, a former member of Maken-ki, and consists mainly of high school aged girls.[tpl]gnr|ch|8|,|9[/tpl] It is later revealed that Venus has ties to the Kamigari organization, and thus serve as the antagonists for a storyline where they plant barrier stones throughout Tenbi, capture Kodama under the pretense that she trespassed into the Amanohara, and challenge Maken-ki to rescue her.[tpl]gnr|ch|14|,|15[/tpl] The Venus unit uses Jingu, which are equipment used by the gods of their Western homelands; they are comparable to the Maken weapons used by the gods of the East.[tpl]gnr|ch|16[/tpl]

====Season 2====

==Reception==

Andy Hanley of UK Anime Network, in reviewing the first five episodes, found little originality in the anime series, which he called: "a cavalcade of tired old tropes and plot devices, from a visit to a hot springs to a 'date' where the couple are spied on by jealous friends, extending all the way out to the show's various characters and beyond." He gave it a 3/10 and summarized it as "A lazy, generic fan service series that has nothing of worth to offer beyond glimpses of female underwear.[tpl]cite web|last=Hanley |first=Andy |url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Maken-ki!_-_Eps._1-5.html |title=UK Anime Network Anime Review - Maken-ki! - Eps. 1-5 |publisher=Uk-anime.net |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2013-04-21[/tpl]
