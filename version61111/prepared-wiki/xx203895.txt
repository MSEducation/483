[[Blind flying panel]]

CATEGORIES: Avionics

A blind flying panel is a sub-panel in the cockpit containing six instruments mounted away from the main panel on three rubber suspension points. All the instruments on the blind flying panel are vacuum powered from a vacuum pump fitted on one of the engines, making the instruments independent of the electrical supply. It incorporates the following pitot/static and vacuum operated instruments:- Airspeed indicator, altimeter, climb/descent indicator, artificial horizon, turn and slip indicator and a directional gyro.
