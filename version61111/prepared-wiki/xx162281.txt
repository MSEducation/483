[[Edmonton municipal election, 1899]]

CATEGORIES: Municipal elections in Edmonton, 1899 elections in Canada

The 1899 municipal election was held December 11, 1899.  It was the first municipal election in which only a portion of the aldermen were to be elected; in 1898, three of the six aldermen elected were elected to two year terms in preparation for a system in which only half of the aldermen would be up for election each year.  Kenneth McLeod, Alfred Jackson, and Kenneth W. MacKenzie were all only halfway through their two year terms at the time of the election.  However, MacKenzie resigned in order to become mayor, leaving council with four vacancies.  Only three were filled by the election; council appointed Henry Goodridge to fill the fourth seat until the 1900 election.
