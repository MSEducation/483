==History==

It can be established, from historical records, that the area now comprising the village of Taghmon has been inhabited since at least as early as 595 AD. Saint Fintan Mannu was granted land there in circa 597 by a chieftain, Dímma mac Áeda Croin who later became a cleric and was buried among the monks at the monastery.Charles-Edwards, T.M. Early Christian Ireland page 117. Cambridge University Press, January 8, 2001. His followers, were residing in the area then known as 'Achadh Liathdrom', which translates as 'the grey field on (or near) the ridge of a hill'.

==Geography==

Many Irish place names are topographically descriptive, and 'Achadh Liathdrom' is no exception. From the western side of the Forth Mountain, as it slopes down towards Ballintlea, a succession of gradual hills and valleys undulate their way across this part of County Wexford towards Camross, Bree and Carrigbyrne Hills. It is on one of these hills or ridges that the village of Taghmon is situated.

==Modern Taghmon==

Being a large growing village, Taghmon has many businesses that contribute to the local economy.
