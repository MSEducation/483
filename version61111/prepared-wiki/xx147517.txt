==History==

ERT World Canada was licensed by the CRTC on December 14, 2000 as Odyssey II.http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-642.htm
Since its inception in 2001 up until 2003, Odyssey II (as it was then known) featured programming from Greece's top private network - MEGA Channel. In the summer of 2003, a dispute arose between Odyssey Television Network and the North American distributors of MEGA Channel and the programming was subsequently pulled. A short while later, OTN2 began airing programming from ERT World which subsequently led to the channel being renamed ERT World Canada.
In June 2013, ERT World was shut down in Greece by the Greek government due to a restructuring of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation. The government has since announced that a new, smaller public broadcaster will launch in early 2014 and it will feature an international feed for Greeks abroad, although it is unknown when the new satellite service will launch. Due to the loss of programming, ERT World Canada has been airing programming from Greek Cinema since the shut down of ERT World, on a temporary basis.
On July 30, 2013, Rogers Cable & Videotron replaced ERT World Canada in their lineup with Alpha Sat, a private network from Greece.
On August 30, 2013, the CRTC approved Odyssey Television Network's request to convert ERT World Canada from a licensed Category B specialty service to an exempted Cat. B third language service.ERT World– Revocation of licence
