</ref> have argued that Ford's impeachment attempt was politically motivated. Those who support this contention note Ford's well-known disappointment with the Senate over the failed nominations of [[Clement Haynsworth]] and [[G. Harrold Carswell]] to succeed Fortas. In April 1970, Congressman Ford moved to impeach Douglas in an attempt to hit back at the Senate. House Judiciary Chairman [[Emanuel Celler]] handled the case carefully and there did not appear to be evidence of any criminal conduct on the part of Douglas. (Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]] and the Nixon administration worked to gather evidence to the contrary.)<ref>[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/700415a.htm Gerald Ford's Remarks on the Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, April 15, 1970]</ref> Congressman Ford moved forward in the first major attempt to impeach a Supreme Court Justice in the modern era.
The hearings began in late April 1970. Congressman Ford was the main witness, and attacked Douglas' "liberal opinions," his "defense of the 'filthy' film." the controversial Swedish film, I Am Curious (Yellow) (1970); and his ties with the aforementioned Parvin. Douglas was criticized for accepting $350 for an article he wrote on folk music in the magazine Avant Garde. The magazine's publisher had served a prison sentence for the distribution of another magazine in 1966 that had been deemed pornographic. Describing Douglas' article, Ford stated, "The article itself is not pornographic, although it praises the lusty, lurid, and risqué along with the social protest of left-wing folk singers." Ford also attacked Douglas for publishing an article in Evergreen Review, as it was known to publish photographs of naked women. The Republican congressmen, however, refused to give the majority Democrats copies of the magazines described, prompting Congressman Wayne Hays to remark "Has anybody read the article – or is everybody over there who has a magazine just looking at the pictures?"(DV) Gerard: Conservatives, Judicial Impeachment, and Supreme Court Justice William O.

==Judicial record-setter==

During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Douglas set a number of records, all of which stand. He sat on the U.S. Supreme Court for more than thirty-six years (1939–75), longer than any other Justice. During those years, he wrote some thirty books in addition to his opinions and dissenting opinions. He gave more speeches than any other Justice, and his record for sidebar productivity is unlikely ever to be topped. Douglas also holds the record among Justices for having had the most wives (four) and the most divorces (three) while on the bench.

==Retirement==

Since the 1970 impeachment hearings, Douglas wanted to retire from the court. He wrote to his friend and former student Abe Fortas: "My ideas are way out of line with current trends, and I see no particular point in staying around and being obnoxious".
At age 76 on December 31, 1974, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Douglas suffered a debilitating stroke in the right hemisphere of his brain. It paralyzed his left leg and forced him to use a wheelchair. Douglas, severely disabled, insisted on continuing to participate in Supreme Court affairs despite his obvious incapacity. Seven of his fellow justices voted to postpone until the next term any argued case in which Douglas' vote might make a difference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/anticipating-the-incapaci_b_266179.html|title=Anticipating the Incapacitated Justice|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|date=August 22, 2009|work=Huffington Post |location=USA |accessdate=August 23, 2009[/tpl] At the urging of Fortas, Douglas finally retired on November 12, 1975, after 36 years of service.
Douglas submitted his resignation to now President Gerald Ford. In his response, Ford put aside former differences and paid tribute to the retiring justice, writing:  
 "May I express on behalf of all our countrymen this nation's great gratitude for your more than thirty-six years as a member of the Supreme Court.  Your distinguished years of service are unequaled in all the history of the Court."Ford, Gerald R. (1979). A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford.  New York: Harper & Row.  p. 334.  ISBN 0-06-011297-2. 
Ford also hosted Douglas as an honored guest at a White House state dinner later that same month, writing of the occasion later: "We had had differences in the past, but I wanted to stress that bygones were bygones."Ford, Gerald R. A Time to Heal.  p. 206.
Douglas believed that he could take senior status, and tried to continue serving on the Court. According to Woodward and Armstrong, Douglas refused to accept his retirement and tried to participate in the court's cases well into 1976, after Stevens had taken his former seat. Douglas reacted with outrage when, returning to his old chambers, he discovered that his clerks had been reassigned to Stevens, and when he tried to file opinions in cases whose arguments he had heard before his retirement. Chief Justice Warren Burger ordered all justices, clerks, and other staff members to refuse to help Douglas in those efforts. When Douglas tried in March 1976 to hear arguments in a capital-punishment case, (Gregg v. Georgia), the nine sitting justices signed a formal letter informing him that his retirement had ended his official duties on the court. Only then did Douglas withdraw from Supreme Court business.Woodward & Armstrong, pp.480–88, 526. One commentator has attributed some of his behavior after his stroke to anosognosia, a neuropsychological presentation which leads an affected person to be unaware and unable to acknowledge disease in himself. It often results in defects in reasoning, decision making, emotions, and feeling.Damasio, Antonio. "Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain." Penguin Books, 1994. pg. 68–69.

==Nicknames==

During his time on the Supreme Court, Douglas picked up a number of nicknames from both admirers and detractors. The most common epithet was Wild Bill, which he received for his independent and unpredictable stances and cowboy-style mannerisms, although many of the latter were affectations for the consumption of the press.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Douglas' first wife was Mildred Riddle, a teacher at North Yakima High School, whom he married on August 16, 1923. They had two children, Mildred and William, Jr.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]  They were divorced on July 20, 1953.  William Douglas, Jr. became an actor, playing Gerald Zinser in PT 109.
On October 2, 1949, Douglas had thirteen of his ribs broken after he was thrown from a horse and tumbled down a rocky hillside.Justice William Douglas injured in fall off horse Due to his injuries, Douglas did not return to the court until MarchPeppery disputes seen when high court convenes of 1950, or take part in many of that term's cases.[tpl]cite book |title=The Brethren |last1=Woodward |first1=Bob |last2=Armstrong |first2=Scott |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1979 |page=367 [/tpl] Four months after his return to the court, Douglas had to be hospitalized again due to his being kicked by a horse."Another horse puts Douglas in the hospital"

At the age of nearly 65, Douglas married for the third time, to Joan Martin, then a 23-year-old law student, on August 5, 1963.The Straits Times, August 7, 1963, p. 3, in newspapers.nl.sg, accessed May 1, 2011 They divorced in 1966.
For much of his life, Douglas was dogged by various rumors and allegations of womanizing, most originating from political rivals and other detractors of his liberal legal opinions on the Court, which were often a matter of controversy. In 1966, for example, Republican Senator Robert Dole of Kansas compared his "bad judgment from a matrimonial standpoint" to his court decisions. Various other Republican Members of Congress in the House of Representatives introduced resolutions, though none was ever passed, that called for investigation of Douglas' moral character.Time Magazine, July 29, 1966
At age 67, on July 15, 1966, Douglas married Cathleen Heffernan, then a 22-year-old student at Marylhurst College."Cloak and Gavel: FBI Wiretaps, Bugs, Informers, and the Supreme Court by Alexander Charns", page 64 books.google.com May 1, 2011 They met when he was vacationing at a mountain wilderness lodge in Washington state, where she was working for the summer as a waitress.Time Magazine, 29 July 1966 They remained together until his death 14 years later.Arlington National Cemetery, William O.
