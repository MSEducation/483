Measurement (from Old French, mesurement) is the assignment of numbers to objects or events.[tpl]cite book |last1 = Pedhazur |first1 = Elazar J. |last2 = Schmelkin  |first2 = Liora Pedhazur  |title = Measurement, Design, and Analysis: An Integrated Approach |edition=1st |publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location = Hillsdale, NJ  |year = 1991 |isbn = 0-805-81063-3  |pages=15â€“29[/tpl] It is a cornerstone of most natural sciences, technology, economics, and quantitative research in other social sciences.
Any measurement can be judged by the following meta-measurement criteria values: level of measurement (which includes magnitude), dimensions (units), and uncertainty. They enable comparisons to be done between different measurements and reduce confusion. Even in cases of clear qualitative similarity or difference, increased precision through quantitative measurement is often preferred in order to aid in replication. For example, different colours may be operationalized based either on wavelengths of light or (qualitative) terms such as "green" and "blue" which are often interpreted differently by different people. The science of measurement is called metrology.

==Standardization of measurement units==

Measurements are most commonly made in the SI system, which contains seven fundamental units: kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole. Six of these units are artifact-free (defined without reference to a particular physical object which serves as a standard); the definition of one remaining unit, the kilogram is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the BIPM outside Paris. Eventually, it is hoped that new SI definitions will be uniformly artifact-free.
Artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a physical constant or other invariable phenomenon in nature, in contrast to standard artifacts which can be damaged or otherwise change slowly over time. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.
