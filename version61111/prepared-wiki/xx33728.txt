The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (also known as UNC, UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, or simply Carolina)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2002/01/unc_leaders_want_abbreviation_change|title=UNC Leaders Want Abbreviation Change|last=Wootson|first=Cleve R., Jr|date=January 8, 2002|location=Chapel Hill, NC|work=The Daily Tar Heel|accessdate=July 9, 2012[/tpl] is a coeducational public research university located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States. North Carolina has been consistently ranked among the highest ranked universities in the United States and is one of the original eight Public Ivy schools that provide an Ivy League experience for a public schooling price. After being chartered in 1789, the university first began enrolling students in 1795, which allows it to be one of three schools to claim the title of the oldest public university in the United States.
The first public institution of higher education in North Carolina, the school opened its doors to students on February 12, 1795. The university offers degrees in over 70 courses of study through fourteen colleges and the College of Arts and Sciences. All undergraduates receive a liberal arts education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status. Under the leadership of President Kemp Plummer Battle, in 1877 North Carolina became coeducational and began the process of desegregation in 1951 when African-American graduate students were admitted under Chancellor Robert Burton House.[tpl]cite web|url=http://womenscenter.unc.edu/about/womens-history-unc/ |title=UNC Women's History | Carolina Women's Center |publisher=Womenscenter.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html |title=North Carolina Collection-UNC Desegregation |publisher=Lib.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-12-21[/tpl] In 1952, North Carolina opened its own hospital, UNC Health Care, for research and treatment, and has since specialized in cancer care. The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as "Tar Heels".
The campus of North Carolina is located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a university town. The campus covers a rather small [tpl]convert|729|acre|km2|0|sp=us[/tpl] over Chapel Hill's downtown area, encompassing places like the Morehead Planetarium and the many stores and shops located on Franklin Street. Students can participate in over 550 officially recognized student organizations. The student-run newspaper The Daily Tar Heel has won national awards for collegiate media, while the student radio station WXYC provided the world's first internet radio broadcast. North Carolina is one of the charter members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which was founded on June 14, 1953. Competing athletically as the Tar Heels, North Carolina has achieved great success in sports, most notably in men's basketball and women's soccer.

==History==

Chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly on December 11, 1789, the university's cornerstone was laid on October 12, 1793, near the ruins of a chapel, chosen because of its central location within the state.[tpl]cite book|last=Snider|first=William D.|title=Light on the Hill: A History of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aKRPWDroJSwC|publisher=UNC Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|year=1992|pages=13, 16, 20|isbn=0-8078-2023-7[/tpl] Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is one of the oldest public universities in the United States and the only such institution to confer degrees in the eighteenth century.Snider, William D.

During the Civil War, North Carolina Governor David Lowry Swain persuaded Confederate President Jefferson Davis to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was one of the few in the Confederacy that managed to stay open.Snider, William D. (1992), p. 67. However, Chapel Hill suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during Reconstruction from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875.[tpl]cite book|last=Battle|first=Kemp P.|title=History of the University of North Carolina: From 1868–1912|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AdshAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Edwards & Broughton Printing Company|location=Raleigh, NC|year=1912|pages=39, 41, 88[/tpl]
Despite initial skepticism from university President Frank Porter Graham, on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the State College of Agriculture and Engineering and Woman's College of the University of North Carolina to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina.Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 212–213. In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully coeducational, although most women still attended Woman's College for their first two years, transferring to Chapel Hill as juniors, since freshmen were required to live on campus and there was only one women's dorm. As a result, Woman's College was renamed the "University of North Carolina at Greensboro", and the University of North Carolina became the "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill."[tpl]cite news|title=UNC Trustees in broad changes of all branches|date=January 25, 1963|location=Burlington, NC|work=The Daily Times-News|page=1[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Frost|first=Susan H.|coauthors=Hearn, James C.; Marine, Ginger M.|year=1997|title=State Policy and the Public Research University: A Case Study of Manifest and Latent Tensions|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|publisher=The Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, OH|volume=68|issue=4|pages=363–397|doi=10.2307/2960008|jstor=2960008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/campus_links/inside_uncg/inside_history.html|title=The History of UNCG|year=2005|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Greensboro|accessdate=May 20, 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/about-nc-state/history/index.php|title=History|year=2008|work=About NC State|publisher=North Carolina State University|accessdate=May 21, 2008[/tpl] In 1955, UNC officially desegregated its undergraduate divisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html |title=North Carolina Collection-UNC Desegregation |publisher=Lib.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl]
During World War II, UNC at Chapel Hill was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://studentorgs.unc.edu/nrotc/index.php/history |title=The Beginning of NROTC at UNC Chapel Hill |publisher=Chapel Hill, North Carolina: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |year=2011[/tpl]
During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, protests about local racial segregation which began quietly in Franklin Street restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance.Snider, William D. (1992), p. 269. The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 Speaker Ban Law prohibiting speeches by communists on state campuses in North Carolina.Snider, William D. (1992), p. 270. The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor William Brantley Aycock and university President William Friday, but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965.Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 272–273. Small amendments to allow "infrequent" visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to Marxist speaker Herbert Aptheker and civil liberties activist Frank Wilkinson; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened "Dan Moore's Wall" by The Daily Tar Heel for Governor Dan K. Moore.Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 274–275. A group of UNC students, led by Student Body President Paul Dickson, filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court, and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down.Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 267–268.
From the late 1990s and onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the "Carolina First" fundraising campaign and an endowment that increased fourfold to over $2 billion in just ten years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://giving.unc.edu/development/endow.htm|title=University Endowment|accessdate=April 5, 2008|year=2007|publisher=UNC Office of University Development|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080311220627/http://giving.unc.edu/development/endow.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://oira.unc.edu/historical-trends-1978-2000.html|title=Historical Trends, 1978–2007|accessdate=May 20, 2008|year=2007|publisher=UNC Office of Institutional Research and Assessment[/tpl] Professor Oliver Smithies was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2007 for his work in genetics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2007/10/09/University/Unc-Professor.Wins.Nobel.Prize-3020317.shtml|title=UNC professor wins Nobel Prize|last=Sullivan|first=Kate|date=October 9, 2007|location=Chapel Hill, NC|work=The Daily Tar Heel|accessdate=May 20, 2008[/tpl]

==Campus==

UNC's [tpl]convert|729|acre|km2|1|adj=on[/tpl] campus is dominated by two central quads: Polk Place and McCorkle Place. Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President James K. Polk,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/jp11.html|title=Biography of James Polk|accessdate=April 5, 2008|year=2001|work=Past presidents|publisher=The White House[/tpl] and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the bill requesting the university's charter.[tpl]cite book|last=Powell|first=William S.|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography|publisher=UNC Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|year=1991|volume=4|chapter=Samuel Eusebius McCorkle|isbn=978-0-8078-1918-0[/tpl] Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the Pit Preacher. The Morehead–Patterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the American Society of Landscape Architects Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university "works of art" by T.A. Gaines in his book The Campus as a Work of Art.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ellertson|first=Shari L.|year=2001|title=Expenditures on O&M at America's Most Beautiful Campuses|journal= Facilities Manager Magazine|volume=17|issue=5|publisher=APPA|location=Alexandria, VA|url=http://www.appa.org/FacilitiesManager/article.cfm?ItemNumber=394&parentid=203|accessdate=April 5, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Gaines|first=Thomas A.|title=The Campus as a Work of Art|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|year=1991|page=155|isbn=0-275-93967-7[/tpl]
The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as "north campus," "middle campus," and "south campus." North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maps.unc.edu/CampusMaps/PdfMaps/CampusMapIndexed2005_11x17.pdf|title=Campus Map|format=PDF|year=2007|publisher=UNC Engineering Information Services|accessdate=May 22, 2008[/tpl] Middle campus includes Fetzer Field and Woollen Gymnasium along with the Student Recreation Center, Kenan Memorial Stadium, Irwin Belk outdoor track, Eddie Smith Field House, Boshamer Stadium, Carmichael Auditorium, the Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government, School of Law, George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls. South campus includes the Dean Smith Center for men's basketball, Koury Natatorium, School of Medicine, UNC Hospitals, Kenan–Flagler Business School, and the newest student residence halls.
A new satellite campus, Carolina North, to be built on the site of Horace Williams Airport was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a research park with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2007/10/03/84083/a-primer-for-carolina-north.html|title=A primer for Carolina North|date=October 3, 2007|location=Raleigh, NC|work=The News & Observer|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Carolina North > Home|url=http://carolinanorth.unc.edu/|accessdate=September 21, 2012[/tpl]

===Sustainability===

The principles of sustainability have been integrated throughout much of UNC-Chapel Hill. In the area of green building, the university requires that all new projects meet the requirements for LEED Silver certification and is in the process of building the first building in North Carolina to receive LEED Platinum status.[tpl]cite web| title =UNC Sustainability: High Performance Buildings| publisher =UNC-Chapel Hill| url =http://sustainability.unc.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=54| accessdate =June 8, 2009 [/tpl]

In 2006, the university and the Town of Chapel Hill jointly agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60% by 2050, becoming the first town-gown partnership in the country to do so.[tpl]cite web| title =UNC Sustainability: Institutionalizing Sustainability| publisher =UNC-Chapel Hill| url =http://sustainability.unc.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=155| accessdate =June 8, 2009 [/tpl]
Through these efforts, the university achieved a “A−” grade on the Sustainable Endowment Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2010.[tpl]cite web| title =College Sustainability Report Card 2009| publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute| url =http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/| accessdate =June 8, 2009 [/tpl]
Only 14 out of 300 universities received a higher score than this.

===Old Well and McCorkle Place===

The most enduring symbol of the university is the Old Well, a small neoclassical rotunda based on the Temple of Love in the Gardens of Versailles, in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/architecture/the-temple-of-love-versailles-1775-left-and-the-ol/|title=Architectural Highlights of Carolina's Historic Campus|accessdate=September 11, 2010|publisher =The Carolina Story[/tpl] The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings, Old East, and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the Davie Poplar tree under which the university's founder, William Richardson Davie, supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC.[tpl]cite book|last=Loewer|first=H. Peter|title=Jefferson's Garden|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, PA|year=2004|page=228|isbn=0-8117-0076-3[/tpl] Because of the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as Hurricane Fran in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III. The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's bicentennial celebration in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/tour/LEVEL_2/davie.htm|title=Davie Poplar|accessdate=April 5, 2008|year=2001|work=A Self-Guided Tour of Campus|publisher=UNC Visitors' Center[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2004/10/12/Features/Reflections.Of.A.Storied.Past-1360832.shtml|title=Reflections of a storied past|last=Valle|first=Kirsten|date=October 12, 2004|location=Chapel Hill, NC|work=The Daily Tar Heel|accessdate=June 24, 2008[/tpl]
Another university landmark is the Confederate monument, known to students as Silent Sam, erected to commemorate UNC students who died fighting for the Confederacy. The statue has at times been dogged by controversy, some critics claiming that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery, while others counter that "Silent Sam" is simply historical and a part of the rich heritage of the South.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/692/story/414858.html|title=Ceremony salutes flag and its cause|last=Nesbitt|first=Jim|date=March 5, 2006|location=Raleigh, NC|work=The News & Observer|accessdate=June 20, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911022704/http://www.newsobserver.com/692/story/414858.html |archivedate = September 11, 2007[/tpl] The statue depicts a soldier armed with a rifle, but lacking a cartridge box. Thus, Silent Sam does not carry any ammunition and is a "benign" soldier. The statue was erected in 1913 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to honor the school's Confederate heroes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gradschool.unc.edu/programs/weiss/interesting_place/landmarks/sam.html|title=Silent Sam|accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl] The student members of the university's Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies are not allowed to walk on the grass of McCorkle Place out of respect for the unknown resting place of Joseph Caldwell, the university's first president.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/di_phi/join.html |title=The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl]
The Morehead–Patterson bell tower was commissioned by John Motley Morehead III, the benefactor of the prestigious Morehead Scholarship.UNC.edu[tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl] The hedge and surrounding landscape was designed by William C. Coker, botany professor and creator of the campus arboretum. Traditionally, seniors have the opportunity to climb the tower a few days prior to May commencement.
The historic Playmakers Theatre is located on Cameron Avenue between McCorkle Place and Polk Place. It was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, the same architect who renovated the northern façade of Old East in 1844.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/tour/LEVEL_2/playmakers.htm |title=Playmakers Theater Tour Stop |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl] The east-facing building was completed in 1851 and initially served as a library and as a ballroom. It was originally named Smith Hall after North Carolina Governor General Benjamin Smith, who was a special aide to George Washington during the American Revolutionary War and was an early benefactor to the university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/early_benefactors/benjamin-smith-1756-1826-1/ |title=The Carolina Story—Carolina's Early Benefactors: |publisher=Museum.unc.edu |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl] When the library moved to Hill Hall in 1907, the School of Law occupied Smith Hall until 1923. In 1925, the structure was renovated and used as a stage by the university theater group, the Carolina Playmakers. It has remained a theater to the present day. Louis Round Wilson wrote in 1957 that Playmakers Theatre is the "architectural gem of the campus."[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl] Playmakers Theatre was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973.http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/NC01.pdf Today, the building is a venue for student drama productions, concerts, and events sponsored by academic departments. In 2006, the university began a renovation of Playmakers Theatre, which has included an exterior paint job and interior remodeling.  The renovation is expected to be complete by the end of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2010/07/playmakers_theatre_to_reopen |title=Playmakers Theatre to reopen |publisher=The Daily Tar Heel |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl]

===Department of Public Policy===

The UNC Department of Public Policy, established in 2001, is a public policy program offering specializations in areas such as global health policy, education policy, tax policy, and social justice.
Established in 1979, the Curriculum in Public Policy Analysis was one of the first undergraduate degree programs in public policy, and a charter member of the national Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. It was augmented in 1991 by an interdisciplinary PhD Curriculum in Public Policy Analysis. In 1995 the two curricula were combined and began recruiting their own core faculty. In 2001 the combined curriculum became the present Department of Public Policy.

===Honor Code===

The university has a longstanding Honor Code known as the "Instrument of Student Judicial Governance," supplemented by an entirely student-run Honor System to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://honor.unc.edu/|title=The Honor Code|publisher=Honor Court of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=April 14, 2009[/tpl] The Honor System is divided into three branches: the Student Attorney General Staff, the Honor Court, and the Honor System Outreach.  The Student Attorney General is appointed by the Student Body President to investigate all reports of Honor Code violations and determine whether or not to bring charges against the student as detailed in the "Instrument."  The Attorney General is supported by a select staff of around 40 students.  The Honor Court is led by the Chair, who is appointed by the Student Body President, and supported by Vice Chairs who adjudicate all students' hearings.  The Honor Court as a whole is made up of some 80 selected students.  The Honor System Outreach is a branch of the System solely devoted to promoting honor and integrity in the University community.

In 2012 a case of academic fraud was found in the Afro-American Studies Department when an investigation, led by former governor James G. Martin, found that many courses were entirely pro-forma.  Former Afro-American Studies Department chairman Julius Nyang'oro had little oversight in creation of these courses that either met a few times during the year, or at all.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2012/08/swept_up_in_scandal[/tpl]  Students in these courses were able to get a passing grade for submitting term papers without attending classes. 216 classes were found to have problems, and 106 student grades were changed without authorization.

===Scholarships===

For decades UNC has offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the Morehead-Cain Scholarship. Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 29 alumni of the program have been named Rhodes Scholars. North Carolina also boasts the Robertson Scholars Program, a scholarship granting recipients the opportunity to attend both UNC and neighboring Duke University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.robertsonscholars.org/index.php?type=static&source=2|title=Overview|year=2005|publisher=The Robertson Scholars Program|accessdate=May 21, 2008[/tpl] Additionally, the university provides merit-based scholarships, including the Carolina, Colonel Robinson, and Pogue Scholars programs, which offer full scholarships for out-of-state students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://studentaid.unc.edu/studentaid/type/ssa_scholarships.html|title=Merit-Based Scholarships|year=2008|publisher=UNC Office of Scholarships and Student Aid|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080321065548/http://studentaid.unc.edu/studentaid/type/ssa_scholarships.html |archivedate=March 21, 2008[/tpl]
In 2003, Chancellor James Moeser announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following Princeton) and the first of its kind at a public university. About 80 other universities have since followed suit.[tpl]cite news|first=Mary Beth|last=Marklein|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2006-09-26-covenent-loans_x.htm|title=Right to an education bound in a Covenant|date=September 26, 2006|location=McLean, VA|work=USA Today|accessdate=July 11, 2008[/tpl]
