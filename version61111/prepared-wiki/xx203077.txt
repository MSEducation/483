Waitstill Hastings Sharp (1902â€“1984) was a Unitarian minister who was involved in humanitarian work and social justice.

==Early life and education==

Sharp, born in Boston in May 1902, was the son of naturalist author and professor Dallas Lore Sharp and Grace Hastings and a descendant of Thomas Hastings who came from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634.
He was a graduate of Boston University (1923), Harvard Law School (1926), and Harvard University (M.A., 1931).

==Career==

While in his third year of law school he got to know Dr. Eugene Shippen, minister of Second Church in Boston. He became part-time director of religious education at Second Church and, later, through the support of Dr. Shippen, National Director of Religious Education for the American Unitarian Association (AUA). Several years later, he was ordained a Unitarian minister. In 1933 he took the pulpit of a small church in Meadville, Pennsylvania.
In 1927, he had married Martha Ingham Dickie, a social worker who also worked with local internationalist and peace groups.
In April 1936, he was appointed pastor at the Unitarian Church of Wellesley Hills in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

==World War II rescue work==

The Sharps were recruited by members of the American Unitarian Association, including Robert Dexter to accept a posting in Czechoslovakia, as representatives of a new program to help endangered refugees. With his wife Martha Sharp, in 1939 he administered relief to hundreds of endangered Jews and other refugees in Prague.
In the following year, Waitstill and Martha traveled to southern Europe to continue a relief and rescue program for endangered refugees as representatives of the newly formed Unitarian Service Committee. While visiting southern France, Waitstill worked closely with the World YMCA to help Czech servicemen to escape from Vichy France.  Waitstill also forged a collaboration with Varian Fry to look after Fry's refugee clients in Lisbon.  In this capacity, Waitstill personally escorted the novelist Lion Feuchtwanger from Marseille, France, to America.Subak, Susan Elisabeth, Rescue and Flight: American Relief Workers Who Defied the Nazis, University of Nebraska Press, 2010.
