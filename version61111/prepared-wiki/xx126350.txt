==History==

Conor Meads and Cory Stier were childhood friends and next door neighbors. Although Meads was three years older, the two were inseparable. Justin Shannon (guitar) and Alex Kuhse (bass) knew Meads and Stier from high school, and in the wake of their graduation, the four friends decided to put their musical talents together and start Pistolita. The band has been primarily influenced by Fugazi, At the Drive-In, Hot Water Music and Hot Snakes. In 2006 the band parted ways with Alex, who went on to become a lifetime bass tech and understudy for Joey Demaio of Manowar. Alex also went on to form the San Diego party rock and roll band Midnight Eagle with KyleBob, a gay club promoter. Shortly after going through two more bassists, the band broke up.
Conor Meads recently followed up "Oliver Under The Moon" with 2009 "The Paper Boy (EP)" and is currently working at guitar center.
Pistolita was the first signing on Montalban Hotel Records, a label run by booking agent Andrew Ellis, as a subsidiary of East West Records and Warner Music Group.  
Their song "Beni Accident" was featured on EA Sports' video game NHL 07.
