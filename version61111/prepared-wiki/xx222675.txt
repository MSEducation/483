==Early life and education==

Born Ong Yoke Lin on July 23, 1917 in Kuala Lumpur.

==Politics==

Omar helped found and joined the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) in 1949. As a prominent Chinese leader, Ong was selected by the British High Commissioner as a member of the then fully appointed Selangor State Council and Federal Legislative Council.
In 1952, he and Yahya Abdul Razak mooted the idea of an alliance between MCA and the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) for the Kuala Lumpur Municipal Council elections. This was the precursor to the formal Alliance Party. He contested and won a seat in that election, and was chosen as leader of the Alliance Party in the Municipal Council.
Omar went on to become MCA vice president and the Member of Parliament for Hulu Selangor.[tpl]cite news |title=Omar Ong Yoke Lin: the passing of an era |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/omar-ong-yoke-lin-the-passing-of-an-era/ |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date=July 1, 2010[/tpl]
In 1955, the Alliance Party won the first ever elections to the Federal Legislative Council under the leadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman.

Following the overwhelming support shown for the Alliance Party during the elections and the forming of the government, the Tunku led the Merdeka Delegation to London which successfully negotiated independence from the British. Omar joined the Tunku on his second trip to London in April 1957 to finalize the newly drafted Constitution of Malaya.
