==Career==

===Skateboarding===

As a professional skateboarder, Lee's reputation was especially prominent in the late-1980s and early-1990s. He co-founded Stereo Skateboards with Chris "Dune" Pastras in 1992, and the pair revived the company in 2003 after it had been defunct for several years.[tpl]cite web|title=Blog|url=http://www.stereosoundagency.com/|work=Stereo skateboards|publisher=Stereo Sound Agency|accessdate=2 January 2013|year=2011[/tpl] Both Lee and Pastras remain on the professional "Classics" team roster as of October 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Team Stereo|url=http://www.stereosoundagency.com/team-2/|work=Stereo Sound Agency|publisher=Antics International|accessdate=15 October 2013|date=October 2013[/tpl]

====Stereo====

Pastras, who was nineteen years of age when the company was founded, has explained in a 2012 interview, in relation to the original formation of Stereo:
 
 It didn't piss off the cool guys and it didn't piss off the hesh guys; it was just sort of, like, retro-Americana. It was, like, an original vibe, you know. And anyone that skated could be, like, "Oh, I get that. It's cool." It was the perfect thing for the perfect time—Stereo ... I met Jason because me and Mike V (Vallely) took a trip out to California, and I was, like, fourteen, fifteen years-old, and we came out and stayed with Mark Gonzales. So, I got super lucky and I met Jason our first trip out, or my first trip out ... We both kinda had similar music tastes and interests. We weren't, like, drinking beer, we were drinking wine—you know? ... Stereo was, kinda, a manifestation of our, sort of, aesthetic. We both got, sorta, I guess, like, disillusioned with ... things, it was just like a no-brainer, you know, like, why don't we start our own deal? Our concept wasn't fully developed. It was just like, "Oh yeah, we want, like, a retro skate brand!", you know?'[tpl]cite web|title=The History behind Stereo Skateboards with Chris Pastras- Hand In Hand|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45VyTVbwkgw|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=RIDEChannel|format=Video upload|date=9 February 2012[/tpl]
The original team from the 1990s, in addition to Lee and Pastras, included Ethan Fowler,[tpl]cite web|title=Ethan Fowler Stereo's "A Visual Sound"|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLuR9XZgesk|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=gee3peeo|format=Video upload|date=18 May 2007[/tpl] Matt Rodriguez,[tpl]cite web|title=Matt Rodriguez / "A Visual Sound" 1994|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVKuD3biFy4|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=gee3peeo|format=Video upload|date=5 November 2008[/tpl] Carl Shipman,[tpl]cite web|title=Carl Shipman - A Visual Sound|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1yFDa1bqoY|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=robowen1|format=Video upload|date=15 January 2011[/tpl] and Mike Daher,[tpl]cite web|title=Mike Daher in Stereo's "A Visual Sound"|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xik9C_RAsCA|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=gee3peeo|format=Video upload|date=22 April 2007[/tpl] and the company released its first video, A Visual Sound, in 1994, adopting the aesthetic of retro companies such as the Blue Note jazz record label, and non-skateboarding influences. However, by 1999, the style that Lee and Pastras had infused into their brand was not marketable and the company gradually dissolved, with the distributor at the time, diverting its financial resources into the launch of other initiatives. Pastras revealed in 2012, "It was, like, a huge relief when it, when Stereo, ended, just because it was, like, the first time I got to not be the 'skater dude', that I knew; put that down for a minute and, sort of, like, joined the rest of the world for a minute, and not feel pressured to skate; but I got sick of it real quick."
Prior to the relaunch of Stereo, Pastras received an email from Lee, who informed his former partner that he had been skateboarding again in a new skate park that was owned by professional skateboarder, Steve Berra—Lee explained in the email that he had been executing tricks such as 360-flips and backside flips. Pastras has stated, "I could tell he was really excited about skateboarding." At the point when Lee raised the idea of restarting Stereo to Pastras, the latter had already been working in the area of the company's trademark for a year.
As of January 2013, the Stereo brand, together with the Hi-Fi wheel company, also co-owned by Lee, is distributed by the Antics! International company, also responsible for distributing the Theeve, Lurkville, and Armourdillo skateboard brands—the Antics! negotiation was finalized in September 2010. Professional skateboarders such as Kyle Leeper, Clint Peterson, Benny Fairfax, and Raymond Molinar ride for the Stereo brand (no team exists for the Hi-Fi brand, but a signature "filmer wheel" for skateboard videographer, Jason Hernandez, is featured on the January 2013 website).[tpl]cite web|title=ANTICS LICENSES STEREO SKATEBOARDS & HI-FI WHEELS|url=http://business.transworld.net/47254/news/antics-licenses-stereo-skateboards-hi-fi-wheels/|work=Transworld Business|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=Mike Lewis|date=14 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.anticsintl.com/|work=Antics International|publisher=Antics International|accessdate=2 January 2013|year=2003–2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=STEREO’S CHRIS PASTRAS AND ANTICS’ BRIAN HOWARD ON NEW PARTNERSHIP|url=http://business.transworld.net/48444/features/stereos-chris-pastras-and-antics-brian-howard-on-new-partnership/|work=Transworld Business|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=Kailee Bradstreet|date=4 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.hifiwheels.com/|work=www.hifiwheels.com|publisher=HiFiWheels.com|accessdate=2 January 2013|year=2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stereo Welcomes Kyle Leeper|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ysl1N7e6m8|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=TheStereoSoundAgency|format=Video upload|date=17 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stereo Wood Vinyl Cruiser: Jason Lee and the boys push through NYC|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFczlDS5Lco&list=UU2oQdzjgavjYFn5inIUJ_UQ&index=2|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=TheStereoSoundAgency|format=Video upload|date=30 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Stereo Sound Agency and WESC in Arizona|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeXoxTVn17U|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=2 January 2013|author=skateboardermagazine|format=Video upload|date=17 September 2012[/tpl] In the Antics! press release following the Stereo and Hi-Fi signing, Brian Howard, at the time the general manager of the distribution company, stated:
 
 Stereo is one of those brands in skateboarding that has true heritage and respect from the skateboard world. The opportunity to be involved with the Stereo and Hi-Fi brands is very exciting. With Jason, Chris, and their team behind the creative and Antics behind the operations, I feel that we will push Stereo to a whole new level.
