It was first issued on a 12-inch 78 rpm record (International Record Collector's Club 118) with a spoken introduction by her mother and reissued on LP ca. 1965 on the same label as part of a compilation (cat. no. IRCC L-7025). Raymond Ericson of The New York Times described her performance of it as quite charming.Ericson, Raymond (1961). "Mendelssohn Songs Refound". The New York Times, 31 October 1965.
