===References from Vedas===

The Rig Veda contains an epithet that has been attributed to Narasimha. The avatar is described as "like some wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming" (RV.I 154.2a). There is an allusion to a Namuci story in RV.VIII 14.13: "With waters' foam you tore off, Indra, the head of Namuci, subduing all contending hosts." This short reference is believed to have culminated in the full puranic story of Narasimha.

===Narasimha and Prahlad===

Bhagavata Puran describes that in his previous avatar as Varaha, Vishnu killed the asura Hiranyaksha. The younger brother of Hiranyaksha, Hiranyakashipu wanted revenge on Vishnu and his followers. He undertook many years of austere penance to take revenge on Vishnu:Bhag-P 7.4.1 "Lord Brahma was very much satisfied by Hiranyakasipu's austerities, which were difficult to perform" Brahma thus offers the demon a boon and Hiranyakashipu asks for immortality.  Brahma tells him this is not possible, but that he could bind the death of Hiranyakashipu with conditions. Hiranyakashipu agreed:
 
 O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you.
Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal.
Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.
Brahma said, "Tatha asthu" (be it so) and vanished.  Hiranyakashipu was happy thinking that he had won over death.Bhag-P, Canto 7  7.3.35-38

One day while Hiranyakashipu performed austerities at Mandaracala Mountain, his home was attacked by Indra and the other devatas.Bhag-P 7.7.6 "The victorious demigods plundered the palace of Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons, and destroyed everything within it. Then Indra, King of heaven, arrested Prahalad's mother, Hiranyakasipu's wife Kayadu, the Queen" At this point the divine sage Narad intervenes to protect Kayadu, whom he describes as 'sinless'.Bhag-P 7.7.8 "Narad Muni said: O Indra, King of the demigods, this woman is certainly sinless. You should not drag her off in this merciless way. This chaste woman is the wife of another. You must immediately release her." Following this event, Narad takes Kayadu into his care and while under the guidance of Narad, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu's son) Prahlad, becomes affected by the transcendental instructions of the sage even at such a young stage of development. Thus, Prahlad later begins to show symptoms of this earlier training by Narad, gradually becoming recognised as a devoted follower of Vishnu, much to his father's disappointment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/6/en1 |title=Bhag-P 7.8.6 |publisher=Srimadbhagavatam.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl]
Hiranyakashipu furious at the devotion of his son to Vishnu, as the god had killed his brother. Finally, he decides to commit filicide.Bhag-P 7.8.3-4 "Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahlad. Hiranyakasipu was by nature very cruel but each time he attempts to kill the boy, Prahlad is protected by Vishnu's mystical power. When asked, Prahlad refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is all-pervading and omnipresent. Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if 'his Vishnu' is in it:
  "O most unfortunate Prahlad, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/12/en1 |title=Bhag-P 7.8.12 |publisher=Srimadbhagavatam.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl]  
Prahlad then answers, He was, He is and He will be.  In an alternate version of the story, Prahlad answers, He is in pillars, and he is in the smallest twig. Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashes the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Vishnu in the form of Narasimha appears from it and moves to attack Hiranyakashipu. in defence of Prahlad. In order to kill Hiranyakashipu and not upset the boon given by Brahma, the form of Narasimha is chosen. Hiranyakashipu can not be killed by human, deva or animal. Narasimha is neither one of these as he is a form of Vishnu incarnate as a part-human, part-animal.  He comes upon Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out), and puts the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his sharp fingernails (neither animate nor inanimate) as weapons, he disembowels and kills the demon.Bhag-P 7.8.29 "Lord Narasimhadeva placed the demon on his lap, supporting him with his thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the lord very easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of his hand." Kurma Puran describes the preceding battle between the Purusha and demonic forces in which he escapes a powerful weapon called Pashupata and it describes how Prahlad's brothers headed by Anuhrada and thousands of other demons "were led to the valley of death (yamalayam) by the lion produced from the body of man-lion" avatar.p.85: K.P.1.15.70 The same episode occurs in the Matshya Purana 179, several chapters after its version of the Narasimha advent.
The Bhagavata Purana further narrates: even after killing Hiranyakashipu, none of the present demigods are able to calm Narasimha's fury, not even Shiva. So all the gods and goddesses call his consort, Lakshmi, but she is also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlad is presented to Narasimha, and finally he is calmed by the prayers of his devotee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/9/en1 |title=Bhag-P 7.9 |publisher=Srimadbhagavatam.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl] Before parting, Narasimha rewards the wise Prahlad by crowning him as the king.
According to Atharva Veda, Linga Purana, Skanda Purana and Sharabha Upanishad, Narasimha's anger did not go even by slaying Hiranyakashipu. Lord Shiva then took his avatar as Virabhadra to subdue him.http://books.google.co.in/books?id=4VUS2Rxmy_QC&pg=PA151&dq=Sharabha&lr=&ei=6D1FS973E6WSkAS-04XrDQ&cd=41#v=onepage&q=Sharabha&f=falseSpecial:BookSources/1-60620-146-8 When that also failed, Shiva manifested as his thirteenth avatar Sharabeshwaramurti,http://books.google.com/books?id=OoFDK_sDGHwC&pg=PA4Special:BookSources/978-0-7914-0799-8 a human-lion-bird form. Shiva was then able to control Narasimha and let Lord Vishnu regained his original form.http://www.harekrsna.com/sun/features/05-09/features1381.htmhttp://www.kamat.com/jyotsna/blog/blog.php?BlogID=1149

===Narasimha and Adi Shankara===

Narasimha is also a protector of his devotees in times of danger. Near Srisailam, there is a forest called Hatakeshwanam, that no man enters. Shankaracharya entered this place and did penance for many days. During this time, a Kapalika, by name Kirakashan appeared before him. Kapalikas are a set of people who live in the burial grounds and pray to God by giving human and animal sacrifice. He told Sri Shankara that he should give his body as a human sacrifice to Kali. Sankara happily agreed. His disciples were shocked to hear this and pleaded with Shankara to change his mind, but he refused to do so saying that it was an honor to give up his body as a sacrifice for Kali and one must not lament such things. The Kapalika arranged a fire for the sacrifice and Shankara sat beside it. Just as he lifted his axe to severe the head of Shankara, Lord Vishnu as Narasimha entered the body of the disciple of Shankaracharya and Narasimha devotee, Padmapada. He then fought the Kapalika, slayed him and freed the forest of Kapalikas. Adi Shankara composed the very powerful Lakshmi-Narasimha Karavalambam Stotram[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindudevotionalblog.com/2008/08/sri-lakshmi-narasimha-karavalamba.html |title=Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram Lyrics - Lakshmi Nrsimha Devotional Video |publisher=Hindu Devotional Blog |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl] at the very spot in front of Lord Narasimha.

==Mode of worship==

Due to the nature of Narasimha's form (divine anger), it is essential that worship be given with a very high level of attention compared to other deities. In many temples only lifelong celibates (brahmacarya) will be able to have the chance to serve as priests to perform the daily puja. Forms where Narasimha appears sitting in a yogic posture, or with the goddess Lakshmi are the exception to this rule, as Narasimha is taken as being more relaxed in both of these instances compared to his form when first emerging from the pillar to protect Prahlad.

===Prayers===

A number of prayers have been written in dedication to Narasimha avatar. These include:
 
 The Narasimha Maha-Mantra
"O' Angry and brave Maha-Vishnu, your heat and fire permeate everywhere. O Lord Narasimha, you are everywhere. You are the death of death and I surrender to You."

"I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha, who gives joy to Prahlad Maharaja and whose nails are like chisels on the stone like chest of the demon Hiranyakasipu." 
(Narasimha Pranama)
"Lord Nrsimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Narasimha is there. 
He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Narasimha, 
the origin of all things and the supreme refuge."Steven J. Rosen, Narasimha Avatar, The Half-Man/Half-Lion Incarnation
 
 
"O Kesava! O Lord of the universe. O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasplike demon Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on your beautiful lotus hands." (from the Dasavatara-stotra composed by Jayadeva)
"O Kamasikha Narasimha! you are sarva sakthan. When you are resolved to protect some one, where is the need to seek the protection of anyone else? When you are resolved not to protect some one, which other person is capable of protecting us?. There is no one. Knowing this fundamental truth, I have resolved to offer my saranagati at your lotus feet alone that rest at the banks of Vegavathi river." (Kamasika Ashtakam by Vedanta Desika)
"I will dance and melt for you, within my heart, to see you, I will sing in praise of you with tears in joy, I will search for Narasimha and I am a householder who still searches to reach you (to attain Salvation)." (Divya Prabandham 2954)

==Symbolism==

==Significance==

In South Indian art – sculptures, bronzes and paintings – Vishnu's incarnation as Narasimha is one of the most chosen themes and amongst Avatars perhaps next only to Ram and Krishna in popularity.

Lord Narasimha also appears as one of Hanuman's 5 faces, who is a significant character in the Ramayan as Lord Raam's(Rama) devotee.

==Forms of Narasimha==

There are several forms of Narasimha, but nine main ones collectively known as Navanarasimha:
In Ahobila, Andhra Pradesh, the nine forms are as follows:
Forms from Prahlad story:
The following three refer to His ferocious aspect:
Others:

==Early images==

In Andhra Pradesh, a panel dating to third-fourth century AD shows a full theriomorphic squatting lion with two extra human arms behind his shoulders holding Vaishnav emblems. This lion, flanked by five heroes (virs), often has been identified as an early depiction of Narasimha.Abdul Waheed Khan, An Early Sculpture of Narasimha, Andhra Pradesh Government Archaeological Series 16, Hyderabad: Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1964. Standing cult images of Narasimha from the early Gupta period, survive from temples at Tigowa and Eran.Alexander Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Reports IX (1873-75), p.47 These sculptures are two-armed, long maned, frontal, wearing only a lower garment, and with no demon-figure of Hiranyakashipu. Images representing the narrative of Narasimha slaying the demon Hiranyakasipu survive from slightly later Gupta-period temples: one at Madhia and one from a temple-doorway now set into the Kumra-math at Nachna, both dated to the late fifth or early sixth century A.D.Michael W. Meiste, Man and Man-Lion: The Philadelphia Narasiṁha, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 56, No. 3/4 (1996), pp. 291–301
An image of Narasimha supposedly dating to second-third century AD sculpted at Mathura was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art's Indian curator, as "perhaps the earliest image of Narasimha as yet known". This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue similar to later images of Narasimha, but the idol's robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasimha's chest under his upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Visnu's cognizance, the Kaustubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasimha's body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The demon's hair streams behind him, cushioning his head against the man-lion's right knee. He wears a simple single strand of beads. His body seems relaxed, even pliant. His face is calm, with a slight suggestion of a smile. His eyes stare adoringly up at the face of Vishnu. There is little tension in this figure's legs or feet, even as Narasimha gently disembowels him. His innards spill along his right side. As the Matsya purana describes it, Narasimha ripped "apart the mighty Daitya chief as a plaiter of straw mats shreds his reeds". Based on the Gandhara-style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century AD.
Deborah Soifer, a scholar who worked on texts in relation to Narasimha, believes that "the traits basic to Vishnu in the Ved remain central to Vishnu in his avataras" and points out, however, that: "we have virtually no precursors in the Vedic material for the figure of a man-lion, and only one phrase that simply does not rule out the possibility of a violent side to the benign Vishnu". Soifer speaks of "the enigma" of Vishnu's Narasimha avatara and comments that "how the myth arrived at its rudimentary form recorded in the Mahabharata, and where the figure of the man-lion came from remain unsolved mysteries".Soifer, 73
An image of Narasimha, dating to the 9th century, was found on the northern slope of Mount Ijo, at Prambanan, Indonesia.Jan Fontein, et al. (1990). The sculpture of Indonesia, p. 145 Images of Thrivikrama and Varaha avataras were also found at Prambanan, Indonesia. Vishnu and His avatara images follow iconographic peculiarities characteristic of the art of central Java. This includes physiognomy of central Java, an exaggerated volume of garment, and some elaboration of the jewelry. This decorative scheme once formulated became, with very little modification, an accepted norm for sculptures throughout the Central Javanese period (circa 730–930 A.D.). Despite the iconographic peculiarities, the stylistic antecedents of the Java sculptures can be traced back to Indian carvings as the Chalukya and Pallava images of the 6th–7th centuries AD.Debjani Paul (1978) Deity or Deified King? Reflections on a Unique Vaiṣṇavite Sculpture from Java', Artibus Asiae, Vol. 40, No. 4 (1978), pp. 311–333.

==Cultural Tradition of Procession (श्री नृसिंह यात्रा)==

In Rajopadhyaya Brahmins of Nepal, there is a tradition of celebrating the procession ceremony of the deity Narasimha avatar, in Lalitpur district of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. The fifth day of holy Shrawan (श्रावण) month i.e. Shrawan Krishna Panchami of the Hindu Lunar Calendar is marked as auspicious day for the religious procession, Nrisimha Yatr a(नृसिंह यात्रा). This tradition of the holy procession has been held for more than a hundred years. This is one of the typical traditions of the Rajopadhyaya Bramhins, the Hindu Bramhans of the locality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rajopadhyaya.org |title=rajopadhyaya.org |publisher=rajopadhyaya.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl]
In this Nrisimha Yatra (श्री नृसिंह यात्रा), each year one male member of the Rajopadhyaya community gets the chance to be the organizer each year in that particular day. He gets his turn according to the sequence in their record, where the names of Rajopadhyaya bramhins are registered when a bramhan[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rajopadhyaya.org |title=rajopadhyaya.org |publisher=rajopadhyaya.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17[/tpl] lad is eligible to be called as a Bramhan.A person is eligible for all kinds of rituals as a Bramhan only after his Chudakarma is marked.
