==History==

The first hospital opened in 1872 and was a modest cottage hospital which then became the Bute Hospital which opened in 1882, built on land donated by the Marquis of Bute.  In 1902 the site was enlarged to a 40-bed establishment but a few years later there was insufficient space for expansion so it was decided to build another hospital.  Ten acres of land, situated in the English countryside between Luton and Dunstable were purchased from Electrolux and a new hospital was built.  The hospital was opened by Queen Mary on 14 February 1939.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ldh.nhs.uk/Origins_History.htm|title=About Us The Origins and History of the L&D|publisher=Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Trust|accessdate=4 December 2010[/tpl]
