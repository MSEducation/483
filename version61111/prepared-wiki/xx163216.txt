Urban Poor Associates (UPA) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Quezon City, Philippines, registered with the Philippine government. It was established in 1992. Since then it has educated over 285,000 families in housing rights matters and assisted 510 communities in eviction crises. It has helped nearly 51,000 families, to relocate in-city, or at least remain as they were. It has been responsible for almost 600 stories that appeared in the Manila dailies, 150 TV stories, and 850 radio interviews.

==Current problems==

The landless urban poor in Metro Manila number close to 5 million men, women and children (about 800,000 families). Recent studies show average family income per month in the poorer slums is about P6,500.00.
The poor suffer greatly from inflation. In the first four months of 2005 prices of basic foods of the poor rose by 25%-30%. There are indications that the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) of children under five years of age is rising. The IMR is held to be the best indicator of community overall well-being. Jobs are harder to find. The quality of public school education deteriorates.
 
 "Ensuring a suitable home for everyone is demanded by the respect owed to every human being and, therefore is a measure of civilization and the condition of a peaceful fraternal society."
-Pope John Paul II Angelus Address June 16, 1996

"There should be no violence. no one should use violence. There should be no intimidation, no use of arms. we will obey, but we don't want to be forced or subjected to violence. If government evicts it must prepare relocation site. This is what we say, the site is prepared when there are houses, roads, lights, water, schools for the children and travel to work must be easy."
-Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales Homily to the Urban Poor- October 30, 2007 Baseco Manila
