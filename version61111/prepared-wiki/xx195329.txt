==History==

"China" was originally one of the ten songs on Red Rockers' second full-length album, Good as Gold. The single was released by the joint label Columbia/415.
In the wake of 415's deal with Columbia, "Voice of America" was relegated to the B-side of the single, and "China" became the breakout single for the band.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.littlehits.com/archives/2005_12_04_index.html |title=The Red Rockers - Voice of America |author= |year=2005 |work= |publisher=Little Hits.com |accessdate=2010-10-23 [/tpl]
Although the song did not reach the Billboard Top Ten, it had an enduring lifespan. The song's popularity was enhanced by its colorful music video, which was a regular selection on MTV during its early years. The video was filmed in New Orleans, the band's hometown.

==Legacy==

"China" was described by rock critic Ira Robbins as "a startlingly pretty pop song", and it represented a major change in the sound and style of Red Rockers: "Gone was the raging rhetoric, replaced by... articulate, ringing guitars and John Griffith's newly smoothed-up vocals."[tpl]cite book |title=The New Trouser Press Record Guide |editor=Robbins, Ira |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985 |edition=3 |publisher=Collier/Macmillan |location=NY, USA |isbn=0-02-036370-2 |page= |pages=465-456 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
"China" was included on Rhino Records' new wave compilation album series, Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the 80's. In 2000, John Thomas Griffith re-recorded the song with his band Cowboy Mouth for their studio album Easy.
In spite of - or perhaps because of - its amorphous qualities, the song remains an accessible touchstone for American pop cultural references to China more than a quarter of a century after its release.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-daltonbeninato/china-video-for-a-mayor-f_b_213901.html|title=China: Red Rocker Video for a Mayor Out of Quarantine |author= |date=10 June 2009 |work= |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2010-10-23[/tpl]
