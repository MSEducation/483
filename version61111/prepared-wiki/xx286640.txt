He holds the Marcelle and Rolande Gosselin research chair on cognitive neuroscience in autism since 2008. As a clinician, he founded the specialized autism spectrum disorder without mental retardation clinic at the Rivière-des-Prairies Hospital, Montreal, Quebec in 1995, and the pervasive development disorder centre for excellence of Université de Montréal in 2007.
Since 1997, his research has been funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. He has signed some hundred scientific articles about the cognitive neuroscience of autism. His most significant results relate to visual and auditory perception in Savant and non savant autism, investigated by brain imaging and cognitive tasks. The Enhanced Perceptual Functioning model that he developed with the Montreal group is now one of the leading theory for interpreting cognitive and fMRI data in autism. He is also interested in re-examining the role of mental retardation and epilepsy in primary autism, and in the inclusion of autistic researchers in science.
