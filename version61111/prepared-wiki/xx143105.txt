==Education and career==

Alcoff began studying philosophy at Georgia State University, earning a BA with honors in 1980 and an MA in 1983. She did her doctoral work at Brown University; completing her dissertation under the direction of Ernest Sosa, Martha Nussbaum, and Richard Schmitt and receiving her PhD in 1987. She then spent one year as assistant professor of philosophy at Kalamazoo College. She then moved to Syracuse University, where she taught for the next ten years. She was tenured and promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 1995 and to full professor in 1999. She also accepted various visiting positions at Cornell University (1994-1995), Aarhus University in Denmark (November 1999), Florida Atlantic University (Fall 2000), Brown University (Spring 2001).

Alcoff has received a number of honors or awards, including receiving an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo in September 2011, winning the Caribbean Philosophical Association's Frantz Fanon Prize for 2009 for her book Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self, being recognized as a Distinguished Woman in Philosophy by the Society for Women in Philosophy in 2005, and holding the Meredith Professorship for Excellence in Teaching at Syracuse University from 1995-1998, among a number of other awards.

==Research areas and publications==

Alcoff has written widely on subjects including Foucault, sexual violence, the politics of epistemology, gender and race identity, and Latino issues.  She has authored two books - Real Knowing : New Versions of Coherence Theory (1996) and Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self (2009).  She has also edited ten volumes, written a large number of peer-reviewed articles, and contributed a large number of book and encyclopedia chapters and entries.
Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self attempted to offer a unified account of social identity by bridging her previous work in epistemology, metaphysics, and the politics of ethnicity, race, and gender.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sundstrom|first=Ronald|title=Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self (Review)|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Review|accessdate=24 February 2014[/tpl] In it, Alcoff suggested that geographic location has significant implications for social identity above and beyond those conveyed by other contributors to identity (although she does view such implications as deterministic.)
