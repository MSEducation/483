==Portrayal==

Gayatri is typically portrayed as seated on a red lotus, signifying wealth. She appears in either of these forms:
She is an aspect of Mata  Saraswati, Mata Lakshmi & Mata Parvati, all three in one form, a form of Adi Shakti, possessing the Rajasi Guna and hence is the source of Brahma's power. Without her, Brahma remains dormant or unable to create. Its said that if we worship anyone, Gayathri Lakshmi Saraswati Durga or Radha devi it is equal to worshiping all the pancha (5) matha.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
