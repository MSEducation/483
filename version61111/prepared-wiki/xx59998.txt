[[Operation Nachshon]]

CATEGORIES: Battles and operations of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War

Operation Nachshon ([tpl]lang-he|מבצע נחשון[/tpl], Mivtza Nahshon) was a Jewish military operation during the 1948 war. Lasting from 5–20 April 1948, its objective was to break the Siege of Jerusalem by opening the Tel-Aviv - Jerusalem road blockaded by Palestinian Arabs and to supply food and weapons to the isolated Jewish community of Jerusalem.
Nachshon was the first major Haganah operation and the first step of Plan Dalet whose aim was to conquer the area allotted to the Jews by the 1947 UN Partition Plan. The operation was carried out by the Givati and Harel Brigades.

==Background==

By the end of March 1948, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni's troops were preventing supply convoys from reaching Jerusalem. The city was besieged and the Jewish population was forced to adhere to a rationing system. On 31 March a 60 vehicle Jewish convoy was ambushed at Hulda and forced to turn back with the loss of five vehicles and 17 dead.Joseph, Dov. The Faithful City. The Siege of Jerusalem, 1948."  Simon and Schuster, 1960. Congress # 60 10976. Page 98.The Times, 1 & 2 April 1948. Yishuv leader David Ben-Gurion decided to launch Nachshon in order to open up the city and provide supplies to the Jewish residents.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.369 Although initially intended as a one-shot affair, Nachshon later proved to be the first operation in the implementation of Plan Dalet.

==The operation==

The operation was named after the Biblical figure Nachshon Ben Aminadav, who was the first to wade into the Red Sea when the Hebrews escaped from slavery in Egypt. The operation was commanded by Shimon Avidan.
The first orders were given on 2 April 1948.orders to diversion attacks arose on April 2, Including Qastel A telegraph confirming the beginning of the operation, was released on 5 April, with the operation starting that same night. It lasted until 20 April.Benny Morris (2003), p.234. 1,500 men from the Givati and Harel brigades took control of the road to Jerusalem,Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.372 allowing three of four convoys to get to the city.Benny Morris (2003), p.236 speaks of  3 resupply convoys  but Lapierre and Collins (Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.456) speak of a fourth convoy of 300 lorries that left Kfar Biou on the dawn of the 20th April
The operation was a military success. All the Arab villages that blocked the route were either taken or destroyed, and the Jewish forces were victorious in all their engagements. Nonetheless, not all the objectives of the operation were achieved, as only 1,800 tonnes of the 3,000 envisaged were transported to the town, and two months of severe rationing had to be assumed.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.457
Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was killed during the night of 7–8 April, in the middle of the battles taking place in Al-Qastal. The loss of the charismatic Palestinian leader 'disrupted the Arab strategy and organisation in the area of Jerusalem.'Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.455 His successor, Emil Ghuri, changed tactics: instead of provoking a series of ambushes throughout the route, he had a huge road block erected at Bab-el-Oued, and Jerusalem was once again isolated as a consequence.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), p.456
During Operation Nachshon the Haganah wanted to attack the strategic village of Abu Gosh but this was opposed by the Stern Gang whose local commanders were on good terms with the mukhtar.Pappe, Ilan (2006) The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine. Oneworld. ISBN 1-85168-467-0. p.91.

==Aftermath==

Operation Nachshon exposed the poor military organisation of the Palestinian paramilitary groups. Due to lack of logistics, particularly food and ammunition, they were incapable of maintaining engagements that were more than a few hours away from their permanent bases.Yoav Gelber (2006), p.89
Faced with these events, the Arab Higher Committee asked Alan Cunningham to allow the return of the Mufti, the only person capable of redressing the situation. Despite obtaining permission, the Mufti did not get to Jerusalem. His declining prestige cleared the way for the expansion of the influence of the Arab Liberation Army and of Fawzi al-Qawuqji in the Jerusalem area.
Between 15 and 20 April, three convoys, totalling over 700 lorries were able to reach Jewish Jerusalem.Joseph, pages 100,101. The Arabs, however, managed to block the road immediately thereafter.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008), p.121 Operation Nachshon was therefore followed by Operation Harel, and immediately thereafter Operation Yevusi. Further operations in the Jerusalem region, Operation Maccabi and Operation Kilshon, took place in May.
