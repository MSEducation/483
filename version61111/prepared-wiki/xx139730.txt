CATEGORIES: Surnames of Anglo-Saxon origin

Withers (earlier variants Wither, Wyther, Wythers) is an English surname of Anglo-Saxon origin. It is today a not uncommon family name throughout the Anglosphere.

==History==

The family name appears on various early documents such as in a charter of Æthelred II, dated 1005 C.E. where one of the witnesses signs his name as "Ego Wiþer minister" (a thorn used in place of the digraph "th"). In the Domesday Book of 1089 C.E. the name is shown as a tenant prior to that date. In the 11th century, the name showed no prefix, suggesting that it was not derived from a place, as were many names at that time. Rather, the name was apparently personal. The meaning of the name comes mainly from wiþerian (Old English, "rise, oppose, struggle against") and/or wiþere (Old English, "a courageous warrior").[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl] The name can also mean “to withstand” when one combines the meaning of wiþer  with some of its cognates, such as the Proto-Germanic wiþra (“against, toward”), the Low German wedder (“against”), the German wider (“contrary to”) and wieder (“again”), and the Old Norse viðr (“wood”).[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Records of the 11th century indicate the holding of land in many counties of England by persons named Wyther. A continuous record of a Wyther family does not appear until the time of  Henry II (reigned 1154–89 C.E.). This was a Wyther family of County Lancaster (now Lancashire) including Sir Robert Wyther, Knight, of Pendleton Hall, Lancashire, and of Halton, Cheshire. (Sir Robert was a Seneschal to Roger de Lucy, Constable of Chester (1179–89 C.E.)). He married Joan, daughter of Sir Adam de Bostock, Knight, of Davenham, County Chester (now Cheshire).
By the 15th century, Wyther families descended from Sir Robert Wyther were living in Cheshire, Lancaster, Wiltshire, Essex, London, Somersetshire, and Hampshire Counties. (For the Hampshire County branch, see Berry's Hampshire County Genealogy.)
