==History==

The founder of Geez magazine, Aiden Enns, originally had the idea of the magazine in 2003 while he was working as managing editor at Adbusters in Vancouver. Enns then moved to Winnipeg and recruited writer and activist Will Braun who came on board as co-editor and co-publisher.
The first issue of Geez was published in Fall 2005 with an initial 500 paying subscribers and no advertising revenue. In the first year, the number of subscribers climbed to 2,000.
In 2009, Geez moved its hub from Enns' home to a community-minded church in Winnipeg's inner-city (Knox United Church).
In 2010, Geez celebrated its 5th anniversary. At the time, Darin Barney, the Canadian Research Chair in Technology and Citizenship said, Geez is one of the "smartest kind of progressive, critical, lefty magazines."Toronto Star, January 2011, Leslie Scrivener http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/01/07/a_faith_magazine_for_the_unchurchable.html
From the beginning, the aim of Geez was to "put the 'geez' into Jesus."January 2005, Gloria Kim http://www.macleans.ca/culture/media/article.jsp?content=20060109_118916_118916 A religious magazine for a new generation of Christians and post-Christians, the up-and-coming magazine wanted a short, provocative name that risked offending more conservative readers. Some consider the name blasphemous because it's an expletive derived from the name of Jesus.Times, July 2009, Julia Duin http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/05/duin-magazine-takes-soft-sell-approach/?page=all
