"Put on Your Red Dress" is a single by British musician Martin Page. It was the third and final single released on the album. There was no music video made to accompany the song, however, a radio edit was made.
The single is generally looked as an attempt to gain international sales, particularly in Germany. Martin Page's first single, "In the House of Stone and Light", was the b-side to the single, and slightly increased the popularity of the song in 1995.
This is considered to be Page's last single, as the songs released on his second album, released on his own record label, were not made into singles.
As stated by Page in the album EPK,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUOKL5qpPA "The song Put on Your Red Dress is a romantic song, about basically saying we've been through some ups and downs, but I'm going to come to your house, knock on your door, we're going to walk down to the docks, and we're going to forget about our problems."
