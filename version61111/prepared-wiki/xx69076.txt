===Cosmological implications===

Theory[tpl]which|date=December 2013[/tpl] suggests that axions were created abundantly during the Big Bang. Because of a unique coupling to the instanton field of the primordial universe (the "misalignment mechanism"), an effective dynamical friction is created during the acquisition of mass following cosmic inflation. This robs all such primordial axions of their kinetic energy.
If axions have low mass, thus preventing other decay modes, axion theories predict that the universe would be filled with a very cold Bose–Einstein condensate of primordial axions.  Hence, depending on their mass, axions could plausibly explain the dark matter problem of physical cosmology.P. Sikivie,Dark matter axions,arXiv. Observational studies to detect dark matter axions are underway, but they are not yet sufficiently sensitive to probe the mass regions where axions would be expected to be found if they are the solution to the dark matter problem. High mass axions of the kind searched for by Jain and Singh (2007)P. L. Jain, G. Singh,  Search for new particles decaying into electron pairs of mass below 100 MeV/c2, J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys., 34, 129–138, (2007); [tpl]doi|10.1088/0954-3899/34/1/009[/tpl], (possible early evidence of 7±1 and 19±1 MeV axions of less than 10−13 s lifetime). would not persist in the modern universe and could not contribute to dark matter.
Low mass axions could have additional structure at the galactic scale. As they continuously fell into a galaxy from the intergalactic medium, they would be denser in "caustic" rings, just as the stream of water in a continuously-flowing fountain is thicker at its peak.P. Sikivie, "Dark matter axions and caustic rings" The gravitational effects of these rings on galactic structure and rotation might then be observable.P. Sikivie (personal website):  pictures of alleged triangular structure in Milky Way; hypothetical flow diagram which could give rise to such a structure. Other cold dark matter theoretical candidates, such as WIMPs and MACHOs, could also form such rings, but, because such candidate particles or objects are fermionic and thus experience friction and/or scattering among themselves, the rings would be less pronounced than with bosons such as the axion.
Axions, if they exist, would also have stopped most interaction with normal matter at a different moment in the big bang than other more massive particles hypothesized for dark matter. The lingering effects of this difference could perhaps be calculated and observed astronomically.
