Évelyne Thomas (born January 10, 1964) is the hostess of the French talk show C'est mon choix (It's my choice)."Chat show host is France's new Marianne", BBC News, 17 October 2003
In 2003 she was controversially chosen as the new Marianne. The town mayors who elect her went for a populist choice, which was at odds with the views of the Parisian intelligentsia. This was compounded by her stating that, while she was in favour of liberty and fraternity, she opposed equality, which implied making everyone the same. See Liberté, égalité, fraternité.
