==Early life==

She was the eldest of seven children most of whom drew, sang, wrote stories and poems.Audur H. Winnan, Wanda Gág, Smithsonian Institute Press, 1993, p. 2 While still a young teen Gág's illustrated story Robby Bobby in Mother Goose Land was  published in The Minneapolis Journal  in their Junior Journal supplement.Richard W. Cox, Minnesota History, Fall 1974, p. 250 When Gág was fifteen her father died of tuberculosis. Her father's final words to her were: "Was der Papa nicht thun konnt', muss die Wanda halt fertig machen." (What Papa couldn't do, Wanda will have to finish.)Gág, p. xxxi Following her father's death, the Gag family was on welfare, and many people suggested that Wanda get a steady job.  She remained in school, however, graduating in June 1912 and then teaching country school in Springfield, Minnesota from November 1912 to June 1913.Winnan, p. 89 In spite of these setbacks, she was determined to become an artist.

==Art school==

From 1913 to 1914, Gág attended The Saint Paul School of Art. From 1914 to 1917 she attended The Minneapolis School of Art under the patronage of Herschel V. Jones.Gág, p. 314  It was there where she met Adolf Dehn who would become her lover for a time and remained a lifelong friend.Wanda Gág Papers, 1892-1968  In 1917, she won a scholarship to the Art Students League of New YorkGág, p.  459 as well as her first book commission, illustrating A Child’s Book of Folk-Lore— Mechanics of Written English by Jean Sherwood Rankin.Gág, p.  466

==New York==

In 1917, Gág moved to Greenwich Village.  At the Art Students League she took classes in composition, etching and advertising illustration. By 1919 she was earning a living as a commercial illustrator. Around this time she added an accent mark in her last name to aid in proper pronunciation (her last name rhymes with "log", not "wag".)Karen Nelson Hoyle Wanda Gág, a Life of Art and Stories pp. 8-10, University of Minnesota Press, 2009  In 1921 she became a partner in a  business venture called "Happiwork Story Boxes", boxes decorated with story panels in the sides. This business, along with other ventures, failed.Hoyle, pp. 10-13 An illustration of Gág's  was published in Broom: An International Magazine of the ArtsHarold A. Loeb, New York, 1921, vol. II, no. 2 in 1921. Her art exhibition in the New York Public Library in 1923 was Gág's first solo show.Winnan, p. 13 She continued exploring artistic projects, publishing a magazine with artist William Gropper titled Folio, it lasted one issue.Hoyle, p. 13 Her one-woman-show in New York's Weyhe Gallery in 1926 led to her recognition as "one of America's most promising young graphic artists" and was the start of a lifelong relationship with Carl Zigrosser, its manager.Julie L'Enfant, The Gág Family, Afton Historical Society Press, 2002, p.123The New Yorker: November 13, 1926, p. 90  Gág continued to create numerous lithographs, wood engravings, water colors and drawings. In 1927 her article These Modern Women: A Hotbed of Feminists was published in The Nation, drawing the attention of Alfred Stieglitz and prompting Egmont Arens to write: "Be more explicit about your relationships with men. The way you solved that problem seems to me to be the most illuminating part of your career. You have done what all the other 'modern women' are still talking about."Winnan, p. 36, 71L'Enfant, p.130 Gág illustrated the March 1927 cover of the leftist magazine The New Masses.Andrew Hemingway, Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement 1926-1956, 2002 Her illustrated story Bunny's Easter Egg was published in John Martin's Book magazine for children in 1927.John Martin's House: New York, vol. XXXV, issue no. 4 A review of a 1929 show with Peggy Bacon at New York City's Downtown Gallery stated: "Wanda Gag's imagination leaps out from dusky shadows and terrifies with light, an emotional source difficult to analyze…"New York Times, December 15, 1929. Her work was recognized internationally, including inclusion in the American Institute of Graphic Arts Fifty Prints of the Year in 1928, 1929, 1931, 1932, 1936, 1937 and 1938.Winnan,  pp. 72-76 Gág's work continued to be shown in New York including The Museum of Modern Art 1939 exhibition Art in Our Time as well as the 1939 New York World's Fair American Art Today show.L'Enfant, p.156

==Books for children==

Gág's work interested Ernestine Evans, director of Coward-McCann's new children's book division. Evans disliked the common children's books of the day, and was looking for new authors and artists to create more realistic, less idealized books. She wanted Gág to illustrate a new edition of an older book, but Gág refused, saying "I am simply not interested in illustration as such... It has to be a story that takes hold of me way down deep".Cech, John (editor), Dictionary of Literary Biographies: American Writers for Children, 1900-1960, Gale Research, 1983, vol. 22, p. 184 Evans asked her to submit her own story with illustrations. Millions of Cats appeared in 1928. It won the Newbery Honor award, a rare achievement for a picture book.[tpl]cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=2012-05-15[/tpl]  Gág carefully oversaw every aspect of the production of this book. When a second printing was made from inferior copies because the originals had been lost, Gág was unhappy with the results and redrew the missing pieces.Cech, p. 185 There was a movement among educators at the time against fairy tales. Some educators disparaged fairy tales, preferring more realistic literature for children.Hoyle, p. 59 Gág disagreed. "I know I should feel bitterly cheated if, as a child, I had been deprived of all fairy lore..."Cech, p. 187 To encourage the use of these stories, Gág published Tales from Grimm in 1936. Two years later she translated and illustrated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as a reaction against the "trivialized, sterilized, and sentimentalized" Disney movie version.Silvey, Anita, The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators, Houghton Mifflin, 2002, p. 171 Her essay I Like Fairy Tales was published in the March 1939 issue of The Horn Book Magazine.  Nothing at All became a Caldecott Honor book for 1942. More Tales from Grimm appeared posthumously in 1947, four of her translated fairy tales were later released individually with new illustrations by Margot Tomes.

==Family and domestic life==

Gág liked to live and work in the country.  In the early 1920s she would spend her summers drawing at various locations in rural New England, New York and Connecticut. She rented a three acre farm in Glen Gardner New Jersey from 1925 to 1930 ("Tumble Timbers") and purchased a larger farm ("All Creation") in Milford, New Jersey in 1931.Winnan, pp. 71-73 She continued to support some of her adult siblings, some of whom lived with her from time to time. Gág's brother Howard Gág did the hand lettering for her picture books and Wanda also encouraged her sister, Flavia Gág, to write children's books.New Ulm Journal,  July 29, 2010 On August 27, 1943 Gág married her long-time paramour and business manager Earle Humphrey.Winnan, p. 61 Gág developed lung cancer and died in New York City June 27, 1946.
