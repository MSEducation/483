==Trademarks==

The USPTO examines applications for trademark registration. If approved, the trademarks are registered on either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register, depending upon whether the mark meets the appropriate distinctiveness criteria. However, this function is declining in popularity as trademark applicants move to cheaper, more straightforward state-by-state registrations.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl][ref]

==Representation==

The PTO only allows certain qualified persons to practice before the PTO. Practice includes filing of patent applications on behalf of inventors, prosecuting patent applications on behalf of inventors, and participating in administrative appeals and other proceedings before the PTO examiners and boards. The PTO sets its own standards for who may practice and requires that any person who practices become registered.  A patent agent is a person who has passed the USPTO registration examination (the "patent bar") but has not passed any state bar exam to become a licensed attorney; a patent attorney is a person who has passed both a state bar and the patent bar and is in good standing as an attorney.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/attorney.htm |title=General Information Concerning Patents: Attorneys and Agents |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date= |accessdate=2010-01-29[/tpl]  A patent agent can only act in a representative capacity in patent matters presented to the USPTO, and may not represent a patent holder or applicant in a court of law.  To be eligible for taking the patent bar exam, a candidate must possess a degree in "engineering or physical science or the equivalent of such a degree".
The United States allows any citizen from any country to sit for the patent bar (if he/she has the requisite technical background).Code of Federal Regulations, Title 37, Chapter I, Part 11, Section 11.7 Only Canada has a reciprocity agreement with the United States that confers upon a patent agent similar rights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/foia/oed/legal/legal11.pdf |title=Decision on Petition Under 37 C.F.R. § 10.2(c) |format=PDF |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=2010-01-29[/tpl]
An unrepresented inventor may file a patent application and prosecute it on his or her own behalf (pro se). If it appears to a patent examiner that an inventor filing a pro se application is not familiar with the proper procedures of the Patent Office, the examiner may suggest that the filing party obtain representation by a registered patent attorney or patent agent.Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, Chapter 400  The patent examiner cannot recommend a specific attorney or agent, but the Patent Office does post a list of those who are registered.[tpl]cite web|url=https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/ |title=Patent Attorney/Agent Search |publisher=Office of Enrollment and Discipline, United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl]
While the inventor of a relatively simple-to-describe invention may well be able to produce an adequate specification and detailed drawings, there remains language complexity in what is claimed, either in the particular claim language of a utility application, or in the manner in which drawings are presented in a design application. There is also skill required when searching for prior art that is used to support the application and to prevent applying for a patent for something that may be unpatentable. A patent examiner will make special efforts to help pro se inventors understand the process but the failure to adequately understand or respond to an Office action from the USPTO can endanger the inventor's rights, and may lead to abandonment of the application.

==Electronic filing system==

The USPTO accepts patent applications filed in electronic form. Inventors or their patent agents/attorneys can file applications as Adobe PDF documents. Filing fees can be paid by credit card or by a USPTO "deposit account".

==Patent search tools==

The USPTO web site provides free electronic copies of issued patents and patent applications as multiple-page TIFF (graphic) documents. The site also provides Boolean search and analysis tools.Nowotarski, Mark, “Searching the USPTO patent database”, Insurance IP Bulletin, February 2012
The USPTO's free distribution service only distributes the patent documents as a set of TIFF files.Patent Full-Page Images  Numerous free and commercial services provide patent documents in other formats, such as Adobe PDF and CPC.

==Criticisms==

The USPTO has been criticized for granting patents for impossible or absurd, already known, or arguably obvious inventions.Philip E. Ross, Patently Absurd, Forbes.com, May 29, 2000.

===Slow patent examination and backlog===

The USPTO has been criticized for taking an inordinate amount of time in examining patent applications. This is particularly true in the fast-growing area[tpl]Update after|2010|11|16[/tpl] of business method patents.  As of 2005, patent examiners in the business method area were still examining patent applications filed in 2001.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
The delay was attributed by spokesmen for the Patent Office to a combination of a sudden increase in business method patent filings after the 1998 State Street Bank decision, the unfamiliarity of patent examiners with the business and financial arts (e.g., banking, insurance, stock trading etc.), and the issuance of a number of controversial patents (e.g., [tpl]US patent|5,960,411[/tpl] "Amazon one click patent") in the business method area.
Effective August 2006, the USPTO introduced an accelerated patent examination procedure in an effort to allow inventors a speedy evaluation of an application with a final disposition within twelve months. The procedure requires additional information to be submitted with the application and also includes an interview with the examiner.USPTO Accelerated Patent Examination The first accelerated patent was granted on March 15, 2007, with a six-month issuance time.USPTO grants first patent under accelerated review option Press Release
As of the end of 2008, there were 1,208,076 patent applications pending at the Patent Office.  At the end of 1997, the number of applications pending was 275,295. Therefore, over those eleven years there was a 439% increase in the number of pending applications.Gene Quinn, How to Fix the USPTO, IPWatchdog, November 21, 2008. Consulted on December 6, 2008.
December 2012 data showed that there was 597,579 unexamined patent application backlog.http://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/patents/main.dashxml December 2012 Patents Data During the four years since 2009, more than 50% reduction was achieved. First action pendency was reported as 19.2 months.
