[[Political officer (British Empire)]]

CATEGORIES: British colonial political officers, Ambassadors of the United Kingdom, Administrators in British India

In the British Empire, a political officer or political agent was an officer of the imperial civil administration, as opposed to the military administration, usually operating outside imperial territory.  The title was particularly attached to a government official acting as a political adviser to the ruler of one of the princely states in pre-independence South Asia, though it could also designate a kind of special envoy or ambassador (e.g. "Political Officer to Afghanistan").
