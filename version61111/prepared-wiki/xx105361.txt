==Biography==

===Early life===

Kane was born in Brooklyn, New York to Jewish parents as Larry Kanowitz. His parents changed the name years before his broadcasting career. Kane's father was an electrical contractor. His mother, Mildred Kane, fought multiple sclerosis for 14 years before her death at age 40. His work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society began because of his mother's involvement with the disease. He began his career in broadcast journalism in Miami, Florida at age 16, first at WQAM and later at WAME and WFUN. While working at WAME, Kane became the first U.S. news correspondent to break the story of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961.

===Career in Philadelphia===

In 1965, he came to Philadelphia as an anchor for WFIL Radio and as main anchor for its sister station WFIL-TV, Philadelphia's ABC affiliate. Kane was hired as the primary anchor for the (then new) Action News format. WFIL-TV would change its call letters to WPVI-TV in 1971 after Capital Cities Communications purchased the station from Triangle Publications. Kane is credited with coining the phrase "The Big Story" at the top of Action News, something WPVI uses to this day.
Kane was also was an anchor on New York's WABC-TV's Eyewitness News for one year from 1977 to 1978. During his time in New York, Kane also anchored news updates for ABC News.
He returned to Philadelphia in 1980 and joined WCAU-TV, then a CBS-owned station, as the primary anchor of Channel 10 News at 6 P.M. and 11 P.M. In 1993 he moved to KYW-TV, an NBC affiliate which became the new CBS station in Philadelphia in 1995. He also hosted a short-time weekly program produced by KYW-TV called The Bulletin with Larry Kane (not to be confused with the defunct Philadelphia Evening Bulletin newspaper). Kane anchored the 6 P.M. and 11 P.M. newscasts at KYW until December 23, 2002.
Kane covered local Philadelphia politics through hosting several public affairs programs. Kane was anchor at WCAU while Jay Feldman was GM and journalistic sources thought reliable tipped erroneously that Philadelphia mayor William J. Green was subject of federal investigation for improprieties. The story was later retracted, and Green sued CBS.
In 1994, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Kane into their Hall of Fame. On November 22, 2002, The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia presented him with their "Person of the Year" award, their highest honor.
