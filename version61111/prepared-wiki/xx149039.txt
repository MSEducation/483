==History==

The town was founded in 1910 with a land ballot that attracted a group of settlers from England. With little access to water, early settlers struggled to maintain a living from the land. The coming of the railway in 1923 Red Soil, Wattle and Crows Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February, 1976 pp21-39 eased some of the early hardships.  The construction of the South Burnett Dairy Co-operative Butter Factory in 1934 led to even more growth.Proston - Queensland. The Age. Retrieved on 10 August 2011.
The closure of the railway line and Butter Factory in the 1970s threw the area into a long period of slow decline.
The creation of the nearby Boondooma Dam in the 1970s by daming the Boyne River provided a source of water for Tarong Power Station and solved Proston's water problems.
