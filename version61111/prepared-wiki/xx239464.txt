McLaren–Greater Lansing (then Ingham Regional Medical Center) participated in a pilot study of a bundled payment scheme between 1987 and 1989 which involved an orthopedic surgeon and a health maintenance organization (HMO).[tpl]Cite journal | author = Johnson LL, Becker RL | title = An alternative health-care reimbursement system -- application of arthroscopy and financial warranty: results of a 2-year pilot study | journal = Arthroscopy | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 462–70; discussion 471–2 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.1016/S0749-8063(05)80200-2 | url = http://www.arthroscopyjournal.org/article/S0749-8063%2805%2980200-2/abstract | PMID = 7945644 [/tpl] The surgeon and IRMC received a predetermined fee for any arthroscopic surgery performed, but they also provided a two-year warranty in that they promised to cover any post-surgery expenses instead of the HMO. The pilot study, in which "all parties benefitted financially," is cited as an example of a successful outcome with bundled payments.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Miller HD | title = From volume to value: better ways to pay for health care | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 1418–28 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.28.5.1418 | url = http://healthaff.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/28/5/1418 | PMID = 19738259 [/tpl]
