The New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) is a 12-team collegiate summer baseball league founded in 1993 and sanctioned by the NCAA and Major League Baseball.  Each NECBL team plays an eight-week, 44-game schedule during June and July, with a playoff in early August.  Like the Cape Cod Baseball League and other amateur leagues, the NECBL is a showcase for top college-level players, giving professional baseball scouts a chance to see prospective pros playing against each other.  Along with the Cape Cod Baseball League, Northwoods League, and Coastal Plain League, it is considered one of the top summer leagues in the country and is a part of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball.

Overall, the NECBL, Jayhawk, and Northwoods leagues look good, but if you pay less attention to the D1% column (which may be reasonable, given the strength of the California JC ranks, for example), the California and West Coast leagues may join them.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=2012 Baseball Season Preview Part 1: Q&A with Head Coach Brett Boretti|url=http://www.gocolumbialions.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9600&ATCLID=205385461|work=GoColumbiaLions.com|publisher=Columbia University Athletics|accessdate=March 4, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65uxS1Qkz|archivedate=March 4, 2012|date=February 23, 2012[/tpl]

==Season structure==

For the current season, the league is divided into two six-team divisions, the North Division and the South Division.  During the regular season, teams play in-division opponents a total of six times, three games at home and three away.  Teams play out-of-division opponents twice, one game at home and one away.  These games make up the 42 game regular season schedule.  When doubleheaders are scheduled due to inclement weather, NECBL rules dictate that they are two seven-inning games.  NECBL regular season games have 2 umpires, while All-Star and playoff games have 3 or 4 umpires.  The top four teams from each division qualify for the playoffs.  In the division semifinal round the first seeds play the fourth seeds and the second seeds play the third seeds, respectively, in best-of-three series.  The winners of the division semifinals advance to the division finals, where they play a best-of-three series against their fellow division finalist.  The division champions advance to the NECBL championship series, where they face each other in a best-of-three series to decide the NECBL champion.

==Past champions==

In the NECBL's history, the most successful team is the Newport Gulls, with five league championships and nine championship series appearances.  The defunct North Shore Navigators franchise had four league titles.  The Keene Swamp Bats have three.  Three franchises have won two championships, the Sanford Mainers, the Vermont Mountaineers, and the defunct Central Mass Collegians.  The Mystic Schooners have won one championship, when the team was known as the Eastern Tides in the league's inaugural 1994 season.NECBL Record Book[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] at necbl.com, URL accessed July 22, 2009
