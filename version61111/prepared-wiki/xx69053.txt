Naomi Ellen Watts (born 28 September 1968) is a British-Australian actress and film producer.[tpl]cite web |title=Watts' Nationality Confusion |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/watts.-nationality-confusion |date=23 January 2004 |work=Contact Music |quote=I'm both Australian and English – but I have a British passport.[/tpl] She began her career in Australia, making her screen debut in the drama film For Love Alone (1986) and then appeared in the television series Hey Dad..! (1990), Brides of Christ (1991) and Home and Away (1991) and alongside Nicole Kidman and Thandie Newton in the coming-of-age comedy-drama film Flirting (1991). After moving to America, Watts appeared in films, including Tank Girl (1995), Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering (1996) and Dangerous Beauty (1998) and had the lead role in the television series Sleepwalkers (1997–1998).
After years as a struggling actress, Watts gained critical acclaim for her work in David Lynch's psychological thriller Mulholland Drive (2001). The following year, she received public recognition for her role in the box office hit horror film The Ring (2002). She then received nominations for the Academy Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Cristina Peck in Alejandro González Iñárritu's neo-noir 21 Grams (2003). Her subsequent films include David O. Russell's comedy I Heart Huckabees (2004), the 2005 remake of King Kong, the crime-thriller Eastern Promises (2007) and the thriller The International (2009). Since then, Watts has portrayed Valerie Plame Wilson in the biographical drama Fair Game (2010) and Helen Gandy in Clint Eastwood's biographical drama J. Edgar (2011). For her leading role as Maria Bennett in the disaster film The Impossible (2012), she received second nominations for the Academy Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.
In 2002, Watts was included in People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People. In 2006, she became a goodwill ambassador for Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, which helps to raise awareness of AIDS-related issues. She has participated in several fundraisers for the cause, and she is presented as an inaugural member of AIDS Red Ribbon Awards.

==Early life==

Watts was born in Shoreham, Kent, England.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3671818/Naomi-Watts-on-Funny-Games.html |title=Naomi Watts on Funny Games |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |first=Sheila |last=Johnston |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2013[/tpl] She is the daughter of Myfanwy Edwards (née Roberts), a Welsh antiques dealer and costume and set designer,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=eSoTToyWJ8W3twerg5yADg&ct=result&id=FORkAAAAMAAJ&dq=naomi+watts+antiques+dealer+costume&q=antiques+dealer+costume#search_anchor|title=Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television: A Biographical Guide Featuring Performers, Directors, Writers, Producers, Designers, Managers, Choreographers, Technicians, Composers, Executives, Dancers|publisher=Gale / Cengage Learning|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7876-9037-3|page=340[/tpl] and Peter Watts, an English road manager and sound engineer who worked with Pink Floyd.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/22/1077384633676.html|title=How Naomi told her mum about Oscar|accessdate=15 December 2008|author=Sams, Christine|date=23 February 2004|work=The Sun-Herald[/tpl]Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2003 Her parents divorced when she was four years old.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2003/11/23/naomi_watts/|title=A role filled with rage and anguish reveals the fearless side of an actress who respects the power of emotion|work=Boston Globe |first=Scott|last=Heller|date=23 November 2003|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] After the divorce, Watts and her elder brother, Ben Watts, moved several times across South East England with their mother. Peter Watts left Pink Floyd in 1974, and he and Myfanwy were later reconciled. Two years later, in August 1976, he was found dead in a flat in Notting Hill, of an apparent heroin overdose.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/naomi-watts/biography/157|title=Naomi Watts Biography|work=TalkTalk|publisher=Tiscali UK Limited trading|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| publisher = Di Capo Press| isbn = 978-0306817526| page = 213| last = Blake| first = Mark| title = Comfortably Numb - The Inside Story of Pink Floyd| year = 2008[/tpl]
Following his death, Watts' mother moved the family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni, on Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' maternal grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years, while Myfanwy moved between there and London in search of a career. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni, where she carried out her studies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northwest/halloffame/showbiz/naomiwatts.shtml|title=Naomi Watts|work=BBC North West Wales|publisher=BBC|date=November 2009|first=Graham|last=Fuller|work=Interview|publisher=Brandt Publications|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] She later said of her time in Wales: "We took Welsh lessons in a school in the middle of nowhere while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, my being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/09/15/naomi_watts_le_divorce_interview.shtml|title=Naomi Watts|work=BBC|accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl] and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk where she attended Thomas Mills High School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/oct/19/londonfilmfestival2007.londonfilmfestival|title='Work begets work: that is my motto'|work=The Guardian|date=19 October 2007|first=Emma|last=Brockes|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/naomi_watts|title=Naomi Watts|work=People|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl]
In 1982, when Watts was 14, she moved to Sydney, New South Wales in Australia (her maternal grandmother was Australian) with her mother, brother and stepfather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/naomi-watts.html|title=Naomi Watts Biography|work=The Biography Channel UK|publisher=A&E Television Networks|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] Myfanwy established a career in the burgeoning film business, working as a stylist for television commercials, then turning to costume design, ultimately working for the soap opera Return to Eden. After emigrating, Watts was enrolled in acting lessons by her mother, where she met and befriended actress Nicole Kidman. She also auditioned for and starred in numerous television advertisements.
In Australia, Watts attended Mosman High School and North Sydney Girls High School.[tpl]cite news|url=http://mosman-daily.whereilive.com.au/news/story/lower-north-shores-top-aussie-legends/|title=Lower North Shore's top Aussie legends|date=21 January 2010|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=The Mosman Daily|publisher=News Community Media[/tpl] She failed to graduate from school, afterwards working as a papergirl, a negative cutter, and managing a Delicacies store in Sydney's affluent North Shore. She decided to become a model when she was 18. She signed with a models agency that sent her to Japan, but after several failed auditions, she returned to Sydney. There, she was hired to work in advertising for a department store, that exposed her to the attention of Follow Me, a magazine which hired her as an assistant fashion editor. A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop returned Watts to acting, and prompted her to quit her job and to seek success as an actress.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.lynchnet.com/mdrive/wattsint.html |title = For Anyone who Ever Needed a reminder of what can happen when you hold onto your dreams— here she is |accessdate =31 August 2010 |last=Sischy|first=Ingrid |date =December 2003|work=Interview|publisher=Brandt Publications[/tpl] Watts obtained her first role in the 1986 drama film For Love Alone, based on the novel of the same name by Christina Stead, and produced by Margaret Fink. Her mother was a set dresser on this production.
Regarding her nationality, Watts has stated: "I consider myself British and have very happy memories of the UK. I spent the first 14 years of my life in England and Wales and never wanted to leave. When I was in Australia I went back to England a lot."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21607413-5006002,00.html|title=Watts turns back on Australia|accessdate=15 December 2008|date=24 April 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl] She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: "I consider myself very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is home, I say Australia, because those are my most powerful memories."[tpl]cite video|people=Aspen, Richard (Interviewer); Watts, Naomi (Interviewee)|date=11 September 2007|title=Eastern Promises Interview|work=Sunrise[/tpl]

==Career==

===1986–1992: Early work===

Watts' career began in television, where she made brief appearances in commercials. The 1986 film For Love Alone, set in the 1930s and based on Christina Stead's 1945 best-selling novel of the same name, marked her debut in film.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/18132/For-Love-Alone/overview|title=For Love Alone (1986) Overview|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] She then appeared in two episodes of the fourth season of the Australian sitcom Hey Dad..! in 1990. After a five-year absence from films, Watts met director John Duigan during the 1989 premiere of her friend Nicole Kidman's film Dead Calm and he invited her to take a supporting role in his 1991 indie film Flirting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iofilm.co.uk/feats/interviews/n/naomi_watts_divorce.shtml |title=Naomi enjoys her shot|publisher=Iofilm.co.uk|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] She starred opposite future Hollywood up-and-comers Kidman and Thandie Newton. The film received critical acclaim and was featured on Roger Ebert's list of the 10 best films of 1992.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921231/COMMENTARY/40308026/1023|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=The Best 10 Movies of 1992 |work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group|date=31 December 1992|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] Also in 1991, she took the part of Frances Heffernan, a girl who struggles to find friends behind the walls of a Sydney Catholic school,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/brides-of-christ/episodes.html|title=Brides of Christ: episode guide|work=Australian Television Information Archive's Official Site|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] in the award winning mini-series Brides of Christ[tpl]cite web|url=http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=721188|title=Brides of Christ description on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's shop|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] and had a recurring role in the soap opera Home and Away as the handicapped Julie Gibson.[tpl]cite news|last=Kent|first=Melissa|work=The Age |location=Australia|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/cast-and-fans-of-home-and-away-well-on-the-way-to-belonging-foreverand-ever/2009/02/07/1233423560588.html|title=Cast and fans of Home and Away well on the way to belonging forever and ever|date=8 February 2009|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl] Watts was then offered a role in the drama series A Country Practice but turned it down, not wanting to "get stuck on a soap for two or three years", a decision she later called "naïve".

===1993–2000: Move to America, career struggles===

Watts then took a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being introduced to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts decided to move to America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts.
Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole Kidman, who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.davidlynch.de/wattssunday.html|title=Film: Naomi Watts interview|work=The Sunday Times|first=Garth|last=Pearce|date=6 January 2002|accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl]
She then won a supporting role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of "Jet Girl" after nine auditions. While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it has gone on to become something of a cult classic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tank_girl/|title=Tank Girl (1995) on Rotten Tomatoes|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/naomi-watts/bio/167538|title=Naomi Watts: Biography|work=TV Guide|publisher=TV Guide Online Holdings LLC|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: "there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I was at the end of my rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/late-bloomer_4/|title=Late Bloomer|work=Backstage.com|date=24 November 2003 |first=Cassie |last=Carpenter |accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eofftv.com/kim_newman_archive/b/bermuda_triangle_1996_review.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle (1996)|work=Encyclopedia of fantastic Film and Television|publisher=Kim Newman|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl] and as the lead role in Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering, in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.
In 1997, she starred in the Australian ensemble romantic drama Under the Lighthouse Dancing and also played the lead role in the short-lived television series Sleepwalkers. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for Babe: Pig in the City. She said in an interview in 2012, "That really should not be on my résumé! I think that was early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my résumé. I came in and did a couple days' work of voiceovers and we had to suck on helium and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I'm sure you would never be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn't either!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/naomi-watts-on-the-impossible-controversy.html|title=Naomi Watts on The Impossible and Her Weirdest Film Credit|work=Vulture.com|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl]
In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/strange-planet-v181000|title=Strange Planet (1999) |work=AllRovi|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/the-hunt-for-the-unicorn-killer-v180100|title=The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer (1999)|work=AllRovi|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl] In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.
Much of her early career is filled with near misses in casting, as she was up for significant roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-Ra-Z/Watts-Naomi.html|title=Naomi Watts: Biography|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=6 July 2011[/tpl] In an interview in 2012, Watts said, "I came to New York and auditioned at least five times for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/21/naomi-watts-on-the-impossible-personal-tragedy-and-playing-princess-diana.html|title=Naomi Watts on ‘The Impossible,’ Personal Tragedy, and Playing Princess Diana|work=The Daily Beast|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=14 March 2013[/tpl] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit."

===2001–2004: Breakthrough===

Naomi Watts studied the Meisner Technique.
In 1999, director David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts after looking at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work,[tpl]cite journal|title=Twin Piques|first=Anna|last=David|date=November 2001|work=Premiere Magazine|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|pages=80–81|volume=15|issue=3[/tpl] and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package."[tpl]cite journal|title=It's a Road She Knows Well; 'Mulholland Dr.' star Naomi Watts has lived the Hollywood metaphor behind the fabled highway|first=Scarlet|last=Cheng|date=12 October 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/12/entertainment/ca-56239|accessdate=7 July 2011|page=20[/tpl] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution. The film, which also starred Laura Harring and Justin Theroux, was highly acclaimed by critics and would become Watts' breakthrough. She was praised by critics, including Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian, who said, "Watts's face metamorphoses miraculously from fresh-faced beauty to a frenzied, teary scowl of ugliness."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/jan/04/1 |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |title=Mulholland Drive review|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=4 Friday 2002|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] and Emanuel Levy, who wrote, "...Naomi Watts, in a brilliant performance, a young, wide-eyed and grotesquely cheerful blonde, full of high hopes to make it big in Hollywood."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/mulholland-drive-3/|first=Emanuel|last=Levy|title=Mulholland Drive review by Emanuel Levy|work=Emanuel Levy|publisher=Emanuel Levy's Official Site|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] The film premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and received a large number of awards and nominations, including the Best Actress Award for Watts from the National Society of Film Critics and a nomination for Best Actress from the American Film Institute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/mulholland-dr-v246240|title=Mulholland Dr. (2001) Awards|work=AllRovi|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] The surrealist film following the story of the aspiring actress Betty Elms, played by Watts, attracted controversy with its strong lesbian theme.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2001/10/05/2001-10-05_dangerous_curves_on_lynch_s_.html|first=Jami|last=Bernard|title=Dangerous curves on Lynch's 'Drive'|work=Daily News|publisher=Daily News, L.P.|date=10 April 2001|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/23/1027332361018.html|first=Red|last=Symons|title=Man in spirit-led, Mulholland-riddle miracle!|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=6 July 2002|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl]
Also in 2001, she starred in two short films, Never Date an Actress and Ellie Parker, and the horror film Down, director Dick Maas' remake of his 1983 film De Lift. In 2002, she starred in one of the biggest box office hits of that year, The Ring, the English language remake of the Japanese horror film Ringu. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film, which also starred Martin Henderson and Brian Cox, received favourable reviews and grossed around US$129 million domestically (equivalent to US$[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|129|2002|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million in [tpl]Currentyear[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ring.htm|title=The Ring at Box Office Mojo|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=IMDb Company|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] Watts portrayed Rachel Keller, a journalist investigating the strange deaths of her niece and other teenagers after watching a mysterious videotape, and receiving a phone call announcing their deaths in seven days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ring/|title=The Ring (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=8 December 2010[/tpl] Her performance was praised by critics, including Paul Clinton of CNN.com, who stated that she "is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in Mulholland Drive was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between scepticism and the slow realisation of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/18/review.the.ring/index.html|title=Review: 'The Ring' gets under your skin|publisher=CNN |first=Paul|last=Clinton|accessdate=8 December 2010|date=18 October 2002[/tpl] That year, she also starred in Rabbits, a series of short films directed by David Lynch; alongside several other famous British actors in the black comedy Plots with a View; and with Tim Daly in the western The Outsider.
The following year, she took the part of Julia Cook in Gregor Jordan's Australian film Ned Kelly opposite Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/ned-kelly-v283385|title=Ned Kelly (2003)|work=AllRovi|accessdate=7 July 2011–[/tpl] as well as starring in the Merchant-Ivory film Le Divorce, portraying Roxeanne de Persand, a poet who is abandoned by her husband Charles-Henri de Persand at the time she is pregnant. Roxeanne and her sister Isabel (Kate Hudson) dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of Henri's lover. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a "C" rating and lamented Watts' performance: "I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never seems like the expatriate artiste she's supposed to be playing".[tpl]cite news|last=Gleiberman|first = Owen |title = Le Divorce | work = Entertainment Weekly| date = 5 August 2003 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472427,00.html | accessdate =7 July 2011[/tpl]
Her performance opposite Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro in director Alejandro González Iñárritu's 2003 drama 21 Grams earned Watts an Academy Award nomination as Best Actress later that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/2000-present/76nominees.html|title=Nominees & Winners for the 76th Academy Awards|work=Academy Awards- Official Site|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] In the story, told in a non-lineal manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken woman living a suburban life after the killing of her husband and two children by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro), who started a relationship with the critically ill academic mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). She said of the nomination, "It's far beyond what I ever dreamed for – that would have been too far fetched".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/11/1076388374177.html|title=Watts bath to fame|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media |first=Paul|last=Clinton|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=11 February 2011[/tpl] She also was nominated for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, as well as many other nominations and acclaim.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/21-grams-v290208|title=21 Grams (2003) Awards|work=AllRovi|accessdate=7 July 2011[/tpl] The New York Times praised her: "Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to forget how brilliant she is.

About the evolution of her portrayals, Watts stated: "You'd better know why you're here as an actor ...
