The 1906 English cricket season saw the Championship decided on the very last day with Kent just pipping Yorkshire for the title. It is famous for two outstanding individual feats in George Hirst’s unique "double Double" of 2,385 runs and 208 wickets, and Tom Hayward breaking Bobby Abel’s 1901 record for the most runs scored in a first-class season.
