[[Multiplexer]]

CATEGORIES: Multiplexing, Digital circuits

In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line.[tpl]cite book | last = Dean | first = Tamara | title = Network+ Guide to Networks | publisher = Delmar | year = 2010 | location = | pages = 82â€“85 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&src=bmrr#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.[tpl]cite book | last = Debashis | first = De | title = Basic Electronics | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | year = 2010 | location = | pages = 557 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=mT_j4F1bJx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Basic+Electronics+By+De+Debashis#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl]  Multiplexers are mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within a certain amount of time and bandwidth. A multiplexer is also called a data selector.
An electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one device or resource, for example one A/D converter or one communication line, instead of having one device per input signal.
Conversely, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the single input. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end.

==Cost saving==

One use for multiplexers is cost saving by connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer (or demux) together over a single channel (by connecting the multiplexer's single output to the demultiplexer's single input).
The image to the right demonstrates this.
In this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is higher than the cost and inconvenience of providing the multiplexing/demultiplexing functions.
At the receiving end of the data link a complementary demultiplexer is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams.
In some cases, the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so, while the demultiplexing still exists logically, it may never actually happen physically.
This would be typical where a multiplexer serves a number of IP network users and then feeds directly into a router which immediately reads the content of the entire link into its routing processor and then does the demultiplexing in memory from where it will be converted directly into IP sections.
Often, a multiplexer and demultiplexer are combined together into a single piece of equipment, which is usually referred to simply as a "multiplexer". Both pieces of equipment are needed at both ends of a transmission link because most communications systems transmit in both directions.
In analog circuit design, a multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output.

==Digital multiplexers==

For example, 9 to 16 inputs would require no fewer than 4 selector pins and 17 to 32 inputs would require no fewer than 5 selector pins.
The binary value expressed on these selector pins determines the selected input pin.
Which can be expressed as a truth table:

File:Multiplexer 8-to-1.svg|8-to-1 mux
File:Multiplexer 16-to-1.svg|16-to-1 mux

The boolean equation for a 4-to-1 multiplexer is:
The following 4-to-1 multiplexer is realized from 3-state buffers and AND gates (the AND gates are acting as the decoder):

===Chaining multiplexers===

Larger multiplexers can be constructed by using smaller multiplexers by chaining them together.  For example, an 8-to-1 multiplexer can be made with two 4-to-1 and one 2-to-1 multiplexers.  The two 4-to-1 multiplexer outputs are fed into the 2-to-1 with the selector pins on the 4-to-1's put in parallel giving a total number of selector inputs to 3, which is equivalent to an 8-to-1.

===List of ICs which provide multiplexing===

The 7400 series has several ICs that contain multiplexer(s):

==Digital demultiplexers==

Demultiplexers take one data input and a number of selection inputs, and they have several outputs.
They forward the data input to one of the outputs depending on the values of the selection inputs.
Demultiplexers are sometimes convenient for designing general purpose logic, because if the demultiplexer's input is always true, the demultiplexer acts as a decoder.
This means that any function of the selection bits can be constructed by logically OR-ing the correct set of outputs.
If X is the input and S is the selector, and A and B are the outputs:

==Multiplexers as PLDs==

Multiplexers can also be used as components of programmable logic devices. By specifying the logic arrangement in the input signals, a custom logic circuit can be created. The selector inputs then act as the logic inputs. This is especially useful in situations when cost is a factor and for modularity.
