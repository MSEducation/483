==History==

From 1935 to 1970, the Miss Missouri pageant was held in a number of locations, including St. Louis, Kansas City, and Springfield.
In 1970, the pageant was held for the first time in Mexico, Missouri, which would become the pageant's home.  The pageant has been held in Mexico in all following years.
Missouri has produced one Miss America: Debbye Turner (Miss America, 1990).  They have had a number of runners-up and semi-finalists.
Three Miss Missouris have won the Miss Missouri USA crown and competed at Miss USA, most notably Miss Missouri 2002, Shandi Finnessey, who won the Miss USA title and placed first runner-up at Miss Universe.  Sarah French, Miss Missouri 2006, is the only titleholder who has also competed at Miss Teen USA, although she represented Arkansas.
