[[1992 BDO World Darts Championship]]

CATEGORIES: BDO World Darts Championships, 1992 in darts

The 1992 Embassy World Darts Championship was held from 3–11 January 1992 at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, Surrey.
With Eric Bristow and defending champion Dennis Priestley both going out in round two, the way was paved for the top two seeds, Phil Taylor and Mike Gregory, to make it to the final – notably, the first since the inauguration of the World Championship in 1978 that neither featured Bristow nor John Lowe.
In a titanic affair, full of big scores and high checkouts, it went to the final set and a tiebreak, where Gregory missed two chances each at double 8, double top and double 10 for the title. It also made Gregory the first and only player to miss darts at double to win a world championship and eventually lose.
Taylor took full advantage and sent the match to a sudden-death leg, which he won to take his second World title.
