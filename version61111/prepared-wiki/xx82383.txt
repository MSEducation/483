John Virgo (born 3 March 1946, in Salford, Lancashire, England) is an English former professional snooker player and more recently a snooker commentator and TV personality.

==Career as snooker player==

===Early professional career (1976-1978)===

John Virgo turned professional in 1976, at a time when players such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Eddie Charlton were at the forefront of the sport. Although he had just turned 30 upon turning pro, he was still among the youngest players on the circuit at the time.
In 1977 Virgo reached the semi finals of the UK Championship losing to eventual winner Patsy Fagan.

===UK Champion and Top 10 player (1979-1990)===

His snooker-playing fortunes peaked in 1979 when he reached the semi-final of the World Championship, and went on to win the 1979 UK Championship (though this was not a ranking event at the time). En route to the final Virgo beat Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor. In the final he overcame the reigning world champion Terry Griffiths (Griffiths attempting his characteristic 'bore him to death' technique) despite being controversially docked two frames because of a miscommunicationcommentary Trump v Ding 28 April 2011 and mentions this constantly regarding the start time of the next session of play. He reached the Top 10 in the world rankings the following season.
In 1986 Virgo reached the semi finals of the British Open losing 9-4 to Willie Thorne.CueTracker Snooker Database - British Open 1986

Virgo retired from professional play in 1995.

==Career as exhibition player and TV commentator==

Virgo, as part of his exhibition performances, had long performed trick shots and comedic impressions of other snooker players. During the 1982 World Championship, after one semi-final had finished early, he performed some of his impressions, such as of Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins, Terry Griffiths and Dennis Taylor. He repeated this act in the 1985 World Championship after both semi-finals ended earlier than expected.
He is now a TV snooker commentator who works primarily during the BBC's coverage of ranking events. From 1991 to 2002, Virgo was co-presenter of the snooker-based TV game show Big Break with Jim Davidson. During each show, Virgo participated in the "trick shots" segment, where a competitor who had been ousted from the main quiz would try to copy a complicated snooker shot performed by Virgo in order to win a prize.

==Other activities==

Virgo's tribute book to the late Alex Higgins, Let Me Tell You About Alex, was published in February 2011 and described as "explosive".[tpl]cite news|title=John Virgo: My life in the eye of Hurricane Higgins|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/john-virgo-my-life-in-the-eye-of-hurricane-higgins-15067267.html|accessdate=2012-12-17|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=29 January 2011[/tpl] In April 2012, his book Amazing Snooker Trick Shots was  published.
