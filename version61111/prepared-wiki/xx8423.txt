[[Foreign relations of North Korea]]

CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of North Korea

The foreign relations of North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) are often tense and unpredictable. According to Article 17 of the  Constitution, "independence, peace, and solidarity are the basic ideals of the foreign policy and the principles of external activities of the DPRK". Furthermore, "the state shall establish diplomatic as well as political, economic and cultural relations with all friendly countries, on principles of complete equality, independence, mutual respect, noninterference in each other’s affairs, and mutual benefit".
In addition to the principles stated above, North Korean foreign policy is usually decided upon by the Workers' Party of North Korea. Specifically, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, decides the basic guidelines for the foreign affairs and the principal operating agency enacts the related provisions. Other decisions are often based on a 'back tell'. Some of the elites from the party, cabinet or army make policy decisions and then obtain ratification from the prime minister and from the minister of foreign relations before the policy is told of to Kim Jong-un. North Korea's foreign policy-related matters  are officially apportioned into three parts : governmental diplomacy, multi-party diplomacy and non-governmental diplomacy. Each is under control of different governmental organisations. In conclusion, foreign policy decision making is based on various government bodies' decision.
Since the Korean War armistice in 1953, the North Korean government has been largely isolationist, becoming one of the world's most totalitarian and oppressive societies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl] Ever since North Korea signed the Armistice Agreement with the United Nations Command, it has maintained relations with China, Moscow (Soviet Union to 1991, Russian Federation onward), Pakistan and often limited relations with other nations.  It has not maintained relations with Japan, the United States, or South Korea.
Both Korean governments claim that the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) is only a temporary administrative line, not a permanent border. Additionally, neither nation recognises the opposite as an independent country in a circumstance similar to that between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC/Mainland China). A demilitarized zone (DMZ) extends 2 kilometres (about 1.25 miles) on each side of the MDL.

==Overview==

As less developed countries increased their influence in the arena of world politics and Soviet–American détente created opportunities for countries in both blocs, North Korea declared 1972 a year of diplomacy.Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, White Paper 2009, MOFAT, op. cited. The DPRK used two strategies:  first, it reached out to African countries where China had already established economic and diplomatic influence. Second, North Korea established diplomatic relations with capitalist countries in an effort to develop its economy.[ref]
</ref> Unlike China, which established new ties across a broad political spectrum, North Korea concentrated its diplomatic efforts in Europe with those countries with a strong communist or socialist party, such as Finland, East Germany, Sweden, and Denmark.<ref>Tae-un Kim, "북한의 대 EU 수교 현황과 그 배경 [Status of North Korea’s diplomatic ties with EU and its background], " 한국정치정보학회 (2001)</ref> As a result, North Korea established its diplomatic relations with 66 countries in a decade.
North Korea has a history of poor relations with western-friendly neighboring countries. During the 1970s and 1980s, North Korean abductions of Japanese and South Koreans occurred. Although having since partly resolved the issue by admitting its role in the abductions, it remains a contentious issue with the two countries. In addition, the United States accuses North Korea of producing large numbers of high-quality counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes, namely the Superdollars, although North Korea denies such allegations. South Korea had maintained what it called the 'Sunshine policy' in its bilateral relations with North Korea since the 1990s, stressing Korean reunification and thus often going to great lengths to avoid majorly criticising the North Korean government. This policy ended in 2009.
Since the late 1980s, North Korea's nuclear research programs have become a major topic in international affairs, with western nations such as the United States, Great Britain and Australia, as well as nations such as India, Armenia, South Africa, and now China having taken critical stances towards the concept of a nuclearized North Korea, with the last three discouraging South Korea from going nuclear as well. After allegations from the United States about the continued existence of a military nuclear program, not in compliance with the 1994 Agreed Framework, North Korea declared the existence of uranium enrichment programs during a private meeting with American military officials. Afterwards, North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty on 10 January 2003. After insisting on bilateral negotiations with the United States, it agreed to six-party talks between itself, the United States, South Korea, China, Russia, and Japan in August 2003. The talks continued for two years until an agreement was reached on 19 September 2005, which was placed under severe strain by the subsequent nuclear test by North Korea in October 2006.  Since then, a very similar agreement was reached on 13 February 2007, specifically emphasised normalizing US-North Korean and Japanese-North Korean diplomatic ties but on the condition that North Korea ceases to operate its Yongbyon nuclear research centre.[tpl]cite news |title=Rice hails N Korea nuclear deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6358797.stm |work=BBC News |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Charles |last=Scanlon |title=The end of a long confrontation? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6357853.stm |work=BBC News |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2007-02-13 [/tpl]

==History==

After 1945, the Soviet Union supplied the economic and military aid that enabled North Korea to mount its invasion of the South in 1950. Soviet aid and influence continued at a high level during the Korean war; as mentioned, the Soviet Union was largely responsible for rebuilding North Korea's economy after the cessation of hostilities. In addition, the assistance of Chinese troops during the war and their presence in the country until 1958 gave China some degree of influence in North Korea. In 1961, North Korea concluded formal mutual security treaties with the Soviet Union (inherited by Russia) and China, which have not been formally ended. For most of the Cold War, North Korea followed a policy of equidistance between the Soviet Union and China by accepting favors from both while avoiding a clear preference for either.
During the 70s, North Korea used a two-part diplomatic strategy: first, it continued reaching out to third world countries where China had already established economic and diplomatic influence, particularly in Africa. Second, North Korea established diplomatic relations with some European countries in an effort to develop its economy and expand its foreign ties. Unlike China, which established new ties across a broad political spectrum, North Korea concentrated its diplomatic efforts on European countries with strong left-wing parties such as Portugal and Denmark, and on neutral countries such as Austria and Switzerland.
As a result of its diplomatic activity, North Korea established relations with 63 countries in a decade. However, by the late 1970s, momentum dropped, as a result of destabilising inter-Korean relations, the North's default on foreign loans, and allegations of drug smuggling by its diplomats (in 1976-77, North Korean diplomats were accused of smuggling drugs into countries as far-ranging as Norway, Venezuela, and India).
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, the Soviet-backed Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, and the Soviet Union's successful invasion of Afghanistan created strains between China and the Soviet Union and, in turn, in North Korea's relations with its two major communist allies. North Korea tried to avoid becoming embroiled in the Sino-Soviet split, accepting favours from both the Soviet Union and China and trying to avoid dependence on either. Following Kim Il Sung's 1984 visit to Moscow, there was a dramatic improvement in Soviet-DPRK relations, resulting in renewed deliveries of advanced Soviet weaponry to North Korea and increases in economic aid.
During the 1980s, the pace of North Korea's establishment of new diplomatic relations slowed considerably. The country’s links to terrorist acts abroad, its economic weakness relative to South Korea, and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc all contributed to this dynamic over the course of the decade.Barry K. Gills, Korea versus Korea: A Case of Contested Legitimacy (Routledge, 1996), p. 198. North Korea's Bombing of Rangoon, Burma in 1983Time Magazine "A Bomb Wreaks Havoc in Rangoon," 17 Oct, 1983. and its bombing of
Korean Airlines flight No. 858 in 1987 both received heavy criticism from the international community. Burma, which had relations with both North and South Korea, "de-recognized" the DPRK and expelled North Korean officials in response to the attempted assassination of South Korean president Chun Doo-hwan in Rangoon.
South Korea established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1990 and the People's Republic of China in 1992, which put a serious strain on relations between North Korea and its traditional allies. Moreover, the fall of communism in eastern Europe in 1989 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 had resulted in a significant drop in communist aid to North Korea, resulting in largely decreased relations with Russia. Despite these changes and its past reliance on this military and economic assistance, North Korea proclaims a militantly independent stance in its foreign policy in accordance with its official extreme right winghttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2010/02/a_nation_of_racist_dwarfs.htmlB.

At the same time, North Korea maintains membership in a variety of multilateral organizations. It became a member of the United Nations in September 1991. North Korea also belongs to the Food and Agriculture Organization; the International Civil Aviation Organization; the International Postal Union; the UN Conference on Trade and Development; the International Telecommunication Union; the UN Development Program; the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization; the World Health Organization; the World Intellectual Property Organization; the World Meteorological Organization; the International Maritime Organization; the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Non-Aligned Movement.
In July 2000, North Korea began participating in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), as Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun attended the ARF ministerial meeting in Bangkok 26–27 July. The DPRK also expanded its bilateral diplomatic ties in that year, establishing diplomatic relations with Italy, Australia, and the Philippines. The United Kingdom established diplomatic relations with the DPRK on 13 December 2000,FCO: Country Profile: North Korea as did Canada in February 2001,- Bilateral Relations Canada-DPRK - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade followed by Germany and New Zealand on 1 March 2001.Auswärtiges Amt: LänderinformationNorth Korea - Country Information Paper - NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Mexico maintains diplomatic relations with North Korea. Other countries such as France, the United States, and South American nations (except Brazil and Guyana) do not have formal diplomatic ties with North Korea and have not announced any intention to have any. North Korea, however, maintains a delegation, not an diplomatic mission, within the vicinity of Paris.
Steps have been taken to normalize US and Japanese ties since the landmark 13 February 2007 agreement, reached in exchange for North Korea freezing its nuclear facility at Yongbyon.
North Korea warned it cannot protect foreign embassies in Pyongyang as of April 10, 2013. It is advised that all foreign countries consider asking the staff of their embassies to leave.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9973577/North-Korea-missile-threat-latest-live.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Barney | last=Henderson | title=North Korea missile threat: April 5 as it happened | date=5 April 2013[/tpl]http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/north-korea-warns-it-cannot-protect-embassies-after-april-10-350633

==Reunification efforts==

In August 1971, both North and South Korea agreed to hold talks through their respective Red Cross societies with the aim of reuniting the many Korean families separated following the division of Korea after the Korean War. After a series of secret meetings, both sides announced on July 4, 1972, an agreement to work toward peaceful reunification and an end to the hostile atmosphere prevailing on the peninsula. Officials exchanged visits, and regular communications were established through a North-South coordinating committee and the Red Cross.
However, these initial contacts broke down and ended in 1973 following the announcement by South Korean President Park Chung Hee that the South would seek separate entry into the United Nations and the kidnapping of South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung in Tokyo by the South Korean intelligence service. There was no other significant contact between North and South Korea until 1984.
Dialogue was renewed on several fronts in September 1984, when South Korea accepted the North's offer to provide relief goods to victims of severe flooding in South Korea. Red Cross talks to address the plight of separated families resumed, as did talks on economic and trade issues and parliamentary-level discussions. However, the North then unilaterally suspended all talks in January 1986, arguing that the annual US-South Korea "Team Spirit" military exercise was inconsistent with dialogue. There was a brief flurry of negotiations on co-hosting the 1988 Seoul Olympics, which ended in failure, and were followed by the 1987 KAL Flight 858 bombing.
In a major initiative in July 1988, South Korean President Roh Tae Woo called for new efforts to promote North-South exchanges, family reunification, inter-Korean trade and contact in international forums. Roh followed up this initiative in a UN General Assembly speech in which South Korea offered to discuss security matters with the North for the first time.
Initial meetings that grew out of Roh's proposals started in September 1989. In September 1990, the first of eight prime minister-level meetings between North Korean and South Korean officials took place in Seoul, beginning an especially fruitful period of dialogue. The prime ministerial talks resulted in two major agreements: the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Exchanges, and Cooperation (the Basic Agreement) and the Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula (the Joint Declaration).
The Basic Agreement, signed on 13  December 1991, called for reconciliation and nonaggression established four joint commissions. These commissions - on South-North reconciliation, South-North military affairs, South-North economic exchanges and cooperation, and South-North social and cultural exchange - were to work out the specifics for implementing the general terms of the Basic Agreement. Sub-committees to examine specific issues were created and liaison offices established in Panmunjom, but in the fall of 1992 the process came to a halt because of rising tension over the nuclear issue.
The Joint Declaration on denuclearization was initiated on 13 December 1991. It forbade both sides to test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons and forbade the possession of nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities. A procedure for inter-Korean inspection was to be organized and a North-South Joint Nuclear Control Commission (JNCC) was mandated with verification of the denuclearization of the peninsula.
On 30 January 1992, the DPRK also signed a nuclear safeguards agreement with the IAEA, as it had pledged to do in 1985 when acceding to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This safeguards agreement allowed IAEA inspections to begin in June 1992. In March 1992, the JNCC was established in accordance with the Joint Declaration, but subsequent meetings failed to reach agreement on the main issue of establishing a bilateral inspection regime.
As the 1990s progressed, concern over the North's nuclear program became a major issue in North-South relations and between North Korea and the US. The lack of progress on implementation of the joint nuclear declaration's provision for an inter-Korean nuclear inspection regime led to reinstatement of the U.S.-South Korea Team Spirit military exercise for 1993. The situation worsened rapidly when North Korea, in January 1993, refused IAEA access to two suspected nuclear waste sites and then announced in March 1993 its intent to withdraw from the NPT. During the next 2 years, the US held direct talks with the DPRK. that resulted in a series of agreements on nuclear matters (see, under U.S. Policy Toward North Korea, U.S. Efforts on Denuclearization). During former US President Jimmy Carter's 1994 visit, Kim Il Sung agreed to a first-ever North-South summit. The two sides went ahead with plans for a meeting in July but had to shelve it because of Kim's death.
Eleven South Korean diplomats left an industrial park, in the North Korean city of Kaesong, near the border between the two nations their country runs with North Korea on the 27th of the same month, after North Korea demanded their withdrawal. Their departure follows comments made in the week of March 17, 2008, by South Korean Unification Minister Kim Ha-joong. He said it would be hard to expand the industrial complex without North Korean progress on denuclearization."Pyongyang pressures S. Korean envoys to leave", CNN, 27 March 2008.

==Nuclear program==

North Korea's nuclear research program started with Soviet help in the 1960s, on condition that it joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). In the 1980s an indigenous nuclear reactor development program started with a small experimental 5 MWe gas cooled reactor in Yongbyon, with a 50 MWe and 200 MWe reactor to follow.
Concerns that North Korea had non-civilian nuclear ambitions were first raised in the late 1980s and almost resulted in their withdrawal from the NPT in 1994. However, the Agreed Framework and the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) temporarily resolved this crisis by having the US and several other countries agree that in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program, two light-water reactors (LWRs) would be provided with moves toward normalization of political and economic relations.
This agreement started to break down from 2001 because of slow progress on the KEDO light-water reactor project and U.S. President George W. Bush's offensive Axis of Evil speech. North Korea announced it would withdraw from the NPT in 2003 after the US in late 2002 stopped Agreed Framework interim oil supplies to North Korea and accused North Korea of continuing its nuclear weapons program in contravention of the NPT. North Korea denied these allegations and insisted upon its right to produce nuclear energy for civilian purposes, as allowed by the NPT.
Following this withdrawal, North Korea's neighbours quickly sought a diplomatic solution to an escalating crisis. This resulted in a series of meetings held periodically in Beijing from 2003, known as the six-party talks. Its success has been questioned as US-NK bilateral relations have been the central obstacle for movements towards normalising North Korean relations and maintaining regional peace. North Korea declared on 10 January 2005 that it had nuclear weapons. On 6 October 2006, North Korea then announced it had successfully detonated a nuclear bomb. In response, the US froze North Korean bank assets. This resulted in a 13-month postponement of the six-party talks until mid-December 2006. The third (and last) phase of the fifth round of six-party talks have been held on 8 February 2007, and implementation of the agreement reached at the end of the round has been successful according to the requirements of steps to be taken by all six parties within 30 days, and within 60 days after the agreement, including normalization of US-North Korean and Japanese-Korean diplomatic ties, among other things.  At the time of writing, the 30 days commitments have generally been met by all parties, with further talks due to be scheduled.
North Korea threatened to bolster its nuclear deterrent on 3 March 2008 in response to U.S.-South Korean war games, striking a discordant note after a week of cultural diplomacy that raised hopes of warmer ties between Washington and Pyongyang, with the 2008 New York Philharmonic visit to North Korea.[tpl]cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/03/nkorea.us.ap/index.html | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
U.S. intelligence officials informed members of the United States Congress on 24 April 2008, of their belief that North Korea was assisting Syria with the construction of a major nuclear facility, which was destroyed by Israeli planes in September 2007. It is less clear whether North Korea had provided or was about to provide essential fuel components to Syria and whether or not North Korea was even helping Syria.
On 11 February 2013 North Korea conducted another nuclear test underground that U.S. and Japanese officials claim recorded a magnitude between 4.9 and 5.2. This was seen as a direct message to the U.S. as it came only days after N. Korea was punished for what the UN called a "Banned missile launch". It was also carried out on the birthday of former leader Kim Jong Il.[tpl]cite web|last=Kim|first=Hyung-Jin|title=North Korea Says it has Conducted Third Nuke Test|url=http://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-says-conducted-third-nuke-test-055333507.html[/tpl]

==Territorial disputes==

The Demarcation Line provides a tense border with South Korea. In addition, a 33 km section of boundary with China in the Baekdu Mountain area is indefinite.  North Korea also currently claims sovereignty over the entire Korean peninsula.

==Diplomacy==

North Korea is one of the few countries in which the giving of presents still plays a significant role in diplomatic protocol. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) regularly reports that the country's leader received a floral basket or other gift from a foreign leader or organization.Past news The announcements never mention what sort of gift, but the Kim family has a large collection of cultural and other souvenirs from leaders all over the world, which is partly or entirely on public display. During a 2000 visit to Pyongyang, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave Kim Jong-Il a basketball signed by Michael Jordan as he took an interest in NBA basketball.[tpl]cite news |last=Perlez |first=Jane |title= Albright reports progress in talks with north korea |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DB1231F936A15753C1A9669C8B63 |publisher=New York Times |date=2000-10-25 |accessdate=2008-05-06[/tpl]
North Korea's diplomacy with the United States and Japan is marked by frequent dire warnings through KCNA about its military capabilities. It regards seemingly minor statements and actions in these countries as declarations of renewed war and more than once has responded by threatening to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire" by firing its artillery along the DMZ at Seoul.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/260067.stm |title= North Korea threatens "sea of fire" if attacked |publisher=BBC |date=1999-01-22 |accessdate=2010-12-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1333778/North-Korea-threatens-sea-South-begins-posturing-war-games-US.html |title= North Korea threatens a 'sea of fire' as the South begins posturing war games with US |work =Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2010-12-29 |location=London[/tpl]
North Korea's lack of trade is felt strongly in vast poverty-stricken regions, resulting in almost NZ$8.5 million of aid to various organizations that assist in the development of farming regions and humanitarian assistance.
The 2008 New York Philharmonic visit to North Korea marked the first presentation of a major U.S. cultural group to North Koreans. It has been suggested that the North Korean government is using the international Unification Church, led by North Korean Sun Myung Moon, to make contact with possible supporters and investors in other countries; as the Soviet Union did with Armand Hammer.Moonies step into Kim's world, The Independent, 1994-07-26  At various times during the Bush administration Dong Moon Joo, the president of The Washington Times,  undertook unofficial diplomatic missions to North Korea  in an effort to improve relations.The Bush Administration’s Secret Link to North Korea, Aram Roston, The Daily Beast, February 7, 2012
