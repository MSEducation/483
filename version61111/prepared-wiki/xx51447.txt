Amongst land animals, forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock.[tpl]cite book|author=Fageria, N.K.|year=1997|title=Growth and Mineral Nutrition of Field Crops|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=NY,NY|pages=595[/tpl]
Historically, the term forage has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage.[tpl]cite book|author=Fageria, N.K.|year=1997|title=Growth and Mineral Nutrition of Field Crops|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=NY,NY|pages=583[/tpl] Amongst aquatic animals, the term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.Karpouzi V, R Watson and D Pauly (2006) "Forage fish consumption by marine mammals and seabirds" Fisheries Centre Research Reports, 14 (3): 33–46.
While the term forage has a broad definition, the term forage crop is used to define crops, annual or biennal, which are grown to be utilized by grazing or harvesting as a whole crop.[tpl]cite book|last=Givens|first=D.
