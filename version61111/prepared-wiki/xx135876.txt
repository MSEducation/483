===AKB48===

At age 14, Maeda became a member of AKB48's first group, Team A, which composed of 24 girls and debuted on December 8, 2005.
In 2009, Maeda won the first edition of AKB48's annual general elections, which are described as a popularity contest. As a result, she was the headlined performer for the group's 13th single, "Iiwake Maybe".[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/4241264/ |title=AKB48、13thシングル選抜総選挙「神様に誓ってガチです」 |accessdate=October 8, 2011|publisher=livedoor Co.,Ltd. |language=Japanese[/tpl] The following year, she placed second overall, but still had a significant choreography position in the lineup for "Heavy Rotation".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.scramble-egg.com/artist/akb48/127sousenkyo07.htm |title=AKB48 17thシングル選抜総選挙『母さんに誓って、ガチです』レポート(4) |accessdate=October 8, 2011|publisher=Scramble-Egg Inc. |language=Japanese[/tpl] Later that year, AKB48 employed a rock-paper-scissors tournament to determine the top spot of AKB48's 19th major single "Chance no Junban".
