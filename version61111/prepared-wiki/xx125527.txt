[[Farleys Brook]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Nottinghamshire

Farleys Brook is the name of a minor watercourse in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. It rises in a pool within a copse close to the M1 motorway at the foot of the Misk Hills. It flows Southeastwards through the Misk Meadows, Pennine View, and Nabbs Lane Estates, where several parks and open spaces are centred around flood prevention lagoons. The Brook flows past Hucknall Aerodrome and into Bulwell Hall Park, following the A611 Hucknall Bypass. Farleys Lane Spring rises in the Brook close to this point and a deep pool is formed which is used for paddling and bathing. The Brook flows into the River Leen at Moorbridge, Bulwell. 

==Developments==

As part of a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) scheme for farm conservation, a permissive path has been established alongside the brook from Farleys Lane to the dismantled railway embankment further to the east. As well as providing access to the waterside grassland for visitors, the hedgerows have been improved, and the pond to the east of Farleys Lane has been cleared, to provide a better habitat for invertebrates and birds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cwr.naturalengland.org.uk/mapboards/pdfs/321298000.pdf |title=Conservation Walks |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]
The lower reaches of the brook have been designated as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). However, the status of this section is under threat, due to proposals for a new industrial park and the construction of 900 new homes. Access roads for the development would cross the conservation site, and objections have been raised by the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, particularly because of its effect on local populations of water voles and lizards which are protected species. The developers and council have approached the Environment Agency about the possibility of culverting the watercourse in the area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/R-R-plans-cause-concern-Hucknall-wildlife-site/story-19350043-detail/story.html |title=R-R plans cause concern for Hucknall wildlife site |publisher=Nottingham Post |accessdate=18 April 2014[/tpl]
