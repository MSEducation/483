Kot Isa Shah is a village located on the Eastern bank of river Jehlum, and about eight miles from the town of Shah Jewna in Jhang District in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Pir Isa Shah, the founder of the village was a descendant of Hazrat Mehboob Elahi (Shah Jewna). He had handed over the 'gaddi' of Shah Jewna to his younger brother (Great grandfather of the current gaddi nashin) and moved to Kot Issa Shah. Amongst his descendants, the most notable was Allah Yar Shah who had four sons: Mohammad Hussain Shah, Maqsood Ali Shah, Mohamad Raza Shah and Sajjad Hussain Shah. Mohammad Hussain Shah was a very influential, principled and respected man. He and his brothers were Unionists and were against the partition of India. After the partition of India, his cousins from Shah Jewna came to power because of their political ideology and being members of Muslim League, the post partition ruling party. The family of Isa Shah lost its place in national or provincial politics after Mohammad Hussain Shah but still wields influence locally. Syed Muhammad Asghar Ali Shah, the second son of Mohammad Hussain Shah is the current nazim of the area.
