Slow Motion Daydream is an album by Everclear that was released (in the U.S.) by Capitol Records on March 11, 2003 (see 2003 in music). Recorded in 2002.  The first single released to radio from Slow Motion Daydream was "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom", followed by second single "The New York Times".
Though the album debuted better than the band's last album at 33 on the Billboard charts, the album quickly fell off the charts due to lack of promotion by Capitol Records and a dwindling fan base.  The album has sold only 100,000 copies to date.
This was the last album of new material to feature longtime members Craig Montoya and Greg Eklund who left the band later in August of that year.

==Track listing==

An early leaked tracklist featured the songs "Your New Disease," "Happy," and "Sex with a Movie Star."  At some point after the completion of this version of the album, an additional recording session produced the new songs "I Want to Die a Beautiful Death," "The New York Times," and "White Noise," which Art Alexakis decided to include on the album instead.  "Your New Disease" and "Happy" were relegated to the b-side of the "Volvo Driving Soccer Mom" single, while "Sex with a Movie Star" finally surfaced on the Ten Years Gone career retrospective.
