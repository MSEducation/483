==Success and reception==

Milsap's 53rd single to be released and the third track from the album Stranger Things Have Happened, the song became his last number-one single.
Curtis Wright, who had just quit Vern Gosdin's road band, wrote the song in 1989. He said that when Doug Millett presented him with the idea, he was initially disinterested in writing the song, but "it kind of opened up like a book". Wright was still concerned that its hook was too similar to Earl Thomas Conley's 1988 single "What She Is (Is a Woman in Love)", and thought that the song was not suited for Milsap's style.
Milsap also created a music video for the song.[tpl]cite book |last=Roland |first=Tom |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits|year=1991 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=0-8230-7553-2 |page=572[/tpl]
