[[Azupiranu]]

CATEGORIES: Akkadian cities, Fertile Crescent, Former populated places in Iraq

Azupiranu was a town in ancient Mesopotamia. The exact location is unknown. In a Neo-Assyrian text purporting to be the autobiography of Sargon of Akkad, Azupiranu is named as Sargon's birthplace and described as "situated on the banks of the Euphrates."L. W. King, Chronicles Concerning Early Babylonian Kings, II, London, 1907, pp.3ff; 87-96. 
"Azupiranu" is an Akkadian name meaning city of saffron; Sargon and his family were themselves Akkadians, and the city was likely a Semitic rather than Sumerian settlement.
