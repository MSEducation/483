A railway station on this site first came into being in 1848; the present structure was inaugurated in 1922. Part of the station is a Grade II listed building.
With over 94 million passenger entries and exits between April 2011 and March 2012, Waterloo is Britain's busiest railway station by passenger usage.[tpl]cite journal |editor-last=Pigott |editor-first=Nick |editor-link=Nick Pigott |title=Waterloo still London's busiest station |magazine=The Railway Magazine |location=Horncastle, Lincs |date=June 2012 |publisher=Mortons Media Group |volume=158 |number=1334 |page=6 [/tpl] The Waterloo complex is one of the busiest passenger terminals in Europe,[tpl]cite news |title=Saint-Lazare Terminus des mécontents: La deuxième gare d'Europe |newspaper=Le Monde |location=Paris| date=8 February 2009 [/tpl] [tpl]fr icon[/tpl] and the 91st busiest railway station in the world.More Countries Join the New List of 100 Busiest Train Stations, Japan Still Claims 82 of Them It has more platforms and a greater floor area than any other station in the United Kingdom (though Clapham Junction, just under [tpl]convert|4|mi|km|0[/tpl] down the line, has the largest number of trains). The station is the terminus for services from Chessington South, Hampton Court, Wimbledon, Epsom, Dorking, Guildford, Woking, Basingstoke, Salisbury, Southampton, Portsmouth,  Bournemouth, Weymouth and Exeter.
Much of Waterloo's traffic is local or suburban. All regular services are operated by South West Trains. Adjacent is London Waterloo East railway station, which is managed and branded separately.
The station was the London terminus for Eurostar international trains from 1994 until 2007, when it was transferred to St Pancras International.

==History==

===Aiming at the City===

The London and South Western Railway (L&SWR) opened the station on 11 July 1848 as 'Waterloo Bridge Station' (from the nearby crossing over the Thames) when its main line was extended from Nine Elms. The station, designed by William Tite, was raised above marshy ground on a series of arches.'York Road', Survey of London: volume 23: Lambeth: South Bank and Vauxhall (1951), pp. 40-44.  The unfulfilled intention was for a through station with services to the City of London. In 1886, it officially became "Waterloo Station", reflecting long-standing common usage, even in some L&SWR timetables.

===Expansion===

The L&SWR's aim throughout much of the 19th century was to extend its main line eastward beyond Waterloo into the City of London. Given this, it was reluctant to construct a dedicated grand terminus at Waterloo. However traffic and passenger usage continued to grow and the company expanded the station at regular intervals, with additions being made in 1854, 1860, 1869, 1875, 1878 and 1885. In each case the long-term plan was that the expansion was 'temporary' until Waterloo became through-station, and therefore these additions were simply added alongside and around the existing structure rather than as part of an overall architectural plan.
This resulted in the station becoming increasingly ramshackle. The original 1848 station became known as the 'Central Station' as other platforms were added. The new platform sets were known by nicknames - the two platforms added for suburban services in 1878 were the 'Cyprus Station', whilst the six built in 1885 for use by trains on the Windsor line became the 'Khartoum Station'. Each of these stations-within-a-station had its own booking office, taxi stand and public entrances from the street, as well as often poorly marked and confusing access to the rest of the station.
By 1899 Waterloo had 16 platform roads but only 10 platform numbers due to platforms in different sections of the station or on different levels sometimes duplicating the number of a platform elsewhere.[ref]
