Woodsia obtusa is a common rock fern of Appalachia and eastern North America.  It prefers a calcareous substrate, but also grows in neutral soils.  It may grow on rock faces or in scree.
This fern is often confused with various ferns of the genus Cystopteris but can be distinguished by its hairy nature.
