==Political life==

In 1980, he ran for school trustee in Ward 4 but finished third behind incumbents Patrick Case and Peter Davis.[tpl]Cite news |title=Non-aligned school trustees can tip scales on Toronto board |last=Turner |first=Julia |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=November 11, 1980 |page=11[/tpl]In this election two trustees were elected to each ward. In 1982 he ran again this time being elected. He ran as an New Democrat aligned trustee.[tpl]cite news |title=New Democrats gain seat on Toronto school board |last=Matas |first=Robert |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=November 9, 1982 |page=11[/tpl]School trustee elections don't run on a party system but individual trustees could run claiming alignment with a particular party. 
He served on the Toronto school board from 1982 to 1990. During this period, he was an advocate of lingual and racial rights, worked to establish international language programs, alternative schools and school childcare, and helped to end the practice of streaming students into narrow learning programs. 
In 1985 and again in 1988, Marchese voted with other trustees to raise their salaries 35% and 86% respectively. By the end of 1988 salaries had increased from about $18,000 to $44,000. Trustees who supported the increase argued that the salary was too low to attract good candidates. Sheila Cary-Meagher, said, "You have to stop and think... about the people who want to run for the job and who, if we keep it a rich person's ghetto, can't do it," she said. In both years trustees rejected citizen recommendations for lower increases.[tpl]cite news |title=Trustees boost own pay 33% by 1987 |first=Darcy |last=Henton |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=August 23, 1985 |page=A6[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Citizens 'shocked' after trustees vote themselves 86 per cent raise |first=Naomi |last=Morris |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=July 2, 1988 |page=A6[/tpl]
