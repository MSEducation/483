Suzuki says of his work, "I try to choose good dynamic designs with patterns that can be modified for today's use. Usually I re-work the fits as lightly as possible, being careful not to re-produce vintage designs—adding some things and taking some off, balancing it out to make it look new."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.refinery29.com/japanese-americana-interview-w.php |title=Japanese Americana: Interview With Daiki Suzuki of Woolrich Woolen Mills and Engineered Garments |author=Gabriel Bell |date=27 Jan 2009 |work= |publisher= Refinery 29 |accessdate=30 December 2010[/tpl]
