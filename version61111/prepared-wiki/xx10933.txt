South Dakota [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-us-South Dakota.ogg|ˌ|s|aʊ|θ|_|d|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|t|ə[/tpl] is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes.  South Dakota is the 17th most extensive, but the 5th least populous and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States.  Once the southern portion of the Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota.  Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 159,000, is South Dakota's largest city.
South Dakota is bordered by the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents as "East River" and "West River".Hasselstrom, pp. 2–4. Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the state's population, and fertile soil in this area is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains, are located in the southwest part of the state. The Black Hills are sacred to the Sioux. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is located there. Other attractions in the southwest include Badlands and Wind Cave national parks, Custer State Park, the Crazy Horse Memorial, and historic Deadwood. South Dakota experiences a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The ecology of the state features species typical of a North American grassland biome.
Humans have inhabited the area for several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century. In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold rush in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching miners and settlers caused conflict that triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 50s for agriculture and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture which has much reduced family farming. 
While several Democratic senators have represented South Dakota for multiple terms at the federal level, the state government is largely dominated by the Republican Party, whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the most recent 12 presidential elections. Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in areas, including biomedical research and alternative energy fuels, to attract and retain residents.  South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence the culture of the state.

==Geography==

South Dakota is situated in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau;Census Regions and Divisions of the United States, U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved January 29, 2009. it is also part of the Great Plains region. The culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota have more in common with the West than the Midwest.Johnson, Dirk. Gold Divides Dakotans as River Did NYtimes.com The New York Times. October 9, 1988. (accessed February 14, 2008) South Dakota has a total land area of [tpl]convert|77121|sqmi|km2[/tpl], making the state the 17th largest in the Union.[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html| title =Land and Water Area of States (2000)| publisher=infoplease.com| accessdate =September 3, 2007[/tpl]

The Missouri River is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, James, Big Sioux, and White Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation.[tpl]cite web| title = Eastern South Dakota Wetlands | publisher=United States Geological Survey | accessdate =January 25, 2009 | url = http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/wetlands/eastwet/overview.htm[/tpl] Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and Lewis and Clark Lake.

===Regions and geology===

South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills.Thompson (ed.), p. 14. The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota, and the geography of the Black Hills differs from its surroundings to such an extent that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. South Dakotans also at times combine the Black Hills with the rest of western South Dakota, and refer to the two resulting regions, divided by the Missouri, as West River and East River.
Eastern South Dakota generally features higher precipitation and lower topography than the western part of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin.Thompson (ed.), pp. 17–18. Further to the west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south.Schell, pp. 4–6. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, also extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, and are the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.[tpl]cite web| title = Pleistocene Deposits | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116121210/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/pleistocene.html | archivedate = January 16, 2008[/tpl]
The Great Plains cover most of the western two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the landscape becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes.Schell, p. 6. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell to the bottom of a large shallow sea that once covered the area and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.[tpl]cite web| title = Mesozoic Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213170116/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/mesozoic.html | archivedate = February 13, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Tertiary Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070925065217/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/tertiary.html | archivedate = September 25, 2007[/tpl]
The Black Hills are in the southwestern part of South Dakota and extend into Wyoming. This range of low mountains covers [tpl]convert|6000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] with peaks that rise from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (600 to 1,200 m) above their bases. The Black Hills are the location of Harney Peak (7,242 ft or 2,207 m above sea level), the highest point in South Dakota and also the highest point in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Two billion-year-old Precambrian formations, the oldest rocks in the state, form the central core of the Black Hills.[tpl]cite web| title = The Geology of South Dakota | publisher=Northern State University | accessdate =August 29, 2008 | url = http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/EARTH/Geolog1.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Precambrian Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/precambrian.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116121220/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/precambrian.html | archivedate = January 16, 2008[/tpl] Formations from the Paleozoic Era form the outer ring of the Black Hills;[tpl]cite web| title = Paleozoic Formations | publisher=South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources | accessdate =November 28, 2008 | url = http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/paleozoic.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116121205/http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geology/paleozoic.html | archivedate = January 16, 2008[/tpl] these were created between roughly 540 and 250 million years ago. This area features rocks such as limestone which were deposited here when the area formed the shoreline of an ancient inland sea.

===Ecology===

Much of South Dakota, not including the Black Hills, is dominated by a temperate grasslands biome.[tpl]cite web| title = A Short Introduction to Terrestrial Biomes | publisher=nearctica.com | accessdate =September 22, 2007 | url = http://www.nearctica.com/ecology/habitats/biointro.htm | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070928020341/http://www.nearctica.com/ecology/habitats/biointro.htm  | archivedate =September 28, 2007[/tpl] Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts.[tpl]cite web| title = South Dakota Flora | publisher=Northern State University | accessdate =September 22, 2007 | url = http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/flora1.htm[/tpl]
Mammals in this area include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs.[tpl]cite web| title = South Dakota Fauna | publisher=Northern State University | accessdate =September 22, 2007 | url = http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/fauna1.htm[/tpl] The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted well to the area after being introduced from China,[tpl]cite web| title = Ring-Necked Pheasant | publisher=Northern State University | accessdate =September 22, 2007 | url = http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/BIRDS/Ringne1.htm[/tpl] and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River.Hetland, Cara. South Dakota bald eagles make a comeback Publicradio.org Minnesota Public Radio. February 8, 2007. (accessed September 22, 2007). Rivers and lakes of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, bass, and other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish.[tpl]cite web| title = Paddlefish | publisher=Northern State University | accessdate =September 22, 2007 | url = http://www3.northern.edu/natsource/ENDANG1/Paddle1.htm[/tpl]
Because of higher elevation and precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from that of the plains.South Dakota's Forest Resources. Piva, R.; Haugan, D.; Josten, G.; Brand, G. (U.S. Department of Interior. Forest Service Resource Bulletin. 2007) The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces.Thompson (ed.), p. 31.  Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.[tpl]cite web| title = Black Hills Deer | publisher=South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks | accessdate =January 29, 2010 | url = http://www.sdgfp.info/wildlife/hunting/biggame/BHDeer.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Brook Trout | publisher=South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks | accessdate =January 29, 2010 | url = http://www.sdgfp.info/Wildlife/Education/FishBook/fishbook.brooktrout.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Rainbow Trout | publisher=South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks | accessdate =January 29, 2010 | url = http://www.sdgfp.info/Wildlife/Education/FishBook/fishbook.rainbowtrout.pdf[/tpl]

===Climate===

South Dakota has a continental climate with four distinct seasons, ranging from cold, dry winters to hot and semi-humid summers. During the summers, the average high temperature throughout the state is often close to [tpl]convert|90|°F[/tpl], although it cools to near [tpl]convert|60|°F[/tpl] at night. It is not unusual for South Dakota to have severe hot, dry spells in the summer with the temperature climbing above [tpl]convert|100|°F[/tpl] several times a year.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www5.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim60/states/Clim_SD_01.pdf | title = Climate of South Dakota | publisher=National Climatic Data Center | accessdate =November 26, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl] Winters are cold with January high temperatures averaging below freezing and low temperatures averaging below [tpl]convert|10|°F[/tpl] in most of the state. The highest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|120|F|C[/tpl] at Usta on July 15, 2006[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheat7.htm | title = Each state's high temperature record | publisher = USA Today | accessdate = March 1, 2012 | date=November 1, 2007[/tpl] and the lowest recorded temperature is [tpl]convert|-58|F|C[/tpl] at McIntosh on February 17, 1936.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wcstates.htm | title = Each state's low temperature record | publisher = USA Today | accessdate = March 1, 2012 | date=February 10, 2011[/tpl] 
Average annual precipitation in South Dakota ranges from semi-arid conditions in the northwestern part of the state (around [tpl]convert|15|in|disp=or|abbr=out[/tpl]) to semi-humid around the southeast portion of the state (around [tpl]convert|25|in|disp=or|abbr=out[/tpl]), although a small area centered on Lead in the Black Hills has the highest precipitation at nearly [tpl]convert|30|in[/tpl] per year.[tpl]cite web| title = Precipitation Normals (1971–2000) | publisher=South Dakota State University | accessdate =November 26, 2008 | url = http://climate.sdstate.edu/archives/data/pptnormals.shtm[/tpl]
South Dakota summers bring frequent, sometimes severe, thunderstorms with high winds, thunder, and hail. The eastern part of the state is often considered part of Tornado Alley,[tpl]cite web| title = Tornado Climatology | publisher=National Severe Storms Laboratory | accessdate =February 7, 2009 | url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/tornado/tor_climatology.html[/tpl] and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif | title = Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953–2004 | publisher=National Climatic Data Center | accessdate =June 25, 2009[/tpl] Severe weather in the form of blizzards and ice storms occurs often during winter.

===National Parks and Monuments===

South Dakota contains several sites that are administered by the National Park Service.
Two national parks have been established in South Dakota, both located in the southwestern part of the state.  Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, contains an extensive cave network as well as a large herd of bison.[tpl]cite web| title = Wind Cave History | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =August 28, 2007 | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/Wind_Cave_History.htm[/tpl] Badlands National Park was created in 1978.[tpl]cite web| title = Frequently Asked Questions (Badlands National Park) | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =August 27, 2007 | url = http://www.nps.gov/badl/faqs.htm[/tpl] The park features an eroded, brightly colored landscape surrounded by semi-arid grasslands.[tpl]cite web| title = Badlands | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =August 27, 2007 | url = http://www.nps.gov/badl[/tpl]  Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925.

Other areas managed by the National Park Service include Jewel Cave National Monument near Custer, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site, which features a decommissioned nuclear missile silo and a separate missile control area located several miles away, and the Missouri National Recreational River.[tpl]cite web| title = South Dakota | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate =August 28, 2007 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/SD/[/tpl]  The Crazy Horse Memorial is a large mountainside sculpture near Mt. Rushmore that is being constructed with private funds.Hetland, Cara. Crazy Horse Memorial turns 60 this year Publicradio.org Minnesota Public Radio. June 8, 2008. (accessed February 7, 2009).

==History==

Humans have lived in what is today South Dakota for at least several thousand years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC.Schell, p. 15. Between 500 AD and 800 AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived in central and eastern South Dakota. In the 14th century, the Crow Creek Massacre occurred, in which several hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.Deloria and Neal (eds.), p. 161. 
By 1500, the Arikara (or Ree) had settled in much of the Missouri River valley.Schell, pp. 16–18. European contact with the area began in 1743, when the LaVerendrye brothers explored the region. The LaVerendrye group buried a plate near the site of modern day Pierre, claiming the region for France as part of greater Louisiana.Schell, pp. 28–29. By the early 19th century, the Sioux had largely replaced the Arikara as the dominant group in the area.Schell, pp. 18–21.
In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory, an area that included most of South Dakota, from Napoleon Bonaparte, and President Thomas Jefferson organized a group commonly referred to as the "Lewis and Clark Expedition" to explore the newly acquired region.Thompson (ed.), pp. 56–57. In 1817, an American fur trading post was set up at present-day Fort Pierre, beginning continuous American settlement of the area.[tpl]cite web| title = Chronology of South Dakota History | publisher=South Dakota Historical Society | accessdate =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070901170704/http://www.sdhistory.org/soc/soc_hist.htm |archivedate = September 1, 2007[/tpl] In 1855, the U.S. Army bought Fort Pierre but abandoned it in 1857 in favor of Fort Randall to the south. Settlement by Americans and Europeans was by this time increasing rapidly, and in 1858 the Yankton Sioux signed the 1858 Treaty, ceding most of present-day eastern South Dakota to the United States.Thompson (ed.), pp. 69–71.
Land speculators founded two of eastern South Dakota's largest present-day cities: Sioux Falls in 1856Schell, pp. 72–73. and Yankton in 1859.Schell, p. 72. In 1861, the Dakota Territory was established by the United States government (this initially included North Dakota, South Dakota, and parts of Montana and Wyoming).[tpl]cite web| title = Dakota Territory History | publisher=Union County Historical Society | accessdate =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.acsnet.com/~jkjar/dt_history.htm[/tpl]  Settlement of the area, mostly by people from the eastern United States as well as western and northern Europe, increased rapidly,Schell, pp 168–170.  especially after the completion of an eastern railway link to Yankton in 1873.Schell, p. 113. 
In 1874, gold was discovered in the Black Hills during a military expedition led by George A. CusterSchell, p. 129.Schell, pp. 140–144. and miners and explorers began illegally entering land promised to the Lakota. Custer's expedition took place despite the fact that the US had granted the entire western half of present-day South Dakota (West River) to the Sioux in 1868 by the Treaty of Laramie as part of the Great Sioux Reservation.Thompson (ed.), p. 90. The Sioux declined to grant mining rights or land in the Black Hills, and war broke out after the U.S. failed to stop white miners and settlers from entering the region.Schell, p. 129; pp. 133-39. Eventually the US defeated the Sioux and broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five reservations, settling the Lakota in those areas. (In 1980, the US Supreme Court and Congress ordered payment to the Lakota for the illegal seizure of the Black Hills. The case remains unsettled, as the Lakota refuse to accept the money and instead insist on the return of the land.)Thompson (ed.), p. 529. 
A growing population caused Dakota Territory to be divided in half and President Benjamin Harrison signed proclamations formally admitting both South Dakota and North Dakota to the union on November 2, 1889.Schell, p. 222.Thompson (ed.), pp. 115–116. Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.
On December 29, 1890, the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Commonly cited as the last major armed conflict between the United States and the Lakota Sioux Nation, the massacre resulted in the deaths of at least 146 Sioux, many of them women and children.Schell, pp. 304–305. 31 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the conflict.
During the 1930s, several economic and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced what was known as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined.[tpl]cite web| title = Drought in the Dust Bowl Years | publisher=National Drought Mitigation Center | accessdate =April 4, 2007 | url = http://drought.unl.edu/whatis/dustbowl.htm | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070329183000/http://www.drought.unl.edu/whatis/dustbowl.htm  | archivedate =March 29, 2007[/tpl] The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state.  The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.[tpl]cite web| title = Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =December 14, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/sd190090.txt[/tpl]
Economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war.Schell, pp. 317–320. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially located in South Dakota.Schell, pp. 323–325. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.
In recent decades, South Dakota has been transformed from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since the completion of the interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has since been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.Hetland, Cara. Sioux Falls 25 years after Citibank's arrival. Publicradio.org Minnesota Public Radio. February 24, 2006. (accessed March 23, 2007) 
In 2007, the site of the recently closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory.[tpl]cite web| title = Homestake Strikes Gold Again | publisher=South Dakota Science and Technology Authority | accessdate =August 28, 2007 | url = http://www.sanfordlaboratoryathomestake.org/news_07-10-07a.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215142331/http://www.sanfordlaboratoryathomestake.org/news_07-10-07a.html | archivedate = December 15, 2007[/tpl] Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states.[tpl]cite web| title = Sweeping out the Plains | publisher=aliciapatterson.org | accessdate =April 5, 2007 | url = http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF2102/Coffman_Anthan/Coffman_Anthan.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070403202243/http://aliciapatterson.org/APF2102/Coffman_Anthan/Coffman_Anthan.html  | archivedate =April 3, 2007[/tpl]  Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.Thompson (ed.), pp. 542–549.

Ethnically, 2.7% of South Dakota's population was of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race).
As of 2011, 25.4% of South Dakota's population younger than age 1 were minorities (note: children born to white hispanics are counted as minority group).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html|title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|last=Exner|first=Rich|date=June 3, 2012|work=The Plain Dealer[/tpl]
The five largest ancestry groups in South Dakota are German (40.7%), Norwegian (15.3%), Irish (10.4%), Native American (8.3%), and English (7.1%).[tpl]cite web| title = Quick Tables | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =August 29, 2008 | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP2&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&geo_id=04000US46[/tpl] German Americans are the largest ancestry group in most parts of the state, especially in East River (east of the Missouri River), although there are also large Scandinavian-descended populations in some counties.

American Indians, largely Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota (Sioux) are predominant in several counties and comprise 20 per cent of the population in West River. There are seven large Indian reservations in the state, but this area is diminished from the Great Sioux Reservation of West River, which the US government had once allocated to the Sioux. South Dakota has the third-highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, behind Alaska and New Mexico.[tpl]cite web| title = States Ranked by American Indian and Alaska Native Population, July 1, 1999 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =December 14, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/state/rank/aiea.txt[/tpl]

English is specified by law as the "common language" of the state. As of the 2000 census, 1.90% of the population aged 5 or older speak German at home, while 1.51% speak Lakota or Dakota, and 1.43% Spanish.[tpl]cite web| title = Most Spoken Languages in South Dakota | publisher=mla.org | accessdate =August 18, 2007 | url = http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=46&mode=state_tops[/tpl]

===Languages===

As of 2010, 93.46% (692,504) of South Dakota residents aged 5 and older spoke English as their primary language. 6.54% of the population spoke a language other than English. 2.06% (15,292) of the population spoke Spanish, 1.39% (10,282) spoke Dakota, and 1.37% (10,140) spoke German.

===Growth and rural flight===

South Dakota, in common with other Great Plains states, has been experiencing a falling population in many rural areas over the last several decades, a phenomenon known as "rural flight" as family farming has decreased. This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 of South Dakota's counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census.O'Driscoll, Patrick. "Sioux Falls powers South Dakota growth", USA Today, March 12, 2001. (accessed December 16, 2008) During that time, nine counties experienced a population loss of greater than 10%, with Harding County, in the northwest corner of the state, losing nearly 19% of its population. Low birth rates and a lack of younger immigration has caused the median age of many of these counties to increase. In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65,[tpl]cite web| title = South Dakota state and county demographic profiles | publisher=South Dakota State University | accessdate =December 16, 2008 | url = http://agbionews.sdstate.edu/story.cfm?id=4420[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] compared with a national rate of 12.8%.
The effect of rural flight has not been spread evenly through South Dakota, however. Although most rural counties and small towns have lost population, the Sioux Falls area, the larger counties along Interstate 29, the Black Hills, and many Indian reservations have all gained population. Lincoln County near Sioux Falls is the ninth-fastest growing county (by percentage) in the United States.[tpl]cite web| title = 100 Fastest Growing Counties | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate =April 10, 2007 | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2004-09.html | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070403192900/http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2004-09.html  | archivedate =April 3, 2007[/tpl] The growth in these areas has compensated for losses in the rest of the state, and South Dakota's total population continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the national average.

===Religion===

The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church with 148,883 members; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) with 112,649 members; and the United Methodist Church (UMC) with 36,020 members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/46/rcms2010_46_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives | State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=December 12, 2013[/tpl] (Both the ELCA and UMC are specific denominations within the broader terms 'Lutheran' and 'Methodist', respectively.)

The service industry is the largest economic contributor in South Dakota. This sector includes the retail, finance, and health care industries. Citibank, which was the largest bank holding company in the United States at one time, established national banking operations in South Dakota in 1981 to take advantage of favorable banking regulations. Government spending is another important segment of the state's economy, providing over ten percent of the gross state product. Ellsworth Air Force Base, near Rapid City, is the second-largest single employer in the state.Reha, Bob.

Agriculture has historically been a key component of the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs.[tpl]cite web| title = State Fact Sheets: South Dakota | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | accessdate =June 25, 2009 | url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts/SD.htm[/tpl] Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

Another important sector in South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel to view the attractions of the state, particularly those in the Black Hills region, such as historic Deadwood, Mount Rushmore, and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.

==Transportation==

South Dakota has 83,609 miles of highways, roads, and streets, along with 679 miles of interstate highways.[tpl]cite web| title = General Information/Key Facts | publisher=South Dakota Department of Transportation | accessdate =September 3, 2007 | url = http://www.sddot.com/geninfo_facts.asp[/tpl]  Two major interstates pass through South Dakota: Interstate 90, which runs east and west through the southern half of the state; and Interstate 29, running north and south in the eastern portion of the state. The I-29 corridor features generally higher rates of population and economic growth than areas in eastern South Dakota that are further from the interstate. 
Also located in the state are the shorter interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around eastern and southern Sioux Falls. Several major U.S. highways pass through the state. U.S. routes 12, 14, 16, 18, and 212 travel east and west, while U.S. routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. South Dakota and Montana are the only states sharing a land border which is not traversed by a paved road.
South Dakota contains two National Scenic Byways. The Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway is located in the Black Hills, while the Native American Scenic Byway runs along the Missouri River in the north-central part of the state. Other scenic byways include the Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, the Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway, and the Wildlife Loop Road Scenic Byway.[tpl]cite web| title = South Dakota | publisher=National Scenic Byways Program | accessdate =January 24, 2008 | url = http://www.byways.org/explore/states/SD/[/tpl]

==Government and politics==

===Government===

Like that of other U.S. states, the structure of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The structure of the state government is laid out in the Constitution of South Dakota, the highest law in the state. The constitution may be amended either by a majority vote of both houses of the legislature, or by voter initiative.[tpl]cite web| title = Article XXIII, Section 1, Constitution of South Dakota | publisher=South Dakota Legislature | accessdate =November 26, 2008 | url = http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=0N-23-1[/tpl]

The state legislature is made up of two bodies, the Senate, which has 35 members, and the House of Representatives, with 70 members. South Dakota is divided into 35 legislative districts,[tpl]cite web| title = Fact Sheet | publisher=State of South Dakota | accessdate =November 26, 2008 | url = http://www.state.sd.us/factpage.htm[/tpl] with voters electing two representatives and one senator per district. The legislature meets for an annual session which begins on the second Tuesday in January and lasts for 30 days; it also meets if a special session is called by the governor.
The judicial branch is made up of several levels. The state supreme court, with four justices and a chief justice, is the highest court in the state.[tpl]cite web| title = Overview – UJS | publisher=South Dakota Unified Judicial System | accessdate =January 30, 2010 | url = http://www.sdjudicial.com/courtinfo/Default.aspx[/tpl] Below the supreme court are the circuit courts; 38 circuit judges serve in seven judicial circuits in the state. Below the circuit courts are the magistrate courts, which deal with more minor criminal and civil actions.

===State taxes===

The state sales tax does not apply to sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units.

===Politics===

South Dakota politics are generally dominated by the Republican Party. Since statehood, Democrat presidential candidates have won the state's electoral votes on only four occasions (Only Alaska has been carried fewer times by Democrats) and have not done so since 1964. Not even George McGovern, the Democratic nominee in 1972 and a native South Dakotan, was able to carry the state.[tpl]cite web| title =  McGovern, George Stanley, (1922–) | publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate =October 5, 2007 | url = http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=m000452[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title = Presidential General Election Graph Comparison – South Dakota | publisher=uselectionatlas.org | accessdate =October 5, 2007 | url = http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparegraphs.php?year=2004&fips=46&f=0&off=0&elect=0[/tpl] Additionally, a Democrat has not won the governorship since 1974.

South Dakota has also produced several notable artists. Harvey Dunn grew up on a homestead near Manchester in the late 19th century. While most of his career was spent as an illustrator, Dunn's most famous works, showing various scenes of frontier life, were completed near the end of his career.Hasselstrom, pp. 34–36. Oscar Howe was born on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation and won fame for his watercolor paintings.Hasselstrom, pp. 215–217. Howe was one of the first Native American painters to produce works heavily influenced by abstraction, as opposed to ones relying on traditional styles. Terry Redlin, originally from Watertown, is an accomplished painter of rural and wildlife scenes. Many of Redlin's works are on display at the Redlin Art Center in Watertown.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.sdhalloffame.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=78&iid=410 | title = Terry Redlin | publisher=South Dakota Hall of Fame | accessdate =May 11, 2009[/tpl]
