==Phonology==

The Cire-cire dialect has the following consonant inventory:
The clicks have a very uneven distribution: Only a dozen words begin with one of the palatal clicks ([tpl]IPA|ǂ[/tpl]), and these are replaced by dental clicks ([tpl]IPA|ǀ[/tpl]) among younger speakers. Only half a dozen words start with one of the alveolar clicks ([tpl]IPA|ǃ[/tpl]), and half a dozen more with one of the affricated clicks. These rather marginal sounds are placed in parentheses in the chart. 
Tsoa has the five vowels [tpl]IPA|/a e i o u/[/tpl]. It is not clear if Tsoa has long vowels, or simply sequences of identical vowels [tpl]IPA|/aa ee ii oo uu/[/tpl]. 
There are two tones, high and low, plus a few cases of mid tone.
