Pontoise Cathedral ([tpl]lang-fr|Cath√©drale Saint-Maclou de Pontoise[/tpl]) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and national monument of France, located in the town of Pontoise, now on the outskirts of Paris, in the Val d'Oise.
The church, raised to the status of cathedral in 1966 when the Diocese of Pontoise was created, is dedicated to Saint Maclovius (Maclou). Construction began in the 12th century on the site of an ancient chapel of Saint Eustace and the building was enlarged and completed in the 15th and 16th centuries. Thus the central and eastern parts of the cathedral are 12th century, while the tower and the central portal are in the Flamboyant style. There are Renaissance additions flanking the central structure, and a north portal of the same period.
