Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and [[Ethanol|alcohol]], readily forming concentrated solutions. A solution of chloral hydrate in [[Ethanol|alcohol]] called "knockout drops" was used to prepare a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey Finn]].<ref>http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/chloral_hydrate.html [tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]</ref> More reputable uses of chloral hydrate include its use as a clearing agent for [[chitin]] and fibers and as a key ingredient in Hoyer's mounting medium, which is used to prepare permanent or semi-permanent microscope slides of small organisms, histological sections, and chromosome squashes. Because of its status as a regulated substance, chloral hydrate can be difficult to obtain. To cope with procurement problems, Rutgers scientists have developed a substitute for chloral hydrate for use in microscopy, known as ''Visikol'',<ref>http://visikol.com</ref><ref>[tpl]cite journal | url = http://otc.rutgers.edu/pdf/Simon-2012-146.pdf | title = Visikol: Novel Clearing Agent and Mounting Medium to replace Chloral Hydrate Solution for use in Microscopy, Forensics, Quality Control, Education, and Biological, Food, and Earth Sciences | journal = Rutgers Technology #: 2012-146[/tpl]</ref> which has been shown to be an effective replacement for chloral hydrate for clearing plant specimens.<ref>[tpl]cite journal | url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.3732/apps.1300016 | title = An Improved Clearing and Mounting Solution to Replace Chloral Hydrate in Microscopic Applications | journal = Applications in Plant Sciences, 1(5) [/tpl]</ref>
It is, together with chloroform, a minor side-product of the chlorination of water when organic residues such as humic acids are present. It has been detected in drinking water at concentrations of up to 100 micrograms per litre (µg/L) but concentrations are normally found to be below 10 µg/L. Levels are generally found to be higher in surface water than in ground water.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/chloralhydratesumstatement.pdf | title=Summary statement - 12.20 Chloral hydrate (trichloroacetaldehyde) | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=March 14, 2013[/tpl]
Chloral hydrate has not been approved by the FDA in the United States or the EMA in the European Union for any medical indication and is on the list of unapproved drugs that is still prescribed by clinicians.[ref]
