==History==

In 1997, the foundation was formed as the William H. Gates Foundation with an initial stock gift of US$94 million. The foundation was renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after a merger with the Gates Learning Foundation in 2000 when the Gates gave an additional US$126 million.Foundation Timeline and History – Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationGates' historical legacy may focus more on philanthropy than on Microsoft - Computerworld During the foundation's following years, funding grew to US$2 billion. On June 15, 2006, Gates announced his plans to transition out of a day-to-day role with Microsoft, effective July 31, 2008,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx|title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates|publisher=Microsoft PressPass|date=2006-06-15[/tpl] to allow him to devote more time to working with the foundation.
Bill and Melinda Gates, along with the musician Bono, were named by Time as Persons of the Year 2005 for their charitable work. In the case of Bill and Melinda Gates, the work referenced was that of this foundation.
In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he asked the students to take on the hard problems of the world in their futures. He also explained the nature and philosophy of his philanthropic endeavors.[ref]Guo, Jeff; McQueen, Rob,

===Warren Buffett donation===

On June 25, 2006, Warren Buffett (then the world's richest person, estimated worth of US$62 billion as of April 16, 2008) pledged to give the foundation approximately 10 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares spread over multiple years through annual contributions, with the first year's donation of 500,000 shares being worth approximately US$1.5 billion.[tpl]cite news|title=Warren Buffett gives away his fortune|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity1.fortune/index.htm|date=2008-03-05|work=Fortune| publisher=Time Warner via CNNMoney.com|accessdate=2007-12-10 | first=Carol J. | last=Loomis| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071128090517/http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity1.fortune/index.htm?| archivedate=28 November 2007 | deadurl=no[/tpl] Buffett set conditions so that these contributions do not simply increase the foundation's endowment, but effectively work as a matching contribution, doubling the Foundation's annual giving: "Buffett's gift came with three conditions for the Gates foundation: Bill or Melinda Gates must be alive and active in its administration; it must continue to qualify as a charity; and each year it must give away an amount equal to the previous year's Berkshire gift, plus an additional amount equal to 5 percent of net assets. Buffett gave the foundation two years to abide by the third requirement."http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=axbiyJ8O.yKk&refer=top_world_news http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=7451 http://www.forbes.com/home/facesinthenews/2006/06/26/buffett-gates-philanthropy-cx_cn_0626autofacescan03.html  The Gates Foundation received 5% (500,000) of the shares in July 2006 and will receive 5% of the remaining earmarked shares in the July of each following year (475,000 in 2007, 451,250 in 2008).[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/25/magazines/fortune/charity3.fortune/index.htm | work=CNN | title=How Buffett's giveaway will work | date=2006-06-25 | accessdate=2010-04-26 | first=Carol J. | last=Loomis[/tpl]http://berkshirehathaway.com/donate/bmgfltr.pdf In July 2013, Buffet announced another donation of his company's Class B, this time in the amount worth $2 billion, is going to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Warren Buffett Makes Huge Charity Stock Donation To Gates Foundation, Other Charities.

==Financials==

The Foundation explains on its website that its trustees divided the organization into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (foundation) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust (trust). The foundation section, based in Seattle, US, "focuses on improving health and alleviating extreme poverty," and its trustees are Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. The trust section manages "the investment assets and transfer proceeds to the foundation as necessary to achieve the foundation’s charitable goals"—it holds the assets of Bill and Melinda Gates, who are the sole trustees, and receives contributions from Buffett.[tpl]cite web|title=Who We Are - Financials|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Financials|work=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|publisher=Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=6 April 2014|year=2014[/tpl]

==Global Development Division==

Christopher Elias leads the Foundation's efforts to combat extreme poverty through grants as president of the Global Development Program.[tpl]cite web|title=Who We Are -  Leadership CHRISTOPHER ELIAS PRESIDENT|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Management-Committee/Christopher-Elias|work=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|publisher=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|accessdate=6 April 2014|year=2014[/tpl]
In March 2006, the Foundation announced a US$5 million grant for the International Justice Mission (IJM), a human rights organization based in Washington, D.C., US to work in the area of sex trafficking. The official announcement explained that the grant would allow the IJM to "create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery" that would involve the opening of an office in a region with high rates of sex trafficking, following research. The office was opened for three years for the following purposes: "conducting undercover investigations, training law enforcement, rescuing victims, ensuring appropriate aftercare, and seeking perpetrator accountability."[tpl]cite web|title=Gates Foundation Awards $5 Million to Fight Sex Trafficking|url=http://www.philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/gates-foundation-awards-5-million-to-fight-sex-trafficking|work=Philanthropy News Digest|publisher=Foundation Center|accessdate=6 April 2014|date=21 March 2006[/tpl]
The IJM used the grant money to found "Project Lantern" and established an office in the Philippines city of Cebu. In 2010 the results of the project were published, in which the IJM stated that Project Lantern had led to "an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases, an increase in commitment to resolving sex trafficking cases among law enforcement officers trained through the project, and an increase in services – like shelter, counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors." At the time that the results were released, the IJM was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions.[tpl]cite web|title=Project Lantern: Game-Changing Results in the Fight Against Trafficking|url=http://www.ijm.org/projectlantern|work=IJM|publisher=IJM|accessdate=6 April 2014|year=2010[/tpl]

===Financial services for the poor===

===Agricultural development===

===Global Special Initiatives===

The Foundation's Special Initiatives include responses to catastrophes as well as learning grants that are used to experiment with new areas of giving. Currently, the Foundation is exploring water, hygiene, and sanitation as a new focus within Global Development.
Open defecation poses significant health and environmental risks, and creates vulnerability, particularly for non adult males, who are exposed to a loss of dignity, abuse, or harassment while defecating in the open. Globally, poor sanitation contributes to 1.5 million child deaths each year from diarrheal disease; in India alone, diarrhea kills one child per minute (UNICEF/WHO, 2009). Diarrhea is also a major cause of death for children and chronic diarrhea affects a child's development by impeding their health and nutrition, and hindering vaccine absorption. Poverty, ill health, and an overall poor quality of life are concurrent factors for such people.
The Foundation has called on grantees to design a standalone toilet unit—without piped-in water, a sewer connection, or outside electricity— with a facility cost target of less than five cents per person, per day. The RTTC is also working to improve waste handling from collection and treatment. Funded by the Foundation, scientists at University of Colorado have developed a composting toilet that uses solar heat to treat the fecal matter and produce char.[tpl]cite web|title=World’s First Solar Powered Toilet to be unveiled in India this month|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/03/worlds-first-solar-powered-toilet-to-be-unveiled-in-india-this-month/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=14 March 2014[/tpl]

Under President Allan Golston, the United States Program has made grants such as the following:

===Libraries===

In 1997, the charity introduced a U.S. Libraries initiative with a goal of "ensuring that if you can get to a public library, you can reach the internet." Only 35% of the world’s population has access to the Internet.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (2014). “What We Do: Global Libraries Strategy Overview.” The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

==Lifespan==

In October 2006 the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was split into two entities: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which manages the endowment assets and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which "... conducts all operations and grantmaking work, and it is the entity from which all grants are made."Gates Foundation Announces That It Doesn't Plan to Operate ForeverAbout the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust Also announced was the decision to "... spend all of Trust's resources within 20Interview with Bill Gates September 21, 2013 (Video 33:52) years after Bill's and Melinda's deaths."Announcements - Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationThe Chronicle, 11/29/2006: Gates Foundation Announces That It Doesn't Plan to Operate ForeverGates foundation to spend all assets within 50 years of trustees' deathsGates Foundation Sets Its Lifespan This would close the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust and effectively end the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In the same announcement it was reiterated that Warren Buffett "... has stipulated that the proceeds from the Berkshire Hathaway shares he still owns at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled."
The plan to close the Foundation Trust is in contrast to most large charitable foundations that have no set closure date. This is intended to lower administrative costs over the years of the Foundation Trust's life and ensure that the Foundation Trust not fall into a situation where the vast majority of its expenditures are on administrative costs, including salaries, with only token amounts contributed to charitable causes.

==Criticism==

===Investments===

The foundation trust invests undistributed assets, with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the Foundation is attempting to relieve poverty.Report: Gates Foundation Causing Harm With the Same Money It Uses To Do Good, Democracy Now!, January 09, 2007  These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.Dark cloud over good works of Gates Foundation, Los Angeles Times, January 7, 2007
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.Gates Foundation to review investments, The Seattle Times, January 10, 2007 It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.Foundation to maintain its investment plan, The Austin Statesman, January 14, 2007

===Diversion of health care resources===

The Foundation has donated millions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. However, investigations in 2007 from Foreign AffairsThe Challenge of Global Health Foreign Affairs, January/February 2007 and Los Angeles Times[tpl]Cite news|last1=Piller|first1=Charles|last2=Smith|first2=Doug|title=Unintended victims of Gates Foundation generosity|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=2007-12-16|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gates16dec16,0,6256166,full.story?coll=la-home-center[/tpl] claimed there were three major problems with the foundation's allocation of aid. First, "by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS, Gates guarantees have increased the demand for specially trained, higher-paid clinicians, diverting staff from basic care." This form of "brain drain", pulls away trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers.  Second, "the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation…." Finally, "Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations cannot prevent."

===Education reform===

The public school reform program of the Gates Foundation has come under criticism by education professionals, parents, and researchers for promoting reforms that they see as undermining public education. The reforms include closing neighborhood schools in favor of privately run charter schools; using standardized test scores extensively to evaluate students, teachers, and schools; and merit pay for teachers based on test scores. Critics also believe that the Gates Foundation exerts too much influence over public education policy without being accountable to voters or tax payers.

===Grantee communication===

A 2011 survey of grantees found that many believed the foundation did not make its goals and strategies clear and sometimes did not understand those of the grantees; that the foundation's decision- and grantmaking procedures were too opaque; and that its communications could be more consistent and responsive. The foundation's response was to improve the clarity of its explanations, make "orientation calls" to grantees upon awarding grants, tell grantees who their foundation contact is, give timely feedback when they receive a grantee report, and establish a way for grantees to provide anonymous or attributed feedback to the foundation.Improving our Work with You: A Progress Report - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
