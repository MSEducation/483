[[Wildcat formation]]

CATEGORIES: American football formations, American football strategy, American football terminology

Wildcat formation describes a formation for the offense in gridiron football in which the ball is snapped not to the quarterback but directly to a running back.  The Wildcat features an unbalanced offensive line and looks to the defense like a sweep behind zone blocking.  A player moves across the formation prior to the snap.  However, once this player crosses the position of the running back who will receive the snap, the play develops unlike the sweep.
Defending against the Wildcat is straightforward, but the defense does not always identify that a play will use the Wildcat, and preparing to defend against it may take practice time away from other preparation.  If a defense interprets the Wildcat as a regular sweep play to one side, it may reduce its defense of the weak side and make it easier for the running back to advance the ball by running to that side.
The Wildcat is a gambit rather than an overall offensive philosophy.  It can be a part of many offenses.  For example, a spread-option offense might use the Wildcat formation to keep the defense guessing, or a West Coast offense may use the power-I formation to threaten a powerful run attack.
The Wildcat scheme was invented by Billy Ford and Ryan Wilson, and was originally called the "Dual" formation.  It has been used since the late 1990s at every level of the game, including the CFL, NFL, NCAA, NAIA, and many high schools across North America.  Specific coaching staffs have used it with various innovations and have given their versions a variety of names.

==History==

One possible precursor to the wildcat formation was named the "wing-T",[tpl]cite web|first=David |last=Waldstein |url=http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2008/12/wildcat_offense_is_actually_a.html |title=Wildcat offense is actually a form of the single wing, with deep Jersey roots |publisher=Advance Publications |work=Nj.com:The Star-Ledger website |date=December 26, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl]"'Wildcat' offense rooted in football's past"[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2009[/tpl] and is widely credited to being first implemented by Coach Tubby Raymond and Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&q=Tubby+Raymond+wing+t |title=Google Book results on Tubby Raymond's Wing-T contribution |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-21068370.html |title=Interview with Tubby Raymond on Wing-T |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=August 1, 1998 |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbforyouth.com/wing-t.html |title=Basic Wing-T |publisher=Fbforyouth.com |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl] Tubby Raymond later wrote a book on the innovative formation. The wildcat's similarity to the wing-T is the focus on series football, where the initial movements of every play look similar. For example, the wing-T makes use of motion across the formation as well in order to draw a reaction from the defense, but runs several different plays from the same look.
Another possible precursor[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] to the wildcat is the offense of Six-Man Football, a form of high school football, played mostly in rural West Texas and Montana, that was developed in 1934. In six-man, the person who receives the snap may not run the ball past the line of scrimmage. To bypass this limitation, teams often snap the ball to a receiver, who then tosses the ball to the potential passer. The passer may then throw the ball to a receiver or run with the ball himself.
The virtue of having a running back take the snap in the wildcat formation is that the rushing play is 11-on-11, although different variations have the running back hand off or throw the football.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]  In a standard football formation, when the quarterback stands watching, the offense operates 10-on-11 basis. The motion also presents the defense with an immediate threat to the outside that it must respect no matter what the offense decides to do with the football.

==High school==

The Wall Street Journal credited Hugh Wyatt, a longtime coach in the Pacific Northwest, with naming the offense. Wyatt, coaching the La Center (WA) High School Wildcats, published an article in Scholastic Coach and Athletic Director magazine in 1998, where he explained his version of the offense, which relied on two wing backs and two backfield players directly behind the center alternating who would receive the snap. Many other high school football programs across the United States adopted Wyatt's Wildcat offense.[tpl]cite news|first=Siebert |last=Charles |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203440104574405322525530870.html |title=Football's Subversive Side  |work=wsj.com |date= September 24, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2010[/tpl]

==College==

The wildcat was popularized on the college level by Bill Snyder, head coach of the Kansas State University Wildcats with Michael Bishop as quarterback in 1997 and 1998 when they made a run at the top of the national rankings.[tpl]cite web|first=Geek|last=Sports |url=http://www.fannation.com/blogs/post/318657-a-look-at-bill-snyders-impact-on-bob-stoops-and-urban-meyer |title=A Look at Bill Snyder's Impact on Bob Stoops and Urban Meyer |publisher=CNNSI Press |work=cnnsi.com |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate= January 6, 2012[/tpl] Bishop rushed for 1304 career yards in two seasons, including 748 yards on 177 carries during the '98 season. As stated in the previous article, this type of offense was the catalyst for Urban Meyer's offense during the start of his career. It was Meyer's success with quarterback Tim Tebow that helped the formation come to the forefront. 
The wildcat has been continued by current Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, and former Ole Miss Rebels offensive coordinator David Lee when they were offensive coordinators for the Arkansas Razorbacks after seeing the success of Bill Snyder and Urban Meyer. In 2006, Malzahn was the offensive coordinator for the Razorbacks. Malzahn introduced the wildcat into the Arkansas offense. When Malzahn left for Tulsa in 2007, Lee became the offensive coordinator for the Razorbacks. Both Malzahn and Lee ran a variation of the wildcat formation which prominently featured running backs Darren McFadden and Felix Jones. The wildcat formation was sometimes called the "wildhog" (in honor of the Razorback mascot at the University of Arkansas) and subsequently rebranded as the "Wild Rebel"[tpl]cite web|first=Mike |last=Herndon |url=http://www.gulflive.com/sports/mississippipress/index.ssf?/base/sports/1220523324171890.xml&coll=5 |title=Nutt: Wild Rebel is here to stay |publisher=The Mississippi Press |work=Gulflive.com |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl] when Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt went to Ole Miss as head coach (Ole Miss' mascot being the Rebels), and a variation involving a direct snap to a tight end has also been called the "Wild Turkey" popularized by the Virginia Tech Hokies.
Several other college teams have used the wildcat formation regularly, including the wildcats of Kansas State, Kentucky, and Villanova, as well as the Pitt Panthers. Pitt had great success with the formation having star running back LeSean McCoy or running back LaRod Stephens-Howling take the snap. The Panthers scored numerous times from this formation during those years.[tpl]Cite news|last=Starkey |first=Joe |url= http://insider.espn.go.com/ncf/insider/news/story?id=3026825&action=login&appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fncf%2finsider%2fnews%2fstory%3fid%3d3026825 |title=Pitt employing wildcat offense to alleviate QB woes |work=Insider.espn.go.com |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2008[/tpl] Kentucky has successfully run the formation with wide receiver Randall Cobb taking the snaps. This formation is frequently called the "WildCobb" and is often very successful given the fact that Cobb also started numerous games at quarterback for Kentucky during his first year. Villanova won the 2009 FCS championship with a multiple offense that included the wildcat, with wide receiver Matt Szczur taking the snap. Szczur scored a key touchdown in the Wildcats' semifinal against William & Mary out of the formation,[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293450222 |title=Villanova advances to school's first FCS championship game |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=December 11, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl] and made a number of big plays out of the wildcat against Montana in the final.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.ncaa.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/121809aaa.html |title=Villanova Takes Home First National Title With 23–21 Comeback Win Over Montana |first=Kyle |last=Kensing |publisher=NCAA.com |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl]
UCF also uses a wildcat formation they call the "Wild Knight".Embattled UCF quarterback Rob Calabrese thrives as `Wild Knight' It was originally intended to be run by Rob Calabrese, even after he lost the starting job in 2010 to Jeff Godfrey, but he tore his ACL using the play to score a rushing touchdown against Marshall on October 13, 2010.UCF storms past Marshall At the time, most agreed that Calabrese was effective at running the Wild Knight formation.

==National Football League==

The wildcat formation made an appearance in 1998, when Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator Brian Billick began employing formations where QB Randall Cunningham lined-up as a wide receiver and third-down specialist David Palmer took the direct snap from the center with the option to pass or run.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-26/sports/9811260021_1_minnesota-vikings-offensive-coordinator-randy-moss-video | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Don | last=Pierson | title=It Computes: Billick's Ideas, Vikings' Talent Equal No. 1 | date=November 26, 1998[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-17/sports/9901160178_1_vikings-lost-vikings-make-down-the-vikings |title=Vikings plan to pump it up vs. Falcons in title game |newspaper=Baltimore Sun |date=January 17, 1999 |accessdate=2012-10-13[/tpl]  
In the 1998 NFC Championship, with 7:58 to go in the third quarter, on a second and 5 play, the Atlanta Falcons deployed quarterback Chris Chandler wide left as a receiver while receiver Tim Dwight took a direct snap and ran 20 yards for a first down.1998 NFC Championship Game highlights from YouTube
In a December 24, 2006 game between the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons, the Panthers deployed a formation without a quarterback and snapped the ball directly to running back DeAngelo Williams for much of the game.[tpl]cite web|first=Charles |last=Odum |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap?gid=20061224001 |title=Panthers 10, Falcons 3 |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=December 22, 2008[/tpl] The Panthers ran the ball—mostly in this formation—for the first twelve plays of the opening drive, and ran the ball 52 times, with only 7 passing plays. The offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers at the time, Dan Henning, later developed this concept into the wildcat as the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins.[tpl]cite web|last=Graham |first=Tim |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/396/miami-coaches-had-wildcat-familiarity |title=Miami coaches had 'Wildcat' familiarity |publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2012-10-13[/tpl]
Relying on the experience of quarterbacks coach David Lee who had run the scheme at Arkansas, the 2008 Miami Dolphins under Henning implemented the wildcat offense beginning in the third game of the 2008 season with great success, instigating a wider trend throughout the NFL.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://swsentinel.blogspot.com/2008/12/dolphins-using-wildcat-formation-to.html |title=Dolphins using wildcat formation to great success |publisher=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |work=Swsentinel.blogspot.com |date=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lloydvance.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/dolphins-breakout-wildcat-offense-in-their-first-win/ |title=Dolphins Breakout Wildcat Offense in Their First Win |work=Lloydvance.wordpress.com |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2008[/tpl] The Dolphins started the wildcat trend in the NFL lining up either running back Ronnie Brown (in most cases) or Ricky Williams to take a shotgun snap with the option of handing off, running, or throwing. Through eleven games, the wildcat averaged over seven yards per play for the Dolphins. "It could be the single wing, it could be the Delaware split buck business that they used to do," Dolphins offensive coordinator Dan Henning said. "It comes from all of that."[tpl]Cite news|last=Wine |first=Steven |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/October 9, 2008-3490998596_x.htm |title=Dolphins help single wing make comeback |work=Usatoday.com |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] On September 21, 2008, the Miami Dolphins used the wildcat offense against the New England Patriots on six plays, which produced 5 touchdowns (four rushing and one passing—from Ronnie Brown himself) in a 38–13 upset victory.
As the popularity of the wildcat spread during the 2008 NFL season, several teams began instituting it as a part of their playbook.
Defending plays from the wildcat requires linemen and linebackers to know and execute their own assignments without over-pursuing what may turn into a fake or a reverse. The formation's initial success in 2008 can be attributed in part to surprise—defenses had not practiced their countermeasures against such an unusual offensive strategy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]  Since then, most teams are well prepared to stop the wildcat; an example came in November 2008 when the Patriots traveled to Miami nine weeks after the Dolphins win in Foxboro; Bill Belichick's defense limited the wildcat to just 27 yards and forced the Dolphins to try a conventional passing attack;[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] the game lead changed six times but the Patriots wore out the Dolphins with a 48–28 win.
Though defenses now understand how to stop the wildcat, it does not mean the formation is no longer useful. A defense's practice time is finite. Opponents who prepare to stop the wildcat have less time available to prepare for other offensive approaches. Many teams admit to spending an inordinate amount of time having to prepare for this scheme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/sports/ci_10809708?nclick_check=1|title=Raiders' wildcat formation might not work against Ravens|date=October 24, 2008|work=MercuryNews.com; San Jose Mercury News website|publisher=Media News Group[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Somers |first=Kent |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/2008/11/12/20081112spt-cards.html |title=Pahokee a wild card for Cards |work=Azcentral.com |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2008[/tpl]
Other teams that use the wildcat formation in the NFL may use different names for their versions. For example, the Carolina Panthers call their version the 'Mountaineer formation', named after the Appalachian State Mountaineers, the alma mater of their wildcat quarterback Armanti Edwards, who played quarterback for the Mountaineers. The Denver Broncos utilize 'Wild Horses', developed in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/271951-dissecting-the-wild-horses-success-of-the-denver-broncos |title=Dissecting the "Wild Horses" Success of the Denver Broncos |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=October 14, 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-13[/tpl] The New York Jets referred to their version as the Tigercat formation in reference to Brad Smith having attended the University of Missouri when Smith played for New York from 2009–2010. The 2011 Minnesota Vikings referred to their formation as the "Blazer package" which employed former UAB Blazers quarterback Joe Webb.

==Canadian Football League==

Until the 2009 season, a technicality in the league rules made the wildcat offense illegal; essentially, the rule stated that a designated quarterback must be in position to take all snaps. This has since been changed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=278370 |title=CFL UNVEILS NEW RULE CHANGES BASED ON SUGGESTIONS FROM FANS |date=May 11, 2009 |publisher=The Sports Network| accessdate=May 11, 2009[/tpl]
