North Carolina Highway 186 (NC 186) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina.  Entirely in Northampton County, it helps facilitate truck traffic parallel to Interstate 95 and connect the communities of Seaboard and Margarettsville.

==Route description==

NC 186 is a two-lane rural highway that traverses [tpl]convert|23.4|mi|km[/tpl] from NC 45, near Gaston, to the Virgina state line, near Margarettsville.  The first [tpl]convert|3.4|mi|km[/tpl] parallel Interstate 95 before joining NC 48 towards Garysburg.  Once in Garysburg, its concurrency with NC 48 ends and then briefly overlaps with US 301 before heads in a northeasterly direction of town.  It then proceeds to connect Gumberry, Seaboard and Margarettsville, before crossing the state line into Virginia, becoming SR 186, and heading towards Boykins.

==History==

Established around 1975 as a renumbering of NC 195; the number change was to match with Virginia's SR 186, which was originally SR 195 before I-195 was established in Richmond, Virginia, around 1970.  Remained unchanged until May 21, 2013, when it was extended west from its former terminus at US 301 to NC 48.  The justification for the extension was to help facilitate truck traffic and serve the Northampton Commerce Park and Enviva Industrial Facility, on what is now formally SR 1200 (Lebanon Church Road and James Jones Road); also as an alternate route for I-95 in the event traffic has to be rerouted.[tpl]cite web |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation |url= https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Route%20Changes/2013_05_21.pdf |format= PDF |title= NC 186 Route Change (2013-05-21)|date= May 21, 2013 |accessdate= June 13, 2013[/tpl]
