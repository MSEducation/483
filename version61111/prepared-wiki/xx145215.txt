[[Hemipsilichthys]]

CATEGORIES: Loricariidae, Fish of South America

Hemipsilichthys is a genus of catfishes belonging to the family Loricariidae. These wide-mouthed freshwater catfishes are restricted to southeast Brazil in the Paraíba do Sul, Perequê-Áçu and Taquari river basins. Hemipsilichthys, along with Delturus, form a clade (Delturinae). In these two genera, members have a ridge behind their dorsal fin and an adipose fin membrane. However, in Hemipsilichthys, the dorsal fin membrane and most anterior plate of the adipose fin do not touch, while they do in Delturus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Upsilodus/Upsilodus.html|title=Upsilodus|last=Armbruster|first=Jonathan W.|accessdate=2007-05-07[/tpl]
