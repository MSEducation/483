==Biography==

===Early years===

Bonham was born on 31 May 1948, in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, to Joan and Jack Bonham. He began learning to play drums at the age of five, making a drum kit out of containers and coffee tins, imitating his idols Max Roach, Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. His mother gave him a snare drum at the age of ten. He received his first proper drum kit from his father at fifteen, a Premier Percussion set. Bonham never took any formal drum lessons, though as a teen he would get advice from other Redditch drummers. Between 1962 and 1963, while still at school, Bonham joined the Blue Star Trio,[tpl]cite book|last=Welch|first=Chris|year=2001|title=John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums|page=19|isbn=0-87930-658-0|publisher=Backbeat|location=San Francisco, Calif.[/tpl] and Gerry Levene & the Avengers.[tpl]cite book|last=Bonham|first=Mick|year=2005|title=John Bonham: The Powerhouse Behind Led Zeppelin|page=31|isbn=1-904915-11-6|publisher=Southbank Publ.|location=London[/tpl]
Bonham attended Lodge Farm Secondary Modern School, where his headmaster once wrote in his school report card that "He will either end up a dustman or a millionaire".Ian Fortnam, "Dazed & confused", Classic Rock Magazine: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin, 2008, p. 38.Chris Welch and Geoff Nicholls (2001), John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums, page 15.Google books (limited extracts) Retrieved 7 September 2008 After leaving school in 1964, he worked for his father as an apprentice carpenterChris Welch and Geoff Nicholls (2001), John Bonham: A Thunder of Drums, page 18.Google books (limited extracts) Retrieved 7 September 2008 in between drumming for different local bands. In 1964, Bonham joined his first semi-professional band, Terry Webb and the Spiders, and met his future wife Pat Phillips around the same time. He also played in other Birmingham bands such as The Nicky James Movement and The Senators, who released a moderately successful single "She's a Mod," in 1964. Bonham then took up drumming full-time. Two years later, he joined A Way of Life, but the band soon became inactive. Desperate for a regular income, he joined a blues group called Crawling King Snakes, whose lead singer was a young Robert Plant.
In 1967, A Way of Life asked Bonham to return to the group, and he agreed—though throughout this period, Plant kept in contact with Bonham. When Plant decided to form Band of Joy, Bonham was first choice as drummer. The band recorded a number of demos but no album. In 1968 American singer Tim Rose toured Britain and invited Band of Joy to open his concerts. When Rose returned for another tour months later, Bonham was formally invited by the singer to drum for his band, which gave him a regular income.

===Led Zeppelin===

After the break-up of The Yardbirds, guitarist Jimmy Page was forming a new band when he recruited Robert Plant, who in turn suggested Bonham. Page's choices for drummer included Procol Harum's B.J. Wilson, and session drummers Clem Cattini and Aynsley Dunbar. Ginger Baker was also rumoured to be on Page's list. However, upon seeing Bonham drum for Tim Rose at a club in Hampstead, north London, in July 1968, Page and manager Peter Grant were instantly convinced that he was the perfect fit for the new project, first known as the New Yardbirds and later as Led Zeppelin.Mat Snow, “Apocalypse Then”, Q magazine, December 1990, p. 76.
Despite an intensive campaign to snare the drummer, Bonham was initially reluctant to join the band.[tpl]cite web |url= [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4739|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title= Led Zeppelin Biography| accessdate=11 November 2008 |last= Erlewine|first= Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Plant sent eight telegrams to Bonham's pub, the "Three Men in a Boat", in Walsall, which were followed by 40 telegrams from Grant. However, at the same time he was also receiving lucrative offers from established artists Joe Cocker and Chris Farlowe. Eventually, Bonham accepted Grant's offer. He later recalled, "I decided I liked their music better than Cocker's or Farlowe's."[tpl]cite journal |last=Davis |first=Stephen |title = Power, Mystery And The Hammer Of The Gods: The Rise and Fall of Led Zeppelin |journal = Rolling Stone |issue=451 |date=4 July 1985 |url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ledzeppelin/articles/story/17537975/power_mystery_and_the_hammer_of_the_gods |accessdate=15 January 2008 [/tpl]
During Led Zeppelin's first tour of the United States in December 1968, Bonham became friends with Vanilla Fudge's drummer Carmine Appice. Appice introduced him to Ludwig Drums, which he then used for the rest of his career. Bonham used the longest and heaviest sticks available, which he referred to as "trees." His hard hitting style was displayed to great effect on many Led Zeppelin songs, including "Immigrant Song" (Led Zeppelin III), "When the Levee Breaks" (Led Zeppelin IV / 70px), "Kashmir" (Physical Graffiti), "The Ocean" (Houses of the Holy), and "Achilles Last Stand" (Presence). In fact, Page once admitted to letting Bonham use a double bass drum in an early demo of "Communication Breakdown" but claimed he scratched the track because of Bonham's "over-use" of it. The studio recording of "Misty Mountain Hop" perfectly captures his keen sense of dynamics, and this is similarly exhibited by his precise drumming on "No Quarter". On several cuts from later albums, Bonham rather adeptly handled funk and Latin-influenced drumming. Songs like "Royal Orleans" and "Fool in the Rain" are good examples, respectively displaying great skill with a New Orleans shuffle and a samba rhythm.
His famous drum solo, first entitled "Pat's Delight," later renamed "Moby Dick", would often last for 30 minutes and regularly featured his use of bare hands to achieve different sound effects. Bonham's action sequence for the film, The Song Remains the Same, featured him in a drag race at Santa Pod Raceway to the sound of his signature drum solo, "Moby Dick". In Led Zeppelin concert tours after 1969, Bonham would expand his basic kit to include congas, orchestral timpani, and a symphonic gong. Bonham is also credited (by the Dallas Times Herald) with the first in-concert use of electronic timpani drum synthesisers (most likely made by Syndrum) during a performance of the song "Kashmir" in Dallas, Texas in 1977. Many modern rappers would later heavily sample his drumming and incorporate it into their compositions, such as Beastie Boys, who sampled "Moby Dick," "The Ocean," and "When the Levee Breaks."Duffell, Daniel. Making Music with Samples (2005): 181
During his time with Led Zeppelin, Bonham was also an avid collector of antique sports cars and motorcycles, which he kept on his family's farm called The Old Hyde. He bought The Plough pub in the nearby village of Shenstone, which shows signs of conversion work to allow him to drive his bikes or cars right behind the bar. This was not the pub featured in the film The Song Remains the Same. It was the New Inn, which is currently boarded up, the only clue to its famous past being a picture hanging close to the bar.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]

===Work outside Led Zeppelin===

As well as recording with Led Zeppelin, Bonham also found time to play on sessions for other artists. In 1969 Bonham appeared on The Family Dogg's A Way of Life, with Page and Jones. Bonham also sessioned for Screaming Lord Sutch on his album Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends in 1970. He played drums on Lulu's 1971 song "Everybody Clap," written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972 he played drums on a Maurice Gibb produced album by Jimmy Stevens called Don't Freak Me Out in the UK and Paid My Dues in the US, credited as Gemini (given his star sign).  Later in his career, Bonham drummed for his Birmingham friend, Roy Wood, on his 1979 album, On the Road Again, and on Wings' album Back to the Egg on the tracks "Rockestra Theme" and "So Glad to See You Here". Bonham was the best man of Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi at his wedding ceremony.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/GeezerButlerInterview.html |title=The Geezer Butler Interview |publisher=Classicbands.com |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl]
In 1974, Bonham appeared in the film Son of Dracula, playing drums in Count Downe's (Harry Nilsson) backing band. This was an Apple film directed by Freddie Francis. Bonham appeared in an overcrowded drum line-up including Keith Moon and Ringo Starr on the soundtrack album.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Death===

On 24 September 1980, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios for an upcoming tour of the United States—the band's first since 1977. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodkas (sixteen shots, between 400–560 ml). He then continued to drink heavily after arriving at the rehearsals. They stopped rehearsing late in the evening and the band retired to Page's house, the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight on 25 September, Bonham fell asleep; someone took him to bed and placed him on his side. Benji LeFevre (who had replaced Richard Cole as Led Zeppelin's tour manager) and John Paul Jones found him dead the next afternoon.Chris Welch (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. ISBN 1-85797-930-3, pp. 92–94. Bonham was 32 years old.
At the coroner's inquest it emerged that in the 24 hours before he died, Bonham consumed approximately forty shots (1-1.4 liters) of 40% ABV vodka, after which he vomited and aspirated the vomitus, causing asphyxiation. A verdict of accidental death was returned at the inquest, held on 27 October 1980. An autopsy found no other drugs in Bonham's body.John Bonham Biography John Bonham's body was cremated and his ashes were interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock Parish Church, Worcestershire. His headstone reads:

Despite media rumours that drummers including Cozy Powell, Phil Collins, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Roger Taylor, Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan, among others, would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband Led Zeppelin after Bonham's death. They issued a press statement on 4 December 1980, confirming that the band would not continue without their drummer. "We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend and the deep respect we have for his family, together with the sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were." It was simply signed "Led Zeppelin".[tpl]cite journal | title=No Way Out| year=2005 | author=Mick Wall | page= 86 [/tpl]

===Family===

John Bonham had two siblings; his younger brother, Mick Bonham (1950-2000), was a disc jockey, author and photographer and his younger sister, Deborah Bonham (born in 1962) is a singer-songwriter.
Bonham was married to Pat Phillips, and the couple had two children; his daughter Zoë Bonham (born 10 June 1975), is a singer-songwriter and also appears regularly at Led Zeppelin conventions and awards, and his son Jason Bonham (born 15 July 1966), a rock drummer who has gained success with various bands including UFO, Foreigner, and Bonham. He previously played in a band called Black Country Communion which included Glenn Hughes, Derek Sherinian, and Joe Bonamassa. They recorded an album called Black Country in 2010. On 10 December 2007, he played with Led Zeppelin on the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, as well as their previous reunion at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary show on 15 May 1988. A 1970 film clip of a four-year-old Jason playing drums appears in the Led Zeppelin film The Song Remains the Same. Zoë and Jason appeared at the induction ceremony for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 along with the surviving members of Led Zeppelin.

===Awards and accolades===

While Bonham is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential rock drummers by other musicians and commentators in the industry, he continues to receive the greatest acclaim from fans, and several opinion polls and critic lists continue to list him in first place before any other drummer in rock history. In 2007, Stylus magazine rated Bonham number 1 on its list of the 50 greatest rock drummers, as did the online music magazine Gigwise.com in 2008, and a Rolling Stone reader's poll where he "led the list by a significant margin" in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/rolling-stone-readers-pick-best-drummers-of-all-time-20110208|title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick Best Drummers of All Time|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=February 2011|publisher=Rolling Stone magazine|accessdate=12 February 2011[/tpl] Bonham was ranked at no. 1 on Classic Rock's 2005 list of "50 Greatest Drummers in Rock",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/classicrock.htm |title=Classic Rock Magazine Lists |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] and Modern Drummer magazine describes him as "the greatest rock 'n' roll drummer in history." In September 2008, Bonham topped the Blabbermouth.net's list of "Rockers fans want brought back to life", ahead of Elvis Presley and Freddie Mercury.John Bonham tops list of rockers fans want brought back to life. Music Radar Rhythm magazine voted him the greatest drummer ever, topping their reader's poll to determine the "50 greatest drummers of all time" for its October 2009 issue.50 greatest drummers of all time: part 2. MusicRadar. At the end of the BBC Two series I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band! on 5 June 2010, John Bonham was named the best drummer of all time.Radio 2 – Rock And Roll Band. BBC
John Bonham has been described by Allmusic as one of the most important, well-known and influential drummers in rock. Adam Budofsky, managing editor of Modern Drummer magazine, writes "If the king of rock 'n' roll was Elvis Presley, then the king of rock drumming was certainly John Bonham."Adam Budofsky, The drummer: 100 years of rhythmic power and invention, Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 1-4234-0567-6, p.63.

===Influence on notable musicians and tributes===

Many rock drummers were influenced by John Bonham's work with Led Zeppelin. A few of them include Alex Van Halen (Van Halen), Joey Kramer [tpl]cite web|title= Drummer to Drummer Interview: Joey Kramer|author= Steven Scott Fyfe |publisher=joeykramer.com |url= http://www.joeykramer.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/naa/cdid/400064/pid/400027|accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] (Aerosmith), Lee Kerslake[tpl]cite web|title= The Fuze interviews Lee Kerslake|author= Todd Seely |publisher=bobdaisley.com |url= http://www.bobdaisley.com/interview/fuse-lee-kerslake|accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] (Uriah Heep, Ozzy Osbourne), Tony ThompsonAllMusic Biography: Neil Peart (Chic), Dave GrohlThe Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: Led Zeppelin[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] (Nirvana, Foo Fighters), Tommy LeeAllMusic Biography: Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe), Peter CrissAllMusic Biography: Peter Criss (Kiss), Chad Smith[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MWA6a9AKhzUC&pg=PA141&dq=chad+smith+interview+%2B+john+bonham |title=The drummer: 100 years of rhythmic power and invention Page 141 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=1 January 2012|isbn=9781423405672|date=2006-07-01[/tpl] (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Dave Lombardo[tpl]cite web|title= SLAYER – Interview with Drummer Dave Lombardo|author= Arto Lehtinen, Marko Syrjala|publisher=metal-rules.com |url= http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/content/view/2192/92/|accessdate=12 December 2011[/tpl] (Slayer, Fantômas) and Brad Wilkhttp://www.drummersrepublic.com/drummers/ratm-drummer-brad-wilk-biography/[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] (Rage Against the Machine, Black Sabbath).
Several of these drummers have testified to Bonham's influence, such as Roger Taylor of Queen, who stated:
 The greatest rock 'n' roll drummer of all time was John Bonham who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums—they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock`n`roll.John Bonham: Personal Quotes. IMDB 
Dave Grohl has said:
 John Bonham played the drums like someone who didn't know what was going to happen next—like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff. No one has come close to that since, and I don't think anybody ever will. I think he will forever be the greatest drummer of all time.Dave Grohl. The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time: 14) Led Zeppelin. Rolling Stone 
Similarly, Chad Smith has remarked:
 To me, hands down, John Bonham was the best rock drummer ever. The style and the sound was so identifiable to one person. Any drum set that he would play, it sounded like him.Chad Smith. John Bonham: I'm in a Rock 'n' Roll Band. BBC Two 
Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones told Guitar Player's Jas Obrecht:
 John Bonham is the best at being John Bonham and doing what he does. Or did—unfortunately, he's dead. He was the best.  There wasn't anyone better than John Bonham at doing that, and thank goodness we've got some records so that you can hear it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cuicoland.bigpondhosting.com/newslets/htmldocs/japdates/2007/20071204.html |title=Charlie Watts interviewed by Jas Obrecht |publisher=Cuicoland.bigpondhosting.com |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2011[/tpl] 
Eric Carr, former drummer of Kiss, stated:
 At least 85% of all of the rock drummers today have gotten influences from Bonham, and all have recognised how great he was.  Every band in the business – guaranteed – has tried to do something with that Bonham sound, which shows that everyone from A to Z has listened to him.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kissrocks.net/kissrocks_ericcarrinterview.html |title=Kiss Rocks' exclusive 1989 interview with Eric Carr |publisher=kissrocks.net |date=8 November 1989 |accessdate=12 December 2011[/tpl] 
Musicians other than drummers have also paid tribute to Bonham. John Paul Jones, who formed a very tight musical partnership with him as Led Zeppelin's power rhythm section, stated that Bonham was a "bass player's dream".Sam Rapallo, In Conversation with John Paul Jones, October 1997. Jimmy Page has also commented:
 One of the marvelous things about John Bonham which made things very easy a producer was the fact that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the instrument sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.National Public Radio, Guitar Legend Jimmy Page, 2 June 2003. 
A major tribute for John Bonham entitled "Bonzo: The Groove Remains the Same—A Night In Honor of John Henry Bonham" was performed on 25 September 2010—the 30th anniversary of his death.  Notable drummers that appeared at the tribute included Steven Adler, Vinny Appice, Kenny Aronoff, Frankie Banali, Fred Coury, Jimmy D'Anda, James Kottak, Chris Slade, Chad Smith, Brian Tichy, Joe Travers, Simon Wright, and John's son, Jason Bonham. Carmine Appice performed via video.Drummers Pay Tribute to Bonzo. Gibson
Bonham is also admired outside of rock music. In 1988, for example, the Pulitzer laureate Christopher Rouse composed Bonham in tribute to the drummer.

==Equipment==

===Drums===

Bonham initially used Premier drums, but in the late 1960s was introduced to Ludwig drums by Carmine Appice of Vanilla Fudge.Flans, Robyn. "Carmine Appice: Power Drumming Forever". Modern Drummer. Vol. 31 No. 4. Apr 2007 Throughout the remainder of his career, Bonham was a major endorser of Ludwig Drums. In concert, he used a wide range of different drum kits, but mostly of the same sizes. From 1970 onwards, he used a 26×14ʺ bass drum, which was the most identifiable part of his setup. He used 16×16ʺ, 18×16ʺ and (on certain live performances) a 20×18ʺ floor tom, while occasionally changing his tom sizes, which included sizes 14×12ʺ, 14×10ʺ, and 15×12ʺ.
Studio and touring kit (1969–1970)
(Bonham did have a second bass drum that can be seen in the "Communication Breakdown" promo; however, it was never used in any recordings. This double bass drum set-up was once used live during a tour with Vanilla Fudge. Also included a 20ʺ floor tom which were rarely used due to their size.)
Studio and touring kit (1970–1973)
Touring kit (1973–1975)
The drums were switched out depending upon the night and what Bonham felt like using—according to A Thunder of Drums
Touring kit (1977–1980)

===Cymbals===

Bonham used Paiste Cymbals exclusively. His cymbal setup included Paiste Giant Beat cymbals until 1970. The Paiste Endorsement Agreement shows he experimented with cymbals including the 602 series before changing to a complete set of what is now the 2002 series in '71, which he used for the rest of his career.

His Paiste "2002" series cymbal setup (1970–1980):

===Drum heads===

Bonham played Remo drum heads throughout his career. For his wood drums, he always used Remo Coated Emperors (or Ludwig equivalent) on his batter sides, while using coated ambassadors on the resonant side of his toms, and a Diplomat or clear Ambassador on the resonant side of his snare drum. The bass drums front head was always a medium weight head, for instance a Remo Coated Ambassador. The toms batter heads were always tuned medium-tight, (almost jazz-like) and the resonant head was always tuned way up, for a full, round sound. The bass drum heads were also tuned a lot higher than normal. He never put anything inside his bass drum, although his band members have said that he would sometimes line it with tin foil so that it would project, with the sound reflecting off the foil. He only used a felt strip on the batter side occasionally. 
On the Vistalites he used Remo CS black dots on the batter side of the toms and the bass drum and clear Ambassadors on the resonant side. The snare always had a coated Emperor on the batter side and an Ambassador or a Diplomat on the snare side. He sometimes used a Gretsch 42-strand snare wires to fatten the snare sound.

===Bass drum pedal===

Bonham used Ludwig Speed King Pedal (with tight spring tension) throughout his career. His trademark bass drum "triplets",—played interchangeably with doubles and singles—which are most notable in "Good Times Bad Times", were played on a single bass pedal, and not a double bass pedal. Unlike some contemporary drummers, Bonham did not use a double-bass drum kit. He did once own one (it was featured in the demo "Communication Breakdown"), but it was removed from his kit by the rest of the band. John Bonham did play double bass drums while the band was touring with the band Vanilla Fudge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Double bass drums were used on the recording of the drum solo "Bonzo's Montreux".  It is a unique approach to incorporating a second bass drum.  Bonham added a second bass drum and simply played it with his left foot the way he would normally be pedaling 1/8th notes on his hi-hat.  In sections, This creates 2 unique bass drum parts that syncopate and sometimes overlap causing both kick drums to be hit at the same time.  
It is possible to hear the squeak of the pedal in several recordings, including "Since I've Been Loving You", "The Ocean", "The Rain Song", "Over the Hills and Far Away", "Dancing Days", "The Crunge", "Houses of the Holy", "Ten Years Gone", "Bonzo's Montreux" and the live version of "I Can't Quit You Baby" on Coda and "All My Love" on In Through The Out Door. Jimmy Page later commented:

==Tribute kits==

In 2005, Ludwig began issuing Bonham reissue kits in green sparkle maple and amber Vistalite. Ludwig currently offers "Zep Kits" in their Vistalite and Classic lines, with a 26" bass drum, a 14" tom mounted on a snare stand, and 16" and 18" floor toms. In 2007 they issued a limited edition stainless steel kit similar to the ones Bonham used on the last Led Zeppelin tours in the 1970s. The stainless steel shells were manufactured by Ronn Dunnett of Dunnett Classic Drums.
