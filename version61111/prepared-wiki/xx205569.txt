Deep in the Shed is the second studio album by the blind jazz pianist Marcus Roberts, a protégé of trumpet player Wynton Marsalis. The album features Roberts playing chords on his left hand and "somewhat dark improvisations that burst into fireworks less often than you'd expect" with his right hand.[ref][tpl]cite book| last =Neil Tesser| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =1998| title =The Playboy Guide to Jazz| pages= 250, 251|publisher =Bloomsbury| url =http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&q=0747543771[/tpl]
