[[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]]

CATEGORIES: Establishments by United States executive order, 1995 establishments in the United States

The Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, or "ISCAP", provides the public and users of the classification system with a forum for further review of classification decisions. ISCAP states in order to foster a well-informed public while simultaneously protecting national security interests, checks and balances are needed over the classification system. This requires that some of the work of the U.S. Government be done outside the purview of its citizenry.
The ISCAP was created under Executive Order 12958, "Classified National Security Information," when it was signed on April 17, 1995 and held its first meeting in May 1996. Today the ISCAP receives its guidelines from Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009,  which superseded Executive Order 12958 and its amendments in full on June 25, 2010.Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995, Classified National Security Information, Federal Register - U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Vol. 60, No. 76, 20 April 1995, p.19825.
