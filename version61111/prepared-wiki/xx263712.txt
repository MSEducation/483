==The Gujarati "Old Version" Bible==

A Gujarati translation had been started by the Serampore Mission Press in 1820, and William Carey had contributed to it. James Skinner and William Fyvie of the London Missionary Society continued. These were all superseded by J. V. S. Taylor's 1861 "Old Version" which remains the standard version today.Decentering translation studies: India and beyond Judy Wakabayashi, Rita Kothari - 2009 p219 "The first Gujarati translation was undertaken by the Serampore Mission Press in 1820. Then in 1861 Rev. J. V. S. Taylor translated the Bible into Gujarati"Edward Noronaha "Christians and Kannada” in Christian contribution to Indian languages and literatures ed. S. Innasi and V. Jayadevan (eds). Madras : Mariyakam, 1994, 61-67. "Right from the start, there have been writers like JVS Taylor in the field of Grammar." J. V. S. Taylor was the first Christian Missionary to study the rules of Gujarati prosody and write hymns in the idiom, published in 1863. He was one of those who contributed to modern Gujarati.

==Hymns==

He was creator of so many religious Christian songs in Gujarati hymnal called Bhajansangrha, which are still popular with Christians in Gujarat. He is remembered for creating some songs like Pita tane parakrame (With the wish and might of my heavenly Father, hymn number 287), Maro Paalak Dev che (The Lord is my Shepherd, hymn number 18). Such song numbers are being sung in Gujarati churches with utmost spiritual enthusiasm still today. He is known as Gujarati Christian poetry's father. Gujarati hymnal Bhajansangra today includes 90 of his own created hymns and 18 translated lyrics.
