Stand Up is the second album by Jethro Tull. Before this album, the band's original guitarist Mick Abrahams resigned because of musical differences with Ian Anderson; Abrahams wanted to stay with the blues-rock sound of This Was, while Anderson wished to branch out into other musical forms. Overall, however, the album does remain more broadly in the style of blues rock than future Jethro Tull albums.
Stand Up represents the first album project on which Anderson was in full control of the music and lyrics. It also marks the first appearance of guitarist Martin Barre, who appeared on every Jethro Tull album from this point on. The album goes in a different direction from Ian Anderson's earlier work, revealing influences from Celtic, folk, and classical music. In particular, the song "Fat Man" showed an interest in unusual instrumentation, as Ian Anderson played mandolin, one of the first times the instrument had been used by a rock band. The instrumental "Bourée" (one of Jethro Tull's better-known numbers) is a jazzy re-working of "Bourrée in E minor" by J.S. Bach. Ian Anderson has said that the melody and solo in "We Used to Know" were used by the Eagles in "Hotel California" as a type of tribute. The Eagles had opened for Jethro Tull at one time.
The album reached No. 1 on the British charts.Chart The gatefold album cover, in a woodcut style designed by artist James Grashow, originally opened up like a children's pop-up book, so that a cut-out of the band's personnel stood up — evoking the album's title. Stand Up won New Musical Express's award for best album artwork in 1969.
The album was re-issued in 1973 by Chrysalis Records and again in 2001 as a digital remaster. In 1989, an MFSL remaster was released. The album was reissued on 5 Oct 2010 as a deluxe edition including six bonus tracks on disc one, and two additional discs: a disc of live material recorded at Carnegie Hall on 4 November 1970, and a disc with a DTS surround mix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8266518 |title=Jethro Tull - Stand Up CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07[/tpl]
