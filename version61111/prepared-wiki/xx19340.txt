[[Conversion factor]]

CATEGORIES: Measurement

A conversion factor changes something to a different version or form. A factor is something that brings results or a cause, while conversion is an action of changing the "version" of a thing.
In mathematics, specifically algebra, a conversion factor is used to convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the relative amount.  To accomplish this, a ratio (fraction) is established that equals one (1). In the ratio, the conversion factor is a multiplier that, when applied to the larger unit, converts the larger unit into the smaller unit, by multiplication with the measured amount.
Days are converted, to hours, by multiplying the days by the conversion factor as 24. The conversion can be reversed by dividing, the hours, by 24 to get days; however, the reciprocal 1/24 could be considered the reverse conversion factor for an hours-to-days conversion, where 1/24 ~= 0.0416666666667. Hence, the term "conversion factor" is the multiplier which yields the result, not a divisor from that viewpoint. To yield hours, the conversion factor is 24, not 1/24, so: hours = days Ã— 24 (multiplying by the factor).
