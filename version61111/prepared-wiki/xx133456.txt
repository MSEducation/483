[[The X Creatures]]

CATEGORIES: BBC television documentaries, Cryptozoological television series

The X Creatures is a British documentary television series that was produced by the BBC in 1998, which was broadcast in 1999 on BBC 1. It was presented by Chris Packham, and examined the possibility of the existence of cryptozoological creatures.
The name of the show was a reference to the popular fictional television show The X-Files. Each episode (there were six in all, each lasting 30 minutes) involved Chris Packham travelling to a certain place on Earth where the creature supposedly exists, and examining eye witness accounts, as opposed to searching for the creature. No VHS or DVD releases were ever made.

==Parodies of The X-Files==

The show parodied the popular television science fiction program The X-Files, which was particularly popular at the time. The name The X Creatures  is an obvious pun on The X-Files, as was the title sequence. Chris Packham also has a facial resemblance to The X-Files star David Duchovny.
