In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation is the expansion of space in the early universe at a rate much faster than the speed of light. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10−36 seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds. Following the inflationary period, the universe continues to expand, but at a slower rate.
The inflationary hypothesis was proposed in 1980 by American physicist Alan Guth.Chapter 17 of Peebles (1993). On 17 March 2014, astrophysicists of the BICEP2 collaboration announced the detection of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum, apparently providing strong evidence for Guth's theory of inflation.[tpl]cite web |authors=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |work=National Science Foundation |accessdate=18 March 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work=NASA |accessdate=17 March 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=17 March 2014 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=17 March 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=24 March 2014 |work=New York Times |accessdate=24 March 2014 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=BICEP2 I: Detection of B-mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales|first1=P.

Inflation explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Quantum fluctuations in the microscopic inflationary region, magnified to cosmic size, become the seeds for the growth of structure in the universe (see galaxy formation and evolution and structure formation).Tyson, Neil deGrasse and Donald Goldsmith (2004), Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, W. W. Norton & Co., pp. 84–5. Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the Universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.
While the detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is not known, the basic picture makes a number of predictions that have been confirmed by observation.[tpl]cite journal|author=Tsujikawa, Shinji|title=Introductory review of cosmic inflation|date=28 Apr 2003|journal=ArXiv.org[/tpl] The hypothetical particle or field thought to be responsible for inflation is called the inflaton.[tpl]cite book|author=Guth, Alan H.|authorlink=Alan Guth|title=The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books|pages=233–234|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7toILlSQtI0C&pg=PA233|isbn=0201328402[/tpl]

==Overview==

An expanding universe generally has a cosmological horizon, which, by analogy with the more familiar horizon caused by the curvature of the Earth's surface, marks the boundary of the part of the universe that an observer can see. Light (or other radiation) emitted by objects beyond the cosmological horizon never reaches the observer, because the space in between the observer and the object is expanding too rapidly.
The observable universe is one causal patch of a much larger unobservable universe; there are parts of the universe that cannot communicate with us yet. These parts of the universe are outside our current cosmological horizon. In the standard hot big bang model, without inflation, the cosmological horizon moves out, bringing new regions into view. Yet as a local observer sees these regions for the first time, they look no different from any other region of space the local observer has already seen: they have a background radiation that is at nearly exactly the same temperature as the background radiation of other regions, and their space-time curvature is evolving lock-step with ours. This presents a mystery: how did these new regions know what temperature and curvature they were supposed to have? They couldn't have learned it by getting signals, because they were not in communication with our past light cone before.Using Tiny Particles To Answer Giant Questions. Science Friday, 3 April 2009.See also Faster than light#Universal expansion.
Inflation answers this question by postulating that all the regions come from an earlier era with a big vacuum energy, or cosmological constant. A space with a cosmological constant is qualitatively different: instead of moving outward, the cosmological horizon stays put. For any one observer, the distance to the cosmological horizon is constant. With exponentially expanding space, two nearby observers are separated very quickly; so much so, that the distance between them quickly exceeds the limits of communications. The spatial slices are expanding very fast to cover huge volumes. Things are constantly moving beyond the cosmological horizon, which is a fixed distance away, and everything becomes homogeneous very quickly.
As the inflationary field slowly relaxes to the vacuum, the cosmological constant goes to zero, and space begins to expand normally. The new regions that come into view during the normal expansion phase are exactly the same regions that were pushed out of the horizon during inflation, and so they are necessarily at nearly the same temperature and curvature, because they come from the same little patch of space.
The theory of inflation thus explains why the temperatures and curvatures of different regions are so nearly equal.  It also predicts that the total curvature of a space-slice at constant global time is zero. This prediction implies that the total ordinary matter, dark matter, and residual vacuum energy in the universe have to add up to the critical density, and the evidence strongly supports this. More strikingly, inflation allows physicists to calculate the minute differences in temperature of different regions from quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era, and many of these quantitative predictions have been confirmed.Our Baby Universe Likely Expanded Rapidly, Study Suggests

===Space expands===

To say that space expands exponentially means that two inertial observers are moving farther apart with accelerating velocity. In stationary coordinates for one observer, a patch of an inflating universe has the following polar metric:Melia, Fulvio (2007), The Cosmic Horizon, MNRAS, 382, 1917–1921.Melia, Fulvio et al. (2009), The Cosmological Spacetime, IJMP-D, 18, 1889–1901.
Since the space–time metric has no explicit time dependence, once an observer has crossed the cosmological horizon, observers closer in take its place. This process of falling outward and replacement points closer in are always steadily replacing points further out—an exponential expansion of space–time.

===Few inhomogeneities remain===

Cosmological inflation has the important effect of smoothing out inhomogeneities, anisotropies and the curvature of space. This pushes the universe into a very simple state, in which it is completely dominated by the inflaton field, the source of the cosmological constant, and the only significant inhomogeneities are the tiny quantum fluctuations in the inflaton. Inflation also dilutes exotic heavy particles, such as the magnetic monopoles predicted by many extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics. If the universe was only hot enough to form such particles before a period of inflation, they would not be observed in nature, as they would be so rare that it is quite likely that there are none in the observable universe. Together, these effects are called the inflationary "no-hair theorem"Kolb and Turner (1988). by analogy with the no hair theorem for black holes.
The "no-hair" theorem works essentially because the cosmological horizon is no different from a black-hole horizon, except for philosophical disagreements about what is on the other side. The interpretation of the no-hair theorem is that the universe (observable and unobservable) expands by an enormous factor during inflation. In an expanding universe, energy densities generally fall, or get diluted, as the volume of the universe increases. For example, the density of ordinary "cold" matter (dust) goes down as the inverse of the volume: when linear dimensions double, the energy density goes down by a factor of eight; the radiation energy density goes down even more rapidly as the universe expands since the wavelength of each photon is stretched (redshifted), in addition to the photons being dispersed by the expansion. When linear dimensions are doubled, the energy density in radiation falls by a factor of sixteen.
During inflation, the energy density in the inflaton field is roughly constant. However, the energy density in inhomogeneities, curvature, anisotropies and exotic particles is falling, and through sufficient inflation these become negligible. This leaves an empty, flat, and symmetric universe, which is filled with radiation when inflation ends.

===Key requirement===

A key requirement is that inflation must continue long enough to produce the present observable universe from a single, small inflationary Hubble volume. This is necessary to ensure that the universe appears flat, homogeneous and isotropic at the largest observable scales. This requirement is generally thought to be satisfied if the universe expanded by a factor of at least 1026 during inflation.This is usually quoted as 60 e-folds of expansion, where e60 ≈ 1026. It is equal to the amount of expansion since reheating, which is roughly Einflation/T0, where T0 = 2.7 K is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background today. See, e.g. Kolb and Turner (1998) or Liddle and Lyth (2000).

===Reheating===

Inflation is a period of supercooled expansion, when the temperature drops by a factor of 100,000 or so. (The exact drop is model dependent, but in the first models it was typically from 1027K down to 1022K.Guth, Phase transitions in the very early universe, in The Very Early Universe, ISBN 0-521-31677-4 eds Hawking, Gibbon & Siklos) This relatively low temperature is maintained during the inflationary phase. When inflation ends the temperature returns to the pre-inflationary temperature; this is called reheating or thermalization because the large potential energy of the inflaton field decays into particles and fills the universe with Standard Model particles, including electromagnetic radiation, starting the radiation dominated phase of the Universe. Because the nature of the inflation is not known, this process is still poorly understood, although it is believed to take place through a parametric resonance.See Kolb and Turner (1988) or Mukhanov (2005).[tpl]Cite journal|title=Reheating after inflation | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/3/5/011|first=Lev|last=Kofman|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=73|issue=5|year=1994|pages=3195–3198|arxiv=hep-th/9405187|last2=Linde|first2=Andrei|last3=Starobinsky|first3=Alexei|bibcode = 1986CQGra...3..811K [/tpl]

==Motivations==

Inflation resolves several problems in the Big Bang cosmology that were discovered in the 1970s.Much of the historical context is explained in chapters 15–17 of Peebles (1993).
Inflation was first discovered by Guth while investigating the problem of why no magnetic monopoles are seen today; he found that a positive-energy false vacuum would, according to general relativity, generate an exponential expansion of space. It was very quickly realised that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look like it does today, the universe would have to have started from very finely tuned, or "special" initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation attempts to resolve these problems by providing a dynamical mechanism that drives the universe to this special state, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of the Big Bang theory.

===Horizon problem===

The horizon problem is the problem of determining why the universe appears statistically homogeneous and isotropic in accordance with the cosmological principle.[tpl]Cite journal|title=The isotropy of the universe | doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/15/2/008|first=Charles W.|last=Misner|year=1968|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=151|issue=2|pages=431|last2=Coley|first2=A A|last3=Ellis|first3=G F R|last4=Hancock|first4=M|bibcode = 1998CQGra..15..331W [/tpl][tpl]Cite book| last = Misner | first = Charles | coauthors = Thorne, Kip S. and Wheeler, John Archibald | title = Gravitation | location = San Francisco | publisher = W.

The situation is quite different in the big bang model without inflation, because gravitational expansion does not give the early universe enough time to equilibrate. In a big bang with only the matter and radiation known in the Standard Model, two widely separated regions of the observable universe cannot have equilibrated because they move apart from each other faster than the speed of light—thus have never come into causal contact: in the history of the universe, back to the earliest times, it has not been possible to send a light signal between the two regions. Because they have no interaction, it is difficult to explain why they have the same temperature (are thermally equilibrated). This is because the Hubble radius in a radiation or matter-dominated universe expands much more quickly than physical lengths and so points that are out of communication are coming into communication. Historically, two proposed solutions were the Phoenix universe of Georges Lemaître[tpl]Cite journal|last=Lemaître|first=Georges|title=The expanding universe|journal=Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles|volume=47A|pages=49|year=1933[/tpl], English in Gen. Rel. Grav. 29:641–680, 1997. and the related oscillatory universe of Richard Chase Tolman,[tpl]Cite book| author=R. C.

Their models failed, however, because of the buildup of entropy over several cycles. Misner made the (ultimately incorrect) conjecture that the Mixmaster mechanism, which made the universe more chaotic, could lead to statistical homogeneity and isotropy.

===Flatness problem===

Another problem is the flatness problem (which is sometimes called one of the Dicke coincidences, with the other being the cosmological constant problem).[tpl]Cite book|last=Dicke |first=Robert H.|title=Gravitation and the Universe |location = Philadelphia | publisher=American Philosopical Society | year = 1970[/tpl][tpl]Cite conference|title=The big bang cosmology – enigmas and nostrums|first=Robert H.|last=Dicke|coauthors=P. J. E. Peebles | year = 1979| booktitle = General Relativity: an Einstein Centenary Survey|editor=ed. S. W. Hawking and W. Israel | publisher = Cambridge University Press[/tpl] It had been known in the 1960s that the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the critical density necessary for a flat universe (that is, a universe whose large scale geometry is the usual Euclidean geometry, rather than a non-Euclidean hyperbolic or spherical geometry).[tpl]cite book|author=Alan P. Lightman|title=Ancient Light: Our Changing View of the Universe|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03363-4[/tpl][tpl]rp|61[/tpl]
Therefore, regardless of the shape of the universe the contribution of spatial curvature to the expansion of the universe could not be much greater than the contribution of matter. But as the universe expands, the curvature redshifts away more slowly than matter and radiation. Extrapolated into the past, this presents a fine-tuning problem because the contribution of curvature to the universe must be exponentially small (sixteen orders of magnitude less than the density of radiation at big bang nucleosynthesis, for example). This problem is exacerbated by recent observations of the cosmic microwave background that have demonstrated that the universe is flat to the accuracy of a few percent.What is the Universe Made Of?

===Magnetic-monopole problem===

The magnetic monopole problem (sometimes called the exotic-relics problem) says that if the early universe were very hot, a large number of very heavy[tpl]why|date=November 2012[/tpl], stable magnetic monopoles would be produced. This is a problem with Grand Unified Theories, which proposes that at high temperatures (such as in the early universe) the electromagnetic force, strong, and weak nuclear forces are not actually fundamental forces but arise due to spontaneous symmetry breaking from a single gauge theory.Since supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory is built into string theory, it is still a triumph for inflation that it is able to deal with these magnetic relics. See, e.g. Kolb and Turner (1988) and [tpl]Cite conference|title=Grand Unified Theories|first=Stuart|last=Raby|arxiv=hep-ph/0608183|booktitle=Galapagos World Summit on Physics Beyond the Standard Model|editor=ed. Bruce Hoeneisen|year=2006[/tpl] These theories predict a number of heavy, stable particles that have not yet been observed in nature. The most notorious is the magnetic monopole, a kind of stable, heavy "knot" in the magnetic field.[tpl]Cite journal|last='t Hooft|first=Gerard|title=Magnetic monopoles in Unified Gauge Theories|journal=Nuclear Physics B|volume=79|pages=276–84|year=1974|bibcode=1974NuPhB..79..276T|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(74)90486-6|issue=2[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|first=Alexander M.|last=Polyakov|title=Particle spectrum in quantum field theory|journal=JETP Letters|volume=20|pages=194–5|year=1974|bibcode = 1974JETPL..20..194P [/tpl] Monopoles are expected to be copiously produced in Grand Unified Theories at high temperature,[tpl]Cite journal|first=Alan|last2=Tye |last=Guth|first2=S. | title= Phase Transitions and Magnetic Monopole Production in the Very Early Universe|journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=44|issue=10|pages=631–635; Erratum ibid.,44:963, 1980 |year=1980|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.44.631|bibcode = 1980PhRvL..44..631G [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|first=Martin B |last=Einhorn |title=Are Grand Unified Theories Compatible with Standard Cosmology?|journal=Physical Review D|volume=21|pages=3295–3298|year=1980|bibcode=1980PhRvD..21.3295E|last2=Stein|first2=D.

A period of inflation that occurs below the temperature where magnetic monopoles can be produced would offer a possible resolution of this problem: monopoles would be separated from each other as the universe around them expands, potentially lowering their observed density by many orders of magnitude. Though, as cosmologist Martin Rees has written, "Skeptics about exotic physics might not be hugely impressed by a theoretical argument to explain the absence of particles that are themselves only hypothetical.

==History==

===Precursors===

In the early days of General Relativity, Albert Einstein introduced the cosmological constant to allow a static solution, which was a three-dimensional sphere with a uniform density of matter. A little later, Willem de Sitter found a highly symmetric inflating universe, which described a universe with a cosmological constant that is otherwise empty.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Willem|last=de Sitter|title=Einstein's theory of gravitation and its astronomical consequences. Third paper|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=78|pages=3–28|year=1917|bibcode = 1917MNRAS..78....3D [/tpl] It was discovered that Einstein's solution is unstable, and if there are small fluctuations, it eventually either collapses or turns into de Sitter's.
In the early 1970s Zeldovich noticed the serious flatness and horizon problems of big bang cosmology; before his work, cosmology was presumed to be symmetrical on purely philosophical grounds. In the Soviet Union, this and other considerations led Belinski and Khalatnikov to analyze the chaotic BKL singularity in General Relativity. Misner's Mixmaster universe attempted to use this chaotic behavior to solve the cosmological problems, with limited success.
In the late 1970s, Sidney Coleman applied the instanton techniques developed by Alexander Polyakov and collaborators to study the fate of the false vacuum in quantum field theory. Like a metastable phase in statistical mechanics—water below the freezing temperature or above the boiling point—a quantum field would need to nucleate a large enough bubble of the new vacuum, the new phase, in order to make a transition. Coleman found the most likely decay pathway for vacuum decay and calculated the inverse lifetime per unit volume. He eventually noted that gravitational effects would be significant, but he did not calculate these effects and did not apply the results to cosmology.
In the Soviet Union, Alexei Starobinsky noted that quantum corrections to general relativity should be important in the early universe. These generically lead to curvature-squared corrections to the Einstein–Hilbert action and a form of f(R) modified gravity. The solution to Einstein's equations in the presence of curvature squared terms, when the curvatures are large, leads to an effective cosmological constant. Therefore, he proposed that the early universe went through a de Sitter phase, an inflationary era.[tpl]cite journal | author = Starobinsky, A.

Eksp. Teor. Fiz.|page= 719 |year=1979 |volume=30[/tpl] This resolved the problems of cosmology, and led to specific predictions for the corrections to the microwave background radiation, corrections that were calculated in detail shortly afterwards.
In 1978, Zeldovich noted the monopole problem, which was an unambiguous quantitative version of the horizon problem, this time in a fashionable subfield of particle physics, which led to several speculative attempts to resolve it. In 1980, working in the west, Alan Guth realized that false vacuum decay in the early universe would solve the problem, leading him to propose scalar driven inflation. Starobinsky's and Guth's scenarios both predicted an initial deSitter phase, differing only in the details of the mechanism.

===Early inflationary models===

According to Andrei Linde, the earliest theory of inflation was proposed by Erast Gliner (1965) but the theory was not taken seriously except by Andrei Sakharov, 'who made an attempt to calculate density perturbations

Like Guth, they concluded that such a model not only required fine tuning of the cosmological constant, but also would very likely lead to a much too granular universe, i.e., to large density variations resulting from bubble wall collisions.
Guth proposed that as the early universe cooled, it was trapped in a false vacuum with a high energy density, which is much like a cosmological constant. As the very early universe cooled it was trapped in a metastable state (it was supercooled), which it could only decay out of through the process of bubble nucleation via quantum tunneling. Bubbles of true vacuum spontaneously form in the sea of false vacuum and rapidly begin expanding at the speed of light. Guth recognized that this model was problematic because the model did not reheat properly: when the bubbles nucleated, they did not generate any radiation. Radiation could only be generated in collisions between bubble walls. But if inflation lasted long enough to solve the initial conditions problems, collisions between bubbles became exceedingly rare. In any one causal patch it is likely that only one bubble will nucleate.

===Slow-roll inflation===

The bubble collision problem was solved by Andrei Linde[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(82)91219-9 | title = A new inflationary universe scenario: A possible solution of the horizon, flatness, homogeneity, isotropy and primordial monopole problems | year = 1982 | last1 = Linde | first1 = A | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 108 | issue = 6 | pages = 389–393 | bibcode=1982PhLB..108..389L [/tpl] and independently by Andreas Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.48.1220 | title = Cosmology for Grand Unified Theories with Radiatively Induced Symmetry Breaking | year = 1982 | last1 = Albrecht | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Steinhardt | first2 = Paul | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 48 | issue = 17 | pages = 1220–1223 | bibcode=1982PhRvL..48.1220A | url=http://astrophysics.fic.uni.lodz.pl/100yrs/pdf/07/060.pdf | format=PDF [/tpl] in a model named new inflation or slow-roll inflation (Guth's model then became known as old inflation). In this model, instead of tunneling out of a false vacuum state, inflation occurred by a scalar field rolling down a potential energy hill. When the field rolls very slowly compared to the expansion of the universe, inflation occurs. However, when the hill becomes steeper, inflation ends and reheating can occur.

===Effects of asymmetries===

Eventually, it was shown that new inflation does not produce a perfectly symmetric universe, but that tiny quantum fluctuations in the inflaton are created. These tiny fluctuations form the primordial seeds for all structure created in the later universe. These fluctuations were first calculated by Viatcheslav Mukhanov and G. V. Chibisov in the Soviet Union in analyzing Starobinsky's similar model.See Linde (1990) and Mukhanov (2005).[tpl]Cite journal|journal=JETP Letters|volume=33|pages=532–5|year=1981|title=Quantum fluctuation and "nonsingular" universe|first=Viatcheslav F.|last=Chibisov|bibcode = 1981JETPL..33..532M|last2=Chibisov|first2=G.

==Observational status==

Inflation is a mechanism for realizing the cosmological principle, which is the basis of the standard model of physical cosmology: it accounts for the homogeneity and isotropy of the observable universe. In addition, it accounts for the observed flatness and absence of magnetic monopoles. Since Guth's early work, each of these observations has received further confirmation, most impressively by the detailed observations of the cosmic microwave background made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) spacecraft.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Spergel|first=D.N.|title=Three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations: Implications for cosmology|url=http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/map/current/map_bibliography.cfm|year=2006|quote=WMAP... confirms the basic tenets of the inflationary paradigm...[/tpl] This analysis shows that the universe is flat to an accuracy of at least a few percent, and that it is homogeneous and isotropic to a part in 100,000.
In addition, inflation predicts that the structures visible in the universe today formed through the gravitational collapse of perturbations that were formed as quantum mechanical fluctuations in the inflationary epoch. The detailed form of the spectrum of perturbations called a nearly-scale-invariant Gaussian random field (or Harrison–Zel'dovich spectrum) is very specific and has only two free parameters, the amplitude of the spectrum and the spectral index, which measures the slight deviation from scale invariance predicted by inflation (perfect scale invariance corresponds to the idealized de Sitter universe).Perturbations can be represented by Fourier modes of a wavelength. Each Fourier mode is normally distributed (usually called Gaussian) with mean zero. Different Fourier components are uncorrelated. The variance of a mode depends only on its wavelength in such a way that within any given volume each wavelength contributes an equal amount of power to the spectrum of perturbations. Since the Fourier transform is in three dimensions, this means that the variance of a mode goes as k−3 to compensate for the fact that within any volume, the number of modes with a given wavenumber k goes as k3. Inflation predicts that the observed perturbations should be in thermal equilibrium with each other (these are called adiabatic or isentropic perturbations). This structure for the perturbations has been confirmed by the WMAP spacecraft and other cosmic microwave background experiments, and galaxy surveys, especially the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey.[tpl]Cite journal|first=M.|last=Tegmark|title=Cosmological constraints from the SDSS luminous red galaxies|arxiv=astro-ph/0608632|date=August 2006|bibcode = 2006PhRvD..74l3507T |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.74.123507|last2=Eisenstein|first2=Daniel J.|last3=Strauss|first3=Michael A.|last4=Weinberg|first4=David H.|last5=Blanton|first5=Michael R.|last6=Frieman|first6=Joshua A.|last7=Fukugita|first7=Masataka|last8=Gunn|first8=James E.|last9=Hamilton|first9=Andrew J.

Moreover, there is evidence for a slight deviation from scale invariance. The spectral index, ns is equal to one for a scale-invariant spectrum.

This is considered an important confirmation of the theory of inflation.
A number of theories of inflation have been proposed that make radically different predictions, but they generally have much more fine tuning than is necessary. As a physical model, however, inflation is most valuable in that it robustly predicts the initial conditions of the universe based on only two adjustable parameters: the spectral index (that can only change in a small range) and the amplitude of the perturbations. Except in contrived models, this is true regardless of how inflation is realized in particle physics.
Occasionally, effects are observed that appear to contradict the simplest models of inflation. The first-year WMAP data suggested that the spectrum might not be nearly scale-invariant, but might instead have a slight curvature.[tpl]Cite journal|first=D.

Another effect has been remarked upon since the first cosmic microwave background satellite, the Cosmic Background Explorer: the amplitude of the quadrupole moment of the cosmic microwave background is unexpectedly low and the other low multipoles appear to be preferentially aligned with the ecliptic plane. Some have claimed that this is a signature of non-Gaussianity and thus contradicts the simplest models of inflation. Others have suggested that the effect may be due to other new physics, foreground contamination, or even publication bias.See cosmic microwave background#Low multipoles for details and references.
An experimental program is underway to further test inflation with more precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background. In particular, high precision measurements of the so-called "B-modes" of the polarization of the background radiation could provide evidence of the gravitational radiation produced by inflation, and could also show whether the energy scale of inflation predicted by the simplest models (1015–1016 GeV) is correct. In March 2014, it was announced that B-mode polarization of the background radiation consistent with that predicted from inflation had been demonstrated by a South Pole experiment, a collaboration led by four principal investigators from the California Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Stanford University, and the University of Minnesota BICEP2. Other potentially corroborating measurements are expected to be performed by the Planck spacecraft, although it is unclear if the signal will be visible, or if contamination from foreground sources will interfere with these measurements.[tpl]Cite conference|title=Systematic effects in CMB polarization measurements|first=C.|last=Rosset|coauthors=(PLANCK-HFI collaboration)|booktitle=Exploring the universe: Contents and structures of the universe (XXXIXth Rencontres de Moriond)|year=2005[/tpl] Other forthcoming measurements, such as those of 21 centimeter radiation (radiation emitted and absorbed from neutral hydrogen before the first stars turned on), may measure the power spectrum with even greater resolution than the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys, although it is not known if these measurements will be possible or if interference with radio sources on earth and in the galaxy will be too great.[tpl]Cite journal|first=A.|last=Loeb|title=Measuring the small-scale power spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations through 21 cm tomography prior to the epoch of structure formation|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=92|pages=211301|year=2004|arxiv=astro-ph/0312134|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.211301|pmid=15245272|last2=Zaldarriaga|first2=M|issue=21|bibcode = 2004PhRvL..92u1301L [/tpl]
Dark energy is broadly similar to inflation, and is thought to be causing the expansion of the present-day universe to accelerate. However, the energy scale of dark energy is much lower, 10−12 GeV, roughly 27 orders of magnitude less than the scale of inflation.

==Theoretical status==

In the early proposal of Guth, it was thought that the inflaton was the Higgs field, the field that explains the mass of the elementary particles. It is now believed by some that the inflaton cannot be the Higgs field[ref]
