Edward Grim was a clerk from Cambridge who was visiting Canterbury Cathedral on Wednesday 29 December 1170 when Thomas Becket was murdered. He subsequently researched and published a book, Vita S. Thomae (Life of Thomas Becket), published in about 1180, which is today known chiefly for a short section in which he gives an eyewitness account of the events in the Cathedral. He himself attempted to protect Becket, and sustained a serious arm wound in the attack.
