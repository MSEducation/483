[[Tempest Stele]]

The Tempest Stele (alt. Storm Stele) was erected by Ahmose I early in the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt, circa 1550 BCE. The stele describes a great storm striking Egypt during this time, destroying tombs, temples and pyramids in the Theban region and the work of restoration ordered by the king.Shaw, Ian.

==The stele==

Broken pieces of this stele were found in the 3rd Pylon of the temple of Karnak at Thebes between 1947 and 1951 by French archaeologists. It was restored and published by Claude Vandersleyen in 1967 and 1968.Claude Vandersleyen, « Deux nouveaux fragments de la stèle d’Amosis relatant une tempête », RdE 20, 1968, p. 127-134.Claude Vandersleyen, « Une tempête sous le règne d’Amosis », RdE 19, 1967, p. 123−159.
Unfortunately, the part of the stele that describes the storm, itself, is the most damaged part of the stele, with many lacunae in the meteorological description. The other parts of the stele are much better preserved.A Storm in Egypt during the Reign of Ahmose Description and translation of the stele.

==Interpretation==

There are Egyptologists who believe the stele to be propaganda put out by the pharaoh, the "tempest" being the depredations of officials of the embattled seventeenth dynasty of Egypt drawing upon the financial resources of the temples during the escalating conflict with the Hyksos. This would constitute an official re-writing of history, for which there are other parallels, such as Hatshepsut's Speos Artemidos, which records "storms" that similarly destroyed temples[tpl]Failed verification|date=June 2013[/tpl], which she restored during her reign, while pointedly cursing the Hyksos and "toppling what had been made" there.[tpl]Wayback|date=20050413054337|url=http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html |title=The Speos Artemidos Inscription of Hatshepsut [/tpl], accessed May 26, 2013.

==Thera eruption==

The argument has been made that there was "a meteorological event of far-reaching proportions, one of the major aftereffects, we strongly suspect, of the Thera eruption" and that the stele reflects an eye-witness account of the eruption.PDF file [tpl]cite journal |last=Foster |first=Karen Plinger |first2=Robert K. |last2=Ritner |first3=Benjamin R. |last3=Foster |title=Text, Storms and the Thera Eruption |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=1–14 |jstor=545376[/tpl] Others argue that given the description in the stele, this is unlikely.[tpl]cite journal | last = Wiener  | first = Malcolm H.  | authorlink = Malcolm H.

In 2014, Nadine Moeller and Robert Ritner offered a new translation of the Tempest Stela. They believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at Thera. They also suggest that the Egyptian pharaoh Ahmose I ruled at a time closer to the Thera eruption than previously thought.Ancient stormy weather: World's oldest weather report could revise bronze age chronology. sciencedaily.com, April 2014[tpl]cite journal|last=Ritner|first=Robert K.|coauthors=adine Moeller|title=The Ahmose ‘Tempest Stela’, Thera and Comparative Chronology|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=April 2014|volume=73|issue=1|doi=10.1086/675069|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/675069[/tpl]
