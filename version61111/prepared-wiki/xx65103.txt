Gornja Morava was known as simply Morava under Ottoman rule, and it extended west of the Upper Žegra-Budriga-Cernica line, thus Gnjilane stayed in the oblast (province) of Topolnica, which provincial seat was Novo Brdo.Urošević/Macura 1987, p. 10 [tpl]quote|Горња Морава се под турском управом звала само Мора- ва, а протезала се западно од линије с.

In this city, it gathers thousands of artists and art lovers from all the Albanian territories, who for three consecutive weeks transform the city into a culture metropolis. The nation's martyrs are honored through values of art by this event, which began before the 10th anniversary of the assassination of the writer, the activist and the patriot Jusuf Gërvalla, along with Kadri Zeka and Bardhosh Gërvalla. 
It was exactly the 10th anniversary without these three martyrs of freedom and from coincidence of these murders in a same date on 11th of January, this event got this name "Flaka e Janarit". Moreover, this month has "eaten" lots of devout patriots.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rrustemi|first=Sabit|journal=Cultural literary magazine "Agmia"|year=2001|volume=5|pages=Pg.85–86[/tpl]
