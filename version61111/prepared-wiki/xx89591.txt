==Etymology==

According to popular legend, there once was a group of warring tribes who lived in the area in and around what is now the modern city. A wise old man (known as apo), seeing the perils of disunity, exerted great effort toward uniting the warring tribes. There were, however, some who bitterly opposed his idea, and one day the old man just disappeared.
After a long search, the old man's body was found, but with the head missing. It is said that the tribesmen launched search parties to locate the severed head of the man; to the Sambal, decapitation was the only permissible form of assassination.It was recorded customary for the Sambal to execute those who have taken another person's life, unless done by decapitation. Their manner of execution was to bore a hole at the top of the skull and then scrape out the brains.
These efforts proved to be futile, and the search was eventually called off. A boy, however, vowed to himself that he would not stop searching until he found the elder's head. He searched for weeks, but found nothing. Then, one day, he chanced upon what appeared to be the old man's head, resting on top of a bamboo pole. The boy ran back to his people crying, "Olo nin apo! Olo nin apo!" ("head of the elder" in Sambal; translates as "ulo ng apo"Olongapo Subic Bay sbma Zambales daily news jobs travel tour info. Olongapo-subic.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28. in Tagalog), running hysterically from village to village. The phrase stuck, and that, according to legend, is how the area got its name, Olongapo.
To this day, the old man's head acts as a symbol of unity of the people in what is now a modern city.

==History==

===British Period===

Britain ruled the Philippines from 1762 to 1764. The British invasion of the Philippines was the first challenge to Spain's control of the archipelago after 191 years of rule. The Royal Navy and British Army joined with the East India Company in Madras to capture Spain's Asian colony. In conjunction with the attack against Spain's key possession in the Americas, Havana, both settlements were successfully seized. However, in the Philippines, whilst the expedition was launched as part of a plan to harass the Spaniards in their possessions, as well as for commercial gain and new territories, the military campaign led by General William Draper and Admiral Samuel Cornish, may have been launched under the guise of an invasion in order to gain prize money. The publication "When Britain Ruled the Philippines 1762-1764" describes the events as they unfolded at the Admiralty in London and at the East India Company in Madras, leading to the invasion and occupation of the capital Manila and the port city of Cavite. The capital was looted, a galleon was seized, and the British commanders imposed a ransom of four million dollars upon the Spaniards. The enormous sums in prize money and valuables seized mainly benefited the commanders.

===Spanish Period===

On March 8, 1885, the Spanish Naval commission authorized construction of the Arsenal at Olongapo.  The Spanish planned to make their naval station, and the village of Olongapo an island, protected against attack by insurrectos. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal.  The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense.
Within ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost three decades developing the naval station.[tpl]cite web|url= http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|title= History of Subic Bay and Olongapo City[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm|title= The Olongapo Story[/tpl]

===American Period===

On May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was hardly completed when Admiral Dewey's flagship, USS Olympia, led the Asiatic Fleet into Manila Bay. A detachment of Admiral Dewey's fleet bombarded the navy yard.  Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States.  This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands.
Realizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; the President of the United States, then Theodore Roosevelt, on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes.
The naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States.
Olongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station.  More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment.  To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change.  The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard.  Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy.
Olongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing though the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness.

===World War II===

When the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated.  Olongapo had to suffer the brunt of destruction twice.
On December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw.  Olongapo was set aflame by the local Filipinos in anticipation of Japanese troop arrival.  The USS New York was scuttled in Subic Bay.Subic Bay History - 1940's. Subicbaypi.com (1942-04-08). Retrieved on 2013-07-28. When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the Bataan peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came.
In 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided the recognized guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (it was the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the sweep of the war's fury.

===Reconstruction and Rehabilitation===

Shortly after the war was over, the Philippines was granted her independence.  Olongapo was one of the principal navy bases retained by the United States. The Navy started to rebuild the town right after the hostilities ceased. Olongapo however was built on a new completely undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former site.  The prewar town site became a part of the Naval Station.
The first few years after the war were extremely hard on the new town.  Starting from scratch, everything in the new Olongapo was in a deplorable state.  There was no electric power and no drainage system.  The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate.  Olongapo streets were unpaved—they were dusty during the dry season and were stretches of mud and slush when the rains came.
Gradually Olongapo evolved into a better community:  new business concerns were established; housing projects were planned, civic facilities were restored. The development of the Reservation has been particularly rapid during the past two years.  The new building constructions recently undertaken by the Reservation include:  a new ice plant, a high school, two elementary schools, two bridges, and a public library.  Two housing projects at Kalaklan and Saluysoy areas are at present being developed.  Within a couple of months, the Reservation plans to start laying down a new set of water main lines to replaced the obsolete lines set up in 1908.
Due to the Korean War, U.S. spent over $170 million to convert the base into the homeport of her Navy's Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest U.S installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to what is now the hub of Olongapo – along what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after the American setup where streets are constructed along straight lines, both horizontally and vertically. The very considerable program of construction of facilities in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought about growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=219|title= World War II - Olongapo City Official Website[/tpl]

===Independence and cityhood===

Unlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after World War II in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation.  The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board.  Olongapo's 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the United States Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried by United States Navy courts.  The United States Navy declined to identify or try a Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot a Filipino.  In July 1955, Manila mayor Arsenio Lacson announced United States service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of United States Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo.  Olongapo was placed under martial law when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed on October 23, 1959.Anderson, Gerald Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay Gerald Anderson (2009) ISBN 1441444521 pp.130-138
Olongapo City was the last piece of Philippine territory surrendered by the US to the country in the 1950s.[tpl]cite web|url= http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/166856/UCMP/UCMP/Documents/olongapo.pdf|title= World Bank - Olongapo Profile[/tpl]  On December 7, 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano.  The first mayor appointed was civic leader Ruben Geronimo and he was later succeeded by business entrepreneur Ildefonso Arriola.
Six years later under Mayor James Leonard T. Gordon, Olongapo was reconverted to a chartered city on June 1, 1966.[tpl]cite web|url= http://members.tripod.com/Olongapo/legend.html|title= Olongapo City - Brief History[/tpl]  The adjacent U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was the largest United States Navy installation in the Pacific at the time, and employed fifteen thousand Filipino civilians.  The base was visited by 215 ships per month as Vietnam War activity peaked in 1967.  The wild nightclubs along Ramon Magsaysay Drive between the naval base main gate and Rizal Avenue were notoriously popular among the 4,225,000 servicemen visiting the base that year.Tucker, Spencer C. The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History (2011) ISBN 1851099611 p.863  Sailors of the war remember talented Filipino musicians and singers, inexpensive San Miguel beer, attractive teen-age prostitutes, erotic floor shows, Jeepney rides back to the naval base and children diving for coins tossed from the bridge over the estuarine drainage channel in front of the naval base main gate.Sherwood, John Afterburner: Naval Aviators and the Vietnam War NYU Press (2004) ISBN 081479842X pp.27-28[tpl]cite web|url=http://dennisclevenger.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/liberty-call-olongapo-city/|title=LIBERTY CALL: Olongapo City|publisher=Dennis Clevenger|accessdate=2012-08-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usswilhoite.org/olongapo.htm|title=Olongapo|publisher=Dave Payson|accessdate=2012-08-03[/tpl]
Olongapo City administers itself autonomously from Zambales province.
The former naval base adjacent to the city became the Subic Bay Freeport Zone in 1992.

===Mount Pinatubo Eruption===

June 15, 1991 proved to be a memorable date to the people of Olongapo. Mount Pinatubo, just 20 miles away from Subic Bay erupted with a force 8 times greater than the Mt. St. Helens eruption. Day turned to night as volcanic ash blotted out the sun. Volcanic earthquakes and heavy rain, lightning and thunder from a typhoon passing over northern Luzon made Black Saturday a 36-hour nightmare.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=234|title= Twin Disasters- Olongapo City Official Website[/tpl]
This caused widespread damage to the U.S. facility and Olongapo City.
On September 16, 1991, the Senate leaders of the Philippines did not grant any extension on the existing RP-US Military Bases Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America thereby terminating the stay of U.S. military in the Philippines.

===Conversion of the Naval Base and the present-day Olongapo===

Like his father before him, Mayor Richard Gordon, who was against the departure of the US military forces, lobbied for the turnover of the facility and its conversion into a freeport.
To date, the renowned volunteerism strategy, overturning an ailing economy to prosperity after twin disasters – withdrawal of US Bases and Mt. Pinatubo's eruption, is an unparalleled achievement. Mayor Richard "Dick" Gordon boldly led a strong corps of 8,000 City volunteers who protected and preserved the abandoned US Naval Base facilities from poachers. He complemented this with an aggressive advocacy to convert the area into a protected area and industrial zone. Later, he launched an aggressive international investment promotion which resulted in the acceleration of the development of a prime industrial and tourism zone in the country, the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ).
It was the first chartered city and highly urbanized city in its province. It rose from a "sin city" in the 1960s and 1970s to become a "Model city" in the 1980s and 1990s.
The city is known for its innovative methods of urban management in the 1980s in addressing crime and cleanliness that has been said to be copied by local governments nationwide. The city pioneered the Color-coded transport system, Integrated Solid Waste Management System, Volunteerism, Organized vendors, elderly, youth and women's groups, use of slogans, People's Law Enforcement Board, Emergency Response Team, and international awards such as the UNESCO Cities for Peace representing Asia and the Pacific in 1997 and the Konrad Adenauer Local Medal of Excellence in 1999.
Furthermore, the Asian Development Bank and World Bank have also recognized its successful urban redevelopment and city development strategy after the US Base turnover.
