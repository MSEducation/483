</ref> This mission is potentially capable of detecting planets with as little as 3&nbsp;times the mass of the Earth at an orbital distance of 2&nbsp;A.U. from the star. Measurements of this system have detected an [[infrared excess|excess of far infrared radiation]], beyond what is emitted by the stars. Such an excess is sometimes associated with a [[debris disk|disk of dust]], but in this case it lies sufficiently close to one or both of the stars that it has not yet been resolved with a telescope.<ref>
