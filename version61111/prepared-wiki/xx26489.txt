Operation Entebbe  was a counter-terrorist hostage-rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60816FA38591B728DDDAD0894DF405B868BF1D3|title=HOSTAGES FREED AS ISRAELIS RAID UGANDA AIRPORT; Commandos in 3 Planes Rescue 105-Casualties Unknown Israelis Raid Uganda Airport And Free Hijackers' Hostages|last=Smith|first=Terence |work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2009 | date=4 July 1976[/tpl] A week earlier, on 27 June, an Air France plane with 248 passengers was hijacked, by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the German Revolutionary Cells, and flown to Entebbe, the main airport of Uganda.

Kenyan sources supported Israel and in the aftermath of the operation Idi Amin issued orders to retaliate and slaughter several hundred Kenyans present in Uganda.Ulrich Beyerlin: Abhandlungen: Die israelische Befreiungsaktion von Entebbe in völkerrechtlicher Sicht.

The IDF acted on intelligence provided by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. The hijackers threatened to kill the hostages if their prisoner release demands were not met. This threat led to the planning of the rescue operation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3269662,00.html|title=Mossad took photos, Entebbe Operation was on its way.|year=2006|publisher=Ynetnews|accessdate=6 July 2009[/tpl] These plans included preparation for armed resistance from Ugandan military troops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885879544&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|title=Back to Entebbe|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond |work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]
The operation took place at night. Israeli transport planes carried 100 commandos over [tpl]convert|2500|mi|km[/tpl] to Uganda for the rescue operation. The operation, which took a week of planning, lasted 90 minutes. 102 hostages were rescued. Five Israeli commandos were wounded and one, the unit commander, Lt. Col. Yonatan Netanyahu, was killed. All the hijackers, three hostages and 45 Ugandan soldiers were killed, and thirty (some say 11) Soviet-built MiG-17s and MiG-21s of Uganda's air force were destroyed.
Operation Entebbe, which had the military codename Operation Thunderbolt, is sometimes referred to retroactively as Operation Jonathan in memory of the unit's leader, Yonatan Netanyahu. He was the older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister of Israel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/entebbi_eng.htm|title=Operation Entebbe|publisher=The Knesset at Sixty|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]

==Background==

The PLO was ousted from Jordan after the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war. The Palestinian military organizations then made South Lebanon its headquarters and enlisted militants from Palestinian refugee camps. South Lebanon was also referred to as Fatahland, due to the almost complete control of Fatah and other military Palestinian organizations over this officially Lebanese area, which they used to stage attacks against Israel, mainly targeting civilians, and to engage in international aircraft hijacking campaigns.

==Hijacking==

On 27 June 1976, Air France Flight 139, an Airbus A300 (Airbus A300B4-203), registration F-BVGG (c/n 019), originated from Tel Aviv, Israel, carrying 246 passengers and a crew of 12. An additional 58 passengers, including four hijackers, waited to board at the Athens airport, heading for Paris.
 Soon after the 12:30 pm takeoff, the flight was hijacked by two Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO), and by two Germans, Wilfried Böse and Brigitte Kuhlmann, from the German Revolutionary Cells. The hijackers diverted the flight to Benghazi, Libya.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3270314,00.html|title=Special: Entebbe's unsung hero.|last=Ben|first=Eyal|date=3 July 2006|work=Ynetnews|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl] There it was held on the ground for seven hours for refuelling. During that time the hijackers released a female hostage who pretended to have a miscarriage. The plane left Benghazi, and at 3:15 pm on the 28th, more than 24 hours after the flight's original departure, it arrived at Entebbe Airport in Uganda.
At Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by at least four others, supported by the pro-Palestinian forces of Uganda's President, Idi Amin. They demanded the release of 40 Palestinians held in Israel and 13 other detainees imprisoned in Kenya, France, Switzerland, and West Germany. They threatened that if these demands were not met, they would begin to kill hostages on 1 July 1976.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nebuchadnezzarwoollyd.blogspot.com/2006/08/entebbe.html|title=Woolly Days: Entebbe|date=2 August 2006|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]
The hijackers sorted the hostages into two groups—Jews and Israelis in one, everyone else in another.David Tinnin, Like Father, Time, 8 August 1977. A review of Hitler's children by Julian Becker, Page 2 As they did so, a Holocaust survivor showed Böse a camp registration number tattooed on his arm. Böse responded, "I'm no Nazi! ... I am an idealist". In 2011, one former hostage Ilan Hartuv, said that the hijackers claimed they were against Israel and not against Jews, although the behaviour and language of Kuhlmann had a marked antisemitic tone, according to witnesses.  According to Hartuv, the hijackers did release an undetermined number of Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli citizenship, including two Yeshiva students from Brazil. 
The hijackers held the passengers hostage for a week in the transit hall of Entebbe Airport—now the old terminal. Some hostages were released, but 106 remained captive. The hijackers threatened to kill them if Israel did not comply with their demands.
The hijackers announced that the airline crew and non-Jewish passengers would be released and put on another Air France plane brought to Entebbe for that purpose. The captain of the original, hijacked Air France flight, Michel Bacos, then told the hijackers that all passengers, including those who remained, were his responsibility and that he would not leave them behind. Bacos's entire crew followed suit. A French nun also refused to leave, insisting that one of the remaining hostages take her place, but Ugandan soldiers forced her into the waiting Air France plane. A total of 85 Israeli and non-Israeli Jewish hostages remained, plus 20 others, most of whom were the crew of the Air France plane.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/entebbe.html|title=The Entebbe Rescue Mission|work=Israel Defense Forces|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]

==Operational planning==

In the week before the raid, Israel tried a number of political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the Israeli cabinet was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch "Burka" Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the release of the hostages, without success."Vindication for the Israelis." Time. 26 July 1976"War of Words over a Tense Border." Time. 26 July 1976. The Israeli government also approached the US government to deliver a message to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, asking him to request Amin to release the hostages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/documents/Kissinger/0000C08F.pdf |title=Conversation between Henry Kissinger and Israeli Ambassador Simch Dinitz, 30 June 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl]
On the 1 July deadline,Grimes, Paul. "Rescuing the Entebbe Hostages." The New York Times. Friday, 30 July 1976. (The Weekend, p. 51) the Israeli government offered to negotiate with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to Port Louis, Mauritius to officially hand over chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam.Lipkin-Shakhak, Tali. "The Forgotten Hero of Entebbe" Maariv. 16 June 2006. This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough time to get to Entebbe.
On 3 July, at 18:30, the Israeli cabinet approved the rescue mission,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60816FA38591B728DDDAD0894DF405B868BF1D3|title=Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport |last=Terence|first=Smith | work=The New York Times | date=4 July 1976 | accessdate=20 May 2010[/tpl] presented by Major General Yekutiel "Kuti" Adam and Brig.

Shomron was appointed as the operation commander.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/console/article_page.aspx?doc_id=23016&lang=english|title=Israel Defense Forces — Entebbe Diary[/tpl]

===Attempts at a diplomatic solution===

As the crisis unfolded, attempts were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government, and special envoy Hanni al Hassan was sent to negotiate in Uganda.[tpl]cite web|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=172177&dt=2082&dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 6 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=181803&dt=2082&dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 9 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl]

===Raid preparation===

President Idi Amin allowed several more Palestinians to join the original hijackers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm |title=1976: Israelis rescue Entebbe hostages  |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DE7fZYVd |deadurl=no |date=4 July 1976[/tpl] Hostage accounts given after the raid testified that the hijackers kept both Jews and Israelis hostages.  However, in 2011, one former hostage has claimed that non-Israelis, including Jews, were allowed to leave.  When Israeli authorities failed to negotiate a political solution, they decided the only option was an attack to rescue the hostages.
Lt. Col. Joshua Shani, lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into Lake Victoria. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport located on the edge of the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the time necessary.[tpl]cite book |title=The Israel Defense Forces: A People's Army |last=Williams |first=Louis |year=2000 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595143535 |page=131 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gSsxPDuQy8YC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=%22rubber+boats%22+Entebbe+%22Lake+Victoria%22&source=bl&ots=BdA0hBNs_o&sig=JkbU0-_FMzHrQ-p5IVXLN_mmrb0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vl3cUNLvCcTC2QWaloCQBg&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22rubber%20boats%22%20Entebbe%20%22Lake%20Victoria%22&f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl]

====Aircraft refueling====

While planning the raid, the Israeli forces had to figure out how to refuel the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft they intended to use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to aerially refuel four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace. While several East African nations, including the logistically preferred choice Kenya, were sympathetic, none wished to incur the wrath of Amin or the Palestinians by allowing the Israelis to land their aircraft within their borders.
The raid could not proceed without assistance from at least one East African government. The Jewish owner of the Block hotels chain in Kenya, along with other members of the Jewish and Israeli community in Nairobi, may have used their political and economic influence to help persuade Kenya's President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta to help Israel. The Israeli government finally secured permission from Kenya for the IDF task force to cross Kenyan airspace and refuel at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.[tpl]cite book |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces |last=Dunstan |first=Simon |year=2011 |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=9781448818686 |page=53 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&pg=PA53&dq=Entebbe+%22Jomo+Kenyatta+airport%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VGrcUNlRxbvZBfvMgdAI&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Entebbe%20%22Jomo%20Kenyatta%20airport%22&f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl]

The Norfolk hotel, then owned by the Block Hotels, was bombed on 31 December 1980 by the PFLP/PLO. The attack, in which 13 people of several nationalities were killed and 87 more were wounded, was retaliation for the possible assistance the Block family and Kenyan Jewish/Israeli business community gave to the Entebbe operation. The bombing was the first act of foreign terrorism perpetrated on Kenyan soil.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/1741/final%20report.pdf?sequence=1 |title=War on terror or war on human rights?

====Hostage intelligence====

Mossad built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of terrorists, and the involvement of Ugandan troops from the released hostages in Paris.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914272,00.html|title=The Rescue: 'We Do the Impossible'.|date=12 July 1976|work=Time|accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl] Additionally, Israeli firms were involved in building projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s and while preparing the raid the Israeli army consulted with Solel Boneh, a large Israeli construction company that had built the terminal where the hostages were held.[tpl]cite web|title=Wars and Operations: Operation Thunderball ("Entebbe")|url=http://www.iaf.org.il/4694-33040-he/IAF.aspx|publisher=Israel Air Force(official website)|language=Hebrew[/tpl] While planning the military operation the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the help of civilians who had helped build the original.
Muki Betzer said in a later Associated Press interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released."Israel marks 30th anniversary of Entebbe." Associated Press in USA Today. 5 July 2006. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and "a phenomenal memory" provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers. After Betzer collected intelligence and planned for several days, four Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules transport aircraft secretly flew to Entebbe Airport at midnight without being detected by Entebbe air traffic control.

===Task force===

The Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following:

==Raid==

===Attack route===

Taking off from Sharm al-Sheikh,"Operation Entebbe," The Knesset, http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/entebbi_eng.htm the task force flew down the international flight path over the Red Sea, mostly flying at a height of no more than 30 m (100 ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and passed south of Djibouti. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya, likely across Somalia and the Ogaden area of Ethiopia. They turned west, passing through the African Rift Valley and over Lake Victoria.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=William|title=Ninety Minutes at Entebbe|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|year=1976|page=100|isbn=0-553-10482-9[/tpl]
Two Boeing 707 jets followed the cargo planes. The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. The commander of the operation, General Yekutiel Adam, was on board the second Boeing, which circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.
The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe at 23:00 IST, with their cargo bay doors already open. A black Mercedes that looked like President Idi Amin's vehicle and Land Rovers that usually accompanied Amin's Mercedes were brought along. The Israelis hoped they could use them to bypass security checkpoints. When the C-130s landed, Israeli assault team members drove the vehicles to the terminal building in the same fashion as Amin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/39910/|title=Remembering Entebbe,Larry Domnitch|date=1 July 2009|publisher=The Jewish Press|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] As they approached the terminal, two Ugandan sentries, aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes, ordered the vehicles to stop.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=30529 |title=A historic hostage-taking revisited |author=David E.

As they pulled away, however, an Israeli commando in one of the following Land Rovers killed them with an unsuppressed rifle. Fearing the hijackers would be alerted prematurely, the assault team quickly approached the terminal.

===Hostage rescue===

The Israelis sprang from their vehicles and burst towards the terminal. The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, "Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers," in both Hebrew and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel who chose to identify himself as an Israeli Jew to the hijackers even though he also had a French passport—stood up and was killed when Israeli company commander Muki Betzer and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him. Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, the manager of an Israeli medical insurance fund, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemdiaries.com/article/6 |title=Remembering Entebbe |publisher=Jerusalem Diaries |date=3 July 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had emigrated to Israel, was killed in the crossfire.
According to hostage Ilan Hartuv, Wilfried Böse was the only hijacker who, after the operation began, entered the hall housing the hostages. At first he pointed his Kalashnikov rifle at hostages, but "immediately came to his senses" and ordered them to find shelter in the restroom, before being killed by the commandos. According to Hartuv, Böse fired only at Israeli soldiers and not at hostages.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-entebbe-was-not-auschwitz-1.372131 |title=Setting the record straight: Entebbe was not Auschwitz |author=Yossi Melman |date=8 July 2011 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DE5G4iCG |deadurl=no[/tpl]

===Departure===

After the raid, the Israeli assault team returned to their aircraft and began loading the hostages. Ugandan soldiers shot at them in the process. The Israeli commandos returned fire with their AK47s, inflicting casualties on the Ugandans. During this brief but intense firefight, Ugandan soldiers fired from the Airport control tower. Israeli commander Yonatan Netanyahu was shot in the chest and killed, possibly by a Ugandan sniper.Operation Thunderball (Film Documentary)'' He was the only Israeli commando killed in the operation. At least five other commandos were wounded. Israeli commandos fired light machine guns and an RPG back at the control tower, suppressing the Ugandans' fire. The Israelis finished evacuating the hostages, loaded Netanyahu's body into one of the planes, and left Entebbe Airport.[tpl]cite book |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces |last=Dunstan |first=Simon |year=2011 |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=9781448818686 |pages=51–53 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&pg=PA53&dq=Entebbe+%22Jomo+Kenyatta+airport%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VGrcUNlRxbvZBfvMgdAI&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Entebbe%20%22Jomo%20Kenyatta%20airport%22&f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012[/tpl] The entire operation lasted 53 minutes—of which the assault lasted only 30 minutes.

Dora Bloch, a 75-year-old British-born Israeli, had been released by the hijackers due to illness and taken to Mulago Hospital in Kampala. After the raid she was killed by officers of the Ugandan army, as were some of her doctors and nurses, apparently for trying to intervene.[tpl]#tag:ref|Now confidential cabinet papers released under the Freedom of Information Act show that the British High Commission in Kampala received a report from a Ugandan civilian that Mrs Bloch had been shot and her body dumped in the boot of a car which had Ugandan intelligence services number plates.|group="nb"|name="highcommission"[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-the-fate-of-idi-amins-hijack-victim-436181.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Robert | last=Verkaik | title=Revealed: the fate of Idi Amin's hijack victim | date=13 February 2007[/tpl] In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda's Attorney general and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and killed by two army officers on Amin's orders.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/7/newsid_2496000/2496095.stm |title=1976: British grandmother missing in Uganda  |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DE3a6Kse |deadurl=no |date=7 July 1976[/tpl] Bloch was shot and her body dumped in the trunk of a car that had Ugandan intelligence services number plates.

==Aftermath==

The government of Uganda, represented by the Foreign Minister Juma Oris, later convened a session of the United Nations Security Council to seek official condemnation of the Israeli raid,Teltsch, Kathleen. "Uganda Bids UN Condemn Israel for Airport Raid." The New York Times. 10 July 1976. (Section: The Week In Review) as a violation of Ugandan sovereignty. The Security Council ultimately declined to pass any resolution on the matter, condemning neither Israel nor Uganda. In his address to the Council, Israeli ambassador Chaim Herzog said:
Western nations spoke in support of the raid. West Germany called the raid "an act of self defense." Switzerland and France praised the operation. Representatives of the United Kingdom and United States offered significant praise, calling the Entebbe raid "an impossible operation." Some in the United States noted that the hostages were freed on 4 July 1976, 200 years after the signing of the U.S. declaration of independence.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7340000/newsid_7349900/7349983.stm?bw=nb&mp=wm&news=1&ms3=6&ms_javascript=true&bbcws=2 | title=Age of Terror: Episode one | date=16 April 2008 | publisher=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3525616,00.html |title=עכשיו, במבצע – תרבות ובידור |publisher=Ynet |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mota.co.il/antebe.htm |title=מבצע אנטבה |publisher=Mota.co.il |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] In private conversation with Israeli Ambassador Dinitz, Henry Kissinger sounded criticism for Israeli use of US equipment during the operation, but that criticism was not made public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/documents/Kissinger/0000BE67.pdf |title=Conversation between Kissinger and Dinitz, 5 July 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl] In mid-July 1976, the supercarrier [tpl]USS|Ranger|CV-61[/tpl] embarked, and her escorts entered the Indian Ocean and operated off the Kenyan coast in response to a threat of military action by forces from Uganda.http://ussranger.org/home/ranger-history| USS Ranger Bicentennial Cruise Book
UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim described the raid as "a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state," (meaning Uganda). Dozens of Ugandan soldiers were killed in the raid. The Arab and Communist world condemned the operation, calling it an act of aggression.

In the ensuing years, Betser and the Netanyahu brothers—Iddo and Benjamin, all Sayeret Matkal veterans—argued in increasingly public forums about who was to blame for the unexpected early firefight that caused Yonatan's death and partial loss of tactical surprise.Sharon Roffe-Ofir "Entebbe's open wound" Ynet, 7 February 2006Josh Hamerman "Battling against 'the falsification of history'" Ynet News, 4 February 2007

==Commemorations==

In August 2012, Uganda and Israel commemorated the raid at a somber ceremony at the base of a tower at the Old Entebbe Airport, where Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Uganda and Israel renewed their commitment in the fight against terrorism and to work towards humanity. In addition, wreaths were laid, a moment of silence was held, speeches were given, and a poem was recited. The flags of Uganda and Israel waved side by side, demonstrating the two countries' strong bilateral relations, next to a plaque with a history of the raid. The ceremony was attended by Ugandan State Minister for Animal Industry Bright Rwamirama and the deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Daniel Ayalon, who laid wreaths at the site.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/634093-Uganda--Israel-honor-1976-Entebbe-raid.html | title=Uganda, Israel honor 1976 Entebbe raid | publisher=New Vision | date=14 August 2012 | accessdate=14 August 2012 | author=Candia, Steven[/tpl]
