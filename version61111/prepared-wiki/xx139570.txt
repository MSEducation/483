CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Enemay is one of the woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Part of the Misraq Gojjam Zone, Enemay is bordered on the south by Dejen, on the west by Debay Telatgen, on the north by Enarj Enawga, and on the east by Shebel Berenta. The administrative center of this woreda is Bichena; other towns in Enemay include Dima and Yetmen. 
The landscape of this woreda is divided into two types: the lava plateau in the northern part and fertile lowlands in the south towards the Abay. Until the late 1930s as much as 25% of the land was covered with trees. Rivers in this woreda include the Muga, which is a perennial river, and the Yegudfin which only flows during the rainy season."Ethiopian Village Studies: Yetmen", Centre for the Study of African Economies (accessed 5 July 2009) Notable landmarks include the Wolde Beri Caves, a limestone cave system which was used as a shelter during the Italian occupation."Stalagmite sampling results table", Ethiopian Venture, First phase: Climate Reconstruction (accessed 16 May 2009)
