[[Tornadoes of 2011]]

CATEGORIES: Tornadoes of 2011, Tornado-related lists by year

This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 2011.  Extremely destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the U.S., Bangladesh and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions.  Tornadoes also appear regularly in neighboring southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer season, and somewhat regularly in Europe, Asia, and Australia.
There were 1,897 tornadoes reported in the US in 2011 (of which 1,704 were confirmed). 2011 was an exceptionally destructive and deadly year for tornadoes; worldwide, at least 577 people perished due to tornadoes: 12 in Bangladesh, two in South Africa, one in New Zealand, one in the Philippines, one in Russia, one in Canada, and an estimated 553 in the United States (compared to 564 US deaths in the prior ten years combined). Due mostly to several extremely large tornado outbreaks in the middle and end of April and in late May, the year finished well above average in almost every category, with six EF5 tornadoes and nearly enough total tornado reports to eclipse the mark of 1,817 tornadoes recorded in 2004, the current record year for total number of tornadoes.
553 confirmed fatalities is also the second-most tornadic deaths in a single year for tornadoes in US history. This total is due in large part to the 325 tornadic deaths that occurred during the April 25–28, 2011 tornado outbreak across the Southeastern United States and the 158 tornadic deaths in the 2011 Joplin tornado.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norman.noaa.gov/2009/03/us-annual-tornado-death-tolls-1875-present/ |title=US Annual Tornado Death Tolls, 1875–present |publisher=Norman.noaa.gov |date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2011[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

An ongoing outbreak at the end of 2010 continued into the first three hours of 2011. During that period seven tornadoes touched down in Mississippi. However, during the remainder of the month, tornadic activity was suppressed by a cold air mass, with nine additional tornadoes – all weak – taking place. This inactivity continued through much of February before a pattern shift. Two consecutive outbreaks took place on February 25 and 27 – 28, producing a combined 55 tornadoes. Overall, 63 tornadoes were confirmed in the month, ranking it as the fourth-busiest February on record.[tpl]cite web|author=Jake Crouch|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2011|title=State of the Climate: Tornadoes February 2011|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tornadoes/2011/2[/tpl] Activity in March was split between the start and end of the month, with a total of 75 tornadoes touching down, which ran slightly above average for the month.
In early April, a prolific severe weather event produced at least 42 tornadoes among more than 1,200 reports of wind damage, setting the tone for the month. A nearly continuous series of major tornado outbreaks followed thereafter in the remainder of April, including two extreme multi-day tornado outbreaks that were among the largest in US history (one of them also one of the deadliest and the costliest) and two other large tornado outbreaks, and combined they resulted in an incredibly active month from start to finish; it was easily the most active month for tornadoes on record and by an extremely large margin the most active April, with over 750 tornadoes touching down.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|date=May 7, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2011|title=U.S. April Tornadoes|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/images/tornado/2010/apr/apriltornadoescount.png[/tpl]
In an abrupt reversal, the activity did not continue into May (normally the most active month for tornadoes), however, and the first half was remarkably quiet and one of the least active Mays on record as of the middle of the month. That continued for three weeks until significant severe weather returned on May 21, and an extremely deadly tornado hit the following day in a major outbreak. The outbreak continued for the next several days, with over 180 confirmed touchdowns, bringing the month of May near average.
The first day of June brought a rare outbreak into Massachusetts, where several tornadoes touched down, some of them fairly destructive. However, another reversal took place afterward and much of June was fairly quiet, with the exception of an active period in the third week that produced a moderate outbreak. July was also relatively quiet for the most part with below normal activity mostly clustered in the northern Plains. August was more quiet with below normal activity and only about 50 confirmed tornadoes. September and October were also below average. November was somewhat more active, primarily due to two moderate outbreaks in the first half of the month. December saw a return to inactivity for most of the month, but there was a small outbreak of 13 tornadoes on December 22 to close out the year.

===United States yearly total===

 

==January==

There were 29 tornadoes reported in the US in January, of which 16 were confirmed.[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2011|title=Monthly and Annual U.S. Tornado Summaries|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/newm.html[/tpl]

===January 1===

A late-season deadly tornado outbreak continued though the early hours of January 1, with seven tornadoes touching down in Mississippi over three hours. The strongest of these, rated EF3 with winds of [tpl]convert|145|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], reached [tpl]convert|0.75|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] in width along its [tpl]convert|23.45|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] track and caused significant damage along Mississippi Highway 19. Several structures were damaged or destroyed and two people were injured. Near Mississippi Highway 35, thousands of trees were uprooted by the tornado. Another EF3 touched down near Macon, damaging or destroying several structures and one person was injured. Overall damage in the state from tornadoes amounted to $10.4 million.[tpl]cite web|work=National Weather Service office in Jackson, Mississippi|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2011|accessdate=April 7, 2011|title=Storm Data and Unusual Weather Phenomena – January 2011|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/jan/stormdata/data/jan2011.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl]

===January 24–25 (Europe)===

In late January, three tornadoes touched down in eastern Europe: two in Turkey and one in Greece. In Kemalpaşa, Turkey, an F1 tornado caused the wall of an industrial building to collapse. Several other structures sustained roof damage. The strongest of these tornadoes was an F2 that touched down in northern Rhodes, destroying small structures and killing several heads of cattle. Hail up to [tpl]convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter fell in some places, damaging farmland and greenhouses. Accumulations of hail also reached [tpl]convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in Mersin Province, Turkey.

==February==

There were 61 tornadoes reported in the US in February, of which 68 were confirmed. The higher final total is due to a large number of late reports.
In addition to the events listed below, there was an F2 tornado in Greece on February 23 that destroyed a restaurant[tpl]cite web|publisher=European Severe Storm Laboratory|year=2011|accessdate=2011|title=European Severe Weather Database|url=http://www.essl.org/ESWD/[/tpl] and a brief, weak tornado associated with Cyclone Carlos which struck the town of Karratha in Western Australia.[tpl]cite web|last=Rickard|first=Lucy|title=Cyclone Carlos leaves Karratha intact, as tornado rips through town |url=http://www.watoday.com.au/environment/weather/cyclone-carlos-leaves-karratha-intact-as-tornado-rips-through-town-20110220-1b0qg.html|publisher=WAToday|accessdate=25 August 2013[/tpl]

===February 24===

Several tornadoes touched down across parts of the Southern United States. The most significant tornado was in the southeastern part of Nashville, Tennessee where significant damage was reported near Hickory Hollow Mall and near Percy Priest Lake in the evening (with widespread wind damage all across Middle Tennessee), and a tornado emergency was declared shortly thereafter for areas to the northeast in Wilson County where another tornado touched down with injuries. Both tornadoes were rated EF2. Other tornadoes touched down with varying degrees of damage in the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and parts of Arkansas including three others rated EF2.The overall damage from this system amounted to $1,500,000 [tpl]cite web | title=SPC Storm Reports for February 24, 2011 | url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110224_rpts.html | accessdate=February 24, 2011 | date=February 24, 2011 | publisher=Storm Prediction Center[/tpl]

===February 27–28===

Another severe weather event developed on February 27 and continued into February 28 across the Midwest and South. While a large portion of the damage was due to damaging straight-line winds, at least 35 tornadoes were reported across several states. The most destructive tornado was in Franklin County, Tennessee on the afternoon of February 28 where one person was killed by an EF2 tornado. It was the first killer tornado of 2011. Another strong tornado, rated EF3, resulted in houses destroyed near Eminence, Kentucky.[tpl]cite web|title=Storm Prediction Center 110227's Storm Reports|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110227_rpts.html|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110228_rpts.html|title=Storm Prediction Center 110228's Storm Reports|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=February 28, 2011[/tpl] Concentrated tornado activity also occurred in parts of Missouri and Illinois with 22 tornadoes in the region, some as strong as EF2, related to a series of squall lines with many embedded tornadoes. None of those tornadoes resulted in any fatalities.Overall damages from this system amounted to $12,800,000.[tpl]cite web|title=Tornadoes & Straight Line Wind Damage February 27–28, 2011|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lsx/?n=02_27_2011|publisher=National Weather Service St. Louis|accessdate=March 10, 2011[/tpl]

==March==

There were 95 tornadoes reported in the US in March, of which 75 were confirmed.

===March 5–6===

One confirmed EF0 tornado hit the town of Crowley, Louisiana. Another reportedly hit Greene County, Mississippi on March 5. It formed in a squall line, which hit portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. A deadly EF2 tornado struck Rayne, Louisiana early that afternoon, killing a mother while she protected her daughter.[tpl]cite web|author=Meghan Evans|publisher=Accuweather|date=March 6, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2011|title=Destructive Tornadoes Rip Across Louisiana|url=http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/46603/destructive-tornadoes-rip-acro.asp[/tpl] At least 12 others were injured. Initial assessments indicate that 62 homes were destroyed and 50 more damaged. Two EF0 tornadoes were also confirmed in eastern North Carolina.

===March 8–9===

Several tornadoes touched down once again on March 8 into March 9 from North Texas eastward to the Florida Panhandle, with Louisiana hardest hit. The most destructive tornadoes, rated EF2, touched down just north of New Orleans in St. Tammany Parish.[tpl]cite web|title=Storm Prediction Center 110309's Storm Reports|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110309_rpts.html|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=March 9, 2011[/tpl]

===March 21–23===

A tornado developed in the afternoon of March 21 near Maxwell, California, and it crossed Interstate 5, but however caused no known damage, as it was on the ground for only a few minutes. The same system produced more severe weather ahead of a dry line across eastern Nebraska, where tornadoes were reported northeast of Omaha. Later, a cluster of supercells began producing tornadoes in south-central Iowa, where a tornado was reported in Greenfield, Iowa, and at least 2 tornadoes were reported near Winterset, Iowa. Several funnel clouds were reported in Des Moines, where there was a possible touchdown. These funnels were associated with the storm that produced the first tornado to hit Greenfield and Winterset.
On March 23, more tornadoes and severe weather developed with the most significant tornadoes touching down in East Tennessee where significant damage was reported. Near Greenback in Blount County, an EF3 tornado was confirmed with severe damage in the area. Another notable tornado touched down in southwestern Pennsylvania, most notably in Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania. It was rated EF2.

===March 29–31===

On March 29, a warm front over the Gulf of Mexico associated with an upper-level low over Texas moved northward into the Gulf Coast States, bringing scattered severe weather.[tpl]cite web|author=Jeffrey L.

==April==

There were 875 tornadoes reported in the United States in April, of which 768 were confirmed.
That set a new all-time monthly record, significantly exceeding the previous record of 552 in May 2003 and nearly tripling the old record for April (267 in 1974).[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 25, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2011|title=April Tornadoes|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/april-tornadoes.png[/tpl] In Alabama, the monthly (for April) and yearly record was broken with 89 and 98 tornadoes respectively.[tpl]cite web|work=National Weather Service Office in Birmingham, Alabama|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 10, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2011|title=April Severe Weather Events Set New Tornado Records for Alabama|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=climo_2011torstats[/tpl]

===April 4–5===

Several storms started to develop in the evening on April 3. Storms in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Illinois brought severe thunderstorms to the areas. A tornado watch was issued for Iowa and Illinois as the storms rolled through, and later a severe thunderstorm watch for northeastern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. However, there were no reported tornadoes.[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 4, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 3, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110403_rpts.html[/tpl] Continuing eastward, the system entered an environment favoring tornadic development.

===April 8–9 (Eastern United States)===

A large storm system with an associated frontal boundary moved northward and eastward across the central United States beginning on April 8. While initial severe weather was limited, a lone supercell broke out ahead of a mesoscale convective system in Pulaski County, Virginia on the eastern end of the warm front that evening. Two tornadoes were confirmed, one of which was an EF2 that caused severe damage in Pulaski, Virginia. Numerous houses were damaged and eight people were injured.[tpl]cite web|author=NWS Blacksburg|publisher=National Weather Service|date=April 9, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2011|title=Multiple tornadoes confirmed on April 8, 2011|url=http://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&product=PNS&issuedby=RNK[/tpl] During the afternoon of April 9, supercells developed along the warm front, and tracked through parts of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, generating softball sized hail, and at least four tornadoes.[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 11, 2011|accessdate=April 11, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 9, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110409_rpts.html[/tpl]

===April 9–11 (Midwestern United States)===

During the evening of April 9, several severe thunderstorms developed across Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa. A single supercell became tornadic over extreme western Iowa, producing a family of ten tornadoes over the course of five hours. The first was [tpl]convert|0.75|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and struck Mapleton, Iowa,[tpl]cite web|work=National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 11, 2011|accessdate=April 11, 2011|title=Mapleton Iowa Tornado April 9, 2011|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/news/display_cmsstory.php?wfo=oax&storyid=66512&source=0[/tpl] destroying about 100 homes.

Additional tornadic activity developed on April 10 across Wisconsin with several more tornadoes reported there.

===April 14–16===

During the afternoon of April 14, a possible significant tornado outbreak started setting up. A PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) tornado watch was issued for much of eastern Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2011|title=PDS Tornado Watch 135|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0135.html[/tpl] Supercells explosively developed over central Oklahoma. Storm chasers in the region reported several funnel clouds and two touchdowns, neither of which resulted in damage. Several tornadoes were confirmed through storm chaser video and local emergency management services. A large, intense tornado caused severe damage in the towns of Atoka and Tushka where many houses were destroyed or flattened. Numerous injuries were reported in the latter of these areas.[tpl]cite web|work=KXII-TV|publisher=Gray Television|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2011|title=Severe Weather Live Blog|url=http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/Severe_Weather_Live_Blog_119873699.html[/tpl] Two people were killed and 25 more injured in Tushka.[tpl]cite news|author=Unattributed|agency=Associated Press|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2011|title=5 killed as severe storms hit Okla., Ark.|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5xxi4N2NX[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Unattributed|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=April 14, 2011|title=2 reported killed in Oklahoma tornado outbreak |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42600584/ns/weather/[/tpl] In Arkansas, 2 people were killed when an EF1 downed a tree which landed on a house.[tpl]cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for April 14, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110414_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Michelle Edmonds|publisher=KHTV|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=April 15, 2011|title=Four fatalities in Arkansas caused by storms|url=http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/153665/2/Four-fatalities-in-Arkansas-caused-by-storms[/tpl]
During the late-night hours into the morning of April 15, tornadic activity lessened. However, by the late morning hours, supercell thunderstorms developed again over parts of Mississippi, and tornadoes began to touch down again. A tornado emergency was declared for the northern Jackson metropolitan area as a result at shortly after 11:00 am CDT (1600 UTC). A destructive tornado moved across the area with severe damage and multiple injuries according to WLBT coverage. That afternoon, Mississippi State University spotters confirmed a large tornado in east-central Mississippi and west-central Alabama and another tornado emergency was issued. ABC 33/40 coverage reported that the tornado was 3/4 mile (1.2 km) in width. Over 90 tornado sightings were reported that day and at least eight people were killed in Mississippi and Alabama.
On April 16, another PDS tornado watch, along with a "high risk" alert from the SPC were issued for central and eastern North Carolina.  At least 24 died and 135 were seriously injured in what became North Carolina's worst tornado outbreak in 25 years; tornadoes also struck South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wral.com/weather/story/9469626/|title=Death toll from NC storm rises|last1=Johnson|first1=Anne|last2=Hanrahan|first2=Kathy|work=WRAL-TV|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2011[/tpl] Twelve of the North Carolina deaths took place in Bertie County; tornado emergencies were issued for Raleigh, Snow Hill, and Wilson at the height of the outbreak. In North Carolina, twelve supercells produced at least 25 tornadoes, with at least 32 counties affected.  A total of 21 businesses and 440 homes were destroyed, 63 of those homes in Raleigh; about 92 businesses and 6,189 homes suffered significant damage, 184 of those homes in Raleigh.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2011/apr/18/tornado-touched-down-davie-county-weather-service--ar-958230/|title=Tornado touched down in Davie County, weather service says|last=Young|first=Wesley|work=Winston-Salem Journal|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/04/19/1139389/after-shock-subsides-stress-and.html|title=Storm damage could add up to millions|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Thomas|last2=Garfield|first2=Matt|last3=Kellner|first3=Chelsea|work=News & Observer|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]

===April 19–24===

Yet another severe weather event developed across the Midwest and southern Great Plains on April 19 as another dynamic low pressure system tracked across the area. Thunderstorms began in the late afternoon and early evening with large hail and several tornadoes. Significant damage was reported near Bowling Green, Missouri and Girard, Illinois as a result of tornadoes, the latter of which was rated EF3. Another large tornado was reported near Octavia, Oklahoma before the supercells merged into a very large squall line. Overnight, the squall line tracked eastward with widespread wind damage and many embedded tornadoes across several states, a few as strong as EF2 but most were brief and weak. In the early hours of April 20, 2011, a tornado tore through a neighborhood in Oregon, Ohio leaving some significant damage and no injuries. Also, 3 tornadoes hit New Albany, Indiana, and Jeffersonville, Indiana. Both cities are just north of Louisville, Kentucky[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 19, 2011|accessdate=April 19, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 19, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110419_rpts.html[/tpl] On April 22, the outbreak continued with several tornadoes causing damage in the Midwest, the most notable being a violent EF4 that struck St. Louis, Missouri, causing extensive damage. A few more tornadoes were reported on April 23–24, however most did not cause any severe damage, though one EF2 tornado caused structural damage in the town of Bardwell, Kentucky.
Severe weather once again developed across parts of the Midwest on April 22. The hardest-hit area was parts of the St. Louis metropolitan area. A destructive tornado tracked across the region with severe damage in several communities including houses destroyed in communities such as Bridgeton, Ferguson, Florissant, Hazelwood, Maryland Heights and New Melle. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was hard hit with severe damage to numerous facilities there and injuries reported. Windows were blown out of the terminals there and airplanes were flipped in the field. The airport has been closed as officials investigate the damage, but should be partially operational by the end of April 23 (the heavily damaged Concourse C reopened on April 2, 2012).[tpl]cite web|last=Leiser|first=Ken|title=Lambert opens refurbished C Concourse after twister|url=http://www.stltoday.com/travel/lambert-opens-refurbished-c-concourse-after-twister/article_8a5f5baa-7cd3-11e1-8923-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=29 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 22, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 22, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110422_rpts.html[/tpl] The tornado has been given a preliminary rating of EF4 based on finding of flattened houses in Bridgeton.

===April 25–28===

Between April 25 and 28, a historic tornado outbreak took place across much of the Southern United States as well as parts of the Midwest and Northeast. With over 300 confirmed tornadoes and 325 tornadic fatalities, the outbreak ranks as  one of the worst in United States history. More than three dozen tornadoes were confirmed each day of the event, with 46 on April 25, 55 on April 26, a record 206 in 24 hours on April 27 and 51 on April 28. In terms of violent tornadoes, the event ranks third with 15 EF4/5 storms, behind the 1974 Super Outbreak and 1965 Palm Sunday outbreak.
A large outbreak was possible for April 25–27 as the SPC issued a moderate risk of severe weather for three consecutive days, centered over Arkansas through Tennessee. By the late-afternoon hours of April 25, several tornadoes had been reported across a few states, including two which caused significant damage in Oklahoma and Texas. At 3:25 pm CST (2025 UTC), the SPC issued a PDS tornado watch for much of Arkansas and parts of Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana.[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 25, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 25, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110425_rpts.html[/tpl] Tornadoes were scattered that day until early evening, when an intense tornadic cell tracked near the Little Rock metropolitan area and a tornado emergency was declared for Vilonia, Arkansas. A 0.5 mile (0.80 km) wide EF2 tornado then caused extensive damage in Vilonia. At least four people are known to have died in the town with many more injured.
On April 27, a large tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama, killing 44 people.[tpl]cite web|last=Morton|title=52nd fatality added to storm’s death toll|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20110929/NEWS/110929702/1007?Title=52nd-fatality-added-to-storm-s-death-toll-|work=Tuscaloosa News[/tpl]  The Tuscaloosa mayor called the damage "catastrophic." The same tornado hit the northern suburbs of Birmingham, Alabama, shortly thereafter, killing 20 more people. Television reporters in Birmingham, filming the tornado, reported that even from miles away, the
funnel was so wide that they could not zoom their cameras out far enough to get the entire funnel into the frame at once. Over 200 tornadoes were reported during the SPC's reporting day of 1200Z April 27 (7:00 am CDT) to 1200Z April 28 (7:00 am CDT).[tpl]cite web|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011|title=Storm Reports for April 27, 2011|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/110427_rpts.html[/tpl] 325 deaths were reported as a result of the outbreak, with as many as 238 in Alabama alone. The overall death toll also includes 33 deaths in Tennessee, 31 in Mississippi, 14 in Georgia, 5 in Arkansas, and 4 in Virginia, according to state officials.
On April 27, President Barack Obama approved Governor Robert Bentley's request for emergency federal assistance including search and rescue support.
On April 28, 2011, the National Weather Service sent out people to survey the damage; however, with the large number of tornadoes across Alabama, the reports were not finalized for months. By April 30, the death toll from the event (including death tolls from flooding and other severe weather) stood at more than 340 people across six states.
In Fergus, Ontario an F0 tornado (the Fujita scale is still used in Canada) downed trees and ripped siding off store buildings on April 27.[tpl]cite web|work=The Weather Network|date=August 26, 2011|accessdate=August 26, 2011|title=Tallying Canada's Confirmed Tornadoes|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&stormfile=tallying_canadas_confirmed__250711?ref=ccbox_homepage_category1[/tpl]

===May 3 (New Zealand)===

On May 3, a line of showers and thunderstorms tracked into the Northland from the Tasman Sea, bringing unsettled weather to much of the region. The Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited (MetService) mentioned the possibility of strong thunderstorms being embedded within the line, producing small hail and gusty winds. Significant upward motion in the atmosphere developed in the region surrounding Auckland, prompting the MetService to issue a high-risk of thunderstorms in the area. With low-level wind shear and helicity, the possibility of tornadic activity was present. At 2:55 pm NZST, a hook echo was apparent on the weather radar, indicating strong rotation and a likely tornado.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Kreft|publisher=Meteorological Service of New Zealand|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2011|title=Albany Tornado, Tuesday 3 May 2011|url=http://blog.metservice.com/2011/05/albany-tornado-tuesday-3-may-2011/[/tpl]
Several minutes later, around 3:00 pm NZST, a tornado struck the Auckland suburb of Albany. With winds estimated at [tpl]convert|125|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], the tornado ranked as a high-end EF2 and caused considerable damage along a [tpl]convert|3.1|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long track in the area.[tpl]cite news|title=Violent tornado rips through northern Auckland, killing one person and leaving 10 in hospital|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/one-person-killed-in-auckland-as-tornado-hits-new-zealand/story-e6frfkyi-1226049142526#ixzz1LIPMpHvy|accessdate=May 3, 2011|newspaper=News.com.au|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=News Limited[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Hayden Donnell and Robert Smith |work=The New Zealand Herald|date=May 3, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2011|title=Slim risk of more tornadoes tonight|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10723163[/tpl] Several cars were tossed up to [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in the air by the storm and pieces of iron roofing were reportedly seen [tpl]convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above the ground.

===May 9–10===

On May 9, a strong upper-level ridge over the Mississippi River Valley produced a narrow axis of extreme instability from eastern Nebraska to central South Dakota.

===May 11–13===

On May 11, an upper-level low moved out of the Four Corners Region into the Central Plains, prompting a moderate-risk of severe weather from the SPC. The main threat from these storms was expected to be large hail, with a considerable region being given a 45 percent chance of hail.[tpl]cite web|author=John Chris Broyles|work=Storm Prediction Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2011|title=May 11, 2011 0600 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2011/day1otlk_20110511_1200.html[/tpl] Later that day, the moderate-risk was discontinued and replaced by a large area under a slight-risk.
