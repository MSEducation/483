Paul-Pierre Henry (Paul Henry) (21 August 1848 – 4 January 1905) and his brother Mathieu-Prosper Henry (Prosper Henry) (10 December 1849 – 25 July 1903) were French opticians and astronomers.
They made refracting telescopes and instruments for observatories, and were involved in the origin of the Carte du Ciel project.
Between the two of them, they discovered a total of 14 asteroids.  The Minor Planet Center credits their discoveries under "P.P. Henry" and "P.M. Henry", respectively. The lunar crater Henry Frères is named after them jointly, as is Henry Crater on Mars.
