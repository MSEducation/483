Phi Delta Phi (ΦΔΦ) is an international legal honor society and the oldest legal organization in continuous existence in the United States. Predating even the American Bar Association, Phi Delta Phi was originally a fraternity; however, it became an honor society in 2012. Until its switch to becoming an honor society in 2012, Phi Delta Phi was the oldest professional fraternity in continuous existence. The fraternity was founded at the University of Michigan in 1869 "to promote a higher standard of professional ethics." 

==History==

Phi Delta Phi Fraternity was founded in the law department of the University of Michigan by John M. Howard of the class of 1871.  Howard was a graduate of Monmouth College and member of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI).  His initial intent was to found a chapter of FIJI at the University, but he did not follow through with the plan because of the large number of chapters already in place on the campus.  Howard instead turned his efforts toward founding a fraternity devoted purely to students of the legal profession.
