CATEGORIES: Living museums, Types of museum

A living museum is a type of museum, in which historical events showing the life in ancient times are performed, especially in ethnographic or historical views, or processes for producing a commercial product in terms of technical and technological developments are shown, especially the craft. It is a type of museum that recreates to the fullest extent conditions of a culture, natural environment or historical period. Sometimes, a drama performing group of historical reenactment of historical scenes in historical buildings is considered as a living museum.

==Comparison with open-air museum==

An open-air museum is a special kind of a living museum. In a living museum, a visitor is using their senses. The objective is total immersion, designing exhibits so that visitors can experience the specific culture, environment or historical period using all the physical senses: sight, smell, sound, taste and touch. In an open-air museum, the exhibits are shown outside buildings, especially collections of houses, buildings, machines, rails etc. An open-air museum can be also a living museum, but this is not necessarily the case.
