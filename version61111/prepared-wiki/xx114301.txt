Wayne Oren Nordhagen (born July 4, 1948 in Thief River Falls, Minnesota) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder and designated hitter. He played eight seasons in the majors for the Chicago White Sox (1976â€“81), Toronto Blue Jays (1982), Pittsburgh Pirates (1982) and Chicago Cubs (1983).
Drafted by the New York Yankees in 1968, Nordhagen played in 502 games in his eight major league seasons. In an oddity, Nordhagen was traded twice in ten days for the same player, outfielder Dick Davis. On June 15, 1982, Nordhagen was traded by the Blue Jays to the Philadelphia Phillies for Davis. Later that day, without having played for the Phillies, he was traded again, this time to the Pirates for outfielder Bill Robinson. On June 25, after playing in just one game for the Pirates (going 2-for-4 with 2 RBI), Nordhagen was traded back to the Blue Jays as the player to be named later in a trade that occurred on June 22, in which the Pirates had acquired the very same Dick Davis.Wayne Nordhagen's transactions at Baseball Reference
