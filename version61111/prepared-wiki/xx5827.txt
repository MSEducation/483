The killer whale (Orcinus orca), also referred to as the orca whale or orca, and less commonly as the blackfish, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family. Killer whales are found in all oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. Killer whales as a species have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals like pinnipeds, and even large whales. Killer whales are regarded as apex predators, lacking natural predators.
Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal family groups which are the most stable of any animal species.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=12[/tpl] Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of culture.
The IUCN currently assesses the orca's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with fisheries. In late 2005, the "southern resident" population of killer whales that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.
Wild killer whales are not considered a threat to humans,[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=19[/tpl] although there have been cases of captives killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/video/2012/07/26/footage-shows-killer-whale-attack-at-sea?videoId=236665315 |title=Footage shows killer whale attack at SeaWorld | Video |publisher=Reuters.com |accessdate=2013-10-09[/tpl] Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Orcinus orca is the only recognized extant species in the genus Orcinus, one of many animal species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in Systema Naturae.[tpl]la icon[/tpl] [tpl]Cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=C. |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I |edition=10th |publisher=Holmiae. (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |page=824 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#3[/tpl] Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of a killer whale in his "Fish book" of 1558, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.Zum Wal in der Marienkirche (in German). St. Mary's Church, Greifswald. Retrieved 2010-02-16
The killer whale is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=19[/tpl] Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.

===Common names===

English-speaking scientists most often use the term "killer whale", although the term "orca" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name Orcinus means "of the kingdom of the dead",[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=69[/tpl] or "belonging to Orcus".Killer Whales. Scientific Classification, Seaworld.org, 23 September 2010, Retrieved 2010-09-09.
Ancient Romans originally applied orca (plural orcae) to these animals, possibly borrowing it from the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|ὄρυξ[/tpl], which referred (among other things) to a whale species. Since the 1960s, orca has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used. The term orca is preferred by some to avoid the negative connotations of "killer",Olsen, Ken. Orcas on the Edge – Killer: It's a Name, Not an Accusation. National Wildlife Federation. 10 January 2006. Retrieved 2010-01-26. and because, being part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other dolphins than to whales.Best, P.B. 2007 Whales and Dolphins of the Southern African Subregion ISBN 978-0-521-89710-5
According to some authors, the name killer whale would be a mistranslation of the 18th century Spanish name asesina ballenas which means literally whale killer.Orca - Orcinus orca by Klappenbach, Laura in About.com - visited 23-October-2013 Basque whalers would have given it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting their own prey.
They are sometimes referred to as blackfish, a name used for some whale species, as well. Grampus is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of grampus should not be confused with the Grampus genus, whose only member is Risso's dolphin.Leatherwood, Stephen and Larry J. Hobbs (1988).

Researchers later discovered transients are not born into resident pods or vice versa. The evolutionary split between the two groups is believed to have begun two million years ago.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=22[/tpl] Genetic data indicate the types have not interbred in the wild for up to 10,000 years.
Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales have been distinguished elsewhere. Separate populations of fish-eating and mammal-eating killer whales have been identified around the United Kingdom.[ref]

Three types have been documented in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.

The identified seven ecotypes in isolated ecological niches. Of three orca ecotypes in the Antarctic, one preys on minke whales, the second on seals and penguins and the third on fish. Another ecotype lives in the eastern North Atlantic, while the three Northeast Pacific ecotypes are labeled the transient, resident and offshore populations. The research supported a proposal to reclassify the Antarctic seal- and fish-eating populations and the North Pacific transients, should be recognized as distinct species, leaving the remaining ecotypes as subspecies. The first split in the orca population, between the North Pacific transients and the rest, occurred an estimated 700,000 years ago. Such a designation would enable/require that each new species be subject to separate conservation assessments.[tpl]cite news|first=NICHOLAS |last=WADE |date=April 26, 2010 |publisher=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/science/27whale.html?src=sch&pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Cracking Orca’s Code: It Comes in Several Types[/tpl]
==Appearance and morphology== 
A typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white.

Behind the fin, it has a dark grey "saddle patch" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=20[/tpl] When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species, such as the false killer whale or Risso's dolphin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wildwhales.org/other-species/|title=Wild Whales|publisher=Vancouver Aquarium|accessdate=2012-03-23[/tpl] The killer whale's teeth are very strong and covered in enamel. Its jaws are a powerful gripping apparatus, as the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.[tpl]sfn|Heptner|Nasimovich|Bannikov|Hoffmann|1996|p=683[/tpl]
Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from [tpl]convert|6|to|8|m[/tpl] long and weigh in excess of [tpl]convert|6|t[/tpl].

An individual killer whale can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=1–27[/tpl]

==Life cycle==

Female killer whales mature at around age 15. They then have periods of polyestrous cycling with noncycling periods of between three and 16 months. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. Mothers calve, with usually a single offspring, about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first six to seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=35[/tpl] Weaning begins at about 12 months and completes by the age of two. According to observations in several regions, all male and female killer whale pod members participate in the care of the young.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=35[/tpl] Killer and pilot whales are two of several species (as is now believed to be widespread among many other mammalian species, including humans) where the females are known to go through menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding.Bowden, D.M. and Williams, D.D.

Females breed until age 40, meaning on average they raise five offspring. The lifespans of wild females average 50 years, with a maximum of 80–90 years.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=26[/tpl] Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21.

Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of killer whales (>0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered "common" (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100 km²) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands. High densities have also been reported but not quantified in the western North Pacific around the Sea of Japan (in very limited areas), Shiretoko Peninsula and off Kushiro (Resident and Transient groups began colonizing in these areas possibly after in 2000s), Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands, Kamchatka and the Commander Islands and in the Southern Hemisphere off the coasts of South Australia, Patagonia, off the coast of southern Brazil and the tip of southern Africa. They are reported as seasonally common in the Canadian Arctic, including Baffin Bay between Greenland and Nunavut, and around Tasmania and Macquarie Island. Information for offshore regions and tropical waters is more scarce, but widespread, if not frequent, sightings indicate the killer whale can survive in most water temperatures. They have been sighted, for example, in the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Indian Ocean around the Seychelles. A distinct population may exist in Papua New Guinea.Visser N.I., Killer whales in Papua New Guinea waters, http://www.orcaresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Visser-2007-Killer-whales-in-PNG-waters-SC-59-SM20.pdf., Orca Research Trusthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxbTFPWVdg8
Probably the largest population lives in Antarctic waters, where they range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. In contrast, killer whales are seasonal summer visitors to Arctic waters, where they do not approach the ice pack. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic.[ref]

Killer whales hunt varied prey; however, different populations or species tend to specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species.[tpl]cite journal|author= Morell, Virginia |title= Killer Whales Earn Their Name |journal=Science|pages= 274–276 |volume= 331 |year= 2011|doi= 10.1126/science.331.6015.274|pmid= 21252323|issue= 6015[/tpl] For example, some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Other populations prey on seals. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet. About 65% of them are large, fatty Chinook.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=18[/tpl] Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|2006[/tpl] Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, a killer whale eats [tpl]convert|227|kg|lb[/tpl] each day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/animals/creaturefeature/orca/|title=National Geographic creature feature|author=Hughes, Catherine D.|accessdate=2007-07-25[/tpl]
Killer whales are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=84|title=Orcinus orca – Orca (Killer Whale)|accessdate=2007-06-26|publisher=Marinebio.org[/tpl]
Each population seems to prefer one kind of prey. Those that feed on whales may not even recognize fish as food. This specialization in diet and hunting, combined with small differences in markings, suggest that they might be different species, rather than populations. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.

===Fish, reptiles and invertebrates===

Fish-eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish, particularly salmon, herring, and tuna. In New Zealand, rays are killer whales' most frequent prey,[ref]

Squid and sea turtles are also taken.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=17[/tpl]
While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals, herring are often caught using carousel feeding; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, either stunning or killing up to 10–15 fish at a time. The herring are then eaten one at a time. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian killer whale population and with some oceanic dolphin species.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z93-210 |author= Similä, T. and Ugarte, F. |year=1993 |title=Surface and underwater observations of cooperatively feeding killer whales in Northern Norway|journal=Can.

Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in sharks and rays by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe.

Killer whales are very sophisticated and effective predators. Thirty-two cetacean species have been recorded as killer whale prey, from examining either stomach contents, scarring on the prey's body, or feeding activity. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales.[tpl]cite journal|author=Visser, Ingrid N|year=2010|title=First Record of Predation on False Killer Whales (Pseudorca crassidens) by Killer Whales (Orcinus orca)|journal=Aquatic Mammals|pages=195–204|doi=10.1578/AM.36.2.2010.195|last2=Zaeschmar|first2=Jochen|last3=Halliday|first3=Jo|last4=Abraham|first4=Annie|last5=Ball|first5=Phil|last6=Bradley|first6=Robert|last7=Daly|first7=Shamus|last8=Hatwell|first8=Tommy|last9=Johnson|first9=Tammy|displayauthors= 9|volume=36|issue=2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Ford, J.

Hunting large whales usually takes several hours. Killer whales generally choose to attack young or weak animals, instead. However, a group of five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2001.tb01000.x|author=Pitman, Robert L. et al.|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/507/ |title=Killer Whale Predation on Sperm Whales: Observations and Implications|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=17|issue=3|pages=494–507|year=2001[/tpl] Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.[tpl]cite book | author = Estes, et al |title =Whales, Whaling, and Ocean Ecosystems| year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-520-24884-7[/tpl]
Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less frequently taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=45[/tpl] Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence.Pinell, Nadine, et al.

In steeply banked beaches off Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, killer whales feed on South American sea lions and southern elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behavior, and can require years of practice for the young.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=29[/tpl] Killer whales can then release them again near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|pp=61–62[/tpl] "Wave-hunting" killer whales spy-hop to locate Weddell seals, crabeater seals, leopard seals, and penguins resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe.

Killer whales have also been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer and moose swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America.[tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|p=23[/tpl] Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers.[tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|p=124[/tpl] One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=19[/tpl]
Killer whales in many areas may also prey on cormorants and gulls.[tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|p=14[/tpl] A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behavior.[tpl]Cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2005/0907-ap.html |title=Whale uses fish as bait to catch seagulls then shares strategy with fellow orcas |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2010-02-18[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Day-to-day killer whale behavior generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales are frequently active at the surface, engaging in acrobatic behaviors such as breaching, spyhopping, and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water, helps the animal view its surroundings.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=64[/tpl]
Resident killer whales swim with porpoises, other dolphins, seals, and sea lions, which are common prey for transient killer whales.

===Social structure===

Killer whales are notable for their complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates, such as humans, live in comparably complex social structures.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=35[/tpl] Due to orcas' complex social bonds and society, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep these animals in captive situations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.keepwhaleswild.org/ |title=Keep Whales Wild |publisher=Keep Whales Wild |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-16[/tpl] Resident killer whales in the eastern North Pacific have a particularly complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for their entire lives. These societies are based on matrilines consisting of the matriarch and her descendants which form part of the line, as do their descendants. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12[/tpl]
Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12[/tpl]
Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12[/tpl] DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39[/tpl]
Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=12[/tpl]
The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.[tpl]#tag:ref|In the northeast Pacific, three communities of fish-eating killer whales have been identified: the southern community (one clan, three pods, 90 killer whales as of 2006), the northern community (three clans, 16 pods, 214 killer whales as of 2000), and the south Alaskan community (two clans, 11 pods, 211 killer whales as of 2000).|group=Note[/tpl]
Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=13[/tpl] As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14[/tpl]

===Vocalizations===

 
 
Like all cetaceans, killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.
Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20[/tpl] Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=20[/tpl] They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.
All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time.[tpl]cite journal|author=Foote, A. D., Osborne, R. W., & Hoelzel, A.|year=2008|title=Temporal and contextual patterns of killer whale (Orcinus orca) call type production|journal=Ethology|volume=114|issue=6|pages=599-606|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2008.01496.x[/tpl] Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=14[/tpl] Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members.[tpl]cite journal|author=Filatova, Olga A.; Fedutin, Ivan D.; Burdin, Alexandr M. and Hoyt, Erich |year=2007|url=http://russianorca.com/Doc/Science/structure_repert.pdf |title=The structure of the discrete call repertoire of killer whales Orcinus orca from Southeast Kamchatka|journal=Bioacoustics|volume=16|pages=261–280|doi=10.1080/09524622.2007.9753581|issue=3[/tpl] For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ev/Research/Faculty/OVALItems/pdf_Papers/SpongCalvesPaper.pdf|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110527060306/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ev/Research/Faculty/OVALItems/pdf_Papers/SpongCalvesPaper.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-27|last1=Weiß|first1=Brigitte M.|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=119|last2=Ladich|issue=1|first2=Friedrich|last3=Spong|first3=Paul|last4=Symonds|first4=Helena|year=2006|pmid=16454316 |title=Vocal behaviour of resident killer whale matrilines with newborn calves: The role of family signatures|doi=10.1121/1.2130934|pages=627–35[/tpl] Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=15–16[/tpl] When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kremers, D., Lemasson, A., Almunia, J., & Wanker, R.|year=2012|title=Vocal sharing and individual acoustic distinctiveness within a group of captive orcas (Orcinus orca)|journal=Journal Of Comparative Psychology|volume=126|issue=4|pages=433-445|doi=10.1037/a0028858[/tpl] 
Dialects of killer whales not only distinguish them between pods, but also between types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore killer whales have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=15–16[/tpl]
The vocalizations of killer whales in other parts of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.[tpl]cite journal|author=Simon, M., McGregor, P. K., & Ugarte, F|year=2007|title=The relationship between the acoustic behaviour and surface activity of killer whales (Orcinus orca) that feed on herring (Clupea harengus)|journal=Acta Ethologica|volume=10|issue=2|pages=47-53|doi=10.1007/s10211-007-0029-7[/tpl]

Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals[ref]
Spear, Kevin. Killer whales: How smart are they? Orlando Sentinel, 7 March 2010. Retrieved 2010-03-07[/ref] (after Sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent,[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=67[/tpl] although defining and measuring "intelligence" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioral strategies are very different from those of humans.[tpl]sfn|Carwardine|2001|p=67[/tpl]
Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|pp=61–62[/tpl]
People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but also have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=42[/tpl] Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:
[tpl]quote|"It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats."|Craig Matkin[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=42[/tpl][/tpl]
In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.[ref]

==Conservation==

In 2008, the IUCN changed its assessment of the killer whale's conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.
Like other animals at the highest trophic levels, the killer whale is particularly at risk of poisoning from accumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99[/tpl] European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=99[/tpl] Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations.
In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=98[/tpl]
In 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90.M. L. Lyke, Granny's Struggle: When Granny is gone, will her story be the last chapter?, Seattle Post Intelligencer, 14 October 2006 In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past ten years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.Le Phuong.

In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behavior displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars. "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said." The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the exact day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of the two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.
Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government in Vancouver, Canada, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats.[tpl]cite news|title=Ottawa Sued over Lack of Legislation to Protect B.C.

Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.
Noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=100[/tpl] In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters.[ref]

The Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/03/valdezwhales/ |title=Unique Killer-Whale Pod Doomed by Exxon Valdez | Wired Science |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=2009-12-31 |first=Brandon |last=Keim |date=2009-03-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whalesalaska.org/docs/m356p269.pdf |title=Marine Ecology Progress Series 356:269 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-12-31[/tpl]

==Relationship with humans==

===Indigenous cultures===

The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature killer whales throughout their history, art, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded killer whales as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of killer whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them.[tpl]sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=115–120[/tpl] For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the killer whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors.[tpl]sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=115–120[/tpl] In Kwakwaka'wakw and Nuu-chah-nulth mythology, killer whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs.[tpl]sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=115–120[/tpl] The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the killer whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.[tpl]sfn|Ford|Ellis|Balcomb|2000|p=11[/tpl]
The Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for killer whales, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial site at the Port au Choix National Historic Site.Rollmann, Hans (1999).

==="Killer" stereotype===

In Western cultures, killer whales were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1[/tpl] The first written description of a killer whale was given by Pliny the Elder circa AD 70, who wrote, "Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of whales... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming."Gaius Plinius Secundus. Historia Naturalis 9.5.12 (Latin), in Bill Thayer's LacusCurtius: Into the Roman World. (See also an English translation by John Bostock and Henry Thomas Riley, 1855.) Retrieved 2010-02-19.

In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey.[ref]

Competition with fishermen also led to killer whales being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1[/tpl] As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the killer whales captured in Puget Sound for aquaria through 1970 bore bullet scars.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=41[/tpl] The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of killer whales in Icelandic waters in 1956.Killer Whales Destroyed: VP-7 Accomplishes Special Task, Naval Aviation News, December, 1956, p. 19.

===Modern Western attitudes===

Western attitudes towards killer whales have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1[/tpl] So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.[tpl]sfn|Francis|Hewlett|2007|pp=58–59[/tpl]
Between 1964 and 1976, 50 killer whales from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother-offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.[tpl]sfn|Baird|2002|pp=73–80[/tpl]
Bigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|pp=Chapter 1[/tpl] The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.[tpl]sfn|Heimlich|Boran|2001|p=11[/tpl] In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.
The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film Free Willy, the movie's captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters.[tpl]cite news|last=Wood|first=Daniel|title=Death of Sea World trainer: Do 'killer whales' belong in theme parks?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0224/Death-of-Sea-World-trainer-Do-killer-whales-belong-in-theme-parks|accessdate=19 March 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=24 February 2010[/tpl]  In 2002 the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behavior and social structure of the region's killer whales.[tpl]Cite news|title=Orphaned orca's reunion with family celebrated|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/13/bc-springer.html|date=13 July 2007|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2007-11-06[/tpl] The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.[tpl]Cite news|first=Robert |last=McClure |title=Luna the orca killed by tugboat |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Luna-the-orca-killed-by-tugboat-1198168.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher=Hearst Corporation |location=Seattle, Washington |date=11 March 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-08[/tpl]

===Whaling===

The first records of commercial hunting of killer whales date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|p=39[/tpl] Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales and Norway took 987.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=34[/tpl] Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers,[ref]
Killer Whale, Bergen Museum. Retrieved 2010-01-26[/ref] including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research.[tpl]sfn|Obee|Ellis|1992|p=34[/tpl]Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts.
Killer whales have helped humans hunting other whales.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Reeves|first1=Randall|last2=Whitehead|first2=Hal|title=Killer whales and whaling: the scavenging hypothesis|journal=Biology Letters|volume=1|issue=4|page=415|year=2005|pmid=17148221|pmc=1626385|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0348[/tpl] One well-known example was in Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as they would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.

===Captivity===

The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.[tpl]sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44[/tpl]
Organizations such as the World Society for the Protection of Animals and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.[tpl]#tag:ref|Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.|group=Note[/tpl] In the wild, females which survive infancy live 50 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 30 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/a_closer_look_at_marine_mammals/orcas.html|title=Orcas|publisher=Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/cap-orc-glo-000016.pdf |title=Orcas in captivity |publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society |accessdate=2010-01-26[/tpl] Wild killer whales travel up to [tpl]convert|160|km|mi|-1[/tpl] each day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.[ref]
