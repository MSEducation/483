Richard Bernard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer best known for being a national radio and television comedian between 1937 and 1971 and host of the long-running television program The Red Skelton Show. Skelton, who has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, began entertaining as a youngster. His show business career included a stint as a circus clown when he was in his teens.  Skelton continued on to vaudeville,  films, radio, TV, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.
He learned his comedic and pantomime skills through experience, beginning at age 10 as part of a traveling medicine show.  Skelton then worked on a showboat as the era of that form of entertainment was waning.  He worked the burlesque circuit until its comedic standards began to change, coming into vaudeville as radio and films began to replace live entertainment. Skelton's lifestyle on the road meant having very little baggage, so he had few props to perform with.  He devised routines that required only a hat, which Skelton would fashion into appropriate shapes to suit his characters.  A pantomime sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife opened the door for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films; it even opened the door of the Oval Office. He had long and successful careers in both radio and in films, but was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. Skelton's enthusiasm was rewarded with a twenty year career on network television with a regular program. Despite high ratings, his television show was canceled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power.
While his first wife, comedy writer Edna Stillwell, provided the spark for Skelton the performer, it was his second wife, Georgia Davis, who convinced him that the art work he had done as a hobby for many years was worth sharing with the public. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.
Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh and wanted to be known as a clown, because he defined it as being able to do everything.  He entertained three generations of Americans during his career as a performer.  The earliest generation welcomed him to their cities and towns as a performer in various stage venues, the next into their homes on radio and television, while the younger generation was again able to welcome him personally, because Skelton focused his time and energy on personal appearance performances after he no longer had a regular television show.

==Biography==

===Early years-the medicine show and the circus===

Born in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was the fourth son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph E. Skelton (1878–1913). Joseph, a grocer, died two months before his last child was born; he had once been a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm|title=Red Skelton, Knockabout Comic and Clown Prince of the Airwaves, Is Dead at 84|author=Severo, Richard|date=September 18, 1997|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=May 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_RLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2u0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6805,971926&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Lovable Clown Red Skelton Dies|date=September 18, 1997|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=May 18, 2011[/tpl] In Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since Skelton began working at such an early age, he may have had to say he was older than he actually was in order to work.Hyatt, p. 6[tpl]#tag:ref| There is also an an account of Skelton's using a birth certificate of one of his older brothers as proof he was legally of age.|name=age|group=note[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Hyatt also refers to the 1980 People magazine story where Skelton says he is in his seventies.|name=age2|group=note[/tpl]
Because of the loss of his father, young Richard went to work at the age of seven, selling newspapers to help his family, who had lost both the family store and home.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1433&dat=20070719&id=YbA8AAAAIBAJ&sjid=mBMGAAAAIBAJ&pg=2663,2567274|title=Red Skelton: An Americal Legend|date=July 19, 2007|author=Miller, Russ|publisher=The Goldendale Sentinel|accessdate=April 6, 2007[/tpl] He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet young Skelton. In 1923, a man came up to the young newsboy, purchased every paper he had and asked him if he wanted to see the show in town, giving him a ticket. The man, comedian Ed Wynn, was part of the show and later took young Skelton backstage. It was then that he realized what he wanted to do with his life.[tpl]#tag:ref|Skelton also told another version of this story, with Raymond Hitchcock as the actor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PFobAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-kwEAAAAIBAJ&dq=red-skelton%20raymond-hitchcock&pg=1520%2C5274344|title=I Dare Say!|author=Parry, Florence Fisher|date=September 14, 1946|publisher= The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=June 15, 2011[/tpl]|name=version|group=note[/tpl] Skelton learned at an early age that he could make people laugh. At the age of ten, he auditioned to be part of a medicine show. When he accidentally fell from the stage, breaking bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed; the young boy realized he could earn a living with this ability. Skelton worked in the medicine show for four years.  The pay was ten dollars a week and he sent all of it home weekly to his mother telling her, "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon."[tpl]cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/ra00mac#page/n435/mode/2up|title=The Skelton Saga|author=Swanson, Pauline|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|date=April 1949|pages=56-50, 93-99|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl] Ida Skelton, who held two jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, never said that her youngest son had run away from home, but that "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age".Gehring, p.8
By age 14, he had left school and was already a veteran performer, working in local vaudeville and on a showboat, "The Cotton Blossom", that traveled the Ohio and Missouri rivers. Skelton enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that the days of showboats would soon come to an end.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654|title=Red Skelton, TV and Film's Quintessential Clown, Dies|publisher=LA Times|date=September 18, 1997|accessdate=March 27, 2014[/tpl]  Young Skelton was interested in all forms of acting. He won a dramatic role with a stock theater company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead and he was fired before completing a week's work in the role. At age 15, he was on the burlesque circuit.Humez, Nick. "Burlesque". St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, ed. Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast, Gale Virtual Reference Library, accessed 16 February 2011 [tpl]subscription[/tpl]   The next year he spent some time with the same circus with which his father had also been a clown.

===Young adult-burlesque to vaudeville===

While performing in Kansas City in 1931, Skelton married Edna Stillwell, who was an usher at the old Pantages Theater.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WABRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h-sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5857,4387092&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton, beloved clown, comic, dies at age 84|date=September 18, 1997|publisher=Eugene Register Guard|accessdate=May 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wiZHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1noMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2058,6554331&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Wife Seeks Divorce: Continues to Write His Gags|date=December 30, 1942|publisher=Warsaw Daily Union|accessdate=May 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/666456772.html?dids=666456772:666456772&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+19%2C+1982&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Red+Skelton's+Former+Wife%2C+Edna%2C+Dies&pqatl=google|title=Red Skelton's Former Wife, Edna, Dies|date=November 19, 1982|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 19, 2011|first=Tom|last=Bronzini[/tpl] "Edna Skelton Pound, a comedy writer who wrote some of Red Skelton's best-known comic routines during and after their 12-year marriage, has died."

Skelton, who declared himself to be no prude, said, "I just didn't think the lines were funny". He moved on to dance marathons, popular in the 1930s and referred to as "walkathons" at that time. He became a master of ceremonies who was in demand for these events.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19710513&id=BWpeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T2ENAAAAIBAJ&pg=2140,1818674|title=Red Skelton Remembered as Area Performer Years Ago|date=May 13, 1971|publisher=Observer-Reporter|accessdate=May 2, 2014[/tpl]  At the time of their marriage, Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday, and Edna was 16. The two met the year before when Edna approached Skelton after a show and told him she did not like his material; Skelton asked her if she could do better.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=33RFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ibwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5491,2851007&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=If It Weren't For His Wife Edna, He Would Be a Bum-Says Red Skelton|author=Othman, Frederick C.|date=August 17, 1941|publisher=The Telegraph Herald|accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl] Edna, who was not interested in Skelton when they first met, changed her mind after she won a local marathon where Skelton was the emcee.  She began writing his material for marathons after their marriage.Hyatt, p. 7 At first, Skelton considered his wife to be interfering after she saw the boss when his salary was about to be cut. When she came away with not only a raise for her husband but additional considerations as well, he no longer minded Edna's intervention. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought textbooks and taught Skelton what he had missed. With Edna's help, Skelton received a high school equivalency degree.
The couple's hopes were to somehow find work in New York City and break into vaudeville there.  Skelton and his wife put together an act and began to get bookings for it at some of the smaller theaters. When the couple got a booking in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because it was nearer New York City, the capital of vaudeville, than they were at the time.  To get to Massachusetts, they bought a used car, borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, and set out on the road.  By the time they arrived in St, Louis, the five dollars had become a mere fifty cents.  When Skelton suggested to his wife that they pick up empty cigarette packs for the tinfoil, Edna thought he was joking but did as he asked.  Skelton then spent the couple's fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the smoothed-out tinfoil from the collected cigarette packs.  Red and Edna then marketed their product as fog remover for eyeglasses, selling the foil wrapped soap cubes for fifty cents each. The Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room that evening and for every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port, selling the eyeglass fog remover.
They worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey and were able to get an engagement at the Lido Club in Montreal through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite the language barrier and an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought the couple theater dates throughout Canada. While in Montreal, they ran into a New York vaudeville producer, who promised the pair a booking at Loew's State Theatre there, if Skelton could come up with a new routine for the engagement. Edna had an idea as they were having breakfast in a hotel coffee shop. Skelton and Edna devised the well-known "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won him the promised Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.Adir, p. 197
The Skeltons viewed this engagement as Red's big chance.  They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for Skelton's Loew's engagement, in the belief that they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the ones Red had been performing.  Skelton was on the verge of failing to connect with his New York audience until he began performing his "Doughnut Dunkers" and other older routines.  In 1937, while Skelton was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, DC, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited him to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass,saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President.  I got rolled in a place like this once." Skelton's humor appealed to FDR and he became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.  The problem with doing the "Doughnut Dunkers" skit was that Skelton had to eat nine doughnuts at every performance. He was performing five times a day and eating 45 doughnuts. He gained almost 35 pounds rapidly and had to shelve the routine for a while until he lost the weight.[tpl]cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/radiotelevis00macf#page/8/mode/2up|title=Everything's Funny But Love|author=Franchey, John R.|publisher=Radio-Television Mirror|date=June 1942|pages=8, 9, 46|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl]

===Film work===

Skelton's first contact with Hollywood came in the form of a failed 1932 screen test. In 1937 he made his film debut for RKO Radio Pictures in the supporting role of a camp counselor in Having Wonderful Time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_KoiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sK8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3229,4975260&dq=richard+skelton&hl=en|title=Rialto Theatre|date=July 6, 1938|publisher=The Daily Times|accessdate=May 26, 2011[/tpl] Two short subjects made for Vitaphone were released in 1939: Seeing Red and The Bashful Buckaroo. After screen star Mickey Rooney had seen Skelton perform his "Doughnut Dunkers" act at President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1940 birthday party, Rooney contacted Skelton, urging him to try for work in films; he also spoke favorably about Skelton to his film employer, MGM.Hyatt, p. 9[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2293&dat=19420802&id=fMkmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7gEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=5486,4006337|title=It Happened In Hollywood|author=Heffernan, Harold|date=August 2, 1941|publisher=The Sunday Morning Star|accessdate=April 6, 2014[/tpl]  For his MGM screen test, Skelton performed many of his well-received skits such as "Guzzler's Gin", but added some impromptu pantomimes as the cameras were rolling.  "Imitation of Movie Heroes Dying" were Skelton's impressions of how stars like George Raft, Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney met their end on film.
He was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to lend comic relief to its Dr. Kildare medical dramas, but was soon starring in comedy features as inept radio detective "The Fox" and in Technicolor musicals.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19440108&id=5hMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rGkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4818,3499426|title=Red Skelton Comes to the Stanley In Another "Whistler" |author=Cohen, Harold V.|date=January 8, 1944|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=May 2, 2014[/tpl] When Skelton renegotiated his 1940 long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio and to be able to work on television, which was then largely experimental.  In 1970, Skelton recalled the reaction of the MGM executives to his request for the television portion of the clause.  "They all thought I was nuts.", he said. At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was apparently able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy on the television screen.Hyatt, pp. 5-44[tpl]#tag:ref|Some examples of Pre-WWII television programming from WNBT, New York.

While he and Buster Keaton were at work on a film, Skelton voiced his frustration by saying, "Movies are not my friend. Radio and television are." In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the US with his radio show.Gehring, p. 191 He did not receive the desired television clause and was not able to begin working in the medium until his MGM contract completed in 1951.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Pv9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4617,4641797&dq=edna+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton Says Comedy Needs Action, Not Gab|author=Quigg, Jack|date=September 20, 1949|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl]
Skelton asked MGM once more for rights to pursue television when his contract was over. This time the studio was willing to grant them, making him the only major MGM personality with the privilege.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E_VJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C4UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=919,4095326&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Irrepressible Cutup, Red Skelton Takes TV By Storm|author=Bacon, James|date=March 16, 1952|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl] During the last portion of his contract with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on television in addition to films.

===Radio, divorce and remarriage===

The "Doughnut Dunkers" routine also led to Skelton's first appearance on The Rudy Vallee Show on August 12, 1937. Vallee's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. The show received enough fan mail after Skelton's performance to invite the comedian back two weeks after his initial appearance and again in November of that year. On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced Red Foley as the host of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast under her maiden name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radioechoes.com/avalon-time|title=Avalon Time|publisher=Radio Echoes|accessdate=September 25, 2013[/tpl] She developed a system for working with the show's writers; selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=465IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ngENAAAAIBAJ&pg=1219,5830865&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Writers Tell How His Gags Are Launched|author=Thomas, Bob|date=March 26, 1949|publisher=The Meriden Daily Journal|accessdate=May 28, 2011[/tpl]  Skelton hosted the show until late 1939.Hyatt, pp. 9-11 
His work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, Skelton promoted himself and MGM by appearing gratis at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.  He went on the air with his own program, The Raleigh Cigarettes Program, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=The+Raleigh+Cigarette+Program+Starring+Red+Skelton|title=The Raleigh Cigarette Program Starring Red Skelton|author=Goldin, J.

Skelton introduced the first two of his many characters during the show's first season. Clem Kadiddlehopper was based on a Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was very much like that of the later cartoon character, Bullwinkle. They were sufficiently similar to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose.Hyatt, p. 11 The Mean Widdle Kid, or "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. "Junior" would say things like, "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, "I dood it!" Skelton performed the character at home with Edna giving him the nickname "Junior" long before it was heard by a radio audience.Adir, p. 199 While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea to try using the character on the radio show was Edna's.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TFIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1406,611914&dq=richard+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton's Success Due Wife|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=March 5, 1942|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=May 23, 2011[/tpl] Skelton starred in a 1942 movie of the same name, but did not play "Junior" in the film.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EOJXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UvUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3401,1393945&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton, Powell in Lively Picture|date=June 6, 1942|publisher=Spokane Daily Chronicle|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl] When MGM decided to use the phrase for the movie, they did so without the permission of either Skelton or his Raleigh cigarettes sponsor; Skelton asked for $25,000 from the studio in damages.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ArItAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UNQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2768,4136627&dq=red+skelton+dood&hl=en|title=Red Skelton Seeks $25,000 From M-G-M for 'Dood' Title|author=Graham, Sheilah|date=December 23, 1942|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl]

Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a Douglas A-20 Havoc to be given to the Soviet Army to help fight World War II. Asking children to send in their spare change, Skelton raised enough money for the plane in two weeks. He named the bomber "We Dood It!"

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called "Mellow Cigars" by Skelton, the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; Skelton renamed the routine "Guzzler's Gin", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor's wares.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ufhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jU0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6633,6965434&dq=red+skelton+queen&hl=en|title=Red Skelton Is No Recluse|date=April 17, 1984|publisher=The Mount Airy News|accessdate=May 22, 2011[/tpl] While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience warm-up in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite.  After the regular radio program had ended, the studio audience was treated to a post-program performance.  Skelton would then perform his "Guzzler's Gin" or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show.  He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program.  As a result, studio audience tickets for the Skelton radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people needed to be turned away for lack of seats.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&pg=PA569&lpg=PA569&dq=edna+skelton+pound#v=onepage&q=edna%20skelton%20pound&f=false|title=On the Air:The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|editor-last=Dunning|editor-first=John|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=570|isbn=0195076788|accessdate=January 7, 2013[/tpl]

The Skelton divorce meant that Red had lost his married man's deferment; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944.

By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry Skelton, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Skelton's former wife's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career. Edna Skelton stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMheAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WzIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3537,461014&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red, Muriel Make Ready for Wedding|date=April 8, 1944|publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune|accessdate=May 19, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F2pIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6525,5823272&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton Marriage Cancellation Real Mystery|date=April 11, 1944|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=May 19, 2011[/tpl]

On April 22, 1947, Skelton was censored by NBC two minutes into his radio show.

The script was completed and Skelton had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls.  The skit called for the character Willie Lump-Lump's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking.  When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall.  Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall.

===Off the air and bitterness===

As the 1970s began, the networks began a major campaign to discontinue long-running shows that were seen as stale or lacking youth appeal. Despite Red Skelton's continued strong ratings, CBS saw his show as fitting into this category and canceled the program along with other comedy and variety shows hosted by veterans such as Jackie Gleason and Ed Sullivan.

In 1980, Skelton was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a story that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19800711&id=7YhPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5477,4301975|title=Writers Suing Red Skelton Over Tapes|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|date=July 11, 1980|accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|The People magazine story goes on to say that Skelton was willing to reconsider his call for the destruction of all recordings of his television show, if an arrangement could be made to distribute them to home video only.|name=RedSkeltonShow|group=note[/tpl]  Skelton contended his remarks were made at a time when he was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context.

==Art and other interests==

===Artwork===

Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago department store that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one which Skelton described as "a bunch of blotches", he was told, "Ten thousand wouldn't buy that one." Skelton said he told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife, Georgia, a former art student, persuaded Skelton to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the Las Vegas hotel where he was entertaining at the time.Gehring, p. 282[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=owwdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AZcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7263,4009494&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Paintings Exhibited At Las Vegas|author=Gavin, Mike|date=June 21, 1964|publisher=Park City Daily News|accessdate=May 19, 2011[/tpl] He believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19640301&id=251IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mgoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=572,180807|title=One Classic Clown Befriends Another|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=March 1, 1964|publisher=The News and Courier|accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] Skelton originals are priced at $80,000 and upward; In addition to his originals, Skelton also sold reproductions and prints of them through his own mail order business.  He made his work available to art galleries by selling them franchises to display and sell his paintings. He once estimated the sale of his lithographs earned him $2.5 million per year.[tpl]#tag:ref|Though aware of the value of his artwork, Skelton did not view his works from a strictly monetary standpoint.  He would often do an impromptu sketch on whatever was at hand-often a restaurant's linen napkin-and present it to a fan he was visiting with.|name=napkin|group=note[/tpl] Shortly after Skelton died, his art dealer said he believed that Skelton made more money on his paintings than from his television work. Skelton had produced over 1,000 oil paintings of clowns at the time of his death.  When asked why his artwork focused on clowns, Skelton said at first, "I don't know why it's always clowns." He continued after thinking a moment by saying. "No, that's not true--I do know why.  I just don't feel like thinking about it..."
In Death Valley Junction, California, Skelton found a kindred spirit when he saw the artwork and pantomime performances of Marta Becket. Today, circus performers painted by Marta Becket decorate the Red Skelton Room in the Amargosa Hotel, where Skelton stayed four times in Room 22. The room is dedicated to Skelton, as explained by John Mulvihill in his essay, "Lost Highway Hotel":
 Room 22 is where Red Skelton used to stay. He visited once to catch Marta’s show and, like so many others, fell victim to the Amargosa’s enchantment and returned again and again. He asked Marta to illustrate his room with circus performers and though he died shortly thereafter, she did so anyway. Staying in this room, with acrobats scaling the walls and trapeze artists flying from the ceiling, is a singularly evocative experience, one I wouldn’t trade for a suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.[tpl]cite web | author=Mulvihill, John. | title=Lost Highway Hotel | url=http://www.davidlynch.de/armagosa.html | work=The Universe of David Lynch | date= | accessdate=March 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424001636/http://www.amargosa-opera-house.com/hotel.html|title=Amargosa Hotel: Red Skelton Room[/tpl]

Skelton was a prolific writer of both short stories and music.

Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give.

==Legacy and tributes==

Skelton was quoted as saying, "I just want to be known as a clown, because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh."[tpl]cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/red-skelton/|title=Red Skelton-Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl] He preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comedian and explained, "A comedian goes out and hits people right on.  A clown uses pathos.  He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19740730&id=7AgvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wNoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,3650439|title=Red Skelton Kicked Off His Career With Circus|date=July 30, 1974|publisher=Beaver County Times|accessdate=May 2, 2014[/tpl] Since he believed this was his mission in life, Skelton was able to share his gift of laughter under surprising circumstances. While flying to a 1951 London Palladium engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, who was in the Skelton party, were on a plane from Rome with passengers from an assortment of countries that included 11 children when the plane lost two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19510629&id=gXEzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5u4HAAAAIBAJ&pg=2847,8116819|title=Skelton Performs As Plane Engines Quit Over Alps|date=June 29, 1961|publisher=Lodi  News-Sentinel|accessdate=April 1, 2014[/tpl] When it appeared that the plane would crash over Mont Blanc, the priest readied himself to administer Last Rites. As he did so, he told Skelton, "You take care of your department, Red, and I'll take care of mine." Skelton diverted the attention of the passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed; they were somehow able to land at a small airstrip in Lyon, France.Gehring, p.226[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|title=Command Performance|author=Arnold, Maxine|date=May 1957|publisher=TV-Radio Mirror|pages= 10–12|accessdate=February 12, 2012[/tpl] (PDF) Skelton's nervous collapse while in the army left him with a serious stuttering problem.  While recovering at an army hospital in Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive.  Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh.  As a result of this effort, Skelton's stuttering problem was cured; his army friend's condition also improved and he was no longer on the critical list.[tpl]cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/radiotvmirror00macf#page/n485/mode/2up|title=Laughter For Peter|date=May 1952|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|pages=41, 84|accessdate=March 25, 2014[/tpl]
In late 1965, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business in bygone days, singled out Skelton for high praise. "It's all so very different today," said Bergen. "The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton."

"With one prop, a soft battered hat," Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." He added that Skelton also "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors."Gehring, preface, xvGroucho Marx, pp.136–7.
The Red Skelton Performing Arts Center was dedicated on Friday, February 24, 2006 on the campus of Vincennes University at a cost of $16.8 million.
