Mahlon Williamson was an 1854 bark (or "barque") that sailed out of Wilmington, Delaware and New York. The ship was active in the cargo and guano trades. The ship is remembered today as the subject of a painting by maritime artist Joseph B. Smith, in which it is being towed on the Delaware River by tugboat William Cramp.
