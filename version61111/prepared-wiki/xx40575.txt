His mother offered him US$100 to take a drama class instead, and Tobey agreed.Tobey Maguire: A Thoughtful Spider-Man, published May 2, 2002; retrieved May 1, 2007.
The nomadic nature of his school-age years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and finally, after another relocation for his freshman year, Maguire dropped out of high school and did not return. Instead, he pursued an acting career.Interview: Tobey Maguire, published May 4, 2007; retrieved May 14, 2007.

==Career==

===Early career===

Maguire's first appearance in a feature film was in 1989's The Wizard. He plays one of Lucas Barton's goons (one of three competitors at a video game competition) and had no lines. Maguire initially worked as a child actor in the early 1990s, often playing roles much younger than his chronological age; as late as 2002, Maguire was still playing teenagers while in his mid-20s. He appeared in a variety of commercials and TV and movie roles, working opposite such actors as Chuck Norris (Walker, Texas Ranger), Roseanne Barr (Roseanne), and Tracey Ullman (Tracey Takes On...). Eventually, Maguire was cast as the lead in the FOX TV series Great Scott, which was cancelled five weeks later.
During many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects. For example, both auditioned for the same part in the 1990 TV series based on the 1989 comedy Parenthood. DiCaprio was cast, and Maguire later got a guest role at least partly on DiCaprio's recommendation. The same scenario played itself out during casting for the 1993 movie This Boy's Life (featuring Robert De Niro as the lead); DiCaprio got the main teen role (coincidentally, the character was named "Toby") and Maguire got a part as one of Toby's friends.
By the mid-1990s, Maguire was working steadily but was also becoming involved in the hard-partying lifestyle of some of his fellow young actors. In 1995, Maguire requested director Allan Moyle to release him from his part in the movie Empire Records. Moyle agreed, and all of Maguire's scenes were deleted from the final film.Men of the Week in Entertainment; retrieved May 14, 2007.  Maguire then sought help for a drinking problem from Alcoholics Anonymous; he has been sober ever since.Tobey Maguire Reveals AA Meetings, published April 12, 2007; retrieved May 14, 2007.
As part of his recovery from alcoholism and learning to deal with his self-described "addictive and compulsive nature", Maguire changed his career path slightly in order to obtain roles where he and DiCaprio would not always be in competition for the same part, and the move paid off when he got the role of Paul Hood, a teenage boarding school student whose narration anchors the action in Ang Lee's 1997 film, The Ice Storm. This led to a variety of lead roles in films such as Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules, and Wonder Boys.
In the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he portrayed a hitchhiker who meets Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo during their drive to Las Vegas.[tpl]cite web|last=Blair|first=Andrew|title=Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/19059/looking-back-at-terry-gilliam%E2%80%99s-fear-and-loathing-in-las-vegas|accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl]
In Ride with the Devil (1999), Maguire portrayed Jakob Roedel, opposite Jewel Kilcher. Here he played the son of a unionist German immigrant who joins his southern friends in the Missouri riders, avenging the atrocities committed against Missourians by Kansas Jayhawkers and redleggers.[tpl]cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Ride with the Devil|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ride-with-the-devil-1999|accessdate=18 June 2013|date=December 17, 1999[/tpl]
In 2001, Maguire took a role that featured his youthful-sounding voice, a beagle puppy named Lou, in the family movie Cats & Dogs.[tpl]cite news|title=Cats & Dogs (2001)|url=http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Dogs-Alec-Baldwin/dp/B00005TOTC|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=Amazon[/tpl]

===Spider-Man===

In 2002, Maguire starred in Spider-Man, based on the popular Marvel Comics superhero. The film was a major success and quickly shot Maguire to stardom. He reprised the role in the sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and has also provided the voice of Spider-Man for the video game adaptations of the films. All three movies went on to be part of the highest grossing movies each year.[tpl]cite web|title=Spider-Man 3|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman3.htm|publisher=boxofficemojo|accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Spider-Man 2|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman2.htm|publisher=boxofficemojo|accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Spider-Man|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman.htm|publisher=/boxofficemojo|accessdate=18 June 2013[/tpl]
Maguire's performance as Spider-Man earned him some glowing reviews. For instance, Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune wrote that "with his big, round, soulful eyes, Maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder, and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here."
Due to script and production complications, a proposed third Spider-Man sequel did not materialize. Sony has rebooted the franchise, and has focused on a younger Spider-Man (played by Andrew Garfield) as Peter Parker is still in high school in the movie; Garfield has a more youthful appearance than Maguire.Raimi, Maguire Out of 'Spider-Man 4' The film, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, was released on July 3, 2012.

He received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film. Of the nomination, Maguire said, "I had no expectation about getting a nomination, but I was watching nonetheless. My wife and my son got really excited. I was sort of surprised – I was like, 'Oh, wow.' And I couldn't hear the latter part of my name."

===Future career===

[tpl]As of|November 2007[/tpl], Warner Bros. has plans to fast-track a movie based on the 1980s anime series  Robotech. Maguire is producing the film through his Maguire Entertainment and is eying the lead role in what the studio plans on being a tent-pole sci-fi franchise. "We are very excited to bring 'Robotech' to the big screen", Maguire said. "There is a rich mythology that will be a great foundation for a sophisticated, smart and entertaining film..." The decision was said to have been made due to the enormous success of the Transformers film adaptation, which grossed $690 million during the summer of 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1f2de64a1d24bd55d67832dedc4bd442|title=Maguire, WB attack the big screen with 'Robotech'|accessdate=September 12, 2007|date=September 7, 2007|work=The Hollywood Reporter|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070910185747/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i1f2de64a1d24bd55d67832dedc4bd442|archivedate=September 10, 2007[/tpl]

And I go, 'Okay, well, that's it for the meeting.' And then I ask Kirsten, 'Can I drive you home?' And they look at each other and she goes, 'No, no, I'm going to play a game of Touch 10 with Tobey.'
