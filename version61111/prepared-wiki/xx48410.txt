In continuum mechanics, the infinitesimal strain theory is a mathematical approach to the  description of the deformation of a solid body in which the displacements of the material particles are assumed to be much smaller (indeed, infinitesimally smaller) than any relevant dimension of the body; so that its geometry and the constitutive properties of the material (such as density and stiffness) at each point of space can be assumed to be unchanged by the deformation.
With this assumption, the equations of continuum mechanics are considerably simplified.  This approach may also be called small deformation theory, small displacement theory, or small displacement-gradient theory.  It is contrasted with the finite strain theory where the opposite assumption is made.
The infinitesimal strain theory is commonly adopted in civil and mechanical engineering for the stress analysis of structures built from relatively stiff elastic materials like concrete and steel, since a common goal in the design of such structures is to minimize their deformation under typical loads.

This linearisation implies that the Lagrangian description and the Eulerian description are approximately the same as there is little difference in the material and spatial coordinates of a given material point in the continuum. Therefore, the material displacement gradient components and the spatial displacement gradient components are approximately equal. Thus we have

or using different notation:
Also, from the general expression for the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors we have

==Geometric derivation of the infinitesimal strain tensor==

From the geometry of Figure 1 we have
and, again, for small displacement gradients, we have
thus

===Physical interpretation of the infinitesimal strain tensor===

From finite strain theory we have
For infinitesimal strains then we have
Then we have

===Strain transformation rules===

In matrix form,
The components of the strain in the two coordinate systems are related by
or

===Strain invariants===

Certain operations on the strain tensor give the same result without regard to which orthonormal coordinate system is used to represent the components of strain.  The results of these operations are called strain invariants.  The most commonly used strain invariants are
In terms of components

===Principal strains===

If we are given the components of the strain tensor in an arbitrary orthonormal coordinate system, we can find the principal strains using an eigenvalue decomposition determined by solving the system of equations
===Volumetric strain[tpl]anchor|Volumetric strain[/tpl]=== 
The dilatation (the relative variation of the volume) is the trace of the tensor:
as we consider small deformations,
therefore the formula.

Real variation of volume  (top) and the approximated one (bottom): the green drawing shows the estimated volume and the orange drawing the neglected volume
In case of pure shear, we can see that there is no change of the volume.

===Strain deviator tensor===

The deviatoric strain tensor can be obtained by subtracting the mean strain tensor from the infinitesimal strain tensor:

===Octahedral strains===

The normal strain on an octahedral plane is given by

===Equivalent strain===

A scalar quantity called the equivalent strain, or the von Mises equivalent strain, is often used to describe the state of strain in solids.  Several definitions of equivalent strain can be found in the literature.  A definition that is commonly used in the literature on plasticity is
This quantity is work conjugate to the equivalent stress defined as

===Plane strain===

in which the double underline indicates a second order tensor.   This strain state is called plane strain.   The corresponding stress tensor is:

===Antiplane strain===

Antiplane strain is another special state of strain that can occur in a body, for instance in a region close to a screw dislocation.  The strain tensor for antiplane strain is given by

==Infinitesimal rotation tensor==

The infinitesimal strain tensor is defined as
Therefore the displacement gradient can be expressed as

===The axial vector===

The axial vector is also called the infinitesimal rotation vector.  The rotation vector is related to the displacement gradient by the relation
