In the early 1900's, Flint was known as the birthplace of General Motors, and was the home of the Flint Sit-Down Strike of 1936–37 that played a vital role in the formation of the United Auto Workers, and eventually became an automobile manufacturing powerhouse. However, by the late 1980's the city sank into a deep economic depression after GM closed and demolished several factories in the area. Since the mid-2000's, it has been known for its high crime rates. Since this time, Flint has been continually ranked among the "Most Dangerous Cities in the United States", with a per capita violent crime rate seven times higher than the national average.

==History==

The Saginaw Valley, particularly the vicinity of Flint, is considered by some to be the oldest continually inhabited area of Michigan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] Regardless of the validity of this claim, the region was home to several Ojibwa tribes at the start of the 19th century, with a particularly significant community established near present-day Montrose. The Flint River had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it.

===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===

In 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government, along with his Ojibwe wife founded a trading post in Flint itself. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwas on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the overland route between Detroit and Saginaw, Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.
In the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry.  Buick Motor Company, after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  AC Spark Plug (now part of Delphi) originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the Dort, Little, Flint, and Mason brands.  And Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all Chevrolets and Buicks were built in Flint.

===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===

In 1904, local entrepreneur William C. Durant was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded General Motors, filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.General Motors | Corporate Information – History | GM[tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl] Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended Louis Chevrolet and founded Chevrolet, which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.
For the last century, Flint's history has been dominated by both the auto industry and car culture. During the Sit-Down Strike of 1936–1937, the fledgling United Automobile Workers triumphed over General Motors, inaugurating the era of labor unions. The successful mediation of the strike by Governor Frank Murphy, culminating in a one page agreement recognizing the Union, began an era of successful organizing by the UAW.[tpl]cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=115&category=business |title=Detroit News, Rearview Mirror, The Sitdown strike at General Motors. |accessdate=May 21, 2012[/tpl]  The city was a major contributor of tanks and other war machines during World War II due to its extensive manufacturing facilities.  For decades, Flint remained politically significant as a major population center as well as for its importance to the automotive industry.
A freighter named after the city, the SS City of Flint was the first US ship to be captured during the Second World War in October, 1939. The vessel was later sunk in 1943.[tpl]cite book |title=Å være eller ikke være – Under orlogsflagget i den annen verdenskrig |last=Bjørnsson |first=Nils |year=1994 |publisher=Sjømilitære Samfund ved Forlaget Norsk Tidsskrift for Sjøvesen |location=Haakonsvern |isbn=82-990969-3-6 |page=23 |url= |language=Norwegian [/tpl]
The eighth deadliest tornado on record in the United States struck Beecher, just north of Flint, on June 8, 1953, killing 115 people, injuring 844. Known as the "Beecher Tornado", after the North Side community which the tornado devastated. On the next day the same weather system spawned the worst tornado in New England in Worcester, Massachusetts, killing another 94 people.
The city's population peaked in 1960 at almost 200,000, at which time it was the second largest city in the state. The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the Flint Cultural Center.[tpl]cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |accessdate=May 21, 2012[/tpl]  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day.

===Late 20th century: Deindustrialization and demographic changes===

Since the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from disinvestment, deindustrialization, depopulation and urban decay, as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of "white flight" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the 1973 oil crisis and subsequent collapse of the U.S. auto industry.
In the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including outsourcing, exporting jobs abroad, moving jobs to non-union facilities, unionization, exorbitant overhead, globalization, and more recently, a dramatic decline in General Motors sales.  Locally, these rationales are often strictly applied along lines of political orientation, and labor remains a divisive and polarizing issue.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
This decline was highlighted in the film Roger & Me by Michael Moore (the title refers to Roger B. Smith, the CEO of General Motors during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished AutoWorld) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of Davison (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11.

===21st century===

====First financial emergency: 2002–2004====

The first decade of the 21st century opened on the final stages of large-scale General Motors deindustrialization.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] By 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.[tpl]cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time?

On March 5, 2002, the city's voters recalled mayor Woodrow Stanley.  A few months later, on May 8, the state of Michigan appointed an emergency financial manager,[tpl]cite news|last=Longley|first=Kristin|title=Flint would be only Michigan city to twice undergo emergency state takeover|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/11/flint_would_be_only_michigan_c.html|accessdate=November 14, 2011|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=November 8, 2011[/tpl] Ed Kurtz.  The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, Darnell Earley, in the city administrator position.  The City Council fought the takeover in court.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
In August, city voters elected former Mayor James Rutherford to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency demolitions.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that Emergency Financial Managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.
Emergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September 2003, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in sewer and road projects.  Don Willamson was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003–2004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.
With pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the Mayor's pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004–05 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.  Of the nearly 80,000 people that worked for General Motors in Flint during its peak years in the late 1970s, only about 8,000 were left after the most recent 2006 buyouts.

====Redevelopments====

In the last decade, local efforts to counter deindustrialization have centered around diversifying the economy, either by attracting small parts manufacturers with vacant industrial space and tax incentives, or steering the city toward a more commercially driven economy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Industrially, the vacated Buick City site is currently the United States' largest brownfield. Its accessibility to the Flint River and major rail networks have made it potentially attractive to shipping interests. A local shipping company has considered turning Buick City into a large shipping center.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] This center could provide 600 jobs and spur many small businesses.  In a recent [tpl]When|date=April 2013[/tpl] new GM-UAW deal, an agreement was reached to build a new engine plant on a portion of the Buick City site. This plant is expected to provide 800 new jobs. [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Commercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.  Examples of their efforts include the following:

Similar to a plan in Detroit, Flint is in the process of tearing down thousands of abandoned homes in order to curb crime and reduce city services to a level where the population can sustain it. As of June 2009, approximately 1100 homes have been demolished in Flint, with one official estimating another 3000 more will have to be torn down.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/5516536/US-cities-may-have-to-be-bulldozed-in-order-to-survive.html|title= US cities may have to be bulldozed in order to survive|accessdate=June 18, 2009|author= Tom Leonard|date= June 12, 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph [/tpl]

An Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District was created by Manager Brown in June 2012 for 11 downtown Flint properties. On July 19, the city pension system was transferred to the Municipal Employees Retirement System by the city's retirement board which led to a legal challenge.
On August 3, 2012, the Michigan Supreme Court ordered the state Board of Canvassers to certify a referendum on Public Act 4, the Emergency Manager Law, for the November ballot.  Brown made several actions on August 7 including placing a $6 million public safety milage on the ballot and sold Genesee Towers to a development group for $1 to demolish the structure.  The Board certified the referendum petition on August 8, returning the previous Emergency Financial Manager Law into effect.  With Brown previously temporary mayor for the last few years, Brown was ineligible to be the Emergency Financial Manager. Ed Kurtz was once again appointed Emergency Financial Manager by the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board.
Two lawsuits were filed in September 2012, one by the City Council against Kurtz's appointment, while another was against the state in Ingham County Circuit Court claiming the old emergency financial manager law remains repealed.

==Geography==

Flint lies in the Flint/Tri-Cities region of Michigan. Flint and Genesee County can be categorized as a subregion of Flint/Tri-Cities.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|34.06|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|33.42|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|0.64|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-11-25[/tpl] Flint lies just to the northeast of the Flint hills. The terrain is low and rolling along the south and east sides, and flatter to the northwest.

===Neighborhoods===

Flint has several neighborhoods grouped around the center of the city on the four cardinal "sides". The downtown business district is centered on Saginaw Street south of the Flint River. Just west, on opposite sides of the river, are Carriage Town (north) and the Grand Traverse Street District (south). Both neighborhoods boast strong neighborhood associations. These neighborhoods were the center of manufacturing for and profits from the nation's carriage industry until the 1920s, and to this day are the site of many well-preserved Victorian homes and the setting of Atwood Stadium.
The University Avenue corridor of Carriage Town is home to the largest concentration of "Greek" housing in the area, with fraternity houses from both Kettering University, and the University of Michigan Flint. Chapter houses include Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Delta Chi, Theta Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Theta Xi, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Delta Tau Delta Fraternities.
Just north of downtown is River Village, a successful example of mixed-income public housing. To the east of I-475 is Central Park, a small neighborhood defined by culs-de-sac.
The North Side and 5th Ward are predominantly African American, with such historic districts as Buick City and Civic Park on the north, and Sugar Hill, Floral Park, and Kent and Elm Parks on the south. Many of these neighborhoods were the original centers of early Michigan blues. The South Side in particular was also a center for multi-racial migration from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and the Deep South since World War II. These neighborhoods are most often lower income, but have maintained some level of economic stratification. The East Side is the site of the Applewood Mott Estate, and Mott Community College, the Cultural Center, and East Village, one of Flint's more prosperous areas.
Just north is Eastside Proper, also known as the "State Streets", an area that has recently  diversified and has much of Flint's Hispanic community.  The West Side includes the main site of the 1937 sitdown strike, the Mott Park neighborhood, Kettering University, and the historic Woodcroft Estates, owned in the past by legendary automotive executives and current home to prominent and historic Flint families such as the Motts, the Manleys, and the Smiths.
Facilities associated with General Motors in the past and present are scattered throughout the city, including GM Truck and Bus, Flint Metal Center and Powertrain South (clustered together on the city's southwestern corner); Powertrain North, Flint Tool and Die and Delphi East. The largest plant, Buick City and adjacent facilities, have been demolished.

An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013. Among other possible ventures, there are plans to relocate the local Flint Farmer's Market to the site.

===Climate===

Flint lies within the humid continental climate zone (Köppen Dfb), with four distinct seasons. Summer is very warm and humid, with a July daily mean temperature of [tpl]convert|70.5|°F|1[/tpl], and highs reaching [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl] on about 9 days per year. Though days of [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl] are rare, the record high is [tpl]convert|108|°F|0[/tpl], set on July 8 and 13, 1936. Winters are cold and snowy, with a January average of [tpl]convert|22.4|°F|1[/tpl] and lows falling to [tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] or below on 9.3 nights a season.
The lowest temperature on record is at most [tpl]convert|−25|°F|0[/tpl], set on January 18, 1976. Though snow averages [tpl]convert|48|in|cm|0[/tpl] per season, snow cover is not necessarily reliable and may disappear for short periods of time. Precipitation is greatest toward the end of summer.
