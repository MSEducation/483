Sharon Christa McAuliffe (née Corrigan; September 2, 1948 – January 28, 1986) was an American teacher from Concord, New Hampshire, and was one of the seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
She received her bachelor's degree in education and history from Framingham State College in 1970, and also a Master of Arts in education supervision and administrationHohler, Robert T. (1986). "I Touch the Future..." The Story of Christa McAuliffe. New York, NY: Random House. ISBN 0-394-55721-2. from Bowie State University in 1978. She took a teaching position as a social studies teacher at Concord High School in New Hampshire in 1983.
In 1985, McAuliffe was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to participate in the NASA Teacher in Space Project and was scheduled to become the first teacher in space.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1998/01/28/20spacs1.h17.html|title=Teachers in Space: A Chronology |accessdate=2009-01-09|work = Education Week|date=1998-01-28|pages=Vol. 17, Issue 20, p.12[/tpl] As a member of mission STS-51-L, she was planning to conduct experiments and teach two lessons from Space Shuttle Challenger. On January 28, 1986, the spacecraft disintegrated 73 seconds after launch. After McAuliffe's death, schools and scholarships were named in her honor, and also in 2004 she was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Early life==

McAuliffe was born Sharon Christa Corrigan on September 2, 1948, in Boston, Massachusetts. She was the eldest of the five children of accountant Edward Christopher Corrigan (1922–1990) of Irish descent[tpl]Harvnb|Corrigan|2000|p=21[/tpl] and Grace Mary Corrigan (née George), a substitute teacher,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Biographies/challenger.html|title=The Crew of the Challenger Shuttle Mission in 1986|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=NASA|date=2004-10-22[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/28/obituaries/edward-c-corrigan-astronaut-s-father-67.html |title=Edward C.

McAuliffe was a great niece of Lebanese-American historian Philip Khuri Hitti.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lebanesemonthly.com/magazines/lebanese_monthly_volume-01_issue-02.pdf|title=20 Years Later... Remembering Lebanese American Astronaut Christa McAuliffe|work = Lebanese Monthly Magazine|date=February 2006|accessdate=2009-01-12|page=18, Volume 1, Issue 2|format=PDF[/tpl] She was known by the name "Christa" from an early age, although in later years she signed her name "S. Christa Corrigan", and eventually "S. Christa McAuliffe".[tpl]Harvnb|Burgess|Corrigan|2000|pp=6–7[/tpl]
The year that McAuliffe was born, her father was completing his sophomore year at Boston College. Not long thereafter, he took a job as an assistant comptroller in a Boston department store, and the family moved to Framingham, Massachusetts, where Christa attended and graduated from Marian High School in 1966.[tpl]Harvnb|Corrigan|2000|p=40[/tpl] As a youth, she was inspired by Project Mercury and the Apollo moon landing program. The day after John Glenn orbited the Earth in Friendship 7, she told a friend at Marian High: "Do you realize that someday people will be going to the Moon? Maybe even taking a bus, and I want to do that!"[tpl]Harvnb|Burgess|Corrigan|2000|p=10[/tpl] She wrote years later on her NASA application form: "I watched the Space Age being born, and I would like to participate."[tpl]Harvnb|Burgess|Corrigan|2000|pp=9–10[/tpl]

==Career as an educator==

McAuliffe attended Framingham State College in her hometown, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in education and history.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/christa-mcauliffe.html|title=Christa McAuliffe 1948–1986|accessdate=2009-01-11|publisher=Framingham State College - Henry Whittemore Library[/tpl] A few weeks later, she married her longtime boyfriend whom she had known from high school Steven J. McAuliffe, a 1970 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, and they moved closer to Washington, D.C., so that Steven could attend the Georgetown University Law Center. They had two children: Scott and Caroline, who were nine and six, respectively, when she died.[tpl]Harvnb|Corrigan|2000|p=123[/tpl]
McAuliffe obtained her first teaching position in 1970, as an American history teacher at Benjamin Foulois Junior High School in Morningside, Maryland. From 1971 to 1978, she taught history and civics at Thomas Johnson Middle School in Lanham, Maryland. In addition to teaching, she completed a Master of Arts in education supervision and administration from Bowie State University in Maryland. In 1978, she moved to Concord, New Hampshire, when Steven accepted a job as an assistant to the New Hampshire Attorney General. McAuliffe taught 7th and 8th grade American history and English in Concord, NH and 9th grade English in Bow, NH before taking a teaching post at Concord High School in 1983.Application for NASA Teacher in Space Program: Sharon Christa McAuliffe can be found in the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe Special Collections at Whittemore Library at Framingham State University http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/archives-and-special-collections/christa-mcauliffe.html
She was a social studies teacher, and taught several courses including American history, law, and economics, in addition to a self-designed course: "The American Woman".[tpl]Harvnb|Burgess|Corrigan|2000|pp=15–16[/tpl] Taking field trips and bringing in speakers were an important part of her teaching techniques. According to The New York Times, she "emphasized the impact of ordinary people on history, saying they were as important to the historical record as kings, politicians or generals."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0902.html|title=The Shuttle Explosion, The Seven Who Perished in The Explosion of The Challenger |work=The New York Times |date=1986-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-13[/tpl]

==Teacher in Space Project==

In 1984, President Ronald Reagan announced the Teacher in Space Project, and McAuliffe learned about NASA's efforts to find the first civilian, an educator, to fly into space.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.challenger.org/about/history/index.cfm|title=The Challenger Story:Teacher in Space |publisher=Challenger Center for Space Science Education|accessdate=2009-01-13[/tpl] NASA wanted to find an "ordinary person," a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit.[tpl]Cite news|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401108.html|title=McAuliffe: Teacher on 'Ultimate Field Trip'|work = The Washington Post|date=1986-01-28|page=A10|accessdate=2009-01-13[/tpl] McAuliffe became one of more than 11,000 applicants.

NASA hoped that sending a teacher into space would increase public interest in the Space Shuttle program, and also demonstrate the reliability of space flight at a time when the agency was under continuous pressure to find financial support.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11062587/ |agency=Associated Press |title=On anniversary, some reflect on lessons learned |date=2006-01-28 |work = msnbc.com |accessdate=2009-03-19[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=Vaughan |first=Diane |coauthor=American Council of Learned Societies |title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL| isbn=0-226-85176-1|page=16[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch8.htm |title=Chapter VIII: Pressures on the System |work=Report of the PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident| accessdate=2009-03-19 |date=1986-06-06 |publisher=NASA[/tpl] President Reagan said it would also remind Americans of the important role that teachers and education serve in their country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40300 |title=Remarks at a Ceremony Honoring the 1983–1984 Winners in the Secondary School Recognition Program |accessdate=2009-03-19 |date=1984-08-27 |publisher=The American Presidency Project[/tpl]
The Council of Chief State School Officers, a non-profit organization of public officials in education, was chosen by NASA to coordinate the selection process.[tpl]cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/sts51lpresskithighres.pdf |title=SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION STS-51L Press Kit |accessdate=2009-03-16 |date=January 1986 |publisher=NASA|pages=22–25 |format=PDF[/tpl] Out of the initial applicant pool, 114 semi-finalists were nominated by state, territorial, and agency review panels. McAuliffe was one of two teachers nominated by the state of New Hampshire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060126/REPOSITORY/601260382 |title=An inspired choice for an extraordinary role |accessdate=2009-03-16 |last=Travis |first=Mark |date=2006-01-26 |work = Concord Monitor[/tpl] The semi-finalists gathered in Washington, DC, from June 22–27, 1985, for a conference on space education and to meet with the National Review Panel that would select the 10 finalists.
On July 1, 1985, McAuliffe was announced as one of the 10 finalists, and on July 7 she traveled to Johnson Space Center for a week of thorough medical examinations and briefings about space flight. The finalists were interviewed by an evaluation committee composed of senior NASA officials, and the committee made recommendations to NASA Administrator James M. Beggs for the primary and backup candidates for the Teacher in Space Project. On July 19, 1985, Vice President George H. W. Bush announced that McAuliffe had been selected for the position. Another teacher, Barbara Morgan, served as her backup.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=38909 |title=Remarks of the Vice President Announcing the Winner of the Teacher in Space Project |accessdate=2009-03-16 |date=1985-07-19 |publisher=The American Presidency Project[/tpl] According to Mark Travis of the Concord Monitor, it was McAuliffe's manner that set her apart from the other candidates. NASA official Alan Ladwig said "she had an infectious enthusiasm", and NASA psychiatrist Terrence McGuire told New Woman magazine that "she was the most broad-based, best-balanced person of the 10."
In the autumn of that year, McAuliffe and Morgan each took a year-long leave of absence from teaching in order to train for a space shuttle mission in early 1986.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/morgan.html|title=Barbara Radding Morgan - NASA Astronaut biography|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=NASA|year=2007[/tpl] (NASA paid both their salaries.) While not a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps, McAuliffe was to be part of the STS-51-L crew, and would conduct experiments and teach lessons from space. Her planned duties included basic science experiments in the fields of chromatography, hydroponics, magnetism, and Newton's laws.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.challenger.org/programs/51L_lostlessons1.cfm|title=Challenger's Lost Lessons|accessdate=2009-02-12|publisher=Space Educators' Handbook – OMB/NASA Report #S677/Challenger Center for Space Science Education[/tpl] She was also planning to conduct two 15-minute classes from space, including a tour of the spacecraft, called "The Ultimate Field Trip", and a lesson about the benefits of space travel, called "Where We've Been, Where We're Going, Why."[tpl]Cite news |last=Magnuson|first=Ed|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,143062,00.html|title=They Slipped the Surly Bonds of Earth to Touch|accessdate=2009-01-09 |work=Time |date=2001-06-24[/tpl] The lessons were to be broadcast to millions of schoolchildren via closed-circuit TV.

After being chosen to be the first teacher in space, McAuliffe was a guest on several television programs, including Good Morning America; the CBS Morning News; the Today Show; and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, where, when asked about the mission, she stated, "If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat.

==Disaster and aftermath==

On January 28, 1986, McAuliffe boarded Space Shuttle Challenger with the other six crew members of STS-51-L. Just 73 seconds into its flight at an altitude of 48,000 feet, Challenger broke apart, leading to the deaths of all seven crew members.[tpl]cite web| last=Kerwin |first=Joseph P.| title=Challenger crew cause and time of death| year=1986| url=http://history.nasa.gov/kerwin.html| publisher=NASA| accessdate=2010-03-01[/tpl] According to NASA, it was in part because of the excitement over McAuliffe's presence on Challenger that the accident had such a significant effect on the nation. Many schoolchildren were viewing the launch live, and media coverage of the accident was extensive.[tpl]cite journal | last = Wright| first = John C. | coauthors = Dale Kunkel; Marites Pinon; Aletha C. Huston | title = How Children Reacted to Televised Coverage of the Space Shuttle Disaster | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | page = 27 | date = Spring 1989 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1989.tb01027.x | ref = harv[/tpl]
The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident—also known as the Rogers Commission—was formed to investigate the disaster. It determined that the accident was due to a failure of rubber O-rings made by Morton-Thiokol that provided a pressure seal in the aft field joint of the shuttle's right Solid Rocket Booster.[tpl]cite web | title=Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | url= http://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm | work=Report of the PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident | publisher=NASA | date=1986-06-06 | accessdate=2009-05-15[/tpl] The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors that included the low temperature on the day of launch. The Commission found that O-ring resiliency is directly related to temperature and due to the low temperature at launch—36 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees lower than the next coldest previous launch—it was probable the O-rings had not provided a proper seal.
Barbara Morgan, McAuliffe's backup, became a professional astronaut in January 1998, and flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-118, to the International Space Station, on August 8, 2007, aboard Endeavour, the orbiter that replaced Challenger.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/endeavour-info.html|title=NASA Orbiter Fleet - Space Shuttle Overview: Endeavour (OV-105)|accessdate=2009-03-07|publisher=NASA/Kennedy Space Center[/tpl]
