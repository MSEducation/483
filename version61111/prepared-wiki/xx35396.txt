Child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.[tpl]cite web|title=What is child labour?|publisher=International Labour Organisation|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl] This practice is considered exploitative by many international organisations.

Child labour was employed to varying extents through most of history. Before 1940, numerous children aged 5–14 worked in Europe, the United States and various colonies of European powers. These children worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining and in services such as newsies. Some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.[tpl]cite web|title=Child Labour in Historical Perspective: 1800-1985|publisher=UNICEF|author=Cunningham and Viazzo|isbn=88-85401-27-9|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/hisper_childlabour_low.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Hugh Hindman|publisher=M.E.

In developing countries, with high poverty and poor schooling opportunities, child labour is still prevalent. In 2010, sub-saharan Africa had the highest incidence rates of child labour, with several African nations witnessing over 50 percent of children aged 5–14 working.[tpl]cite web|title=Percentage of children aged 5-14 engaged in child labour|publisher=UNICEF|year=2012|url=http://www.childinfo.org/labour_countrydata.php[/tpl] Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child labour.[tpl]cite news|title=Child Labour|publisher=The Economist|date=20 December 2005|url=http://www.economist.com/node/5328365?zid=317&ah=8a47fc455a44945580198768fad0fa41[/tpl] Vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings and informal urban economy; children are predominantly employed by their parents, rather than factories. Poverty and lack of schools are considered as the primary cause of child labour.
The incidence of child labour in the world decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank.Norberg, Johan (2007), Världens välfärd (Stockholm: Government Offices of Sweden), p. 58 Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains high, with UNICEF and ILO acknowledging an estimated 168 million children aged 5-17 worldwide, were involved in child labour in 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=To eliminate child labour, attack it at its roots, UNICEF says|publisher=UNICEF|year=2013|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70610.htmll[/tpl]

==History==

===Industrial Revolution===

During the Industrial Revolution, children as young as four were employed in production factories with dangerous, and often fatal, working conditions.E. P. Thompson The Making of the English Working Class, (Penguin, 1968), pp. 366–7 Based on this understanding of the use of children as labourers, it is now considered by wealthy countries to be a human rights violation, and is outlawed, while some poorer countries may allow or tolerate child labour. Child labour can also be defined as the full-time employment of children who are under a minimum legal age.

===Victorian era===

The Victorian era became notorious for employing young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps.Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. Charles Dickens for example worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in debtor's prison. The children of the poor were expected to help towards the family budget, often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay,Barbara Daniels, Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era earning 10-20% of an adult male's wage. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children."Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills". Douglas A. Galbi. Centre for History and Economics, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age.
Karl Marx was an outspoken opponent of child labor, saying British industries, "could but live by sucking blood, and children’s blood too," and that U.S. capital was financed by the "capitalized blood of children" [tpl]cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX’S VAMPIRES[/tpl][tpl]cite speech|author=Karl Marx|title=Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association|year=1864[/tpl]
In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.Jane Humphries, Childhood And Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution (2010) p 33
Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods. Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80 hour weeks.

===Early 1900s===

In the early 1900s, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133 °F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung aliments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.[tpl]cite book|last=Hine|first=Russell Freedman ; with photographs by Lewis|title=Kids at work : Lewis Hine and the crusade against child labour|year=1994|publisher=Clarion Books|location=New York|isbn=0395587034|pages=54–57[/tpl]
Children as young as three were put to work. A high number of children also worked as prostitutes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/hist8.html |title=Child Labour by Professor David Cody, Hartwick College |publisher=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2010-03-21[/tpl] Many children (and adults) worked 16-hour days. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the "Short Time Committees" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days.
An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900."  The Industrial Revolution". The Web Institute for Teachers.
In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States."Photographs of Lewis Hine: Documentation of Child Labour". The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.  This included children who rolled cigarettes,Essay from UMBC on children working in the 1910s as cigarette rollers engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin doffers in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries.Child Labour in the South: Essays and Links to photographs from the Lewis Hines Collection at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  Lewis Hine's photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south.  Hines took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as staff photographer for the National Child Labour Committee.

====Household enterprises====

Factories and mines were not the only place where child labour was prevalent in early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well.[tpl]cite book|title=The Global Construction of Gender - Home based work in Political Economy of 20th Century|author=Elisabeth Prügl|pages=25–31, 50–59|isbn=978-0231115612|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999[/tpl]  Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women in particular preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.
Home-based manufacturing operations were active year round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises.[tpl]cite book|title=Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labour|author=Russell Freedman|publisher=Sandpiper|year=1998|isbn=978-0395797266[/tpl] In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 to 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, Frieda Miller - then Director of United States Department of Labour - told the International Labour Organisation that these home-based operations offered, "low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions."[tpl]cite book|title=Miller, Frieda S.

===Colonial empires===

Systematic use of child labour was common place in the colonies of European powers between 1650 to 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries.[tpl]cite book|title=Child Labour in Sub-Saharan Africa|author=Loretta Bass|year=2004|isbn=978-1588262868|pages=30–43|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publications[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Beverly Grier (Ed: Hugh Hindman)|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2009|pages=173–177|isbn=978-0-7656-1707-1[/tpl] Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of 5-14 were hired as apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master.[tpl]cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=38–46|publisher= University of North Carolina Press[/tpl] Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins.
Beyond laws, new taxes were imposed on colonies. One of these taxes was the Head Tax in British and French colonial empires. The tax was imposed on everyone older than 8 years, in some colonies. To pay these taxes and cover living expenses, children in colonial households had to work.[tpl]cite journal|title=Child labour in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|author=Jack Lord|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|year=2011|pages=88–115|url=|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Invisible Hands: Child Labour and the State in Colonial Zimbabwe by Beverly Grier (a review)|author=Karen Wells|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=1|number=3|date=Fall 2008|pages=481–483 |doi= 10.1353/hcy.0.0025[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Head Tax, Social Structure and Rural Incomes in Cameroun, 1922-1937|author=Jane Guyer|journal=Cahiers d'Etudes africaines|volume=20|issue=79|year=1980|pages=305–329|doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2338[/tpl]
In southeast Asian colonies, such as Hong Kong, child labour such as the Mui Tsai (妹仔), was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities.[tpl]cite book|title=Child slavery in Hong Kong: the mui tsai system|year=1930|author=Hugh Lyttleton Haslewood|publisher=Sheldon Press[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Theorizing the Chinese: The MUI TSAI controversy and construction of transnational chineseness in Hong Kong and British Malaya|author=Karen Yuen|journal=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies|volume= 6|number= 2| date= December 2004|pages= 95–110|url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-Dec04/6_2_6.pdf[/tpl] The Dutch East India Company officials rationalised their child labour abuses with, "it is a way to save these children from a worse fate." Christian mission schools in regions stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not secular education. Elsewhere, the Canadian Dominion Statutes in form of so-called Breaches of Contract Act, stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers.[tpl]cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=203–207|publisher= University of North Carolina Press[/tpl]
Proposals to regulate child labour began as early as 1786.Steve Charnovitz, "Child Labour: What to do?," Journal of Commerce, 15 August 1996.

===Soviet Union and Russia===

Although formally banned since 1922, child labour was widespread in the Soviet Union, mostly in the form of mandatory, unpaid work by schoolchildren on Saturdays and holidays. The students were used as a cheap, unqualified workforce on kolhoz (collective farms) as well as in industry and forestry. The practice was formally called "work education".Svetlana Stephenson, "Child Labour in the Russian Federation", 2002, University of North London
From the 1950s on, the students were also used for unpaid work at schools, where they cleaned and performed repairs.Евгений Жирнов, Среднее и высшее самообслуживание, 2007, Kommersant This practice has continued in the Russian Federation, where up to 21 days of the summer holidays is sometimes set aside for school works. By law, this is only allowed as part of specialised occupational training and with the students' and parents' permission, but those provisions are widely ignored.Школьников заставляют работать в школьном участке в каникулах. 21 дней.

Out of former Soviet Union republics Uzbekistan continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of Islam Karimov's income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60 kg of raw cotton they have to collect. This process is repeated in spring, when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded. In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million of children were forced to work this way.[tpl]cite book|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty |author=Daron Acemoglu, James Robinson |pages=loc. 6515–6529 (MOBI)[/tpl]

===21st century===

Child labour is still common in many parts of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 to 304 million, if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations.[tpl]cite news |title=Child labour in Kyrgyz coal mines |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6955202.stm |accessdate=2007-08-25 | date=24 August 2007 |first=Natalia |last=Antelava[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Global child labour developments: Measuring trends from 2004 to 2008|author=Yacouba Diallo, Frank Hagemann, Alex Etienne, Yonca Gurbuzer and Farhad Mehran|publisher=ILO|year=2010|isbn=978-92-2-123522-4[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=The State of the World's Children 1997  |work=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ |accessdate=2007-04-15[/tpl] Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).
Contrary to popular beliefs, most child labourers are employed by their parents rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or in-kind compensation are usually found in rural settings, than urban centers. Less than 3 percent of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.
Child labour accounts for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, 1% in US, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations.Facts and figures on child labour The proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries. Africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5–17 employed as child labour, and a total of over 65 million. Asia, with its larger population, has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million. Latin America and Caribbean region has lower overall population density, but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too.[tpl]cite book|title=Tackling child labour: From commitment to action|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour - ILO|year=2012|isbn=978-92-2-126374-6|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_181875/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl]
Accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour. In some countries, government policy contributes to this difficulty. For example, the overall extent of child labour in China is unclear due to the government categorizing child labour data as “highly secret”.[tpl]cite web|title=Children's Rights: China|publisher=Law Library of Congress, United States|year=2012|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/china.php#Child%20Labour%20and%20Exploitation[/tpl] China has enacted regulations to prevent child labour; still, the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within China, generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises.[tpl]cite web|title=The dark side of labour in China|author=Karine Lepillez|year=2009|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/slavery/china.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=China: End Child Labour in State Schools|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=4 December 2007|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/02/china-end-child-labour-state-schools[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Causes of child labour==

===Primary causes===

International Labour Organisation (ILO) suggests poverty is the greatest single cause behind child labour.[tpl]cite web|title=Child labour - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm[/tpl] For impoverished households, income from a child's work is usually crucial for his or her own survival or for that of the household. Income from working children, even if small, may be between 25 to 40% of these household income. Other scholars such as Harsch on African child labour, and Edmonds and Pavcnik on global child labour have reached the same conclusion.[tpl]cite journal|title=Child Labour in the Global Economy|author=Eric V. Edmonds and Nina Pavcnik|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19|number=1|date=Winter 2005|pages=199–220|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hiscox/EdmondsPavcnik.pdf|doi=10.1257/0895330053147895[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Ernest Harsch|journal=Africa Recovery|volume=15|number=3|date=October 2001|pages=14–15|url=http://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/vol15no3/153chil4.htm[/tpl]Basu, Kaushik and Van, Phan Hoang, 1998. 'The Economics of Child Labour', American Economic Review, 88(3),412–427
Lack of meaningful alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because they have nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60-70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.[tpl]cite web|title=The Relationship between Education and Child Work|author=Jo Boyden|publisher=UNICEF|year=1994|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/crs9.pdf[/tpl]

===Cultural causes===

In European history when child labour was common, as well as in contemporary child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.[tpl]cite web|title=CHILD LABOUR: ISSUES, CAUSES AND INTERVENTIONS|author=Faraaz Siddiqi and Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=The World Bank|year=1999|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Child_Labour_issues.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Exploring the causes of child labour|author=Obinna E.

===Macroeconomic causes===

Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest[tpl]cite book|title=Asian Informal Workers: Global Risks, Local Protection|author= Mario Biggeri and Santosh Mehrotra|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-38275-5[/tpl] that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.[tpl]cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author=Christiaan Grootaert and Harry Anthony Patrinos|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0312221225[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills|author=Douglas Galbi|journal=Journal of Population Economics|year=1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages= 357–375|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.pdf|doi=10.1007/s001480050048[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Brown, D.

==Child labour laws and initiatives==

Almost every country in the world has laws relating to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organisation has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified.
According to ILO minimum age convention (C138) of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.
The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, which was subsequently ratified by 193 countries.United Nations Treaty Collection.  Convention on the Rights of the Child. Retrieved 21 May 2009. Article 32 of the convention addressed child labour, as follows: ...Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.[tpl]cite web |title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm  |archivedate = 3 October 2006[/tpl] 
Under Article 1 of the 1990 Convention, a child is defined as "... every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier." Article 28 of this Convention requires States to, "make primary education compulsory and available free to all."
Three countries that have not ratified the 1990 Convention are Somalia, South Sudan and the United States.Child Rights Information Network (2008).  Convention on the Rights of the Child.

In 1999, ILO helped lead the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182),[tpl]cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|publisher=International Labour Organisation, United Nations|year=1999|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327[/tpl] which has so far been signed upon and domestically ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.
In addition to setting the international law, the United Nations initiated International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in 1992.[tpl]cite web|title=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)|publisher=International Labour Organisation, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl] This initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour. Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time bounded program countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. The initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things, universal primary school availability. The IPEC has expanded to at least the following target countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, Nepal, Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Turkey.
Targeted child labour campaigns were initiated by the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in order to advocate for prevention and elimination of all forms of child labour. The global Music against Child Labour Initiative was launched in 2013 in order to involve socially excluded children in structured musical activity and education in efforts to help protect them from child labour.[tpl]cite web|title=Music Against Child Labour Initiative|publisher= IPEC, International Labour Organisation, United Nations|year=2013|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/MusicInitiative/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl]

===Exceptions granted===

In 2004, the United States passed an amendment to the Fair Labour Standards Act of 1938. The amendment allows certain children aged 14–18 to work in or outside a business where machinery is used to process wood.[tpl]cite web|title=Exemptions from Child Labour Rules in Non-Agriculture (see FLSA Section 13(c)(7))|publisher=Department of Labour, United States|year=2012|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/cl/exemptions.asp[/tpl] The law aims to respect the religious and cultural needs of the Amish community of the United States. The Amish believe that one effective way to educate children is on the job. The new law allows Amish children the ability to work with their families, once they are past eighth grade in school.
Similarly, in 1996, member countries of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC, agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by competent authority. Children above the age of 13 may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances.[tpl]cite web|title=Protections of young people at work|publisher=Europa|year=2004|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/health_hygiene_safety_at_work/c11205_en.htm[/tpl] Nonetheless, many children under the age of 13 do work, even in the most developed countries of the EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job.[tpl]nl[/tpl]Eenderde van de 12-jarigen heeft bijbaan (RTL News, 14 February 2012)

===More laws vs. more freedom===

[tpl]Rquote|right|These (child labour) state laws were not enforced. Often the children themselves and their parents, who wanted the money or could see no way to survive without it - resisted.

Scholars disagree on the best legal course forward to address child labour. Some suggest the need for laws that place a blanket ban on any work by children less than 18 years old. Others suggest the current international laws are enough, and the need for more engaging approach to achieve the ultimate goals.[tpl]cite news|title=Sickness or symptom? - Child Labour|publisher=The Economist|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2405051[/tpl]
Some scholars suggest any labour by children aged 18 year or less is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.[tpl]cite journal|title=Is Child Labour Inefficient?|author=Jean‐Marie Baland and James A.

Other scholars suggest that these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will do more harm than good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.[tpl]cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author=Christiaan Grootaert and Harry Anthony Patrinos|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|pages=8–54|isbn=978-0312221225[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Economics of Consumer Actions against Products with Child Labour Content|author=Eric Edmonds|date=May 2007|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eedmonds/clwa.pdf[/tpl]
These scholars suggest, from their studies of economic and social data, that early 20th century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part as a result of economic development of formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth. These scholars suggest economic engagement, emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws, and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world. International legal actions, such as trade sanctions increase child labour.[tpl]cite journal|title=Does Child Labour Decline with Improving Economic Status?|author=Eric Edmonds|journal=Journal of Human Resources|year=2005| volume=40|number= 1|date=Winter 2005|pages=77–99|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10134.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The economics of child labour: A framework for measurement|author=Richard ANKER|journal=International Labour Review|volume=139|issue=3|pages=257–280|date=September 2000|doi=10.1111/j.1564-913X.2000.tb00204.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Will trade sanctions reduce child labour?: The role of credit markets|author=Saqib Jafareya and Sajal Lahiri|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=68|issue=1|date=June 2002|pages=137–156|doi=10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00009-3[/tpl]
"The Incredible Bread Machine" a book published by "World Research, Inc." in 1974:
"Child labor was a particular target of early reformers. William Cooke Tatlor wrote at the time about these reformers who, witnissing children ar work in the factories, thought to themselves: 'How much more delightful would have been the gambol of the free limbs on the hillside; the sight of the green mead with its spangles of buttercups and daisies; the song of the bird and the humming bee...'
But for many of these children the factory system meant quite literally the only chance for survival. Today we overlook the fact that death from starvation and exposure was a common fate before the Industrial Revolution, for the pre capitalist economy was barely able to support the population. Yes, children were working. Formerly they would have starved. It was only as goods were produced in greater abundance at lower cost that men could support their families without sending their children to work. It was not the reformer or the politician that ended the grim necessity for child labor; it was capitalism."

It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as Mali - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as orpaillage, children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including mercury, and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.[tpl]cite web|title=Child labour in gold mining|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/MoreaboutCLinmining/lang--en/index.htm[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Artisanal Gold Mining: Unglamorous Practices at High Prices|author=Sandra Garcia|publisher=Mining Magazine|date=April 2010|url=http://magazine.mining.com/issues/1003/Vol03-02-ArtisanalGoldMining-36-38.pdf[/tpl]

However, the report concluded that the system was being abused by unscrupulous subcontractors.
GAP's policy, the report claimed, is that if it discovers child labour was used by its supplier in its branded clothes, the contractor must remove the child from the workplace, provide it with access to schooling and a wage, and guarantee the opportunity of work on reaching a legal working age.
In 2007, The New York Times reported that GAP, after the child labour discovery, created a $200,000 grant to improve working conditions in the supplier community.Gap moves to recover from child labour scandal

===H&M and Zara===

In December 2009, campaigners in the UK called on two leading high street retailers to stop selling clothes made with cotton which may have been picked by children. Anti-Slavery International and the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) accused H&M and Zara of using cotton suppliers in Bangladesh. It is also suspected that many of their raw materials originates from Uzbekistan, where children aged 10 are forced to work in the fields. The activists were calling to ban the use of Uzbek cotton and implement a "track and trace" systems to guarantee an ethical responsible source of the material.
H&M said it "does not accept" child labour and "seeks to avoid" using Uzbek cotton, but admitted it did "not have any reliable methods" to ensure Uzbek cotton did not end up in any of its products. Inditex, the owner of Zara, said its code of conduct banned child labour."Stores urged to stop using child labour cotton"

In 2008, the BBC reportedBBC News on Primark using child labour in the manufacture of clothing.

The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, "Why am I only paying £4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little cost?", in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent.

==Eliminating child labour==

Concerns have often been raised over the buying public's moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in developing countries with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that boycotting products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a UNICEF study found that after the Child Labour Deterrence Act was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Bangladesh, leaving many to resort to jobs such as "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution", jobs that are "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production". The study suggests that boycotts are "blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved."[tpl]cite web | title=The State of the World's Children 1997 | work=UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ | accessdate=2007-04-15 [/tpl]
According to Milton Friedman, before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture."Some authors such as conservative Nobel economist Milton Friedman claim that child labor actually decreased during the industrial revolution. He argues that before the industrial revolution almost all children were working in agriculture(...)" [tpl]cite book|author=Robert A.

Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.Hugh Cunningham, "The Employment and Unemployment of Children in England c.1680–1851." Past and Present. Feb. 1990. [tpl]doi|10.1093/past/126.1.115[/tpl] Austrian school economist Murray Rothbard said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went "voluntarily and gladly" to work in factories.Murray Rothbard, Down With Primitivism: A Thorough Critique of Polanyi Ludwig Von Mises Institute, reprint of June 1961 article.
British historian and socialist E. P. Thompson in The Making of the English Working Class draws a qualitative distinction between child domestic work and participation in the wider (waged) labour market.  Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500, notes that:
According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the University of Houston, in an article published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank operating in Washington D.C., "it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.DeGregori, Thomas R., "Child Labour or Child Prostitution?" Cato Institute.
The International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world.IPEC IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.
From 2008 to 2013, the ILO operated a program through International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) titled " Combating Abusive Child Labour (CACL-II) ". The project, funded by the European Union, contributed to the Government of Pakistan by providing alternative opportunities for vocational training and education to children withdrawn from the worst forms of child labour.http://www.ilo.org/islamabad/whatwedo/projects/WCMS_143210/lang--en/index.htm

===Action against Child Labour in India===

India has legislation since 1986 which allows work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall be total ban on the employment of children up to the age of 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with his or her family in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/final-order-of-high-court-in-child-labou-70204/ |title=CWP 2693 of 2010- Hemant Goswami vs. Union of India|work=JD Supra |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl]
