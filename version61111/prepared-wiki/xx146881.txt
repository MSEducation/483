In December 2007, the band with record producer Mark Trombino recorded new songs and remixed previous tracks. They released their first full-length album, Embrace the Curse, on June 24, 2008 under Glassnote Records.  
In early 2010, the band recorded an album entitled Race to Red, with producer Lee Miles. The band released the first single off the album, "Free Without You", on January 12, 2010. They have released music videos for "Free Without You" and "Unspoken".
In June 2010, a woman named Kate, after whom the band was named, left frontman Justin Mauriello an angry voicemail about the use of her name for the band and threatening legal action.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] The band felt it was in their best interest to change their name to Darling Thieves, under which name the new album was released on June 17, 2010.   
As the Darling Thieves they have been headlining their own shows and sharing the stage with The Smashing Pumpkins, Chevelle, OK Go, Anberlin, Flobots, and Hollywood Undead.
The Darling Thieves have since 2012 been on a hiatus, while members of the band are taking care of new children. Since then, Justin Mauriello has been working on a Solo EP in Nashville, Tennessee.
