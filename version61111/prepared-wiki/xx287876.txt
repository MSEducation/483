==History==

Between 1802 and 1806 Sir John D'Oyly was the Government Agent and Fiscal Collector in District Matara and Hambantota.
Gajaman Nona was left almost destitute by the death of her husband, and she could not get a proper job. Since Gajaman Nona had several children to take care of,she asked John D'Oyly, the Government Agent, for some kind of assistance. Kind-hearted   Sir John D'Oyly granted Nindagama so that she could provide for her family. Presently, this statue of her stands at Ambalantota, Nonagama Junction (name derived from Gajaman  Nona).
