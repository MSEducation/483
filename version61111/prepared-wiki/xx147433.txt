==Music style and influences==

Entity Paradigm is one of the first bands in Pakistan to have two vocalists and two drummers and up to eight members in a band. Entity Paradigm is a fusion of different elements in music like alternative rock and progressive rock, all of which merge in unique consonance to create a raw, new sound, never heard before in Pakistan. The band works on the belief that their music, their lyrics, should tell a story, tender a philosophy and above all else – inspire and instigate change. Inducing metamorphosis in thought and perception is what the band aims for through its music. The band's tracks are characterized by dark, melancholy, ambient preludes and interludes, pulsating drum beats, electronica, like scratches and other sound-effects, reverberating vocals and raw, scathing guitar riffs backed up by delicate string work on the rhythms. All of which makes for a very magnified soundscape – a creative effort that thrives on the diversity, dissonance and varying backgrounds that each of the members of the band bring to it. Their music consisted of themes of self-reflection and existentialism.
