Clayton Wood is an area of woodland towards the north west of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England at [tpl]gbmapping|SE254384[/tpl]. It is bordered by Lawnswood, Horsforth, Ireland Wood and Tinshill. Towards the west of the wood runs a beck (which flows from north to south). Along the north of the wood is Silk Mill Road and to the east is Ireland Wood. Towards the south of the Wood is the Leeds Ring Road.
Inside the wood, there is an abandoned quarry, which is soon to be home to a housing estate with a railway station to be known as Woodside, which will be on the Leeds to Harrogate Line. The railway line runs up the middle of the wood, going west of the quarry and out into Horsforth station.
When standing at Horsforth station one is able to see the tail end of the wood.
