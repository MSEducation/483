The building has a gift shop on its ground floor. The museum is on the third floor. Also located in the building is the hall where four daily shows of the Awa Odori are performed. The last of the shows, which begins in the late evening, is slightly more expensive than the others. One unique feature of the performances is the participation of audience members.[tpl]cite web[/tpl]
