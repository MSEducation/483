Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as vegetables, fruit or animals). It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chelikani P, Fita I, Loewen PC | title = Diversity of structures and properties among catalases | journal = Cell.

Likewise, catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert millions of molecules of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen each second.[tpl]cite web | title = Catalase | author = Goodsell DS | work = Molecule of the Month | publisher = RCSB Protein Data Bank | url = http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/pdb57_1.html | date = 2004-09-01 | accessdate = 2007-02-11[/tpl]

==History==

Catalase was first noticed in 1811 when Louis Jacques Thénard, who discovered H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), suggested its breakdown is caused by an unknown substance. In 1900, Oscar Loew was the first to give it the name catalase, and found it in many plants and animals.[tpl]cite journal | author = Loew O | title = A New Enzyme of General Occurrence in Organisms | journal = Science | volume = 11 | issue = 279 | pages = 701–702 |date=May 1900 | pmid = 17751716 | doi = 10.1126/science.11.279.701 | url = [/tpl] In 1937 catalase from beef liver was crystallised by James B. Sumner and Alexander Dounce[tpl]cite journal | author = Sumner JB, Dounce AL | title = Crystalline catalase | journal = Science | volume = 85 | issue = 2206 | pages = 366–367 |date=April 1937 | pmid = 17776781 | doi = 10.1126/science.85.2206.366 | url = [/tpl] and the molecular weight was found in 1938.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sumner JB, Gralén N | title = The molecular weight of crystalline catalase | journal = Science | volume = 87 | issue = 2256 | pages = 284–284 |date=March 1938 | pmid = 17831682 | doi = 10.1126/science.87.2256.284 | url = [/tpl]
In 1969, the amino acid sequence of bovine catalase was discovered.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schroeder WA, Shelton JR, Shelton JB, Robberson B, Apell G | title = The amino acid sequence of bovine liver catalase: a preliminary report | journal = Arch.

==Action==

The reaction of catalase in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in living tissue:
The presence of catalase in a microbial or tissue sample can be tested by adding a volume of hydrogen peroxide and observing the reaction. The formation of bubbles, oxygen, indicates a positive result. This easy assay, which can be seen with the naked eye, without the aid of instruments, is possible because catalase has a very high specific activity, which produces a detectable response.

==Molecular mechanism==

While the complete mechanism of catalase is not currently known, the reaction is believed to occur in two stages:
As hydrogen peroxide enters the active site, it interacts with the amino acids Asn147 (asparagine at position 147) and His74, causing a proton (hydrogen ion) to transfer between the oxygen atoms. The free oxygen atom coordinates, freeing the newly formed water molecule and Fe(IV)=O. Fe(IV)=O reacts with a second hydrogen peroxide molecule to reform Fe(III)-E and produce water and oxygen. The reactivity of the iron center may be improved by the presence of the phenolate ligand of Tyr357 in the fifth iron ligand, which can assist in the oxidation of the Fe(III) to Fe(IV). The efficiency of the reaction may also be improved by the interactions of His74 and Asn147 with reaction intermediates. In general, the rate of the reaction can be determined by the Michaelis-Menten equation.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug98/900981784.Bc.r.html | title = How does the concentration of hydrogen peroxide affect the reaction | author = Maass E | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 1998-07-19 | work = | publisher = MadSci Network | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 009-03-02 [/tpl]
Catalase can also catalyze the oxidation, by hydrogen peroxide, of various metabolites and toxins, including formaldehyde, formic acid, phenols, acetaldehyde and alcohols. It does so according to the following reaction:
The exact mechanism of this reaction is not known.
Any heavy metal ion (such as copper cations in copper(II) sulfate) can act as a noncompetitive inhibitor of catalase. Also, the poison cyanide is a competitive inhibitor of catalase, strongly binding to the heme of catalase and stopping the enzyme's action.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source should be provided|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Three-dimensional protein structures of the peroxidated catalase intermediates are available at the Protein Data Bank. This enzyme is commonly used in laboratories as a tool for learning the effect of enzymes upon reaction rates.

==Cellular role==

Hydrogen peroxide is a harmful byproduct of many normal metabolic processes; to prevent damage to cells and tissues, it must be quickly converted into other, less dangerous substances. To this end, catalase is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive gaseous oxygen and water molecules.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gaetani G, Ferraris A, Rolfo M, Mangerini R, Arena S, Kirkman H | title = Predominant role of catalase in the disposal of hydrogen peroxide within human erythrocytes | journal = Blood | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 1595–9 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8608252[/tpl]
The true biological significance of catalase is not always straightforward to assess: Mice genetically engineered to lack catalase are phenotypically normal, indicating this enzyme is dispensable in animals under some conditions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ho YS, Xiong Y, Ma W, Spector A, Ho D | title = Mice Lacking Catalase Develop Normally but Show Differential Sensitivity to Oxidant Tissue Injury | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 279 | issue = 31 | pages = 32804–32812 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15178682 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M404800200[/tpl] A catalase deficiency may increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.[tpl]cite journal | author = László Góth, Ágota Lenkey, William N.

The predominant scavengers of H2O2 in normal mammalian cells are likely peroxiredoxins rather than catalase.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2009[/tpl]
Human catalase works at an optimum temperature of 45°C,. In contrast, catalase isolated from the hyperthermophile archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis has a temperature optimum of 90°C.[tpl]cite journal | author = Amo T, Atomi H, Imanaka T | title = Unique presence of a manganese catalase in a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 | journal = J.

Catalase is usually located in a cellular, bipolar environment organelle called the peroxisome.[tpl]cite book | author = Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = 4th | language = | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = | chapter = Peroxisomes | chapterurl = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=catalase&rid=mboc4.section.2194 | quote = | isbn = 0-8153-3218-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in photorespiration (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms). Hydrogen peroxide is used as a potent antimicrobial agent when cells are infected with a pathogen. Catalase-positive pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni, make catalase to deactivate the peroxide radicals, thus allowing them to survive unharmed within the host.[tpl]cite journal | author = Srinivasa Rao PS, Yamada Y, Leung KY | title = A major catalase (KatB) that is required for resistance to H2O2 and phagocyte-mediated killing in Edwardsiella tarda | journal = Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) | volume = 149 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 2635–2644 |date=September 2003 | pmid = 12949187 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.26478-0 | url = [/tpl]
Catalase contributes to ethanol metabolism in the body after ingestion of alcohol, but it only breaks down a small fraction of the alcohol in the body.http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA72/AA72.htm

==Distribution among organisms==

All known animals use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver .[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of chemicals ordinarily stored separately in its paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, whereas the smaller of the pair, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes the contents of the two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant.[tpl]cite journal | author = Eisner T, Aneshansley DJ | title = Spray aiming in the bombardier beetle: photographic evidence | journal = Proc.

A minor use is in contact lens hygiene - a few lens-cleaning products disinfect the lens using a hydrogen peroxide solution; a solution containing catalase is then used to decompose the hydrogen peroxide before the lens is used again.[tpl]US patent reference | number = 5521091 | y = 1996 | m = 05 | d = 28 | inventor = Cook JN, Worsley JL | title = Compositions and method for destroying hydrogen peroxide on contact lens [/tpl] Recently, catalase has also begun to be used in the aesthetics industry. Several mask treatments combine the enzyme with hydrogen peroxide on the face with the intent of increasing cellular oxygenation in the upper layers of the epidermis.

===Catalase test===

The catalase test is also one of the main three tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria. The presence of catalase enzyme in the test isolate is detected using hydrogen peroxide. If the bacteria possess catalase (i.e., are catalase-positive), when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide, bubbles of oxygen are observed.
The catalase test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a microscope slide. Using an applicator stick, a scientist touches the colony, and then smears a sample into the hydrogen peroxide drop.
While the catalase test alone cannot identify a particular organism, combined with other tests, such as antibiotic resistance, it can aid identification. The presence of catalase in bacterial cells depends on both the growth condition and the medium used to grow the cells.
Capillary tubes may also be used. A small amount of bacteria is collected on the end of the capillary tube (it is essential to ensure that the end is not blocked, otherwise it may present a false negative). The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide which will draw up the liquid (through capillary action), and turned upside down, so the bacterial end is closest to the bench. A few taps of the arm should then move the hydrogen peroxide closer to the bacteria. When the hydrogen peroxide and bacteria are touching, bubbles may begin to rise, giving a positive catalase result.

===Gray hair===

According to recent scientific studies, low levels of catalase may play a role in the graying process of human hair. Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and catalase breaks it down. If catalase levels decline, hydrogen peroxide cannot be broken down as well. This allows the hydrogen peroxide to bleach the hair from the inside out. This finding may someday be incorporated into cosmetic treatments for graying hair.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090223131123.htm | title = Why Hair Turns Gray Is No Longer A Gray Area: Our Hair Bleaches Itself As We Grow Older | author = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-02-24 | work = Science News | publisher = ScienceDaily | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-03-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/news/20090225/why-hair-goes-gray | title = Why Hair Goes Gray | author = Hitti M | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = 2009-02-25 | format = | work = Health News | publisher = WebMD | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-03-01[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Wood JM, Decker H, Hartmann H, Chavan B, Rokos H, Spencer JD, Hasse S, Thornton MJ, Shalbaf M, Paus R, Schallreuter KU | title = Senile hair graying: H2O2-mediated oxidative stress affects human hair color by blunting methionine sulfoxide repair | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 23| issue = 7| pages = 2065–2075|date=February 2009 | pmid = 19237503 | doi = 10.1096/fj.08-125435 | url = [/tpl]
