King's Dock was a dock on the River Mersey, England and part of the Port of Liverpool. It was situated in the southern dock system, connected to Wapping Dock to the north and Queens Dock to the south. It consisted of two branch docks. The dock was designed by Henry Berry and opened in 1785. Further warehouse buildings were added by John Foster, Sr..
The branch docks have been filled in, and the open space was often used as a concert venue, when a large tent and stage was erected. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra played their Summer Pops concert series here. Everton FC had proposed to build a new stadium here, but those plans fell through in 2003.[tpl]citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/2940481.stm|title=Everton fail in King's Dock bid|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 April 2003|accessdate=22 March 2008[/tpl]
