==History==

===Foundation===

Fantagraphics was founded in 1976 by Gary Groth and Mike Catron in College Park, Maryland. The first act of the new company was the takeover of an adzine named The Nostalgia Journal, which was quickly renamed The Comics Journal.". . . transforming it from an adzine into a magazine of news and criticism that just happened to carry advertisements." The Comics Journal Message Board :: View topic - The Comics Journal #32 (January 1977).
As comics journalist (and former Fantagraphics employee) Michael Dean writes, "the publisher has alternated between flourishing and nearly perishing over the years." Kim Thompson joined the company in 1977, using his inheritance to keep the company afloat.Dean, Michael.

Beginning in 1981, and lasting until 1992, Fantagraphics published Amazing Heroes, a magazine which examined comics from a hobbyist's point of view.

===Comics publisher===

Beginning in 1982, Fantagraphics began publishing comics, starting with Los Bros Hernandez'  Love and Rockets, and moving on to such critically acclaimed and award-winning series as Acme Novelty Library, Eightball, and Hate.
Catron acted as Fantagraphics' co-publisher until 1985 (also handling advertising and circulation for The Comics Journal from 1982–1985), when he left the company.Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999. 

===The Kirby Award and the Harvey Award===

From 1985–1987, Fantagraphics coordinated and presented (through their magazine Amazing Heroes) The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals. The Kirby Award was managed by Dave Olbrich, a Fantagraphics employee (and later publisher of Malibu Comics). In 1987, a dispute arose when Olbrich and Fantagraphics each claimed ownership of the awards.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] A compromise was reached, and starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued and two new awards were created:"Newswatch: Kirby Awards End In Controversy," The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), pp. 19-20. the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich; and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award, named for cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman. Since their inception, the Harvey Awards have been presented at various fan conventions, such as the Chicago Comicon, the Dallas Fantasy Fair,  WonderCon, the Pittsburgh Comicon, the MoCCA Festival, and their current venue, the Baltimore Comic-Con. The Harvey Awards are no longer affiliated with Fantagraphics.

===Relocation to Seattle===

In 1989, Fantagraphics relocated from Los Angeles to its current location in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.
In 1990, the publisher introduced Eros Comix, a lucrative line of erotic comics which again saved the company from bankruptcy.
Longtime employee Eric Reynolds joined Fantagraphics in 1993, first as news editor for The Comics Journal from 1993, before moving to marketing and promotion in 1996. Tom Spurgeon, now publisher of The Comics Reporter, was editor of The Comics Journal  from 1994–1999.[tpl]cite news|title=Comics Reporter Blog Reaches Anniversary|date=October 10, 2007|publisher=Editor & Publisher[/tpl]

===Financial ups and downs===

In 1998, Fantagraphics was forced into a round of layoffs; and in 2003 the company almost went out of business, losing over $60,000 in the wake of the 2002 bankruptcy of debtor and book trade distributor Seven Hills Distribution.Dean, Michael. "Seven Hills Follows LPC into Limbo, Marvel Abandons Diamond for CDS," The Comics Journal, Posted August 30th, 2002. One employee quit during the subsequent downsizing while denouncing Fantagraphic's "disorganization and poor management." Fantagraphics was saved by a restructuring and a successful appeal to comic book fandom that resulted in a huge number of orders. After restructuring, the company has had greater success with such hardcover collections as The Complete Peanuts, distributed by W. W. Norton & Company.
