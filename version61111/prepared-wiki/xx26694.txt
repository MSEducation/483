[[Neuro-linguistic programming]]

CATEGORIES: Neuro-linguistic programming, Pseudoscience

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is an approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. Its creators claim a connection between the neurological processes ("neuro"), language ("linguistic") and behavioral patterns learned through experience ("programming") and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life.Tosey, P. & Mathison, J., (2006) "Introducing Neuro-Linguistic Programming Centre for Management Learning & Development, School of Management, University of Surrey.[tpl]Cite book|author=Dilts, R., Grinder, J., Delozier, J., and Bandler, R. |title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I: The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience |publisher=Cupertino, CA: Meta Publications |year=1980 |page=2 |isbn=978-0916990077[/tpl] Bandler and Grinder claim that the skills of exceptional people can be "modeled" using NLP methodology, then those skills can be acquired by anyone.[tpl]cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | last2=John | title=The Structure of Magic I: A Book about Language and Therapy | year=1975 | publisher=Science and Behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400447 | pages=5–6 [/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Grinder | first=John | last2=Bostic St. Clair| last2= Carmen | title=Whispering In The Wind | year=2001 | publisher=J & C Enterprises | isbn=0971722307 | chapter=Chapter 2: Terminology | quote=NLP is a modeling technology whose specific subject matter is the set of differences that make the difference between the performance of geniuses and that of average performers in the same field or activity.

Thus, after a session of "therapy," a smoker denied smoking before, even when family and friends insisted otherwise, becoming unable to account for such evidence as nicotine stains.

==History and conception==

===Early development===

According to Bandler and Grinder, NLP comprises a methodology termed modeling and a set of techniques that were derived from its initial applications by Bandler and Grinder.[tpl]cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | last2=John | title=The Structure of Magic I: A Book about Language and Therapy | year=1975 | publisher=Science and Behavior Books Inc. | isbn=0831400447 | page=6[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Grinder | first=John | last2=Bostic St. Clair| first2=Carmen | title=Whispering In The Wind | year=2001 | publisher=J & C Enterprises | isbn=0971722307 | chapter=Chapter 2: Terminology [/tpl]  Many of those methods that have come to be considered fundamental were derived from the initial modeling by Bandler and Grinder of the work of Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson and Fritz Perls.[tpl]cite book | last=Bandler | first=Richard | last2=Grinder | first2=John | editor1-last=Andreas | editor1-first=Steve | title=Frogs into Princes:Neuro Linguistic Programming | year=1979 | publisher=Real People Press | isbn=0911226192 | page=8 [/tpl] Bandler and Grinder also drew upon theories of Gregory Bateson, Alfred Korzybski and Noam Chomsky, particularly transformational grammar,[tpl]cite book|last=Wake|first=Lisa|title=Neurolinguistic psychotherapy : a postmodern perspective|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415425414|accessdate=24 May 2013|url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=8wIy20m_u9kC[/tpl] as well as ideas and techniques from Carlos Castaneda.  Bandler and Grinder claim that the therapeutic "magic" as performed in therapy by Perls, Satir and Erikson, and by performers in any complex human activity, had a structure that could be codified using their methodology and thereby learned by others. Their 1975 book The Structure of Magic I: A Book about Language and Therapy is intended to be a codification of the therapeutic techniques of Perls and Satir.page 6 of Bandler & Grinder 1975a.
Bandler and Grinder say that they modeled Virginia Satir, to produce what they termed the Meta-Model (via their process of modeling), a model for gathering information and challenging a client's language and underlying thinking. By challenging linguistic distortions, specifying generalizations, and recovering deleted information in the client's statements, the transformational grammar concepts of surface structure were said to yield a more complete representation of the underlying deep structure and to have therapeutic benefit.John Grinder, Suzette Elgin (1973).

Other than Satir, the people they cite as influences did not collaborate with Bandler or Grinder. Chomsky himself has no association with NLP whatsoever; his original work was intended as theory, not therapy. Stollznow writes, "other than borrowing terminology, NLP does not bear authentic resemblance to any of Chomsky's theories or philosophies - linguistic, cognitive or political."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Stollznow |first1=Karen |year=2010 |title=Not-so Linguistic Programming |journal=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=7 |publisher=The Skeptics Society |doi= |url=http://www.skeptic.com/magazine/archives/vol15n04.html |accessdate=1 June 2013[/tpl]

More recently (circa 1997), Bandler has claimed, "NLP™ sic is based on finding out what works and formalizing it. In order to formalize patterns I utilized everything from linguistics to holography...The models that constitute NLP™ sic are all formal models based on mathematical, logical principles sic such as predicate calculus and the mathematical equations underlying holography."[tpl]cite web | last = Bandler | first = Richard | title = NLP Seminars Group - Frequently Asked Questions | website = NLP Seminars Group | publisher = NLP Seminars Group | url = http://www.purenlp.com/nlpfaqr.html | year = 1997 | accessdate = 8 August 2013 | archiveurl =  http://web.archive.org/web/20130622080317/http://www.purenlp.com/nlpfaqr.html | archivedate = 22 June 2013[/tpl]  However, there is no mention of the mathematics of holography nor of holography in general in McClendon's,[tpl]cite book| last1 = McClendon| first1 = Terrence L.| title = The Wild Days.

On the matter of the development of NLP, Grinder recollects:[tpl]cite web | last = Grinder | first = John | others = Interviewed by Chris Collingwood and Jules Collingwood  | title = 1996 Interview with John Grinder PhD, co-creator of NLP | website = Inspiritive | publisher = Inspiritive | url = http://www.inspiritive.com.au/grinterv.htm |date=July 1996 | accessdate = 8 August 2013 | archiveurl =  http://web.archive.org/web/20130428225949/http://www.inspiritive.com.au/grinterv.htm | archivedate = 28 April 2013[/tpl]
The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll responded that Grinder has not understood Kuhn's text on the history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified in a field of science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a paradigm shift in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a paradigm shift is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a paradigm shift, i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm. In developing NLP Bandler and Grinder were not responding to a paradigmatic crisis in psychology nor did they produce any data that caused a paradigmatic crisis in psychology. There is no sense in which Bandler and Grinder caused or participated in a paradigm shift. "What did Grinder and Bandler do that makes it impossible to continue doing psychology...without accepting their ideas? Nothing.", argues Carroll.

===Commercialization and evaluation===

By the late 1970s, the human potential movement had developed into an industry and provided a market for some NLP ideas. At the center of this growth was the Esalen Institute at Big Sur, California. Perls had led numerous Gestalt therapy seminars at Esalen. Satir was an early leader and Bateson was a guest teacher. Bandler and Grinder claimed that in addition to being a therapeutic method, NLP was also a study of communication and began marketing it as a business tool, claiming that, "if any human being can do anything, so can you."[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=Heidi Yorkshire|title=The Bandler Method|journal=Mother Jones Magazine|year=1989|volume=14|issue=2|page=26|url=http://www.american-buddha.com/bandler.method.htmlpg=PA26|accessdate=24 May 2013|author=Frank Clancy|publisher=Mother Jones|issn=0362-8841[/tpl] After 150 students paid $1,000 each for a ten-day workshop in Santa Cruz, California, Bandler and Grinder gave up academic writing and produced popular books from seminar transcripts, such as Frogs into Princes, which sold more than 270,000 copies. According to court documents relating to an intellectual property dispute between Bandler and Grinder, Bandler made more than $800,000 in 1980 from workshop and book sales.
A community of psychotherapists and students began to form around Bandler and Grinder's initial works, leading to the growth and spread of NLP as a theory and practice.[tpl]cite book|title=Social Engineering|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc|author=Christopher Hadnagy|coauthors=Paul Wilson|accessdate=24 May 2013|url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=9LpawpklYogC|date=21 December 2010|isbn=9780470639535[/tpl] For example, Tony Robbins trained with Grinder and utilized a few ideas from NLP as part of his own self-help and motivational speaking programmes.[tpl]cite book|title=Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|year=2006|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=9781400054107|author=Steve Salerno|accessdate=24 May 2013|url = http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Sham.html?id=lmmxX81cEmMC[/tpl] Bandler led several unsuccessful efforts to exclude other parties from using NLP.[tpl]cite journal|coauthors=John A. Swets|title=Enhancing human performance: Issues, theories, and techniques|journal=Human Resource Development Quarterly|year=1988|volume=1|issue=2|pages=202–206|doi=10.1002/hrdq.3920010212|author=Daniel Druckman|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, DC[/tpl] Meanwhile, the rising number of practitioners and theorists led NLP to become even less uniform than it was at its foundation. Prior to the decline of NLP, scientific researchers began testing its theoretical underpinnings empirically, with research indicating a lack of empirical support for NLP's essential theories.  The 1990s were characterized by fewer scientific studies evaluating the methods of NLP than the previous decade. Witkowski attributes this to a declining interest in the debate as the result of a lack of empirical support for NLP from its proponents.

==Main components and core concepts==

NLP can be understood in terms of three broad components and the central concepts pertaining to those:

==Techniques or set of practices==

According to one study by Steinbach,Steinbach, A. (1984). Neurolinguistic programming: a systematic approach to change. Canadian Family Physician, 30, 147-50. PMC 2153995 a classic interaction in NLP can be understood in terms of several major stages including establishing rapport, gleaning information about a problem mental state and desired goals, using specific tools and techniques to make interventions, and integrating proposed changes into the client's life. The entire process is guided by the non-verbal responses of the client. The first is the act of establishing and maintaining rapport between the practitioner and the client which is achieved through pacing and leading the verbal (e.g., sensory predicates and keywords) and non-verbal behavior (e.g., matching and mirroring non-verbal behavior, or responding to eye movements) of the client.[tpl]Cite book|author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. |title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming |location=Moab, UT |publisher=Real People Press |year=1979 |pages=149 (p.8 (quote), pp. 15, 24, 30, 45,52) |isbn=0-911226-19-2[/tpl]
Once rapport is established, the practitioner may gather information (e.g., using the Meta-Model questions) about the client's present state as well as help the client define a desired state or goal for the interaction. The practitioner pays particular attention to the verbal and non-verbal responses as the client defines the present state and desired state and any "resources" that may be required to bridge the gap. The client is typically encouraged to consider the consequences of the desired outcome, and how they may affect his or her personal or professional life and relationships, taking into account any positive intentions of any problems that may arise (i.e. ecological check). Fourth, the practitioner assists the client in achieving the desired outcomes by using certain tools and techniques to change internal representations and responses to stimuli in the world.Bandler, 1984. pp. 134–137[tpl]cite journal|author=Masters, B Rawlins, M, Rawlins, L, Weidner, J.|year=1991|title=The NLP swish pattern: An innovative visualizing technique|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume= 13|issue=1|pages=79–90|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1991-19473-001[/tpl] Finally, the changes are "future paced" by helping the client to mentally rehearse and integrate the changes into his or her life. For example, the client may be asked to "step into the future" and represent (mentally see, hear and feel) what it is like having already achieved the outcome.
According to Stollznow (2010), "NLP also involves fringe discourse analysis and "practical" guidelines for "improved" communication. For example, one text asserts "when you adopt the "but" word, people will remember what you said afterwards. With the "and" word, people remember what you said before and after."

===Psychotherapeutic===

Early books about NLP had a psychotherapeutic focus given that the early models were psychotherapists. As an approach to psychotherapy, NLP shares similar core assumptions and foundations in common with some contemporary brief and systemic practices,Rubin Battino (2002) Expectation: The Very Brief Therapy Book.

According to Stollznow (2010) "Bandler and Grinder's infamous Frogs into Princes and their other books boast that NLP is a cure-all that treats a broad range of physical and mental conditions and learning difficulties, including epilepsy, myopia and dyslexia. With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)."  A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt et al (2012) concluded that "that there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes."
