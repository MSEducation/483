Voiced by Dan Castellaneta, he is the father of Homer Simpson, and the grandfather of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. In the 1000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Grampa was selected as the Grandpa for "The Perfect TV Family"."TV: Breaking Down the List," ''Entertainment Weekly," #999/1000 June 27 & July 4, 2008, 56.
Grampa is a World War II veteran and former farmer who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his long, rambling, often incoherent stories and incompetence. He shares his name with Matt Groening's grandfather. However, Groening says he refused to name him, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, the writers chose the name Abraham.

==Role in The Simpsons==

Grampa Simpson is the father to Homer Simpson, father-in-law to Marge Simpson and grandfather to siblings Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Grampa has also fathered two illegitimate children; a daughter named Abbie by a British woman named Edwina while in the United Kingdom during World War II,[tpl]cite episode |title=The Regina Monologues |episodelink=The Regina Monologues |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=November 23, 2003 |season=15 |number=04[/tpl] and Herbert Powell by a carnival prostitute.[tpl]cite episode |title=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |episodelink=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=	February 21, 1991 |season=2 |number=15[/tpl] Grampa has an older brother named Cyrus, who lives in Tahiti and has multiple native wives.[tpl]cite episode |title=Simpsons Christmas Stories |episodelink=Simpsons Christmas Stories |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Payne, Don; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=2005-12-18 |season=17 |number=365[/tpl] He also has a younger brother named Chet, who owns an unsuccessful shrimp company.[tpl]cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa the Simpson" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Grampa was briefly married to Amber, the same woman Homer married on a drinking binge in Las Vegas.[tpl]cite episode |title=Brawl in the Family |episodelink=Brawl in the Family |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H.; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2002-01-06 |season=13 |number=276[/tpl] Grampa has also been briefly married to Marge's sister, Selma Bouvier,[tpl]cite episode |title=Rome-old and Juli-eh |episodelink=Rome-old and Juli-eh |series=The Simpsons |credits=Kruse, Nancy; Chun, Daniel |network=Fox |airdate=March 11, 2007 |season=18 |number=15[/tpl] though Homer was against it, and was once romantically linked to Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier.

Almost all of Grampa's biographical information is supplied by himself. Many of his stories seem to be wildly inaccurate, often physically or historically impossible, and occasionally inconsistent even with each other, suggesting that Grampa is quite senile. It is unknown where Grampa was born. He claims that he came to America as a boy from the "old country", but he cannot remember which country it was.[tpl]cite episode |title=Much Apu About Nothing |episodelink=Much Apu About Nothing |series=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=May 5, 1996 |season=7 |number=23[/tpl] Grampa was raised in New York City with his parents, Orville J.

Grampa is a veteran of World War II, where he served as Master Sergeant of the Flying Hellfish unit. At the very end of war in Europe, Grampa's unit "liberated" a stash of priceless art from surrendering German forces. The Flying Hellfish formed a tontine, and buried the art in a trunk at sea. Decades later, Montgomery Burns, the second surviving member of the unit, tried to murder Grampa in order to get the art, prompting Grampa to violate the tontine. When Grampa and Bart retrieved the art from Mr. Burns, the State Department arrived to return the art to its rightful owner.[tpl]cite episode |title=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish" |episodelink=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish" |series=The Simpsons |credits=Collier, Jonathan; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=April 28, 1996 |season=7 |number=22[/tpl]
Homer's mother, Mona Simpson, was married to Grampa for several years. She became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after seeing Joe Namath's hair on television. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab owned by Mr. Burns to deliberately poison everyone in Springfield. To explain this to his then-six-year-old son, Grampa said that Mona died while Homer was at the movies.[tpl]cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episodelink=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Rich; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1995-11-19 |season=07 |number=08[/tpl] Grampa has a poor relationship with his son, who placed him in a nursing home as soon as he could, despite Grampa selling his house in order to provide Homer with a mortgage.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10[/tpl] Its recurringly suggested that, while caring, Grampa was very controlling, neglectful, and even emotionally abusive towards Homer when he was growing up and he still had not forgiven him for that.[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart Star |episodelink=Bart Star |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David X.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1997-11-09 |season=09 |number=06[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title=Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy |episodelink=Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill & Weinstein, Josh.; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1994-12-04 |season=06 |number=10[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title=Barting Over |episodelink=Barting Over |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Kreisberg, Andrew.; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2003-02-16 |season=14 |number=11[/tpl]

==Character==

===Creation===

Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, wanted to have a character that was "really cranky" and old, and who complained a lot and invented stories to tell to children, so he created Grampa. After naming the main characters after his own family members (except for Bart, an anagram of "brat", which he substituted for his own name),[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |date=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Groening refused to name Grampa after his grandfather, Abraham Groening. He left it to the writers to choose a name and they chose "Abraham", not knowing that it was also the name of Groening's grandfather.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Old Money" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Grampa first appeared in the Simpsons short "Grampa and the Kids", which premiered on The Tracey Ullman Show on January 10, 1988. In the short, Grampa tells his grandchildren stories of "the good old days". When they stop paying attention to him, he feigns his own death to recapture their attention.[tpl]cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family |others=[tpl]smallcaps|Created by Matt Groening; edited by Ray Richmond and Antonia Coffman[/tpl]. |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=HarperPerennial |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |asin=0060952520 |ref=[tpl]harvid|Richmond & Coffman|1997[/tpl][/tpl] ISBN [tpl]ISBNT|0-06-095252-0[/tpl], [tpl]ISBNT|978-0-06-095252-5[/tpl]. pp. 14.â€“15
The Simpsons writer Al Jean commented that Grampa is often the focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said the reason for that is because the staff is trying to illustrate how society mistreats the elderly, "and some of it is because people over 55 never watch our show".[tpl]cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=2000-10-21 |publisher=TV Guide |author=Rhodes, Joe[/tpl] Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are "obsessed" with old people.[tpl]cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Weinstein commented that they "both love people and seem to really hate them at the same time".[tpl]cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] He also said that he "enjoys" to write for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up "old time slang".[tpl]cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Team Homer" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]

===Voice===

Grampa's voice is performed by Dan Castellaneta, who also voices numerous other characters, including Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby and Hans Moleman. Castellaneta was part of the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show and had previously done some voice-over work in Chicago alongside his wife Deb Lacusta.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |title=D'oh, you're the voice |accessdate=2008-09-21 |date=2003-02-27 |author=Lee, Luaine |publisher=The Age[/tpl] Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/jun/23/voice-homer-simpson-leads-his-own-simple-life/ |title=Voice of Homer Simpson leads his own, simple life |author=Morrow, Terry |accessdate=2008-09-05 |date=2007-06-23 |publisher=Scripps Howard News Service |work=The Albuquerque Tribune[/tpl] and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it.Castellaneta, Dan.

==Reception==

===Commendations===

Nancy Basile of About.com named Grampa the fifth best character of The Simpsons, calling him a "perfect stereotypical old person".[tpl]cite web |url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/lists/tp/sicharacters.htm |title=Top 10 "The Simpsons" Characters |last=Basile |first=Nancy |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2008-12-27[/tpl] In the 1000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Grampa was selected as the "Grandpa for The Perfect TV Family". Joe Rhodes of TV Guide considered Grampa's most memorable line to be "If I'm not back at the home by nine, they declare me legally dead and collect my insurance." Dan Castellaneta has won two Primetime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance category for voicing various characters, including Grampa. The first was awarded in 1992 for the episode "Lisa's Pony",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl] and the second in 2004 for "Today I Am A Clown".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117908929.html?categoryid=1603&cs=1 |title=Emmy speaks for Homer |work=Variety |author=Schneider, Michael |accessdate=2008-12-27 |date=2004-08-10[/tpl] In 2010, Castellaneta was nominated for the award for voicing Grampa and Homer in the episode "Thursdays with Abie".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |title=2010 Primetime Emmy Awards Nominations |accessdate=2010-07-08 |publisher=Academy of Television Arts & Sciences[/tpl]
The Simpsons writer David Mirkin said that one of his favorite jokes on the show is the one where Grampa cycles down the street in high speed and shouts that he feels young again, and is then knocked flying from his bicycle after a doll's head flies into the spokes and falls into an open grave. In a review of the Grampa-centric episode "Lady Bouvier's Lover", Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict said that he is "never terribly interested" in episodes that revolve around Grampa, because he believes Grampa is "great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage."[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Patrick [/tpl] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said in a review of the same episode that Grampa is "always fun" and "itâ€™s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while."[tpl]cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin [/tpl]

===Analysis===

Mirkin thinks it is hard to make a "boring" and "tedious" character, such as Grampa, funny. He believes that what ultimately makes Grampa funny is that the things he says are "actually funny" in the context of the boredom and the tedium.[tpl]cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Anne-Marie Barry and Chris Yuill, the authors of the book Understanding the Sociology of Health, commented that in episodes in which Grampa appears, the comedy content is often generated by Grampa falling asleep at "inopportune" moments or "embarking" on long rambling stories about his youth. "Instances such as these match popular stereotypes that all old people are 'demented' and in poor health," they wrote.[tpl]cite book |last=Barry |first=Anne-Marie |coauthors=Yuill, Chris |title=Understanding the Sociology of Health |publisher=SAGE |year=2008 |page=212 |chapter=Ageing in society: a general overview |isbn=978-1-4129-3623-1 |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl]
Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that Grampa has the least amount of "power" in the Simpson family, and that he is treated as little more than a child and is often ignored. The family frequently laughs at his "failing" memory and his "ineffectual" attempts to get what he wants. They added that Grampa is left behind, forgotten, and rarely invited to spend time with the family. The authors commented that he is "not without influence, but he certainly does not play the traditional grandfather role in the family hierarchy."
Brown and Logan also wrote that Grampa had a considerable influence in the formation of Homer's character, and that flashbacks in The Simpsons show what an "angry", "critical" father he was to Homer. "He yelled, used corporal punishment, and constantly belittled Homer's attempts to have fun, date, and excel at various activities," they added. The authors said that Homer tries "in vain" to repair his relationship with Grampa and continuously seeks for his approval, but Grampa continues to be "as critical as ever".[tpl]cite book |last=Brown |first=Alan S. |coauthors=Chris Logan |title=The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh! |publisher=BenBella Books, Inc. |year=2006 |pages=3â€“4 (Chapter: The Family Simpson â€” Family Hierarchy) |id=|isbn=1-932100-70-9[/tpl] In his book Understanding the Psychology of Diversity, author Bruce Evan Blaine wrote that Grampa is typically portrayed as a "doddering", "senile", and "dependent" person who is a "trivial" and "often disposable figure" in his son's life.[tpl]cite book |last=Blaine |first=Bruce |title=Understanding The Psychology of Diversity |publisher=SAGE |year=2007 |page=160 |chapter=Presentations and Portrayals of Older People |isbn=978-1-4129-2109-1 |accessdate=2008-12-30[/tpl]
