Gandhi Global Family (GGF) is an organization founded to propagate the ideologies of Mahatma Gandhi, Vinoba Bhave, and Nirmala Deshpande in an effort to develop peace, international understanding, communal harmony, and friendship worldwide. Additionally, the Gandhi Global Family establishes person-to-person contact throughout different countries of the world. GGF was founded by Didi Nirmala Deshpande whose prime concern was to develop a channel of communication and understanding among the constructive organizations of youth, workers, and students in order to enable more harmonious relationships throughout the world.
GGF is headed by its President, Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Hon'ble Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare who joined the Gandhian Movement in 1969 when he was a college student. The GGF Vice President is Padmashri S.P. Varma who joined the Gandhian Movement in 1990 after meeting Padma Vibushan Didi Nirmala Deshpande in Kashmir, where militancy was at its peak.
GGF's main objectives are to raise awareness of "social evils" among students, provide affordable access to quality education and medical facilities, remember front-runner freedom fighters, celebrate national and international importance days, explore markets for Indian artisans, and encourage demilitarization of the conflicting zones across the country.
