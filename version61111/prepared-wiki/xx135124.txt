Firepower (also known as Multi-Ball Firepower) is a 1980 pinball game designed by Steve Ritchie and released by Williams. The machine had a production run of 17,410 machines.
The machine was originally supposed to have two sets of 3 drop targets. For economical reasons these were changed to stand up targets. Some Firepower owners have modified their machines to drop-targets.

==Features==

Firepower was the first solid-state electronic pinball to feature 3-ball Multi-Ball, as well as "Lane Change", where the player uses the right flipper button to shift the lit lights in a set of lights on the playfield, such as a set of lights on the outlanes and inlanes showing which lane has an award.

==Digital versions==

Firepower is a playable table of Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection and available as downloadable content (DLC) for The Pinball Arcade for several platforms.
