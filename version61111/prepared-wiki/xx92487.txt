Archibald Scott Cleghorn (November 15, 1835 – November 1, 1910) was a Scottish businessman who married into the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
He was born on November 15, 1835 in Edinburgh, Scotland, to Thomas Cleghorn and wife, Janet Nisbet. In 1851, at the age of 16, Cleghorn traveled with his parents to Honolulu, where his father established a dry goods store. His father died within the year, and his mother left for New Zealand, but Archibald remained in Hawaii and continued running the store. His business prospered and he expanded to other islands.[tpl]cite book |title=Hawaii's Tragic Princess: Kaiulani, the girl who never got to rule |author=Maxine Mrantz |page=7 |publisher=Aloha Graphics and Sales |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-941351-04-1 [/tpl]
