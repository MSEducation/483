The Kannada language is written using the Kannada script, which evolved from the 5th-century Kadamba script. Kannada is attested epigraphically for about one and a half millennia, and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 6th-century Ganga dynasty and during the 9th-century Rashtrakuta Dynasty.Zvelebil (1973), p.7 (Introductory, chart) Kannada has an unbroken literary history of over a thousand years.Garg (1992), p.67

==History==

Kannada is a Southern Dravidian language and according to Dravidian scholar Sanford Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three periods; Old Kannada (halegannada) from 450–1200 A.D., Middle Kannada (Nadugannada) from 1200–1700 A.D., and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present.Steever, S.B. (1998), p. 129 Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit. Influences of other languages such as Prakrit and Pali can also be found in Kannada language. The scholar Iravatham Mahadevan proved that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than 3rd century B.C., and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit and Tamil inscriptions of that period, Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population.[tpl]cite web |title=Classical Kannada, Antiquity of Kannada|url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html|author=|publisher=Central Institute for Indian Languages |work=Centre for classical Kannada|accessdate=28 August 2011[/tpl] The scholar K.V. Narayana claims that many tribal languages which are now designated as Kannada dialects could be nearer to the earlier form of the language with lesser influence from other languages.

==Influence of Sanskrit and Prakrit==

The sources of influence on Kannada grammar appear to be three-fold; Pāṇini's grammar, non-Paninian schools of Sanskrit grammar, particularly Katantra and Sakatayana schools, and Prakrit grammar.[tpl]cite book|last=Mythic Society (Bangalore, India)|title=The quarterly journal of the Mythic society (Bangalore)., Volume 76|year=1985|publisher=Mythic Society (Bangalore, India)|pages=Pages_197–210[/tpl] Literary Prakrit seemed to have prevailed in Karnataka since ancient times. The vernacular Prakrit speaking people may have come in contact with the Kannada speakers, thus influencing their language, even before Kannada was used for administrative or liturgical purposes. Kannada phonetics, morphology, vocabulary, grammar and syntax show significant Sanskrit and Prakrit influence.[tpl]cite book|last=B. K.

Some examples of naturalised (tadbhava) words of Prakrit origin in Kannada are baṇṇa derived from  vaṇṇa, arasu (king), and from Sanskrit, varṇa (color), hunnime (new moon) from  puṇṇivā, paurṇimā (full moon), and rāya from rāja (king).[tpl]cite book|last=Jha|first=Ganganatha|title=Journal of the Ganganatha Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Volume 32|year=1976|publisher=Ganganatha Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha,|pages=see page 319[/tpl] Kannada has numerous borrowed (tatsama) words such as dina, kopa, surya, mukha, nimiṣa, anna.[tpl]cite book|last=Kulli|first=Jayavant S|title=History of grammatical theories in Kannada|year=1991|publisher=Internationial School of Dravidian Linguistics,|pages=330 pages[/tpl]

==Early epigraphy==

Pre-old Kannada (or Purava HaleGannada) was the language of Banavasi in the early Common Era, the Satavahana and Kadamba periods and hence has a history of over 2000 years.[tpl]cite web |title=Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the Sixth Century AD |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/MAHEAR.html |author=Iravatham Mahadevan|publisher= |work=Harvard University Press |accessdate=12 April 2007[/tpl]Kamath (2001), p. 5–6(Wilks in Rice, B.L. (1897), p490)Pai and Narasimhachar in Bhat (1993), p103 The Ashoka rock edict found at Brahmagiri (dated to 230 BC) has been suggested to contain words in identifiable Kannada.The word Isila found in the Ashokan inscription (called the Brahmagiri edict from Karnataka) meaning to shoot an arrow is a Kannada word, indicating that Kannada was a spoken language in the third century BC (Dr. D.L. Narasimhachar in Kamath 2001, p5)
A possibly more definite reference to Kannada is found in the 'Charition mime' of the 1st or 2nd century CE. The farce, written by an unknown author was discovered in early 20th century at Oxyrynchus in Egypt.Suryanatha Kamath – Karnataka State Gazetteer – South Kanara (1973), Printed by the Director of Print, Stationery and Publications at the Govt. PressManohar Laxman Varadpande – History of Indian theatre, Volume 3 (1987), Abhinav Publications, New Delhi. The play is concerned with a Greek lady named Charition who has been stranded on the coast of a country bordering the Indian Ocean. The king of this region, and his countrymen, sometimes use their own language, and the sentences they spoke include  Koncha madhu patrakke haki (lit having poured a little wine into the cup separately) and  paanam beretti katti madhuvam ber ettuvenu (lit having taken up the cup separately and having covered it, I shall take wine separately).D. R. Bhandarkar – Lectures on the Ancient History of India on the Period From 650 To 320 B.C. (1919), University of Calcutta. The language employed in the papyrus indicates that the play is set in one of the numerous small ports on the western coast of India, between Karwar and Mangalore.
The written tradition of Kannada begins in the early centuries of common era. The earliest examples of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (shilashaasana) containing Brahmi characters with characteristics attributed to those of proto-Kannada in Hale Kannada (lit Old Kannada) script can be found in the Halmidi inscription, usually dated c. 450 C.E., indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language at that time. The Halmidi inscription provides invaluable information about the history and culture of Karnataka.Ramesh (1984), p10Encyclopaedia of Indian literature vol. 2, Sahitya Akademi (1988), p1717, p 1474A report on Halmidi inscription, [tpl]cite news |title=Halmidi village finally on the road to recognition |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/11/03/stories/2003110304550500.htm |author=Muralidhara Khajane |work=The Hindu |accessdate=25 November 2006 |location=Chennai, India |date=3 November 2003[/tpl]Kamath (2001), p10 The 5th century Tamatekallu inscription of Chitradurga and the Chikkamagaluru inscription of 500 AD are further examples.Narasimhacharya (1988), p6Rice (1921), p13Govinda Pai in Bhat (1993), p102 Recent reports indicate that the Old Kananda Nishadi Inscription discovered on the Chandragiri hill, Shravanabelagola, is older than Halmidi inscription by about fifty to hundred years and may belong to the period 350–400 CE. The noted archaeologist and art historian S. Settar is of the opinion that an inscription of the Western Ganga King Kongunivarma (c.350 – 370) is also older than the Halmidi inscrption.[tpl]cite web |title=HALMIDI INSCRIPTION|url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/DataBase/KannwordHTMLS/CLASSICAL%20KANNADA%20INSCRIPTIONS%20HTML/HALMIDI%20INSCRIPTION%20HTML.htm|author=|publisher=Central Institute for Indian Languages |work=Centre for classical Kannada|accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl]
Over 30,000 inscriptions written in the Kannada language have been discovered so far.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p1717 Prior to the Halmidi inscription, there is an abundance of inscriptions containing Kannada words, phrases and sentences, proving its antiquity. The 543 AD Badami cliff inscription of Pulakesi I is an example of a Sanskrit inscription in old Kannada script.Kamath (2001), p58[tpl]cite web |title=Badami: Chalukyans' magical transformation |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jul262005/spectrum1422512005725.asp |author=Azmathulla Shariff |work=Deccan Herald |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061007040120/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/jul262005/spectrum1422512005725.asp  |archivedate = 7 October 2006[/tpl]
The earliest copper plates inscribed in Old Kannada script and language, dated to the early 8th century AD, are associated with Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu (the Dakshina Kannada district), and display the double crested fish, his royal emblem.Gururaj Bhat in Kamath (2001), p97 The oldest well-preserved palm leaf manuscript in Old Kannada is that of Dhavala.

===Coins===

Some early Kadamba Dynasty coins bearing the Kannada inscription  Vira and Skandha were found in Satara collectorate.The coins are preserved at the Archaeological Section, Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, Mumbai – Kundangar and Moraes in Moraes (1931), p382 A gold coin bearing three inscriptions of Sri and an abbreviated inscription of king Bhagiratha's name called bhagi (c. 390–420 C.E.) in old Kannada exists.The coin is preserved at the Indian Historical Research Institute, St. Xavier's College, Mumbai – Kundangar and Moraes in Moraes (1938), p 382 A Kadamba copper coin dated to the 5th century C.E. with the inscription  Srimanaragi in Kannada script was discovered in Banavasi, Uttara Kannada district.[tpl]cite news |title=5th century copper coin discovered at Banavasi |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/06/stories/2006020609090400.htm|author=Dr Gopal, director, Department of Archaeology and Ancient History |publisher=The Hindu|work=Hindu, Monday, 6 February 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2007 |location=Chennai, India |date=6 February 2006[/tpl] Coins with Kannada legends have been discovered spanning the rule of the Western Ganga Dynasty, the Badami Chalukyas, the Alupas, the Western Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Hoysalas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the Keladi Nayakas and the Mysore Kingdom, the Badami Chalukya coins being a recent discovery.Kamath (2001), p12, p57[tpl]cite web |title=Indian coins-Dynasties of South |url=http://prabhu.50g.com/ |author=Govindaraya Prabhu, S |publisher=Prabhu's Web Page on Indian Coinage, 1 November 2001 |work= |accessdate=27 November 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Vijayanagar Coins-Catalogue |url=http://www.vijayanagaracoins.com/htm/history.htm |author=Harihariah Oruganti-Vice-President, Madras Coin Society |publisher= |work= |accessdate=27 November 2006[/tpl] The coins of the Kadambas of Goa are unique in that they have alternate inscription of the king's name in Kannada and Devanagari in triplicate,This shows that the native vernacular of the Goa Kadambas was Kannada – Moraes (1931), p384 a few coins of the Kadambas of Hangal are also available.Two coins of the Hangal Kadambas are preserved at the Royal Asiatic Society, Mumbai, one with the Kannada inscription Saarvadhari and other with Nakara.

==Literature==

===Old Kannada===

The oldest existing record of Kannada poetry in tripadi metre is the Kappe Arabhatta record of 700 CE.Kamath (2001), p67 Kavirajamarga by King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I (850 CE) is the earliest existing literary work in Kannada. It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries. The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King Durvinita of the 6th century and Ravikirti, the author of the Aihole record of 636 CE.Sastri (1955), p355Kamath (2001), p90 Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of Kannada grammar and literary styles, it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier.[tpl]cite web |title=History of the Kannada Literature-I |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/history1.htm |author=Jyotsna Kamat |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |work=Kamat's Potpourri, 4 November 2006 |accessdate=25 November 2006[/tpl] An early extant prose work, the Vaddaradhane by Shivakotiacharya of 900 AD provides an elaborate description of the life of Bhadrabahu of Shravanabelagola.Sastri (1955), p356
Kannada works from earlier centuries mentioned in the Kavirajamarga are not yet traced. Some ancient texts now considered extinct but referenced in later centuries are Prabhrita (650 CE) by Syamakundacharya, Chudamani (Crest Jewel—650 CE) by Srivaradhadeva, also known as Tumbuluracharya, which is a work of 96,000 verse-measures and a commentary on logic (Tatwartha-mahashastra).The seventeenth-century Kannada grammarian Bhattakalanka wrote about the Chudamani as a milestone in the literature of the Kannada language (Sastri (1955), p355)[tpl]cite web |title=History of the Kannada Literature – I |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/kar/literature/history1.htm |author=Jyotsna Kamat |publisher=Kamat's Potpourri |work=Kamat's Potpourri, 4 November 2006 |accessdate=25 November 2006[/tpl]Narasimhacharya (1988), pp 4–5 Other sources date Chudamani to the 6th century or earlier.Rice, B.L. (1897), p4976th century Sanskrit poet Dandin praised Srivaradhadeva's writing as "having produced Saraswati from the tip of his tongue, just as Shiva produced the Ganges from the tip of his top knot (Rice E.P., 1921, p27) The Karnateshwara Katha, a eulogy for King Pulakesi II, is said to have belonged to the 7th century; the Gajastaka, a work on elephant management by King Shivamara II, belonged to the 8th century,Kamath (2001), p50, p67 and the Chandraprabha-purana by Sri Vijaya, a court poet of King Amoghavarsha I, is ascribed to the early 9th century.The author and his work were praised by the latter-day poet Durgasimha of 1025 CE (Narasimhacharya 1988, p18.) Tamil Buddhist commentators of the 10th century CE (in the commentary on Nemrinatham, a Tamil grammatical work) make references that show that Kannada literature must have flourished as early as the 4th century CE.[tpl]cite web |title=The place of Kannada and Tamil in India's national culture |url=http://www.intamm.com/journalism/ta-jour3.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070415154722/http://www.intamm.com/journalism/ta-jour3.htm |archivedate=15 April 2007 |author=Sri K.

The late classical period gave birth to several genres of Kannada literature, with new forms of composition coming into use, including Ragale (a form of blank verse) and meters like Sangatya and Shatpadi. The works of this period are based on Jain and Hindu principles. Two of the early writers of this period are Harihara and Raghavanka, trailblazers in their own right. Harihara established the Ragale form of composition while Raghavanka popularised the Shatpadi (six-lined stanza) meter.Sastri (1955), pp 361–2 A famous Jaina writer of the same period is Janna, who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works.Narasimhacharya (1988), p20
The Vachana Sahitya tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature, and the sum of contributions by all sections of society. Vachanas were pithy poems on that period's social, religious and economic conditions. More importantly, they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution, which caused a radical re-examination of the ideas of caste, creed and religion. Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include Basavanna, Allama Prabhu and Akka Mahadevi.Sastri (1955), p361

===Middle Kannada===

During the period between the 15th and 18th centuries, Hinduism had a great influence on Middle Kannada (Nadugannada) language and literature. Kumara Vyasa, who wrote the Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari, was arguably the most influential Kannada writer of this period. His work, entirely composed in the native Bhamini Shatpadi (hexa-meter), is a sublime adaptation of the first ten books of the Mahabharata.Sastri (1955), p364 
During this period, the Sanskritic influence is present in most abstract, religious, scientific and rhetorical terms."Literature in all Dravidian languages owes a great deal to Sanskrit, the magic wand whose touch raised each of the languages from a level of patois to that of a literary idiom". (Sastri 1955, p309)Takahashi, Takanobu. 1995. Tamil love poetry and poetics. Brill's Indological library, v. 9. Leiden: E.J. Brill, p16,18"The author endeavours to demonstrate that the entire Sangam poetic corpus follows the "Kavya" form of Sanskrit poetry"-Tieken, Herman Joseph Hugo. 2001. Kāvya in South India: old Tamil Caṅkam poetry. Groningen: Egbert Forsten During this period, several Hindi and Marathi words came into Kannada, chiefly relating to feudalism and militia.[tpl]Cite book | year=1899 | title = A Kannaḍa-English school-dictionary: chiefly based on the labours of the Rev.

Hindu saints of the Vaishnava sect such as Kanakadasa, Purandaradasa, Naraharitirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Vijaya Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Prasanna Venkatadasa produced devotional poems in this period.Sastri (1955), pp 364–365 Kanakadasa's Ramadhanya Charite is a rare work, concerning with the issue of class struggle.The writing exalts the grain Ragi above all other grains that form the staple foods of much of modern Karnataka (Sastri 1955, p365) This period saw the advent of Haridasa Sahitya (lit Dasa literature) which made rich contributions to bhakti literature and sowed the seeds of Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa is widely considered the Father of Carnatic music.Iyer (2006), p93Sastri (1955), p365

===Modern Kannada===

The Kannada works produced from the 19th century make a gradual transition and are classified as Hosagannada or Modern Kannada. Most notable among the modernists was the poet Nandalike Muddana whose writing may be described as the "Dawn of Modern Kannada", though generally, linguists treat Indira Bai or Saddharma Vijayavu by Gulvadi Venkata Raya as the first literary works in Modern Kannada. The first modern movable type printing of "Canarese" appears to be the Canarese Grammar of Carey printed at Serampore in 1817, and the "Bible in Canarese" of John Hands in 1820.Report on the administration of Mysore – Page 90 Mysore – 1864 "There is no authentic record of the casting of the first Early Canarese printing. Canarese type, but a Canarese Grammar by Dr. Carey printed at Serampore in 1817 is extant. About the same time a translation of the Scriptures was printed The first novel printed was John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, along with other texts including Canarese Proverbs, The History of Little Henry and his Bearer by Mary Martha Sherwood, Christian Gottlob Barth's Bible Stories and "a Canarese hymn book."Missions in south India – Page 56 Joseph Mullens – 1854 "Among those of the former are tracts on Caste, on the Hindu gods; Canarese Proverbs; Henry and his Bearer; the Pilgrim's Progress; Barth's Bible Stories; a Canarese hymn book"
Modern Kannada in the 20th century has been influenced by many movements, notably Navodaya, Navya, Navyottara, Dalita and Bandaya. Contemporary Kannada literature has been highly successful in reaching people of all classes in society. Further, Kannada has produced a number of prolific and renowned poets and writers such as Kuvempu, Bendre, and V K Gokak. Works of Kannada literature have received eight Jnanpith awards,[tpl]cite web|author=Special Correspondent |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article2468374.ece |title=The Hindu – Jnanpith for Kambar |publisher=Thehindu.com |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2013[/tpl] the highest number awarded to any Indian language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jnanpith.net/laureates/index.html |title=Welcome to: Bhartiya Jnanpith |publisher=jnanpith.net |date= |accessdate=7 November 2008[/tpl]

==Dialects==

There is also a considerable difference between the spoken and written forms of the language. Spoken Kannada tends to vary from region to region. The written form is more or less consistent throughout Karnataka. The Ethnologue reports "about 20 dialects" of Kannada. Among them are Kundagannada (spoken exclusively in Kundapura), Nadavar-Kannada (spoken by Nadavaru), Havigannada (spoken mainly by Havyaka Brahmins), Are Bhashe (spoken by Gowda community mainly in the Sullia region of Dakshina Kannada), Malenadu Kannada (Sakaleshpur, Coorg, Shimoga, Chikmagalur), Soliga, Gulbarga Kannada, Dharawad Kannada etc. All of these dialects are influenced by their regional and cultural background.
Ethnologue also classifies a group of four languages related to Kannada, which are, besides Kannada proper, Badaga, Holiya and Urali.

==Status==

The Director of the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Udaya Narayana Singh, submitted a report in 2006 to the Indian government arguing for Kannada to be made a classical language of India.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/10/04/stories/2006100419510100.htm|title=Kannada likely to get classical tag|last=K.N. Venkatasubba Rao|date=4 October 2006|work=The Hindu|accessdate=17 February 2013[/tpl]
In 2008 the Indian government announced that Kannada was to be designated as one of the classical languages of India.

==Writing system==

The language uses forty-nine phonemic letters, divided into three groups: swaragalu (vowels – thirteen letters); vyanjanagalu (consonants – thirty-four letters); and yogavaahakagalu (neither vowel nor consonant – two letters: anusvara [tpl]lang|kn|ಂ[/tpl] and visarga [tpl]lang|kn|ಃ[/tpl]). The character set is almost identical to that of other Indian languages. The script itself, derived from Brahmi script, is fairly complicated like most other languages of India owing to the occurrence of various combinations of "half-letters" (glyphs), or symbols that attach to various letters in a manner similar to diacritical marks in the Romance languages. The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a "half n" (which becomes a half m). The number of written symbols, however, is far more than the forty-nine characters in the alphabet, because different characters can be combined to form compound characters (ottakshara). Each written symbol in the Kannada script corresponds with one syllable, as opposed to one phoneme in languages like English. The Kannada script is syllabic.

===Obsolete Kannada letters===

Kannada literary works employed the letters [tpl]lang|kn|ಱ[/tpl] (transliterated '[tpl]IAST|ṟ[/tpl]' or 'rh') and [tpl]lang|kn|ೞ[/tpl] (transliterated '[tpl]IAST|ḻ[/tpl]', 'lh' or 'zh'), whose manner of articulation most plausibly could be akin to those in present-day Malayalam and Tamil. The letters dropped out of use in the 12th and 18th centuries, respectively. Later Kannada works replaced 'rh' and 'lh' with [tpl]lang|kn|ರ[/tpl] (ra) and [tpl]lang|kn|ಳ[/tpl] (la) respectively.Rice, Edward. P (1921), "A History of Kanarese Literature", Oxford University Press, 1921: 14–15
Another letter (or unclassified vyanjana (consonant)) that has become extinct is 'nh' or 'inn'. 20px|baseline|link=Histocal form of 'N'|alt=ನ್ Likewise, this has its equivalent in Telugu, where it is called Nakaara pollu. The usage of this consonant was observed until the 1980s in Kannada works from the mostly coastal areas of Karnataka (especially the Dakshina Kannada district). Now hardly any mainstream works use this consonant. This letter has been replaced by [tpl]lang|kn|ನ್[/tpl] (consonant n).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl]

===Kannada script evolution===

The image below shows the evolution of Kannada script from prehistoric times to the modern period. The Kannada script evolved in stages:
Proto-Kannada → Pre–Old Kannada → Old Kannada → Modern Kannada.
The Proto-Kannada script has its root in ancient Brahmi and appeared around the 3rd century BCE. The Pre-Old-Kannada script appeared around the 4th century CE. Old-Kannada script can be traced to around the 10th century CE, whereas Modern-Kannada script appeared around the 17th century CE.

===Dictionary===

A German priest, the Reverend Ferdinand Kittel, composed the first Kannada–English dictionary, consisting of more than 70,000 words. Ferdinand Kittel also wrote a book on Kannada grammar called "A Grammar of the Kannada Language: Comprising the Three Dialects of the Language".[ref]Ferdinand Kittel.

===Kannada script in computing===

Several transliteration schemes/tools are used to type Kannada characters using a standard keyboard. These include Baraha[tpl]cite web |url=http://baraha.com/ |title=Baraha – Free Indian Language Software |publisher=baraha.com[/tpl] (based on ITRANS), Pada Software[tpl]cite web |url=http://pada.pro/ |title=Pada Software – For Indic Scripts|publisher=pada.pro[/tpl] and several internet tools like Google transliteration, Quillpad[tpl]cite web|url=http://quillpad.in/kannada |title=QuillPad – Typing in Kannada has never been easier |publisher=Quillpad.in |date= |accessdate=7 November 2008[/tpl] (predictive transliterator). Nudi, the Government of Karnataka's standard for Kannada Input, is a phonetic layout loosely based on transliteration.

==Grammar==

The canonical word order of Kannada is SOV (subject–object–verb) as is the case with Dravidian languages.
Kannada is a highly inflected language with three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter or common) and two numbers (singular and plural). It is inflected for gender, number and tense, among other things. The first authoritative known book on Kannada grammar is Shabdhamanidarpana by Keshiraaja. The first available Kannada book is a treatise on poetry: Kavirajamarga.
The most influential account of Kannada grammar is Keshiraja's Shabdamanidarpana (c. 1260 CE).Studies in Indian History, Epigraphy, and Culture – By Govind Swamirao Gai, pp. 315A Grammar of the Kannada Language. F. Kittel (1993), p. 3. The earlier grammatical works include portions of Kavirajamarga (a treatise on alańkāra) of the 9th century, and Kavyavalokana and Karnatakabhashabhushana (both authored by Nagavarma II in the first half of the 12th century).

===Compound bases===

Compound bases, called samāsa in Kannada, are a set of two or more words compounded together.Ferdinand Kittel, pp. 30 There are several types of compound bases, based on the rules followed for compounding.[tpl]Clarify|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Examples: tangaaLi, hemmara, immadi.

===Pronouns===

In many ways the third-person pronoun is more like demonstratives than like the other pronouns. They are pluralized like nouns, whereas the first- and second-person pronouns have different ways to distinguish number.Bhat, D.N.S. 2004. Pronouns. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 13–14
