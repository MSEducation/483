[[Redirect examination]]

CATEGORIES: Evidence law, Legal terms

Redirect examination is the trial process by which the party who offered the witness has a chance to explain or otherwise qualify any damaging or accusing testimony brought out by the opponent during cross-examination.  Redirect examination may question only those areas brought out on cross-examination and may not stray beyond that boundary.
When a witness is presented for testimony in the U.S. judicial system, the order is "direct" testimony, then the opposing attorney does "cross" and then "redirect" from the attorney first offering the witness. "Recross" may be allowed, but usually the opposing attorney must ask for permission from the judge before proceeding with this additional round of questioning.
In Australia, Canada and South Africa the process is called re-examination.
