The Albino Code (2006) is a short film parodying the film version of The Da Vinci Code.  The Albino Code was written and produced by, and stars, Dennis Hurley, who has albinism.  The film pokes fun at the depiction of people with albinism in Hollywood films by parodying the Da Vinci Code character Silas.  Hurley's film points out flaws with the portrayal of Silas, namely that most people with albinism do not have pink eyes, and that due to their impaired vision, they could not function well as assassins.Boston Herald
