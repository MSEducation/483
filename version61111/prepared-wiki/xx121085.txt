...Until We Felt Red is the third album by American guitarist Kaki King, released in 2006.

==Reception==

Writing for Allmusic, critic Jeff Tamarkin noted King's change in direction on the album, commenting "...those seeking the imaginative, intricate acoustic playing that characterized King's earlier work need not, well, fret. Every track—notably "Ahuvati," "First Brain," "Second Brain," and the title track—is rich with gleaming guitaristry. What's different is that King, whose first notices came when she entertained New York subway riders, can no longer be described simply as a guitarist. From here on, she'll be watched as a complete artist.."
