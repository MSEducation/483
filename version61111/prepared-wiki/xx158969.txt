F. calocera is a wood-inhabiting saprotrophic fungus.Singer R (1974) A Monograph of Favolaschia Beih. Nova Hedwigia 50:1–107 It presents as a bright orange stalked fan, 5 mm–30 mm diameter, with prominent pores on the underside.[tpl]cite web|title=Orange Poreconch (Favolaschia calocera)|url=http://www.terrain.net.nz/friends-of-te-henui-group/fungi-te-henui/orange-pore-fungi.html|publisher=Taranaki Educational Resource: Research, Analysis and Information Network|accessdate=2012-05-14[/tpl]
It is uncertain whether F. calocera is native to Madagascar or was introduced to the island from Asia. Throughout much of its expanded range F. calocera is now considered an invasive species.  It colonizes ruderal sites along transport routes and can become dominant in habitats disturbed by human activity.  Mycologists fear that it may be displacing native fungi species as it spreads through the paleotropics.
