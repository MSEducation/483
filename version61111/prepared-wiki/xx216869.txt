CATEGORIES: Blood

Venous stasis, or venostasis, is a condition of slow blood flow in the veins, usually of the legs. Venous stasis is a risk factor for forming blood clots in veins (venous thrombosis), as with the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT).[tpl]cite journal| author=Martinelli I, Bucciarelli P, Mannucci PM| title=Thrombotic risk factors: basic pathophysiology | journal=Crit Care Med | year= 2010 | volume= 38 | issue= 2 Suppl | pages= S3-9 | pmid=20083911 | doi=10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c9cbd9 [/tpl] Causes of venous stasis include long periods of immobility that can be encountered from driving,[tpl]cite book|title=Pharmacotherapy Handbook|author=Barbara G.
