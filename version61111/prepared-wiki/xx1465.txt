Croquet is a sportThe Croquet Association (CA), the national governing body for the sport of Croquet in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of ManOxford Croquet.com, "Croquet is a satisfying sport utilising tactics and touch in equal measure" that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops (often called "wickets" in the United States) embedded in a grass playing court.

==History==

The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers' Company in London.  This record is now in the English Public Records Office. In 1868 the first croquet all-comers' meeting was held at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon, London.
In the book Queen of Games: The History of Croquet,[tpl]cite book | last=Smith | first=Nicky | title=Queen of Games: The History of Croquet | publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson | year = 1991 | isbn=0-297-81176-2[/tpl] Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game that took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas.
The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the reign of Charles II of England, and was played under the name of paille-maille or pall mall, derived ultimately from Latin words for "ball and mallet".  This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica, dated 1877. In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt describes the way pall mall was played in England in the early 17th century:  "Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins.  It is to be observed, that there are two of these arches, that is one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime."[tpl]Cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=nSKFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=strutt+sport+goff#v=onepage&q=croquet&f=false |title=Sports and pastimes of the people of England |first= Joseph |last= Strutt |pages = 94–5 |publisher=Google Books|accessdate=14 September 2010 |year=1810[/tpl]Cotgrave, 1611
Whilst the name pall mall and various games bearing this name may have been played elsewhere (France and Italy) the description above suggests that the croquet-like games were certainly popular in England as early as 1611.  Some early sources refer to pall mall being played over a large distance (as in golf), however an image in Strutt's 1801 book clearly shows a croquet-like ground billiards game (balls on ground, hoop, bats and peg) being played over a short, garden-sized distance.  Interestingly, this image's caption describes the game as "a curious ancient pastime", confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England.
In Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary, his definition of "pall mall" clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: "A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring".[tpl]Cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=z3kKAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA519&dq=pelmel#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title= A dictionary of the English language |first1= Samuel last1= Johnson | first2= John |last2= Walker |first3= Robert S. |last3= Jameson |page=519 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |year= 1828[/tpl] However, there is no evidence that pall mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game.
The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches.  Records show the similar game of "crookey" being played at Castlebellingham in 1834, which was introduced to Galway in 1835 and played on the bishop's palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of Kingstown (today Dún Laoghaire) where it was first spelt as "croquet".Irish Daily Mail, 8 August 2009, p. 50. There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way game was played, in particular there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke.[tpl]cite book | last= Prichard | first=DMC | title=The History Of Croquet | publisher=Cassell | year=1981 | isbn=0-304-30759-9[/tpl] The noted croquet historian Dr Prior, in his book of 1872, makes the categoric statement "One thing only is certain: it is from Ireland that croquet came to England and it was on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale that it was first played in this country." This was about 1851.[tpl]cite book| title=A Brief History of Croquet in Ireland |first1= Clive |last1= Martin |first2= Simon |last2= Williams |year= 2004[/tpl]
John Jaques apparently claimed in a letter to Arthur Lillie in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland and, "I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr Spratt above introduced the subject to me."[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.
Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form, croquet is, like pall mall, trucco, jeu de mail and kolven, clearly a derivative of ground billiards, which was popular in Western Europe back to at least the 14th century, with roots in classical antiquity.[tpl]Shamos 1999|p. 117[/tpl][tpl]Stein & Rubino 2008|pp. 2, 4, 5, 27[/tpl]
Croquet became highly popular as a social pastime in England during the 1860s; by 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his Laws and Regulations of the game. It quickly spread to other Anglophone countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.
By the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, tennis, and many of the newly created croquet clubs, including the All England club at Wimbledon, converted some or all of their lawns into tennis courts. There was a revival in the 1890s, but from then onwards, croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. The English headquarters for the game is now in Cheltenham.

===Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle===

The earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations which was published in the mid-1860s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the Earl of Eglinton. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of "croquet" in full swing.[tpl]Cite book | chapter = Introduction | url = http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html | title = Edinburgh Croquet Club| accessdate = 4 April 2011[/tpl]
The croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between Eglinton Castle and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet, which had small bells on the eight hoops "to ring the changes", two pegs, a double hoop with a bell and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865 the 'Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet' was published by Edmund Routledge.  Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist, and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland. It is not known why the earl named the game thus.Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park – falconer

==Competitive variations==

There are several variations of croquet currently played, differing in the scoring systems, order of shots, and layout (particularly in social games where play must be adapted to smaller-than-standard playing courts). Two forms of the game, association croquet and golf croquet, have rules that are agreed internationally and are played in many countries around the world. The United States has its own set of rules for domestic games. More unusual variations of the game include mondo croquet, extreme croquet, and bicycle croquet (perhaps influenced by polo). Gateball, a sport originated in Japan under the influence of croquet, is played mainly in East and Southeast Asia and the Americas, it can also be regarded as a croquet variant.
As well as club-level games, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia; every four years, these countries play the MacRobertson Shield tournament. Many other countries also play. The current world rankings[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/Rankings/teamranking.php |title=WCF World Team Rankings |date=8 April 2010 |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl] show England in top place for association croquet, followed by Australia and New Zealand sharing second place, with the United States in fourth position; the same four countries appear in the top six of the golf croquet league table, below Egypt in top position, and with South Africa at number five.
Croquet is popularly believed to be viciously competitive."So they left the subject and played croquet, which is a very good game for people who are annoyed at each other, giving many opportunities for venting rancour." —Rose Macaulay, The Towers of Trebizond This may derive from the fact that (unlike in golf) players will often attempt to move their opponents' balls to unfavourable positions. However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy: successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents. At championship-standard association croquet, players can often make all 26 points (13 for each ball) in two turns.
Croquet was an event at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Roque, an American variation on croquet, was an event at the 1904 Summer Olympics.

==Variations==

===Association===

Association croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at international level. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win. The game's distinguishing feature is the "croquet" shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.
In association croquet one side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow.
At each turn, players can choose to play with either of their balls for that turn.
At the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop ("runs" the hoop), or hits another ball (a "roquet"), the turn continues.
Following a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the "croquet stroke" from which the game takes its name.
After the croquet stroke, the player plays a "continuation" stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again.
The winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).
Good players may make "breaks" of several hoops in a single turn.  The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn. "Advanced play" (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in a turn, to allow the opponent a chance of getting back into the game; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball help avoid these penalties.
A handicap system ('bisques') provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents. Players of all ages and both sexes compete on level terms.
The World Championships are organised by the World Croquet Federation (WCF)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |title=WFC News |date=9 September 2010 |publisher= World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl] and usually take place every 2 or 3 years. The New Zealand team won the last MacRobertson International Croquet Shield tournament, which is the major international test tour trophy in association croquet. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, Great Britain, the United States and New Zealand. Historically the British have been the dominant force, winning 14 times out of the 20 times the event has been held. In individual competition, the UK is often divided by subnational country (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). Unlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together. As of 2013, the Association Croquet World Champion is Robert Fletcher of Australia and the Women's Association Croquet World Champion is Jenny Clarke of New Zealand.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.croquetrecords.com/records/womensworlds/worlds2012.htm |title=Women's World Championship| date=28 September 2012 |publisher=Croquet Records Website|accessdate=28 October 2012[/tpl]
The world's top 10 association croquet players as of February 2014 are Robert Fletcher (Australia), Chris Clarke (New Zealand), Reg Bamford (South Africa), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), Aaron Westerby (New Zealand), Greg Bryant (New Zealand), Toby Garrison (New Zealand),  Robert Fulford (England),  David Maugham (England), and Jamie Burch (England).[tpl]cite web |url= http://butedock.demon.co.uk/cgs/rank.php |title=Croquet Grading System |first= Chris |last= Williams |accessdate=22 May 2012[/tpl]
Three women have won the British Open Championship: Lily Gower in 1905, Dorothy Steel in 1925, 1933, 1935 and 1936, and Hope Rotherham in 1960. While male players are in the majority at club level in the UK, the opposite is the case in Australia and New Zealand.
The governing body in England is The Croquet Association, which has been the driving force of the development of the game. The rules and tournament regulations are now maintained by the International Laws Committee, established by the croquet associations of England and Wales (CA), Australia (ACA), New Zealand (CNZ) and the United States (USCA).

===Golf===

In golf croquet, a hoop is won by the first ball to go through each hoop. Unlike association croquet, there are no additional turns for hitting other balls.
Each player takes a stroke in turn, each trying to hit a ball through the same hoop. The sequence of play is blue, red, black, yellow. Blue and black balls play against red and yellow. When a hoop is won, the sequence of play continues as before. The winner of the game is the player/team who wins the most hoops.
Golf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101121030026/http://croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm | archivedate= 21 November 2010 | title=Older, Wealthier and with a bit to Think about |first= Kevin |last= Carter |year=2007 |publisher= The Croquet Association| accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl] owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness.  There is an especially large interest with competitive success by players in Egypt.[tpl]cite web |title=Egypt v Rest of World GC Event |url=http://www.croquet.org.uk/news/newsdb.asp?NewsID=2766 |first= Elizabeth |last= Williams |location= Roehampton Club |date=21 July 2008 |publisher=The Croquet Association  |accessdate=14 September 2010[/tpl] Golf croquet is easier to learn and play, but requires strategic skills and accurate play. In comparison with association croquet, play is faster and balls are more likely to be lifted off the ground, as seen in this video footage.
In April 2013, Reg Bamford of South Africa beat Ahmed Nasr of Egypt in the final of the Golf Croquet World Championship in Cairo, becoming the first person to simultaneously hold the title in both association croquet and golf croquet.[tpl]cite news| title=Reg Bamford won the WCF GC Championship to become the first AC & GC World Champion | first= Tim |last= King |location= Cairo | date= 28 April 2013 |url= https://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=/news/newsdb.asp&NewsID=4457 |publisher=The Croquet Association | accessdate= 30 September 2013[/tpl] As of 2011, the Women's Golf Croquet World Champion was Rachel Rowe (England).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.croquet.org.uk/?p=/news/newsdb.asp&NewsID=4040| date=26 November 2011 |title= Rachel Rowe won the 4th WCF Women's World Golf Croquet Championship |first1= Elizabeth |last1= Larsson |first2= Tim |last2= King |location= Bay of Plenty, New Zealand |publisher= The Croquet Association |accessdate=4 December 2011[/tpl]

===Garden===

Garden croquet is widely played in the UK. The rules are easy to learn and the game can be played on lawns of almost any size but usually around [tpl]convert|32|ft|m|disp=x| wide (|)[/tpl] by [tpl]convert|40|ft|m|disp=x| long (|)|abbr=on[/tpl]. The rules are similar to those described above for Association Croquet with three major differences:
This version of the game is easy for beginners to learn. The main Garden Croquet Club in the UK is the Bygrave Croquet Club which is a private club with five lawns. Other clubs also use garden croquet as an introduction to the game, notably the Hampstead Heath Croquet Club and the Watford Croquet Club.

===American six-wicket===

The American rules version of croquet, another six-hoop game, is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in Canada. It is governed by the United States Croquet Association. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American "backyard" croquet.
Two of the most notable differences are that the balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow) throughout the game, and that a ball's "deadness" on other balls is carried over from turn to turn until the ball has been "cleared" by scoring its next hoop. Tactics are simplified on the one hand by the strict sequence of play, and complicated on the other hand by the continuation of deadness. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/laws/usca/index.asp |title=Association vs US (6-wicket) Rules Croquet |first= Ian |last= Plummer |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Oxford Croquet  |accessdate=22 February 2011[/tpl]
In the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only [tpl]convert|9|in|spell=in[/tpl] from the boundary rather than a yard ([tpl]Convert|1|yd|cm|disp = out[/tpl]) as in association croquet. "Attacking" balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.

===Nine-wicket===

Nine-wicket croquet, sometimes called "backyard croquet", is played mainly in Canada and the United States, and is the game most recreational players in those countries call simply "croquet". This version of croquet varies from six-wicket croquet in that there are nine wickets, two stakes, and players can compete individually with a single ball, or as teams of two or three, with up to six players competing.  The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course.  Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to win the game.
Unlike six-wicket croquet, where each time a ball is roqueted a croquet shot must be taken, players have three options after roqueting another ball.  These reflect the more individual aspect of nine-wicket croquet.  The options are:
Ordinarily, the first person to finish the course wins the game.  However, some players prefer to use an endgame procedure called "poison". In poison, once a player has scored the last hoop but has not hit the starting stake, their ball becomes "poison", which allows them to eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them. If a non-poison ball roquets a poison ball, the standard roqueting options apply, but if a poison ball travels through a wicket or hits a stake for any reason, it forfeits and is eliminated from the game. The last person remaining is the winner.http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/28/backyard-croquet-challenging-options#option6

===Ricochet===

This version of the game was invented by John Riches of Adelaide, Australia with help from Tom Armstrong in the 1980s. The game can be played by up to 6 people and is very easy to learn. For this reason it is often used as a stepping stone to association croquet. Ricochet has similar rules to association and garden croquet, except that when a ball is roqueted, the striker's ball remains live and two free shots are earned. This enables strikers to play their ball near to another opponent ball and ricochet that too thus earning two more free shots. Running a hoop earns one free shot.

==Glossary of terms==

==In art and literature==

The way croquet is depicted in paintings and books says much about popular perceptions of the game, though little about the reality of modern play.

==In politics==

On 25 May 2006, the then British Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, was photographed by The Mail on Sunday playing croquet at his official residence, Dorneywood.[tpl]cite news|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14049-2206420,00.html|title=Prescott Quits Country House to Save Skin|last=Webster|first=Philip|date=1 June 2006|work=The Times|location=London|accessdate=4 May 2009[/tpl] Following shortly after a sex scandal[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945170.stm|title=Prescott Admits Affair with Aide|date=28 April 2006|accessdate=4 May 2009 |work=BBC News[/tpl] that had forced Prescott to resign his ministerial responsibilities while retaining his salary and privileges,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2167472,00.html| title= Prescott loses his dream home: the mega-department| last= Knight| first= Sam| date= 5 May 2006|work=The Times|accessdate=4 May 2009 | location=London[/tpl] the incident was portrayed as evidence that Prescott had little real responsibility for running the country during the absence of the Prime Minister.
