Moscow is situated on the Moskva River in the Central Federal District of European Russia making it the world's most populated inland city. It also has the largest forest area within its borders—more than any other major city—even before its expansion in 2012. In the course of its history the city has served as the capital of a progression of states, from the medieval Grand Duchy of Moscow and the subsequent Tsardom of Russia to the Soviet Union. Moscow is the site of the Moscow Kremlin, a medieval city-fortress that is today the residence of the Russian president. The Moscow Kremlin is also one of several World Heritage Sites in the city. Both chambers of the Russian parliament (the State Duma and the Federation Council) also sit in Moscow.
The city is served by an extensive transit network, which includes four international airports, nine railway terminals, and one of the deepest underground metro systems in the world, the Moscow Metro, third to Tokyo and Seoul in terms of passenger numbers. It is recognized as one of the city's landmarks due to the rich and varied architecture of its 194 stations.
Over time, Moscow has acquired a number of epithets, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The Third Rome ([tpl]lang|ru|Третий Рим[/tpl]), The Whitestone One ([tpl]lang|ru|Белокаменная[/tpl]), The First Throne ([tpl]lang|ru|Первопрестольная[/tpl]), The Forty Forties ([tpl]lang|ru|Сорок Сороков[/tpl]), and The Hero City ([tpl]lang|ru|город-герой[/tpl]). In old Russian the word "[tpl]lang|ru|Сорок[/tpl]" (forty) also meant a church administrative district, which consisted of about forty churches. The  demonym for a Moscow resident is "[tpl]lang|ru|москвич[/tpl]" (moskvich), rendered in English as Muscovite.

==History==

The city is named after the river (old [tpl]lang-ru|гра́д Моско́в[/tpl], literally "the city by the Moskva River"). The first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 when Yuri Dolgorukiy called upon the prince of the Novgorod-Severski to "come to me, brother, to Moscow".[tpl]cite web |url=http://faculty.oxy.edu/richmond/csp8/history_of_moscow.htm |title=The History of Moscow |publisher=Occidental College |last=Comins-Richmond |first=Walter |accessdate=2006-07-03[/tpl]
Nine years later, in 1156, Prince Yuri Dolgorukiy of Rostov ordered the construction of a wooden wall, the Kremlin, which had to be rebuilt multiple times, to surround the emerging city.[tpl]cite web |url=http://russia.nypl.org/events/Kremlin.html |title=Russia Engages the World: The Building of the Kremlin, 1156–1516 |publisher=The New York Public Library |accessdate=2006-07-03[/tpl] After the sacking of 1237–1238, when the Mongols burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants, Moscow recovered and became the capital of the independent Vladimir-Suzdal principality in 1327.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Along the Moscow Golden Ring |publisher=Moscow, Russia Tourist Information center|accessdate=2006-07-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Its favorable position on the headwaters of the Volga River contributed to steady expansion. Moscow developed into a stable and prosperous principality, known as Grand Duchy of Moscow, for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia.
Under Ivan I of Moscow the city replaced Tver as a political center of Vladimir-Suzdal and became the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol-Tatar rulers. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons, but was passed intact to his eldest. Moscow's opposition against foreign domination grew. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo. The battle, however, was not decisive and only two years later Moscow was sacked by khan Tokhtamysh. Ivan III, in 1480, finally broke the Russian people free from Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in Russia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html|title=The Mongol Connection: Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow |last=Vogel|first=Michael|publisher=Indiana University South Bend|accessdate=2006-07-03 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060107213535/http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html  |archivedate= 2006-01-07[/tpl] Under Ivan III the city became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of present-day Russia and other lands.
In 1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin."The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World". John F. Richards (2006). University of California Press. p.260. ISBN 0-520-24678-0
In 1609, the Swedish army led by Count Jacob De la Gardie and Evert Horn started their march from Great Novgorod toward Moscow to help Tsar Vasili Shuiski, entered Moscow in 1610 and suppressed the rebellion against the Tsar, but left it early in 1611, following which the Polish–Lithuanian army invaded. During the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618) hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski entered Moscow after defeating the Russians in the Battle of Klushino. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.
The plague epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656."Bubonic plague in early modern Russia: public health and urban disaster". John T. Alexander (2002). Oxford University Press US. p.17. ISBN 0-19-515818-0 The city ceased to be Russia’s capital in 1712, after the founding of Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great near the Baltic coast in 1703. The Plague of 1771 was the last massive outbreak of plague in central Russia, claiming up to 100,000 lives in Moscow alone. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and evacuated, as Napoleon’s forces were approaching on 14 September. Napoleon’s Grande Armée, plagued by hunger, cold and poor supply lines, was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 died during this time, and only a few tens of thousands of ravaged troops returned."The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars". Albert Seaton, Michael Youens (1979). p.29.

In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow’s first official mayor. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, on 12 March 1918LENINE’S MIGRATION A QUEER SCENE, The New York Times, March 16, 1918 Moscow became the capital of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and of the Soviet Union less than five years later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/GEOGRAF.HTM|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511023524/http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/GEOGRAF.HTM|archivedate=2008-05-11 |title=Geographi |publisher=The Russian Embassy |accessdate=2009-03-08[/tpl] During World War II (the period from June 22, 1941, to May 9, 1945, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War), after the German invasion of the USSR, the Soviet State Defense Committee and the General Staff of the Red Army was located in Moscow.
In 1941, sixteen divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), twenty-five battalions (18,500 people) and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. That November, the German Army Group Center was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with most of the government, and from 20 October the city was declared to be under siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and supervised antitank defenses, while the city was subjected to air bombing. Joseph Stalin refused to leave Moscow, meaning that the general staff and the council of people's commissars remained in the city as well. Despite the siege and the bombings, the construction of Moscow's metro system continued through the war, and by the end of the war several new metro lines were opened.
Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between 30 September 1941, and 7 January 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the Wehrmacht and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.Moscow Encyclopedia, ed.

On 1 May 1944, a medal For the defense of Moscow and in 1947 another medal In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow were introduced. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany, on May 8, 1965, Moscow became one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the Hero City title.
In 1980, it hosted the Summer Olympic Games, which were boycotted by the United States and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in late 1979. In 1991, Moscow was the scene of the failed coup attempt by the government members opposed to the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev. When the USSR dissolved at the end of that year, Moscow continued as the capital of Russia.
Since then, the emergence of a market economy in Moscow has produced an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles. In 1998, Moscow hosted the first World Youth Games – see 1998 World Youth Games. This city hosted the 2013 World Championships in Athletics.

==Geography and climate==

===Location===

Moscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over [tpl]convert|500|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] through the East European Plain in central Russia. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits. The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 m (512 ft). Teplostanskaya highland is the city's highest point at [tpl]convert|255|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.darwin.museum.ru/expos/oopt/?t=40 |title= Памятник природы "Высшая точка Москвы – 255 м над уровнем моря (Теплый Стан)" |publisher= www.darwin.museum.ru |accessdate= 2009-04-29 |language= Russian[/tpl] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is [tpl]convert|39.7|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl], and the length from north to south is [tpl]convert|51.8|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl].

===Time===

Moscow serves as the reference point for the timezone used in most of Central Russia, including Saint Petersburg. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as Moscow Standard Time (MSK, мск), which is 4 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+4. Daylight saving time is no longer observed.

===Climate===

Moscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with warm humid summers and fairly cold winters usually lasting from mid November through the end of March. Weather can fluctuate widely with temperatures ranging from [tpl]convert|-25|C[/tpl] to above [tpl]convert|0|C[/tpl] in the winter and from [tpl]convert|15|C[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|30|C[/tpl] in the summer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=27612&month=6&year=2010 |title=Погода и Климат – Климатический монитор: погода в Москве |publisher=Pogoda.ru.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] Typical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July and August are around a comfortable [tpl]convert|20|C[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|26|C[/tpl], but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed [tpl]convert|30|C[/tpl], sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, night-time temperatures normally drop to approximately [tpl]convert|-10|C[/tpl], though there can be periods of warmth with temperatures rising above [tpl]convert|0|C[/tpl]. The highest temperature ever recorded was [tpl]convert|38.2|C[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/monitor.php?id=27612&month=7&year=2010 |title=Climate monitoring|accessdate=2006-07-27[/tpl] at the VVC weather station and [tpl]convert|39.0|C[/tpl] in the center of Moscow and Domodedovo airport on July 29, 2010 during the unusual 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave. Record high temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, August, November and December in 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pogoda.ru.net/climate/27612.htm|title=Pogoda.ru.net|accessdate=2012-12-15 |publisher=|language=Russian[/tpl] The average July temperature from 1981–2010 is [tpl]convert|19.2|C[/tpl]. The lowest ever recorded temperature was [tpl]convert|-42.2|C[/tpl] in January 1940. Snow, which is present for three to five months a year, often begins to fall at the end of November and melts by mid-March.
On average Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying between a low of 8% in December to 52% in May–August.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pogoda.ru.net/weathernews.php?id=3284|title=2008 was the warmest year in Moscow history (in Russian)|accessdate=2009-02-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Between 2004–2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meteoweb.ru/cl006-4.php|title=Sunshine hours in 2007 (in Russian)|accessdate=2009-02-21[/tpl]
Moscow, being in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere, is a place with the most expressed signs of global warming. Thus the climate becomes less stable, but the average yearly temperature is growing. So, the period from July until the beginning of August has become considerably warmer. During this time periods of extreme heat are often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011). At the end of January–February it is often colder (2006, 2010, 2011). The last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow. Temperature changes in the city are depicted in the table below:

==Demographics==

===Population===

According to the results of the 2010 Census, the population of Moscow was 11,503,501; up from 10,382,754 recorded in the 2002 Census.[tpl]ru-pop-ref|2002Census[/tpl]
At the time of the official 2010 Census, the ethnic makeup of the city's population whose ethnicity was known (10,835,092 people) was:
The official population of Moscow is based on those holding "permanent residency." According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow also holds 1.8 million official "guests" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 13.3 million. The number of unofficial guests, those without proper documentation, the vast majority from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2009/02/09/migrant.html |title="Российская газета" о мигрантах в Москве |publisher=Rg.ru |date=|accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl] for a total population of about 14.3 million.

===Religion===

Christianity is the predominant religion in the city, of which the Russian Orthodox Church is the most popular. Moscow is Russia's capital of Orthodox Christianity. It has been the country’s traditional religion and was deemed a part of Russia's "historical heritage" in a law passed in 1997.[tpl]cite book|last=Bell|first=Imogen|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=respecting+christianity+islam+buddhism+judaism+and+other&source=web&ots=pppIldMuS1&sig=KikE3NJkzMEdWt4rU9EoeN03-6o|accessdate=2007-12-27 |isbn=978-1-85743-137-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Taylor & Francis[/tpl] Other religions practiced in Moscow include Islam, Rodnovery, Protestantism, Catholicism, Old Believers, Buddhism, and Judaism.
The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery. Moscow was called the "city of 40 times 40 churches"—"город сорока сороков церквей"—prior to 1917. In 1918 Bolsheviks' government declared Russia a secular state, which actually meant that religion was outlawed and society was to become totally atheistic. During the period of 1920-1930s a great number of churches in Moscow were demolished, including historical Chudov Monastery in Kremlin, dating from the 14th century, Kazansky Cathedral on the Red Square, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over the Napoleon army in 1812, and many more. It still continued even after WW II, in 1940-1970s, when persecutions against religion in Soviet Union became less severe. Most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs, offices, factories and even warehouses. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity. Among the churches reconstructed in 1990s is an impressive Cathedral of Christ the Savior which once more has become one of the most picturesque landmarks of the city. People over 30 years old still remember a huge open swimming-pool which was located on the site of the demolished cathedral till 1994.
Muslims constitute around 1.5 million, that is 14% of the population.[tpl]cite news|author=Maxim Kireev|title=Planned Mosque Sparks Controversy in Russia|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,723799,00.html|publisher=Der Spiegel[/tpl] There are four mosques in the city.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

Moscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is also well known as the site of Saint Basil’s Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.
Medieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.
The Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by increasing numbers of masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.
The city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires, but also the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.[tpl]cite book|title=The architecture and planning of classical Moscow: a cultural history|last=Schmidt|first=Albert J|publisher=American Philosophical Society|date=1989-04-01|pages=5–25[/tpl]
For much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of Joseph Stalin's large-scale effort to "modernize" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's socialist reforms was the Sukharev Tower, a longtime city landmark, as well as numerous mansions and commercial buildings lining the major streets. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular, totalitarian nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1525/city.1998.10.1.269?cookieSet=1&journalCode=ciso |title=blackwell-synergy.com |publisher=blackwell-synergy.com |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl]
While the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS, responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov, famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.[tpl]cite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080527154019/http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&id=mem_shukhov&lang=eng&data=mem_shukhov |publisher=Melnikov Institute |title=Memorial |accessdate=2006-07-06[/tpl] Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the GUM department store on Red Square, bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.
Perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called Seven Sisters, comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow’s skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City, and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower, which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world’s seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto.List of tallest buildings in the world
The Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. These can often be identified by age, sturdiness of construction, or ‘style’ depending on the neighborhood and the materials used. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.
Although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least 9 floors tall, and have elevators. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.
Stalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes. However, small churches – almost always Eastern Orthodox– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old Arbat Street, a popular tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist façades of Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times. Ostankino Palace, Kuskovo, Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some convents and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.
Attempts are being made to restore many of the city’s best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. Facadism is also widely practiced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&data_id=92&do=view_single |title=Moscow Architecture Preservation Society |publisher=Maps-moscow.com |date=2006-04-17 |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-Modernist styles employed, such as with the Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as “false teeth of Moscow” and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.
Plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well-known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many "museum houses" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.
Moscow's skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction.
In recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2007/11/moscow-russia-buildings |title=Appetite for destruction |publisher=New Statesman |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zagraevsky.com/moscow_engl.htm |title=Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky.

There are on average [tpl]convert|27|m2|sp=us[/tpl] of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York.[tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Green dress of Moscow
Gorky Park (officially the Central Park of Culture and Rest named after Maxim Gorky), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square meters[tpl]\[/tpl] 170 acres) along the Moskva river contains estrades, children's attractions (including the Observation Wheel water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the Neskuchny Garden (408,000 square meters[tpl]\[/tpl] 101 acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mosday.ru/photos/?neskuchniy |title=Neskuchniy Garden |publisher=Mosday.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl]
Several parks include a section known as a "Park of Culture and Rest", sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki. Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).
Izmaylovsky Park, created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with Richmond Park in London. Its area of [tpl]convert|15.34|km2|sqmi[/tpl] is six times greater than that of Central Park in New York.
Sokolniki Park, named after the falcon hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of [tpl]convert|6|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.
Losiny Ostrov National Park ("Elk Island" National Park), with a total area of more than [tpl]convert|116|km2|sqmi[/tpl], borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the "city taiga" – elk can be seen there.
Tsytsin Main Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences, founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.[tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] The Official Site of the Main Moscow Botanical Garden. Retrieved on 2006-07-18. It covers territory of [tpl]convert|3.61|km2|sqmi[/tpl] bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand different species of plants from different parts of the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It also contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is also a greenhouse taking up more than 5000 square meters of land.
The All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a "permanent trade show", is in fact one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of recreational park areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or one of USSR's republics. Even though, during the 1990s, it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (Stone Flower and Friendship of Nations) and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema.
Lilac Park, founded in 1958, is known for its permanent sculpture display and a large rosarium.
Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists.

===Moscow Rings===

Moscow's road system is centered roughly around the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads ("rings").
The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called Bely Gorod (White Town). The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a horseshoe-like arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the Yauza River.
The second primary ring, located outside the bell end of the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.
The third ring, the Third Transport Ring, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed freeway.
The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, is under construction to further reduce traffic congestion.
The outermost ring within Moscow is the Moscow Automobile Ring Road (often called the MKAD from the Russian Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога), which forms the approximate boundary of the city, was established in the 1950s. Outside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits.

===Overview===

One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/ |title=The Official site of the Tretyakov Gallery |publisher=Tretyakovgallery.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11[/tpl] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings.

The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous Monument to the Third International and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.
Another art museum in the city of Moscow is the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, the father of Marina Tsvetaeva. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the British Museum in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts famous paintings from every major Western era; works by Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso are present in the museum's collection.
The State Historical Museum of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million.

Moscow houses several equally prominent and award-winning football, ice hockey, basketball and many other sports teams, which is rather unusual for Russia as well as the world. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were highly centralized in the first place, two of the best-manned Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo) and a Union-wide selection (there were "army" and "police" teams in most major cities) and Moscow being the center of both the sports organisations, DoD and police headquarters, Spartak, CSKA and Dinamo were equally the most prestigious, well-manned and best-funded teams in the USSR.
