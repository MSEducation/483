[[Legislative districts of Cebu]]

CATEGORIES: Legislative districts of the Philippines, Cebu

The Legislative Districts of Cebu, namely the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth districts, are the representations of the Province of Cebu and the independent city of Mandaue in the Philippine House of Representatives. From 1907 until 1972, Cebu Province was divided into seven congressional districts and Cebu City was part of its representation. From 1978 to 1984, it was part of the representation of Region VII, and from 1984 to 1986, it elected 6 assemblymen at-large.
The province's representation was reduced to six congressional districts upon the restoration of the House of Representatives in 1987 after Cebu City was given its own representations in Congress.
The passage of Republic Act 9726 separated the highly-urbanized city of Lapu-Lapu from the sixth district to form its own congressional district starting in the 2010 elections.
