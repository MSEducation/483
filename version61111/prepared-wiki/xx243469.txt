[[Constitutional history of Ecuador]]

CATEGORIES: Constitutions of Ecuador, Legal history of Ecuador

Ecuador's first constitution as a republic was established in 1830, following the country's independence from Gran Colombia. Ecuador has had a total of twenty constitutions over the course of its history, which can be seen as a symptom of Ecuador's chronic instability.  
After several years of political crisis, the government of Rafael Correa, elected in 2005 following the dismissal of Lucio Guti√©rrez by Congress, proposed a new Magna Carta for the country with the goal of stability and social development. This constitution, approved in 2008, is the last episode of Ecuador's constitutional history.
