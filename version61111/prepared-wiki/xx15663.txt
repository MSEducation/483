Ethnic territory of Belarusians

]]
Belarusians form minorities in neighboring Ukraine, Poland (especially in the Podlaskie Voivodeship), Russia and Lithuania. At the beginning of 20th century Belarusians constituted a majority in the regions around Smolensk.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
Noticeable numbers have emigrated to the United States, Brazil and Canada in the early 20th century. During Soviet times, many Belarusians were deported or migrated to various regions of the USSR, including Siberia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
Since the breakup of the USSR several hundred thousand have emigrated to Baltic states, the United States, Canada, Russia, and EU countries.

==Languages==

The two official languages in Belarus are Belarusian and Russian. Russian is the most spoken language, principally by 72% of the population, while Belarusian is only used by 11.9%Belta.by in everyday life. Statistical data shows that Belarusian is fluently communicated, read and written by 29.4%, while 52.5% of the population can communicate and read in Belarusian. Belarusian is a language of the Eastern Slavic group.

==Genetics==

Belarusians have a high percentage of male ancestry Haplogroup R1a (51%), similar to Russians, Ukrainians and Poles. Such large frequencies of R1a have been found only in Eastern Europe and India.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Doron M. |last1=Behar |first2=Mark G. |last2=Thomas |first3=Karl |last3=Skorecki |first4=Michael F. |last4=Hammer |first5=Ekaterina |last5=Bulygina |first6=Dror |last6=Rosengarten |first7=Abigail L. |last7=Jones |first8=Karen |last8=Held |first9=Vivian |last9=Moses |first10=David |last10=Goldstein |first11=Neil |last11=Bradman |first12=Michael E. |last12=Weale |title=Multiple Origins of Ashkenazi Levites: Y Chromosome Evidence for Both Near Eastern and European Ancestries |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=768–779 |year=2003 |doi=10.1086/378506 |pmid=13680527 |pmc=1180600[/tpl]
Genetic studies show that genetically Belarusians have close genetic similarities with Poles, Russians and Ukrainians, which belong to the same group. A study of the Y chromosome in East Slavs groups shows that there is no significant variation in the Y chromosome between Belarusians, Poles, central-southern Russians and Ukrainians, and it is overlapped by their vast similarities, thus revealing an overwhelmingly shared patrilineal ancestry."DK Zelenin, Ethnographical divisions of East Slavs"[tpl]full|date=November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Balanovsky |first=Oleg |last2=et al. |year=2008 |title=Two Sources of the Russian Patrilineal Heritage in Their Eurasian Context |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=236–250 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.019 |pmid=18179905 |pmc=2253976[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |first=Boris |last=Malyarchuk |last2=et al. |year=2004 |title=Differentiation of Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosomes in Russian Populations |journal=Human Biology |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=877–900 |doi=10.1353/hub.2005.0021 |pmid=15974299[/tpl] In terms of haplogroup distribution, the genetic pattern of Belarusians most closely resembles that of Ukrainians.
A genetic portrait of modern Belarusians documents a separation of subpopulations along the south-north line, which is demonstrated particularly in distribution of Y chromosomal lineages R1b, I1a and I1b, N3 and G-chromosomes, has been noted; east-west gradient is insignificant.Genetic portrait of modern Belarusians: mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome perspective.

==Name==

The name Belarus can be literally translated as White Ruthenia that is a historical region in the east of modern Republic of Belarus, known in Latin as Ruthenia Alba ([tpl]lang-en|White Rus[/tpl]). This name was in use in the West for some time in history, together with White Ruthenes, White Russians (though not to be confused with the political group of White Russians that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War) and similar forms. Belarusians trace their name back to the people of Rus'.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Until the 19th century Belarusians were also known as Litvins (after the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). The term Belarusians was promoted mostly during the 19th century. For instance, this can be traced by editions of folklorist researches by Ivan Sakharov, where in the edition of 1836 Belarusian customs are described as Litvin, while in the edition of 1886 the words Литва (Lithuania) and Литовцо-руссы (Lithuanian-Russians/Ruthenians) are replaced by respectively Белоруссия (Byelorussia) and белоруссы (Byelorussians).Сказанія русскаго народа, собранныя Иваномъ Петровичемъ Сахаровымъ, 1836, 1886
