==Athletic director career==

Mississippi State
Byrne is the former athletics director for Mississippi State University.  On June 7, 2008, Byrne hired John Cohen as head baseball coach to replace Ron Polk, who retired the preceding March. Polk, who endorsed his assistant Tommy Raffo upon his retirement, protested the hire and waged a very personal and public attack on Byrne.Mississippi St AD Greg Byrne takes Arizona job AP via MSNBC.com.

On December 10, 2008, Byrne hired Dan Mullen as head football coach to replace Sylvester Croom who resigned after five years and a 21–38 record at Mississippi State.Croom resigns after five years at Mississippi State AP via ESPN.com.

On March 22, 2010, Greg Byrne was hired at the University of Arizona (replacing longtime Arizona AD Jim Livengood, who accepted the AD position at UNLV some months prior) and officially started in his new position on May 1, 2010. 
Arizona
Byrne took over a long-term $378 million sports expansion project at Arizona, announced the previous fall, that would include an expansion of the north end zone stands at Arizona Stadium. The expansion would include a four-story building that would house locker rooms and football offices, among other things.[tpl]cite web |title=UA's $378M sports upgrade |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/wildcats/307356 |date=2 September 2009 |work= |publisher=Arizona Daily Star |accessdate=2 September 2009[/tpl] In January 2011, Byrne announced that a new [tpl]convert|5,356|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] video board would be installed above the south stands in time for the 2011 season.

Also under Byrne, another, more immediate and major change to the Wildcat football program occurred: eight-year head coach Mike Stoops was relieved of his duties on Oct 10, 2011 after the Wildcats opened the season with a 1-5 record. Co-defensive coordinator Tim Kish was named as interim head coach.Mike Stoops is out: Why and what's next?
On November 21, 2011, Arizona announced the hiring of Rich Rodriguez to replace Stoops. Rodriguez previously served as the head football coach at Salem University (1988), Glenville State College (1990–1996), West Virginia (2001–2007), and the University of Michigan (2008–2010); he was also assistant coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterback coach for Tulane University (1997–1998) and Clemson University (1999–2000) (both under head coach Tommy Bowden). 
Rodriguez' West Virginia teams played in (and won) three consecutive BCS bowl games. Rodriguez was an analyst for CBS Sports during the 2011 football season after a less-than-successful and disappointing tenure at Michigan. His hiring at Arizona was first announced by Greg Byrne on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/#!/Greg_Byrne/status/138777752001187840 while a press conference officially announcing him as the head coach was held a day later at McKale Center in Tucson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/blogs/pac12pundit/ua-football-rodriguez-s-goal-is-win-rose-bowl/article_3990cef8-1544-11e1-a26f-001cc4c03286.html|title=UA football: Rodriguez's goal is 'win Rose Bowl'|last=Finley|first=Patrick|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=2011-11-22[/tpl]
In 2012, after making the decision to move the Arizona Wildcats baseball team from their on-campus stadium to the off-campus Hi Corbett Field, the Arizona Wildcats possessed the third-highest attendance on the West Coast and hosted both a Regional and Super Regional. The team went onto win the 2012 College World Series, Byrne's first championship as Athletic Director.
