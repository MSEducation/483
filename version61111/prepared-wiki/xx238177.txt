Mills joined Carshalton Athletic at the start of the 2012–13 Ryman Premier League season. He scored four goals in a reserve match and was quickly moved up into the first team squad. Used primarily as a striker, and occasionally on the right of a front three, he played 10 games and scored three goals – two in a FA Trophy qualifier against Heybridge Swifts and one against Kingstonian in a 2–1 league defeat. Due to the mass clear-out of players at Colston Avenue in the autumn of 2012, a successful bid by Ryman Premier rivals Whitehawk saw Mills leave Colston Avenue.
