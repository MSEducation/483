[[Trams in Stockholm]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Stockholm, Tram transport in Sweden

The Stockholm tramway network forms part of the public transport system in Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden.

==History==

The first tramway in Stockholm was opened in 1877 and was drawn by horses. A tramline run on steam-power opened in 1887. Stockholm's tram network was converted to electrical propulsion 1901-1905. An extensive network formed in the early 20th Century. Trams were effectively replaced by the Stockholm Metro from 1950 onwards, and all tram lines were closed down by 1967 due to the effect of Dagen H and replaced with buses (especially those in Stockholm proper), with the exception of two suburban tram lines, Lidingöbanan and Nockebybanan.
In 1991, one tram line, Djurgårdslinjen, was reopened as a heritage and tourist line. Since 2000, two more tram lines have been built from scratch, one to the suburb of Tvärbanan (Line 22), and one to the inner city Spårväg City (Line 7). The Tvärbanan tramline was extended in 2013, and will be further extended in the future.

As of 2013, the following lines provide service in the Stockholm metropolitan area:
