Cytinus is a genus of parasitic flowering plants. Species in this genus do not produce chlorophyll, but rely fully on its host plant. Cytinus usually parasitizes Cistus and Halimium, two genera of plants in the Cistaceae family. It has also been found on Ptilostemon chamaepeuce.
Several species are found in the Mediterranean Region, South Africa, with a possibly undescribed species from Madagascar.parasiticplants.siu.edu: Cytinaceae

==Biology==

C. capensis and C. sanguineus are dioecious, while C. hypocistis is monoecious.Nickrent et al. 2004
C. hypocistis has been shown to infect mainly Halimium halimifolium and Cistus monspeliensis in Portugal.Thorogood & Hiscock 2007

==Systematics==

The genus Cytinus was previously included in the parasitic family Rafflesiaceae, but is now put into the family Cytinaceae (order Malvales), together with the genus Bdallophytum with four species.
Cytinus ruber is no longer considered a separate species, but is now a subspecies of C. hypocistis.

==Uses==

The young C. hypocistis is cooked as an Asparagus substitute, and an extract has been used in treating dysentery, throat tumors and as an astringent.[ref]Dr. Duke's
Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases: Cytinus hypocistis[/ref] C. ruber is also edible, and was used in folk medicine as an emmenagogue.The University of Reading: Cytinus hypocistis
