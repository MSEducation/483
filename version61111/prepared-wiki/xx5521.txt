[/ref] The many mile-high cities have temperature swings from roughly [tpl]convert|50|-|79|F|C|1[/tpl]. Nairobi, at [tpl]convert|1798|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|1.798|km|mi|2|abbr=on[/tpl], ranges from [tpl]convert|49|-|80|F|C|1[/tpl], and Kitale, at [tpl]convert|1825|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|1.825|km|mi|2|abbr=on[/tpl], ranges from [tpl]convert|51|-|82|F|C|1[/tpl]. At night, heavy clothes or blankets are needed, in the highlands, when the temperature drops to about [tpl]convert|50|-|54|F|C|1[/tpl] every night.
At lower altitudes, the increased temperature is like day and night, literally: like starting the morning at the highland daytime high, and then adding the heat of the day, again. Hence, the overnight low temperatures near sealevel are nearly the same as the high temperatures of the elevated Kenyan highlands. However, locations along the Indian Ocean have more moderate temperatures, as a few degrees cooler in the daytime, such as at Mombasa (see chart below).
There are slight seasonal variations in temperature, of [tpl]convert|4|C-change|disp=or[/tpl], cooler in the winter months. Although Kenya is centred at the equator, it shares the seasons of the southern hemisphere: with the warmest summer months in February–March and the coolest winter months in July–August, although only a few degrees cooler.
On the high mountains, such as Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon and Kilimanjaro, the weather can become bitterly cold for most of the year. Some snowfall has occurred on the highest mountains.

==Terrain==

Kenya's terrain is composed of low plains that rise into central highlands that are, in turn, bisected by the Great Rift Valley.  There is also a fertile plateau in the west of the country.

===Elevation extremes===

The lowest point on Kenya is at sea level on the Indian Ocean. The highest point on Kenya is 5,199 meters above sea level at Mount Kenya.

===Rivers===

The two main rivers are the Galana and the Tana. However, the Ewaso Ng'iro is a very important river supplying water from Mt. Kenya to the northern part of Kenya.

===Natural resources===

Natural resources that are found on Kenya include: limestone, soda ash, salt, gemstones, fluorspar, zinc, diatomite, gypsum, wildlife and hydropower.

===Land use===

9.48% of the land is arable. Permanent crops occupy 1.12% of the land. Other uses make up the rest of Kenya's land. (2011)

====Irrigated land====

1032 km² of Kenya' land is irrigated.(2003)

===Total renewable water resources===

30.7 km3 (2011)

==Natural hazards==

Natural hazards include recurring drought and flooding during the rainy seasons.
There is limited volcanic activity in the country.  The Barrier (elev. 1,032 m) last erupted in 1921.  South Island is the only other historically active volcano.

===Environmental issues===

====Current issues====

Current issues that threaten the environment at the moment include water pollution from urban and industrial wastes; degradation of water quality from the increased use of pesticides and fertilizers; deforestation; water hyacinth infestation in Lake Victoria; soil erosion; desertification; and poaching.

====International agreements====

==Extreme points==

This is a list of the extreme points of Kenya, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.
