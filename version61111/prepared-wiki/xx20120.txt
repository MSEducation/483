Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released in October 1969 on Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. Production was credited to lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer. With elements of blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin II also exhibits the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar and riff-based sound. It has been described as the band's heaviest album.[tpl]sfn|Buckley|2003|p=502[/tpl]
Upon release, Led Zeppelin II sold well and was the band's first album to reach number one in the UK and the US. In 1970, art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for the album. On 15 November 1999, it was certified 12× Platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of 12 million copies. Since its release, writers and music critics have regularly cited it in polls of the greatest and most influential rock albums.[tpl]fact|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Conception==

===Background===

Led Zeppelin II was conceived during a hectic and much-travelled period of Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American concert tours.
Each song was separately recorded, mixed and produced at various studios in the UK and North America. The album was written on tour, during periods of a couple of hours in between concerts, a studio was booked and the recording process begun, resulting in a sound with spontaneity and urgency through necessity.[tpl]cite book|last=Rosen|first=Craig|year=1996|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Albums: The Inside Story Behind Pop Music's Blockbuster Records|edition=1st|location=New York|publisher=Billboard Books|page=118|isbn=0-8230-7586-9[/tpl] Bassist John Paul Jones recalled that "We were touring a lot. Jimmy Page's riffs were coming fast and furious. A lot of them came from onstage especially during the long improvised section of 'Dazed and Confused'. We'd remember the good stuff and dart into a studio along the way."Liner notes for the Led Zeppelin boxed set.
Some of the recording studios used by the band were not the most advanced. One studio in Vancouver, credited as "a hut",[tpl]cite web|author=Cleveland, Barry|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mixing-led-zeppelin/May-08/36033|title=Guitar Player: Mixing Led Zeppelin II|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080915051359/http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mixing-led-zeppelin/may-08/36033|archivedate=15 September 2008|date=May 2008|publisher=Guitar Player|accessdate=11 February 2009[/tpl] had an 8-track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities.Schulps, Dave. Interview with Jimmy Page, Trouser Press, October 1977. The group's lead singer Robert Plant later discussed the writing and recording process, stating "It was crazy really. We were writing the numbers in hotel rooms and then we'd do a rhythm track in London, add the vocal in New York, overdub the harmonica in Vancouver and then come back to finish mixing at New York."Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. ISBN 0-7119-5307-4, p. 32.
"Thank You", "The Lemon Song" and "Moby Dick" were overdubbed during the tour, while the mixing of "Whole Lotta Love" and "Heartbreaker" was also done on tour. Page later stated "In other words, some of the material came out of rehearsing for the next tour and getting new material together."

===Recording===

Recording sessions for the album took place at Olympic and Morgan Studios in London, England; A&M, Quantum, Sunset, Mirror Sound and Mystic Studios in Los Angeles, California; Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee; A&R, Juggy Sound, Groove and Mayfair Studios in New York City; and the "hut" in Vancouver. Production was entirely credited to Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the skills and recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer, whose prior work with Jimi Hendrix had impressed the band's members, especially Page. Led Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis wrote of the album's production, stating "That the album turned out to be such a triumph, in particular for a production quality that still sounds fresh today, was in no small way due to the successful alliance with Page and Kramer in the control room." This partnership was particularly exhibited in the central section of the track "Whole Lotta Love". Kramer later said, "The famous Whole Lotta Love mix, where everything is going bananas, is a combination of Jimmy and myself just flying around on a small console twiddling every knob known to man."
In another interview, Kramer later gave great credit to Page for the sound that was achieved, despite the inconsistent conditions in which it was recorded: "We did that album piece-meal. We cut some of the tracks in some of the most bizarre studios you can imagine, little holes in the wall. Cheap studios. But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous. There was a unification of sound on Led Zeppelin II because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page.""Their Time is Gonna Come", Classic Rock Magazine: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin, 2008, p. 21. Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A&R Studios.

==Composition==

The finished tracks reflect the raw, evolving sound of the band and their ability as live performers. The album has been noted for featuring a further development of the lyrical themes established by Robert Plant on Led Zeppelin's debut album, creating a work which would become more widely acclaimed and arguably more influential.allmusic: Led Zeppelin II.

Blender: The Ultimate Guide to Music and More – Led Zeppelin[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]. Maxim Digital. Retrieved on 9 February 2009. As was later observed by Plant himself:
Led Zeppelin II also features experimentation with other musical styles and approaches, as on the alternately soft-and-loud "What Is and What Should Never Be" and "Ramble On" (which featured Page's acoustic guitar), or the pop-influenced ballad "Thank You". With its mysterious atmospherics, "Ramble On" helped develop hard rock's association with fantasy themes, which had been partly derived from the psychedelic rock genre of two to three years before, but also from Plant's personal interest in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien. This musical direction would later culminate on Led Zeppelin IV (and countless subsequent groups would later carry the influence to further extremes). Conversely, the instrumental "Moby Dick" features an extended drum solo by John Bonham, which would be extended further during Led Zeppelin concert performances sometimes for as long as half an hour.
Page's contribution to this album was significant, as his electric guitar solo on the song "Heartbreaker" was emulated by many younger rock guitarists, and exemplifies the group's intense musical attack. Led Zeppelin II is the band's first album to feature Page playing a 1959 Gibson Les Paul, the electric guitar he helped popularise. His innovative recording and drum miking effects on tracks such as "Ramble On" and "Whole Lotta Love" also demonstrated his considerable skill, resourcefulness and originality as a producer. Rolling Stone magazine later called Page's guitar riff for the latter song "one of the most exhilarating guitar riffs in rock & roll." John Paul Jones later discussed Page's contributions:
The album's material also marked a certain honing of Plant's vocal approach,Liner notes by Cameron Crowe for The Complete Studio Recordings, p. 9. and signalled his emergence as a serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as "What Is and What Should Never Be" and "Ramble On" were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented that it was only during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated "During Led Zep I (1969) as far as I was concerned, I thought that I was going to the band anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because there were a lot of demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing. And I was quite nervous and didn't really get into enjoying it until II."Jones, Allan. "Robert Plant: 'We did what we set out to do...'", Uncut Magazine, May 2008, pp. 38–43.

==Packaging==

The album sleeve design was from a poster by David Juniper, who was simply told by the band to come up with an interesting idea. His design was based on a photograph of the Jagdstaffel 11 Division of the German Air Force during World War I, the famed Flying Circus led by the Red Baron. After the picture was tinted, the faces of the four members of the band were airbrushed on from a 1969 publicity photograph. Other faces added, according to Juniper, were either Miles Davis or Blind Willie Johnson, a friend of Andy Warhol (possibly Mary Woronov) and astronaut Neil Armstrong, [tpl]cite web |url=http://rockpopgallery.typepad.com/rockpop_gallery_news/2007/05/cover_story_led.html |title=Cover Story - "Led Zeppelin II" by David Juniper |author=Michael Goldstein |date=18 Mat 2007 |work= |publisher=rockpopgallery.typepad.com |accessdate=19 November 2012[/tpl] although it is actually fellow astronaut Frank Borman.http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/004650.html The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background, which gave the album its nickname "Brown Bomber".

==Release and reception==

The album was released on 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records, with advance orders of 400,000 copies.Welch, Chris (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. ISBN 1-85797-930-3, p. 40. The advertising campaign was built around the slogans 'Led Zeppelin - The Only Way to Fly' and 'Led Zeppelin II Now Flying'.In the United States, some commercially-duplicated reel-to-reel copies of Led Zeppelin II made by Ampex bore the title Led Zeppelin II - The Only Way to Fly on their spine. Commercially, Led Zeppelin II was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking The Beatles' Abbey Road (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks. By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138 week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970.Lewis, Dave (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, pp. 13–19. ISBN 0-7119-3528-9
The album also yielded Led Zeppelin's biggest hit with the track "Whole Lotta Love". This song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1970, after Atlantic went against the group's wishes by releasing a shorter version on 45. The single's B-side, "Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)", also hit the Billboard chart, peaking at No. 65 in April 1970. The album helped establish Led Zeppelin as an international concert attraction, as for the next year, the group continued to tour relentlessly, initially performing in clubs and ballrooms, then in larger auditoriums and eventually stadiums as their popularity grew.allmusic: Led Zeppelin – Bio.

==Legacy==

Led Zeppelin II has been cited by music writers as a blueprint for heavy metal bands that followed it.[tpl]cite book|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2007|title=All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock|edition=1st|location=San Francisco|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=98|isbn=0-87930-917-2[/tpl] Blues-derived songs like "Whole Lotta Love", "Heartbreaker", "The Lemon Song", "Moby Dick", and "Bring It On Home" have been seen as representing standards of the genre, where the guitar-based riff (rather than vocal chorus or verses) defines the song and provides the key hook. Such arrangements and emphasis were at the time atypical in popular music. Page's guitar solo in "Heartbreaker" featuring rapid-fire runs of notes tapped only by the left hand, was a major inspiration to the later work of metal soloists and "shredders" such as Eddie Van Halen and Steve Vai.[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Pete|year=1997|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|edition=1st|location=San Francisco|publisher=Hal Leonard|page=165|isbn=0-7935-4042-9[/tpl] As such, the album is generally considered to be very influential on the development of rock music, being an early forerunner of heavy metal, and inspiring a host of other rock bands including Aerosmith, Iron Maiden and Guns N' Roses.Brackett, Nathan; Hoard, Christian The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004): p. 479
Since its initial critical reception, Led Zeppelin II has been acknowledged by many critics and music writers as one of the most influential albums of rock music, and has earned several accolades from music publications, frequently placed at or near the top of "best album" lists.Acclaimed Music: Led Zeppelin II.

==2014 Reissue==

Along with the group's self-titled debut album and their next album, Led Zeppelin III, the album was remastered and reissued by Page at the start of 2014. The reissue comes in 5 formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe 2 CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe 2 LP version, and a super deluxe 2 CD+2 LP version with a hardback book. The deluxe and super deluxe editions feature bonus material containing alternative takes, backing tracks and a previously unreleased song, "La La".

==Track listing==

Cassette tape releases of the album had "Heartbreaker" ending the first side and "Thank You" starting the second side. "Moby Dick" played as the second track on cassettes with "What Is And What Should Never Be" moved to side two.
Original LP pressings of the album incorrectly listed the running time of "Thank You" at 3:50, as the song's coda features a false fade at that point.
