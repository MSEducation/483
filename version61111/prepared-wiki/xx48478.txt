Edward Moore "Ted" Kennedy (February 22, 1932 – August 25, 2009) was the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts and a member of the Democratic Party. He was the second most senior member of the Senate when he died and was the fourth-longest-serving senator in United States history, having served there for almost 47 years. As the most prominent living member of the Kennedy family for many years, he was also the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Kennedy; the youngest brother of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, both victims of assassination; and the father of Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy.
Kennedy entered the Senate in a November 1962 special election to fill the seat once held by his brother John. He was elected to a full six-year term in 1964 and was reelected seven more times before his death. The Chappaquiddick incident on July 18, 1969, resulted in the death of his automobile passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident; the incident and its aftermath significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming President of the United States. His one attempt, in the 1980 presidential election, resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President Jimmy Carter.
Kennedy was known for his charisma and oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his 1980 rallying cry for modern American liberalism were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as "The Lion of the Senate" through his long tenure and influence. More than 300 bills that Kennedy and his staff authored were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government emphasizing economic and social justice, but was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises between senators with disparate views. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including laws addressing immigration, cancer research, health insurance, apartheid, disability discrimination, AIDS care, civil rights, mental health benefits, children's health insurance, education and volunteering. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful immigration reform efforts. Over the course of his Senate career and continuing into the Obama administration, Kennedy continued his efforts to enact universal health care, which he called the "cause of my life."
In 2008, Kennedy was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died the following August at his Hyannis Port, Massachusetts home. By the later years of his life, he had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for American progressivism.

==Early life==

Ted was born in St. Margaret's Hospital on February 22, 1932 in the Dorchester section of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald, who were members of prominent Irish-American families in Boston,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/15/chapter_1_teddy/ | title=Chapter 1: Teddy: A childhood of privilege, promise, and pain | author=English, Bella | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 15, 2009 | accessdate=February 24, 2009[/tpl] and who constituted one of the wealthiest families in the nation. His elder siblings included Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver. John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy (he'd been born on the first president's 200th birthday); instead, they named him after Joseph Sr.'s assistant.[tpl]cite news| title=Kennedy dead at 77 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/08/26/kennedy_dead_at_77/ | last=Nolan| first=Martin F.| authorlink=Martin Nolan| newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=August 26, 2009 | accessdate=August 26, 2009[/tpl]
Frequently uprooted as a child as his family moved among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London,Clymer, A Biography, pp. 13, 16–17. Kennedy attended ten different schools by the age of eleven. At age seven, he received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican.Clymer, A Biography, p. 11. He spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School, both in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers. Between the ages of eight and sixteen he suffered the traumas of his sister Rosemary Kennedy's failed lobotomy and the deaths of his eldest brother Joe Jr. in World War II and sister Kathleen in an airplane crash. An early political and personal influence was his affable maternal grandfather, John Francis "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald, a former mayor of Boston and U.S. Representative. Kennedy spent his four high school years at Milton Academy prep school, where his grades were ordinary and he did well at football. He also played on the tennis and hockey teams and was in the drama, debate, and glee clubs. He graduated from there in 1950.[tpl]cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000105 | title=Kennedy, Edward Moore (Ted), (1932 – ) | publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate=February 24, 2009[/tpl]

==College, military service, and law school==

Like his father and brothers before him, Ted attended Harvard College, and in his spring semester was assigned to the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived.McGinnis, The Last Brother, p. 194. He was as an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his friends arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class.Leamer, The Kennedy Men, p. 318. At the end of his second semester, in May 1951, and anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, he had a friend take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating, but in a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission within a year or two, after demonstrating good behavior.
Kennedy enlisted in the United States Army in June 1951 (signing up for an optional four-year term, which was shortened to the minimum two years after his father intervened).Clymer, A Biography, pp. 18–19. Following basic training at Fort Dix, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped after a few weeks without explanation. He went to Camp Gordon for training in the Military Police Corps.  In June 1952, Kennedy was assigned to the honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris. His father's political connections ensured he was not deployed to the ongoing Korean War.McGinnis, The Last Brother, p. 198.  While stationed in Europe he travelled extensively on weekends and climbed the Matterhorn. He was discharged in March 1953 as a private first class.
Kennedy re-entered Harvard in summer 1953 and improved his study habits. He joined The Owl final club in 1954;[tpl]cite news | title=Kennedy Ends His Final Club Ties | newspaper=The Harvard Crimson | date=January 17, 2006[/tpl] he was also chosen for the Hasty Pudding Club and the Pi Eta fraternity.McGinnis, The Last Brother, p. 201. On athletic probation during his sophomore year, Kennedy returned as a second-string two-way end for Harvard Crimson football during his junior year and barely missed earning his varsity letter.Clymer, A Biography, pp. 20–21. Nevertheless, he received a recruiting feeler from Green Bay Packers head coach Lisle Blackbourn, asking about his interest in playing professionally.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8406670.html | title=Sen. Kennedy's brush with football fame | author=Black, Chris | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=February 1, 1997[/tpl] Kennedy demurred, saying he had plans to attend law school and to "go into another contact sport, politics."[tpl]cite web |title=About Senator Kennedy: Senator Kennedy's Bio |url=http://kennedy.senate.gov/senator/index.cfm |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=May 23, 2008[/tpl] Kennedy became a starting end on the Harvard Crimson football team in his senior year, working hard to improve his blocking and tackling to complement his 6-foot 2-inch, 200-pound size. In the 1955 Harvard-Yale game, which Yale won 21–7, Kennedy caught Harvard's only touchdown pass. He graduated from Harvard in 1956
