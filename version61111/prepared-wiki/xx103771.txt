DeRogatis first joined the Chicago Sun-Times in 1992; he left in 1995 to join Rolling Stone magazine, a job that lasted eight months, and was back at the Sun-Times in three years.[tpl]cite web| title= Sun-Times rock critic leaving for blog, teaching| url= http://theenvelope.latimes.com/ct-biz-0421-phil--20100421,0,5395226.column| publisher=via the Los Angeles Times | work=From the Chicago Tribune | author=Phil Rosenthal | date=April 21, 2010 | accessdate= 2010-05-23[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  While at Rolling Stone magazine, he was fired after writing a negative review of Hootie & the Blowfish's album Fairweather Johnson. The review irked Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner who had it pulled from publication.  DeRogatis's employment with the magazine was terminated after he revealed this incident to the public.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.citypages.com/1996-06-19/music/a-good-blowfish-is-hard-to-find/ | title=A Good Blowfish is Hard to Find |  date=June 19, 1996 | publisher=City Pages |work= American Blandstand (review rejected by Rolling Stone) |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl]

The radio talk show is heard on Chicago Public Radio and nationally syndicated by American Public Media and is available as a podcast. The program is one of the longest running talk radio shows focusing exclusively on rock music with stints on both Chicago's WXRT and an early incarnation on Q101 featuring Bill Wyman from the Chicago Reader in place of Greg Kot.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] The move to Chicago Public Radio took place on December 3, 2005. 
DeRogatis plays drums in the indie rock band Vortis. He previously played in the bands the Ex-Lion Tamers (Wire cover band), Airlines and Speed the Plough. Vortis has released two albums and a third is due to be released soon.

==Ryan Adams==

DeRogatis gained more notoriety after Ryan Adams left an angry message on his answering machine.Conversation With Jim DeRogatis' Answering Machine - An answering machine message from Ryan Adams from the Internet Archive  It was in response to a scathing review DeRogatis gave of an Adams show, and in particular the critic's dismissive comparison of the singer-songwriter's talents with those of Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy.

==R. Kelly trial==

DeRogatis was named as a witness in the 2008 child pornography trial of musician R. Kelly. As a Chicago Sun-Times music critic, he received a videotape in 2002, allegedly featuring R Kelly and a 14-year-old girl. He turned the tape over to police.
The defense lawyers have charged that DeRogatis should be charged with child pornography for allegedly making a copy of the tape and showing it to another person after turning the original over to police.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-rkelly_24may24,0,879823.story | title=R.

After initially failing to appear for the trial, DeRogatis was ordered by Judge Vincent Gaughan on May 30, 2008 to report to the trial the following day.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/kelly/986220,CST-NWS-rkelly04.article | title=DeRogatis must testify| publisher=Chicago Sun-Times | date=June 4, 2008 | author=Eric Herman | coauthor=Kim Janssen |accessdate=2010-05-23[/tpl] However, upon questioning by Judge Gaughan outside of the presence of the jury, DeRogatis refused to provide substantive answers, citing his First and Fifth Amendment rights as the basis for his refusal.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/06/04/rkelly.trial/ | publisher=CNN | title=Reporter refuses to testify at R. Kelly trial | date=June 4, 2008 | accessdate=May 6, 2010[/tpl]   Judge Gaughan disagrees that as a journalist DeRogatis had a First Amendment basis for refusing to testify, but excused DeRogatis from taking the stand in front of the jury based upon his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.
