The effects of clouds are  a significant area of uncertainty in climate models. Clouds have competing effects on the climate. One of the roles that clouds play in climate is in cooling the surface by reflecting sunlight back into space; another is warming by increasing the amount of infrared radiation emitted from the atmosphere to the surface.Nasa Liftoff to Space Exploration Website: Greenhouse Effect. Archive.com. Recovered 1 Oct 2012.  In the 2001 IPCC report on climate change, the possible changes in cloud cover were highlighted as one of the dominant uncertainties in predicting future climate change;[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]  see also[ref]

Thousands of climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system. There are thousands of papers published about model-based studies in peer-reviewed journals – and a part of this research is work improving the models. Improvement has been difficult but steady (most obviously, state of the art AOGCMs no longer require flux correction), and progress has sometimes led to discovering new uncertainties.
In 2000, a comparison between measurements and dozens of GCM simulations of ENSO-driven tropical precipitation, water vapor, temperature, and outgoing longwave radiation found similarity between measurements and simulation of most factors. However the simulated change in precipitation was about one-fourth less than what was observed. Errors in simulated precipitation imply errors in other processes, such as errors in the evaporation rate that provides moisture to create precipitation.  The other possibility is that the satellite-based measurements are in error. Either indicates progress is required in order to monitor and predict such changes.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl]
A more complete discussion of climate models is provided in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report.[ref]McAvaney et al., Chapter 8: Model Evaluation,[tpl]Page needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] in

The precise magnitude of future changes in climate is still uncertain;[ref]Cubasch et al., Chapter 9: Projections of Future Climate Change, Executive Summary, in 
 (pb: [tpl]ISBNT|0-521-01495-6[/tpl]).[/ref] for the end of the 21st century (2071 to 2100), for SRES scenario A2, the change of global average SAT change from AOGCMs compared with 1961 to 1990 is +3.0 °C (4.8 °F) and the range is +1.3 to +4.5 °C (+2 to +7.2 °F).
In the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, it was stated that there was "...very high confidence that models reproduce the 
general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period." However, the report also observed that the rate of warming over the period 1998-2012 was lower than that predicted by 111 out of 114 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project climate models.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf | title=Evaluation of Climate Models | publisher=IPCC | date=2013 | accessdate=22 February 2014 | author=Flato, Gregory | pages=768-769[/tpl]

==Relation to weather forecasting==

The global climate models used for climate projections are very similar in structure to (and often share computer code with) numerical models for weather prediction but are nonetheless logically distinct.
Most weather forecasting is done on the basis of interpreting the output of numerical model results. Since forecasts are short—typically a few days or a week—such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed SSTs. They also require accurate initial conditions to begin the forecast—typically these are taken from the output of a previous forecast, with observations blended in. Because the results are needed quickly the predictions must be run in a few hours; but because they only need to cover a week of real time these predictions can be run at higher resolution than in climate mode. Currently the ECMWF runs at [tpl]convert|40|km|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] resolution[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] as opposed to the [tpl]convert|100|to|200|km|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] scale used by typical climate models. Often nested models are run forced by the global models for boundary conditions, to achieve higher local resolution: for example, the Met Office runs a mesoscale model with an [tpl]convert|11|km|abbr=on|adj=on[/tpl] resolution[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] covering the UK, and various agencies in the U.S. also run nested models such as the NGM and NAM models. Like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the GFS, global climate models are often spectral models[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/nwp_gcm.html |title=What are general circulation models (GCM)? |publisher=Das.uwyo.edu |accessdate=2012-02-18[/tpl] instead of grid models. Spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster thus reducing the time needed to run the model simulation.

==Computations involved==

Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future climate.
All climate models take account of incoming energy as short wave electromagnetic radiation, chiefly visible and short-wave (near) infrared, as well as outgoing energy as long wave (far) infrared electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in temperature.
The most talked-about models of recent years have been those relating temperature to emissions of carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas). These models project an upward trend in the surface temperature record, as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher altitudes.[ref]Meehl et al., Climate Change 2007 Chapter 10: Global Climate Projections,[tpl]Page needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] in 
 (pb: [tpl]ISBNT|978-0-521-70596-7[/tpl])

Three (or more properly, four since time is also considered) dimensional GCM's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time. They also contain parametrisations for processes—such as convection—that occur on scales too small to be resolved directly.
Atmospheric GCMs (AGCMs) model the atmosphere and impose sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions. Coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs (AOGCMs, e.g. HadCM3, EdGCM, GFDL CM2.X, ARPEGE-ClimatARPEGE-Climat homepage, Version 5.1, 3 Sep 2009. Retrieved 1 Oct 2012. ARPEGE-Climat homepage, 6 Aug 2009. Retrieved 1 Oct 2012.) combine the two models.
Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
This is not a full list; for example "box models" can be written to treat flows across and within ocean basins.  Furthermore, other types of modelling can be interlinked, such as land use, allowing researchers to predict the interaction between climate and ecosystems.

==Other climate models==

===Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs)===

Depending on the nature of questions asked and the pertinent time scales, there are, on the one extreme,  conceptual, more inductive models, and, on the other extreme, general circulation models operating at the highest spatial and temporal resolution currently feasible. Models of intermediate complexity bridge the gap. One example is the Climber-3 model. Its atmosphere is a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of 1/2 a day;  the ocean is MOM-3 (Modular Ocean Model) with a 3.75° × 3.75° grid and 24 vertical levels.

===Radiative-convective models (RCM)===

One-dimensional, radiative-convective models were used to verify basic climate assumptions in the '80s and '90s.[ref]

==Climate modellers==

A climate modeller is a person who designs, develops, implements, tests, maintains or exploits climate models.  There are three major types of institutions where a climate modeller may be found:
