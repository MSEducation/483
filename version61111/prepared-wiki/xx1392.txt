The Celts ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|s[/tpl], occasionally [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|t|s[/tpl], see pronunciation of Celtic) or Kelts were an ethnolinguistic group of tribal societies in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had a similar culture,[tpl]cite book | last = Koch | first = John | authorlink =John T.

The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe, which flourished from around 1200 BC.[tpl]cite book|last1=Chadwick |last2= Corcoran|first1=Nora |first2= J.

The earliest undisputed direct examples of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions, beginning in the 6th century BC.[tpl]cite book|last=Stifter|first=David|title=Old Celtic Languages|year=2008|pages=24–37|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/indogermanistik/download/Stifter/oldcelt2008_2_lepontic.pdf[/tpl] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic is attested beginning around the 4th century AD through Ogham inscriptions, although it was clearly being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century. Coherent texts of Early Irish literature, such as the Táin Bó Cúailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), survive in 12th-century recensions.
By the mid 1st millennium AD, with the expansion of the Roman Empire and the Great Migrations (Migration Period) of Germanic peoples, Celtic culture and Insular Celtic had become restricted to Ireland, the western and northern parts of Great Britain (Wales, Scotland, and Cornwall), the Isle of Man, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious, and artistic heritage that distinguished them from the culture of the surrounding polities.[tpl]cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Cunliffe|title=The Celts – a very short introduction|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280418-9|page=109[/tpl] By the 6th century, however, the Continental Celtic languages were no longer in wide use.
Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scottish and Manx) and the Brythonic Celts (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods. A modern "Celtic identity" was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Great Britain, Ireland, and other European territories, such as Portugal and Spanish Galicia.[tpl]cite journal|last=McKevitt|first=Kerry Ann|title=Mythologizing Identity and History: a look at the Celtic past of Galicia|journal=E-Keltoi|year=2006|month=1|volume=6|pages=651–673|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_13/mckevitt_6_13.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2011[/tpl] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their historical territories, and Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival.

==Names and terminology==

The first recorded use of the name of Celts – as [tpl]lang|grc|Κελτοί[/tpl] – to refer to an ethnic group was by Hecataeus of Miletus, the Greek geographer, in 517 BC,Sarunas Milisauskas, [tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=31LFIITb3LUC&pg=PA363&dq=Hecataeus+of+Miletus+celt&q=Hecataeus%20of%20Miletus%20celt |title=European prehistory: a survey|page =363 |publisher=Springer, 2002 ISBN 0-306-47257-0 |accessdate=2010-06-07 |isbn=978-0-306-47257-2 |year=2002 [/tpl] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille).H.

Celti or Celtae) and the Greek [tpl]lang|grc|Κέλτης[/tpl] (pl. [tpl]lang|grc|Κέλται[/tpl]) or [tpl]lang|grc|Κελτός[/tpl] (pl. [tpl]lang|grc|Κελτοί[/tpl]) were borrowed from a native Celtic tribal name.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 1.1: “All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae live, another in which the Aquitani live, and the third are those who in their own tongue are called Celtae, in our language Galli.”Strabo, Geography, Book 4. Pliny the Elder cited its use in Lusitania as a tribal surname,Pliny the Elder, The Natural History 21: “the Mirobrigenses, surnamed  Celtici” (“Mirobrigenses qui Celtici cognominantur”). which epigraphic findings have confirmed.http://revistas.ucm.es/est/11326875/articulos/HIEP0101110006A.PDFFernando DE ALMEIDA, Breve noticia sobre o santuário campestre romano de Miróbriga dos Celticos (Portugal) :D(IS) M(ANIBUS) S(ACRUM) / C(AIUS) PORCIUS SEVE/RUS MIROBRIGEN(SIS) / CELT(ICUS) ANN(ORUM) LX / H(IC) S(ITUS) E(ST) S(IT) T(IBI) T(ERRA) L(EVIS)
Latin Gallus (pl. Galli) might also stem from a Celtic ethnic or tribal name originally, perhaps one borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansions into Italy during the early 5th century BC. Its root may be the Common Celtic *galno, meaning “power, strength”, hence Old Irish gal “boldness, ferocity” and Welsh gallu “to be able, power”. The tribal names of Gallaeci and the Greek Γαλάται (Galatai, latinized Galatae; see the region Galatia in Anatolia) most probably go with the same origin.[tpl]cite book|last=Koch|first=John Thomas|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-85109-440-7|pages=794–795[/tpl] The suffix -atai might be an Ancient Greek inflection.[tpl]cite book|last=Spencer and Zwicky|first=Andrew and Arnold M|title=The handbook of morphology|year=1998|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=0-631-18544-5|page=148[/tpl]
Celt is a modern English word, first attested in 1707, in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.(Lhuyd, p. 290) Lhuyd, E. Archaeologia Britannica; An account of the languages, histories, and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain. (reprint ed.) Irish University Press, 1971. ISBN 0-7165-0031-0  The English form Gaul (first recorded in the 17th century) and Gaulish come from the French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, "Land of foreigners or Romans" (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, “foreigner”', or “Celt”, whence the English word Welsh (Anglo-Saxon wælisċ Celtic refers to a family of languages and, more generally, means “of the Celts” or “in the style of the Celts”. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic in nature, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[tpl]cite book|last=Kruta et al|first=Venceslas et al|title=The Celts|year=1991|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=95–102[/tpl] (See Celtic (disambiguation) for other applications of the term.) The relatively modern  idea of an identifiable Celtic cultural identity or "Celticity" generally focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,Paul Graves-Brown, Siân Jones, Clive Gamble, [tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=9BsG0pXp61sC&pg=PA242&dq=%22Celticity%22&q=%22Celticity%22 |title=Cultural identity and archaeology: the construction of European communities, pp 242–244 |publisher=Routledge, 1996 ISBN 0-415-10676-1 |accessdate=2010-06-07 |isbn=978-0-415-10676-4 |year=1996 [/tpl] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.Carl McColman, [tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=71oefF7-73MC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=%22Celticity%22&q=%22Celticity%22 |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom, pp 31–34 |publisher=Alpha Books, 2003, ISBN 0-02-864417-4 |accessdate=2010-06-07 |isbn=978-0-02-864417-2 |date=6 May 2003 [/tpl] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common racial origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and language heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been widely diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they have in common.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
Today, the term Celtic generally refers to the languages and respective cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany, also known as the Celtic nations. These are the regions where four Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent as mother tongues. The four are Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (one of the Brythonic languages) and Manx (one of the Goidelic languages). There are also attempts to reconstruct the Cumbric language (a Brythonic language from North West England and South West Scotland). Celtic regions of Continental Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language has survived; these areas include the western Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Portugal, and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[tpl]cite book|last=Monaghan|first=Patricia|title=The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore|year=2008|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=978-0-8160-7556-0[/tpl] (See also: Modern Celts.)
Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking peoples of the British and Irish islands and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating insular Celts, mainly from Wales and Cornwall, and so are grouped accordingly.[tpl]cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Nora|title=The Celts with an introductory chapter by J.X.W.P.Corcoran|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|page=81[/tpl]
