Wade International Airport, located at the former U.S. Naval Air Station. A causeway links Hamilton Parish, Bermuda to St. George's and the airport.
As in the United Kingdom, traffic drives on the left, meaning that visitors from countries with right-hand traffic must take special care on Bermuda's roads.

==Public transport==

The Ministry of Tourism and Transport of Bermuda manages the public ferry service, "SeaExpress", and the public bus system.

===Bus service===

Bermuda is serviced by a bus system. From the main terminal in Hamilton eleven bus lines spread out in all directions of the island. As the island is relatively narrow and in most sections has a northern and southern route that are serviced, access to the system is usually within a short distance. The MAN busses display a pink and blue livery and stop at pink or blue markers. Visitors can obtain multiday passes that allow usage of bus and ferries.

===Ferry service===

SeaExpress operates four routes for ferries and boats that originate from the ferry terminal in Hamilton. The "Blue Route" services the West End and the Dockyard of Sandys, the "Orange Route" links to the Dockyard and St. George's, the "Green Route" travels to Rockaway of Southampton, and the "Pink Route" brings passengers to points in Paget and Warwick. Fare for travelling by ferry is inexpensive, and allow travel for frequent travel at most hours. In 2003, high-speed catamaran ferry service was introduced.

==Private cars and taxis==

Cars were not allowed in Bermuda until 1946. Today Bermuda has a large number of private cars, almost one for every two inhabitants; however, only residents are allowed to drive them. This is largely because, with close to 300,000 visitors a year, allowing car rental on one of the world's most densely populated islands would quickly bring traffic to a standstill, as well as bankrupt the island's taxi industry. Car prices are much higher than in the United States, Canada, and Europe, due to heavy import duties, and residents are also limited to one car per household. The size of cars is also restricted (due to the narrow and winding roads on Bermuda), meaning that many models popular in the United States, Canada, and Europe are not available in Bermuda. Only the Governor and Premier are exempt from these restrictions.
There is no car hire (car rental); visitors may only rent low-power motor scooters; they may also use the extensive public bus system, or take taxis. The highest speed limit anywhere on the island is 35 km/h (approximately 20 mph), and it is lower in built-up and other congested areas.

==Railways==

The Bermuda Railway provided rail passenger and freight service from St. George's to Somerset in Sandys Parish, via Hamilton, beginning in 1931, but it was replaced by bus service and dismantled in 1948. Much of the old railway right-of-way has been converted to the "Bermuda Railway Trail" for hiking and biking.
