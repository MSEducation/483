==History==

The creation of atomic weapons arose out of political and scientific developments of the late 1930s. The rise of fascist governments in Europe, new discoveries about the nature of atoms and the fear that Nazi Germany was working on developing atomic bombs converged in the plans of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada to develop powerful weapons using nuclear fission as their primary source of energy.
In 1939 a letter was sent by prominent physicists Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning of the possibility that Nazi Germany might be attempting to build an atomic bomb.AIP.orgAtomicarchive.com In 1942, Roosevelt authorized the Manhattan Project, as the American nuclear physics effort was called, to research and develop a nuclear device. Although Nazi Germany was defeated in May 1945, the Manhattan Project was not disbanded, and culminated in the test explosion of a nuclear device at what is now called the Trinity Site on July 16, 1945, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a few weeks later.

===The Manhattan Project===

U.S. and British researchers were investigating the feasibility of nuclear weapons as early as 1939. Practical development began in earnest in 1942 when these efforts were transferred to the authority of the U.S. Army and became the Manhattan Project. The weapons-development portion of this project was located at the Los Alamos Laboratory in northern New Mexico, though much other development and production work was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee (the separation of uranium-235); the Hanford Engineer Works near Hanford, Washington (the production and separation of plutonium-239); in and near Chicago, Illinois (at the University of Chicago and the Argonne National Laboratories); and at the University of California, Berkeley.
These research, development, and production efforts focused both on the development of the necessary fissile materials to power the nuclear chain reactions in the atomic bombs and on the design, testing, and manufacture of the bombs themselves.Hans Bethe (1991), The Road from Los Alamos. American Institute of Physics ISBN 0-671-74012-1
From January 1944 until July 1945, large-scale production plants were set in operation, and the fissile material thus produced was then used to determine the features of the weapons. Multi-pronged research was undertaken to pursue several possibilities for bomb design. Early decisions about weapon design had been based on minute quantities of uranium-235 and plutonium that had been created in pilot plants and in physics-laboratory cyclotrons. From these experimental results, it was thought that the creation of a bomb was as simple as forming a critical mass of fissile material.[tpl]cite web|title= The Manhattan Project / Making the Atomic Bomb|publisher=United States Department of Energy|year=1999|url=http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/pdf/DE99001330/DE99001330.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-24[/tpl]
The production of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings given the technology of the 1940s and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project.The Costs of the Manhattan Project, Brookings Institution (accessed 10 August 2010) Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques in physics (e.g., modifying particle accelerator technology), though it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly.
Plutonium, by contrast, could theoretically be produced most easily in nuclear reactors, but the technology and science involved was wholly new. The first experimental nuclear reactor had been developed and constructed by Enrico Fermi and his team of co-workers by the end of 1942 at the University of Chicago (Chicago Pile-1), which proved that there were no obvious physical limitations to producing a slow-neutron nuclear chain reaction. Work began on constructing large plutonium-breeding reactors at Hanford, Washington, in October 1943. The first reactor-bred plutonium was produced in the B-Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium-production reactor in the world. The first large batch of plutonium was refined at Hanford in the "221-T plant", using the bismuth phosphate process, from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945. This was delivered to Oppenheimer's team at the Los Alamos laboratory on February 5, 1945. In the meantime, the X-10 Graphite Reactor, a scaled-down version of the Hanford reactors, was built in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and went into operation in November 1943.
Plutonium is a synthetic element not found in nature in appreciable quantities. It also has relatively complicated physics, chemistry, and metallurgy compared to most other elements. The only prior plutonium isolated for the project had been produced in cyclotrons in very minute amounts. In April 1944, Emilio Segrè received the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from the X-10 reactor and discovered that it was not as pure as cyclotron-produced plutonium by a significant degree. Specifically, the longer the plutonium remained irradiated inside the reactor—which is necessary for high yields of the metal—the greater its content of the isotope plutonium-240. Pu-240 undergoes spontaneous fission at an appreciable rate, and that releases excess neutrons. These extra neutrons implied a high probability that a gun-type bomb with plutonium would detonate too early, before a critical mass was formed, scattering the plutonium and producing a small "fizzle" of a nuclear explosion many times smaller than a full explosion. The practical result was that a simple gun-type atomic bomb (the proposed Thin Man) would not work as had been hoped.
The impossibility of solving this problem of a gun-type bomb with plutonium was decided upon in a meeting in Los Alamos on June 17, 1944.Manhattan Project Chronology at AtomicArchive.com This forced a search for a different, more practical design for a plutonium-fueled bomb, and an implosion-type atomic-bomb design (i.e., the Fat Man design) was selected as the most practical one at that time. This required a great deal of research work and experimentation in engineering and hydrodynamics before a practical design could be worked out.
In an implosion bomb, a small spherical core of plutonium would be surrounded by high explosives that burned with different speeds. By alternating the faster and slower burning explosives in a carefully calculated spherical configuration, they would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This "lensing" effect focused the explosive force inward with enough force to compress the plutonium core to several times its original density. This would rapidly reduce the necessary size of the critical mass of the material, making it supercritical. It would also activate a small neutron source at the center of the core, which would assure that the chain reaction began in earnest.
The advantage of the implosion method was that it was far more efficient in use of material—only 6.2 kg of plutonium would be needed for a full explosion, compared to the 64 kg of enriched uranium used in the "Little Boy" weapon. The engineering difficulties, though, were daunting. Though explosive lenses had been pursued during the war, the art was still very new, and the tolerances required in terms of timing and symmetry were unprecedented. Should the timing or symmetry be off, the bomb would not detonate fully, and instead just disperse the plutonium into the surrounding area. The entire Los Alamos laboratory was reorganized in 1944 to focus on designing a workable implosion bomb.
Scientists were confident that an implosion device would work, but these new design difficulties were great. It was decided that a full-sized test would be required before any military use, even though it would sacrifice one of a very small number of bombs. In early 1945, plans for a July 1945 test were finalized. The uranium weapon would not be tested; its success could be more or less guaranteed by measurements ahead of time. The date of the Trinity test, Monday July 16, was established in the belief that a successful test would enhance the position of President Truman, who was scheduled to meet with Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin in Potsdam, Germany on Tuesday July 17.
The actual Fat Man atomic  bomb, which used the same design as in the Trinity test, was exploded over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, after the Trinity test had proven its operability in an atomic explosion. A third Fat Man bomb was expected to be ready by mid-August, if needed.

==[tpl]Visible anchor|The gadget[/tpl]==

"The gadget" was the code name given to the first bomb tested.[tpl]Cite news |first=Kathryn |last=Westcott |title=The day the world lit up |work=BBC News |date=15 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4641861.stm[/tpl] It was so called because it was not a deployable weapon and because revealing words like bomb were not used during the project for fear of espionage. It was an implosion-type plutonium device, similar in design to the Fat Man bomb used three weeks later in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Japan.
In the Fat Man design, a subcritical sphere of plutonium was placed in the center of a hollow sphere of high explosives. Numerous exploding-bridgewire detonators located on the surface of the high explosive were fired simultaneously to produce a powerful inward pressure on the core, squeezing it and increasing its density, resulting in a supercritical condition and a nuclear explosion. The actual eventual
Fat Man and the "gadget" devices were not strictly "Fat Man type", as the design was modified into a production design, and both were strictly one-off prototypes.
The gadget was tested at Trinity Site, New Mexico, near Alamogordo. For the test, the gadget was lifted to the top of a [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] bomb tower. It was feared by some that the Trinity test might "ignite" the earth's atmosphere, eliminating all life on the planet, although calculations had determined this was unlikely even for devices "which greatly exceed the bombs now under consideration".[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2589247 |title=Mathematics on a Distant Planet |author=Richard Hamming |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=105 |number=7 |pages=640–650 |year=1998 |doi=10.2307/2589247[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00329010.pdf |title=Report LA-602, "Ignition of the Atmosphere With Nuclear Bombs" |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-29[/tpl] Less wild estimates thought that New Mexico would be incinerated. Calculations showed that the yield of the device would be between 0 (if it did not work) and [tpl]convert|20|ktonTNT[/tpl]. In the aftermath of the test, it appeared to have been a blast equivalent to [tpl]convert|18|ktonTNT[/tpl].

==Test planning==

In March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard University, working under explosives expert George Kistiakowsky.  A site had to be located that would guarantee secrecy of the project's goals even as a nuclear weapon of unknown strength was detonated. Proper scientific equipment had to be assembled for retrieving data from the test itself, and safety guidelines had to be developed to protect personnel from the unknown results of a highly dangerous experiment. Official test photographer Berlyn Brixner set up dozens of cameras to capture the event on film.

===Test site===

The heads of the project considered eight candidate sites, including San Nicolas Island (California), Padre Island (Texas), San Luis Valley, El Malpais National Monument, and other parts of New Mexico.  A Mojave Desert Army base near Rice, California was considered the best location, but was opted against because General Leslie Groves, military head of the project, did not wish to have any dealings with the commander of the base, whom he disliked.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity1.html|title=Trinity Atomic Web Site|publisher=Walker, Gregory|accessdate=2010-08-20[/tpl]  The site finally chosen was at the northern end of the White Sands Proving Ground, in Socorro County between the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio, in the Jornada del Muerto in the southwestern United States ([tpl]Coord|33.6773|N|106.4754|W|region:US-NM_type:landmark_scale:60000|display=inline[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web |title=Trinity Site |work=White Sands Missile Range |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/trinst.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080601033016/http://www.wsmr.army.mil/pao/TrinitySite/trinst.htm |archivedate=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2007-07-16 |quote=GPS Coordinates for obelisk (exact GZ) = N33.40.636 W106.28.525[/tpl]
In late 1944, soldiers started arriving at Trinity Site to prepare for the test.  Sgt. Marvin Davis and his military police unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944.  This unit set up initial security checkpoints around the area, with plans to use horses for patrols.  The distances around the site proved too great, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation.
Throughout 1945, other personnel arrived at Trinity Site to help prepare for the bomb test.  As the soldiers at Trinity Site settled in, they became familiar with Socorro County.  They tried to use water out of the ranch wells, but found the water so alkaline they could not drink it.  They were forced to use U.S. Navy saltwater soap and hauled drinking water in from the firehouse in Socorro.
Three bunkers were set up to observe the test.Rhodes, p. 653. Oppenheimer and Brig. Gen. Thomas Farrell watched from the South bunker [tpl]convert|5.7|mi[/tpl] from the detonation, while Gen. Leslie Groves watched from the base camp [tpl]convert|10|mi[/tpl] away.Rhodes, p. 675.

===Name===

The exact origin of the name Trinity for the test is unknown, but it is often attributed to laboratory leader J. Robert Oppenheimer as a reference to the poetry of John Donne. In 1962, General Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, asking if he had chosen it because it was a name common to rivers and peaks in the West and would not attract attention, and elicited this reply:Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986), pp. 571–572.

===Test predictions===

The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test,Rhodes, pages 656.James Hershberg (1993), James B. Conant: Harvard to Hiroshima and the Making of the Nuclear Age. 948 pp. ISBN 0-394-57966-6 p. 233 with predictions ranging from zero (a complete dud) to [tpl]convert|45|ktonTNT[/tpl].  Physicist I. I. Rabi won the pool with a prediction of [tpl]convert|18|ktonTNT[/tpl].Rhodes, p. 677.
In addition Fermi personally offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet.Rhodes, p. 664. This last result had been previously calculated to be almost impossible,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2589247 |title=Mathematics on a Distant Planet |author=Richard Hamming[/tpl] although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety.  Rhodes speculates that Fermi may have been making a point about a "new force being loosed on the Earth", and how little really was known about it.  Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage of their knowledge about the scientific possibilities.

===Test preparation===

A pre-test calibration explosion of [tpl]convert|100|tonTNT[/tpl], spiked with [tpl]convert|1000|Ci|TBq|lk=on[/tpl] of fission products from the Hanford B Reactor, was detonated on a wooden platform [tpl]convert|800|yd[/tpl] to the south-east of Trinity ground zero ([tpl]coord|33.67123|-106.47229|display=inline[/tpl]) on May 7. The fireball of the conventional explosion was visible [tpl]convert|60|mi[/tpl] away.http://www.radiochemistry.org/history/manhattan/04_pdf/05.pdf The smaller explosion proved an invaluable experiment that helped scientists prepare instruments in time to study the atomic bomb explosion two months later.
For the actual test, the plutonium-core nuclear device, referred to as "the gadget," was hoisted to the top of a [tpl]convert|100|ft|adj=on[/tpl] steel tower for detonation—the height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from an airplane, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as it expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout.
General Groves had ordered the construction of a [tpl]convert|214|ST|adj=on[/tpl] steel canister code-named "Jumbo" to recover valuable plutonium if the [tpl]convert|5|ST[/tpl] of conventional explosives failed to compress it into a chain reaction. The container was constructed at great expense in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and brought to the test site by rail, but by the time it arrived, the confidence of the scientists was high enough that they decided not to use it. Instead, it was hoisted up in a steel tower [tpl]convert|800|yd[/tpl] from the gadget as[tpl]vague|in order to make?|date=May 2013[/tpl] a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end Jumbo survived, although its tower did not.[tpl]cite web | title=Moving "Jumbo" at the Trinity Test Site | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/archive/nucweapons/jumbo | accessdate=2013-02-07[/tpl]
The detonation was initially planned for 4:00 am but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be greatly increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about accidental detonation.[tpl]cite web| title = Countdown| work = Los Alamos: Beginning of an Era, 1943–1945| publisher = Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory| date = ca. 1967–1971| url = http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/publications/LANLBeginningofEraPart5.pdf | format = PDF | doi = | accessdate =2008-01-24 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Explosion==

At 04:45, a crucial weather report came in favorably, and, at 05:10, the twenty-minute countdown began. Most top-level scientists and military officers were observing from a base camp [tpl]convert|10|mi[/tpl] southwest of the test tower[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013[/tpl]. Many other observers were around [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations (physicist Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the dark glasses provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths).Richard Feynman (2000), The Pleasure of Finding Things Out p. 53–96 ISBN 0-7382-0349-1 The final countdown was read by physicist Samuel K. Allison.
At 05:29:21 (plus or minus 2 seconds)[tpl]cite journal|last=Guttenberg|first=B.|title=Interpretation of Records Obtained from the New Mexico Atomic Test, July 16, 1945|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|year=1946|volume=36|pages=327–330[/tpl] local time (Mountain War Time), the device exploded with an energy equivalent to around [tpl]convert|20|ktonTNT[/tpl]. It left a crater of radioactive glass in the desert [tpl]convert|10|ft[/tpl] deep and [tpl]convert|1100|ft[/tpl] wide. At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated "brighter than daytime" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as "being as hot as an oven" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination ranged from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers.  The shock wave was felt over [tpl]convert|100|mi[/tpl] away, and the mushroom cloud reached [tpl]convert|7.5|mi[/tpl] in height.

In the official report on the test, General Farrell wrote, "The lighting effects beggared description.  The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun.  It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue.  It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined..."
News reports quoted a forest ranger [tpl]convert|150|mi[/tpl] west of the site as saying he saw "a flash of fire followed by an explosion and black smoke." A New Mexican [tpl]convert|150|mi[/tpl] north said, "The explosion lighted up the sky like the sun."

The Alamogordo Air Base issued a 50-word press release in response to what it described as "several inquiries" that had been received concerning an explosion. The release explained that "a remotely located ammunitions magazine containing a considerable amount of high explosives and pyrotechnics exploded," but that "there was no loss of life or limb to anyone."

==Test results==

The results of the test were conveyed to President Harry S. Truman, who was eagerly awaiting them at the Potsdam Conference; the coded message ("Operated this morning.  Diagnosis not complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations ... Dr. Groves pleased.") arrived at 7:30 p.m. on July 16 and was at once taken to the president and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the "Little White House" in the Berlin suburb of Babelsberg by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.Gar Alperovitz, The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and the Architecture of an American Myth (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1995), p. 240.  Information about the Trinity test was made public shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima. The Smyth Report, released on August 12, 1945, gave some information on the blast, and the hardbound edition released by Princeton University Press a few weeks later contained the famous pictures of a "bulbous" Trinity fireball.
Oppenheimer and Groves posed for reporters near the remains of the mangled test tower shortly after the war. In the years after the test, the pictures have become a potent symbol of the beginning of the so-called Atomic Age, and the test has often been featured in popular culture.

==First deployment==

Following the success of the Trinity test, two bombs were prepared for use against Japan during World War II. The first, dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, was code-named "Little Boy", and used the "gun" design and uranium-235 as its fission source. It was an untested design but was considered very likely to work and was considerably simpler than the implosion model. It could not be tested, because there was only enough uranium-235 for one bomb. The second bomb, dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, was code-named "Fat Man" and was a plutonium bomb of the type tested at Trinity. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed at least 148,000  people and many more over time. By 1950, the death toll was over 340,000.From: Hughes, Jeff. The Manhattan Project: Big Science and The Atom Bomb. New York: Columbia University Press, 2002. (p.95) They were followed days later by the surrender of Japan. Debate over the justification of the use of nuclear weapons against Japan persists to this day, both in scholarly and popular circles.

==Civilian detection==

Shortly after the Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima on August 9, 1945, the Kodak Company observed some spotting/fogging on their film which was, at the time, usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J.H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that Little Boy was responsible due to the timing of the events. Fallout from the Trinity explosion had contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp, aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/hiroshimatrinity/kodakfilm.htm |title=Oak Ridge's Merril Eisenbud - Hiroshima, the Trinity Test, Nuclear Weapons. - discussing Webb, J.H., The Fogging of Photographic Film by Radioactive Contaminants in Cardboard Packaging Materials, Physical Review Vol. 76 (3):375-380, 1949.[/tpl]

==Fallout effects==

The heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was 30 miles from the detonation point, on Chupadera mesa where cattle grazed, the radioactivity here is reported to have settled in a white mist onto a number of the livestock in the area, resulting in local beta burns and a temporary loss of dorsal/back hair. Patches of hair grew back discolored as white fur. The army bought 75 cattle in all from ranchers; the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos, while the rest were shipped to Oak Ridge for long term observation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lahdra.org/reports/LAHDRA%20Report%20v5%202007_App%20N_Trinity%20Test.pdf |title=INTERIM REPORT OF CDC’S LAHDRA PROJECT – Appendix N. pg 17, 23, 37[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sDQrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248&dq=%22beta+burns%22&cd=5#v=onepage&q=%22beta%20burns%22&f=false |page=248|title=Mass burns: proceedings of a workshop, 13–14 March 1968|author=National Research Council (U.S.).
