==Formation of White Rats==

Golden was performing in London in 1899 when his wife became sick and he was unable to work. The Water Rats, a British entertainment charity, helped him with his expenses and with securing travel back to the United States. 
When the Vaudeville Managers Association (VMA) formed in 1900, and began demanding a 5% kickback from all performers in exchange for steady bookings, Golden called on his experience with the Water Rats to form the White Rats as a labor union for performers. The White Rats attempted to negotiate with the VMA, led by E.F. Albee and B.F. Keith, to reduce or remove the kickback. After negotiations failed, the White Rats called a strike in February 1901. Vaudeville performers all over the United States refused to work. Many claimed they were sick.Samuels, Charles & Louise. Once Upon A Stage: The Merry World of Vaudeville. (New York: Dodd, Mead & Company, 1974) 
The Western States branch of the VMA gave in to the union's demands, and the Eastern branch went without vaudeville for two weeks. Some theaters shut down completely, others booked replacement acts. Keith and Albee called a meeting with the White Rats in which they claimed they themselves had been against the 5% commission, and would ask the other members of the VMA to remove it. Albee and Keith also agreed to go on the record in the press as being against the 5% commission if the strike was called off, and they did so. As a result, the strike was called off, and performers began to sign contracts with the VMA again in order to secure valuable long-term performing contracts.Trav S.D.

Golden wrote a book about the White Rats, My Lady Vaudeville and her White Rats, which was published in 1909 by the Broadway Publishing Company.http://books.google.com/books?id=ljINAAAAYAAJ&dq=george+fuller+golden&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=CICZHc2ILp&sig=LR77tjEvpoM7eoL6vQ2nnA6i1XA&hl=en&ei=XdLdSpi9EISGMs_O5MIM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false
The White Rats received a charter from the American Federation of Labor in 1910.Smith, Bill. The Vaudevillians.
