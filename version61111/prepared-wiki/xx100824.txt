Approach to this island should be made with care and with the use of a nautical chart since there are many rocks and shoals in the immediate area. There is a small pebbly beach on the southern side. Special care should be taken when passing close aboard this island. Shoals extend approximately [tpl]convert|250|yd[/tpl] to the northeast (061 degrees true) from this island and approximately [tpl]convert|480|yd[/tpl] toward the south and southwest (246 degrees true). There are many rocks and ledges in these areas that are hidden at high water. A green and white daybeacon on a pile marks the southwestern point of these shoals.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
On a 1775, London chart, this island was labeled Hayman's Island and shows a greater area than presently exists. There is no historical evidence that this island was used as a location for hanging criminals. The source of its current name has a hazy history. In 1882, several fishermen built fishing shacks on Hangman Island and were reported to have cultivated a vegetable garden here among the rocks. As of 2006, there are no human inhabitants on Hangmans Island. It is being used as a bird sanctuary and landing on this island is discouraged. Local private fishermen fish for striped bass among the rocks located on and near this island during the summer season.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] The label Hangman's Island also appears on a 1733 Map Of the British Empire in America created by Henry Popple.
