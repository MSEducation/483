The [tpl]lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica[/tpl] (Latin for "British Encyclopaedia"), published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., is a general knowledge English-language encyclopaedia. It is written by about 100 full-time editors and more than 4,000 contributors, including 110 Nobel Prize winners and five American presidents. It is regarded as one of the most scholarly of English-language encyclopaedias.
The Britannica is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia still being produced. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes, and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes. Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and 11th editions (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and its acquisition by an American firm, the Britannica shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal in the North American market. In 1933, the Britannica became the first encyclopaedia to adopt "continuous revision", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted and every article updated on a schedule. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer continue to publish its printed editions, instead focusing on its online version, Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Its final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set.
The 15th and latest edition has a three-part structure: a 12-volume Micropædia of short articles (generally fewer than 750 words), a 19-volume Macropædia of long articles (two to 310 pages) and a single Propædia volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge. The Micropædia is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the Macropædia; readers are advised to study the Propædia outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. The size of the Britannica has remained roughly constant over 70 years, with about 40 million words on half a million topics. Although publication has been based in the United States since 1901, the Britannica has largely maintained British spelling.

==History==

Past owners have included the Scottish publisher A & C Black, Horace Everett Hooper, Sears Roebuck and William Benton. The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is Jacqui Safra, a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, Encarta and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias. To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the Britannica, reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on CD-ROM, DVD, and the World Wide Web. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopaedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14th[/tpl] Aside from providing an excellent summary of the Britannica's history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical Britannica edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. Elkan Harrison Powell identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.

===Editions===

The Britannica has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 5th editions (see the Table below). The 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organisation in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th.
Throughout history, the Britannica has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book and to provide educational material.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257–286[/tpl] In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematise all human knowledge.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| pages = 5–8[/tpl] The history of the Britannica can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management or re-organisation of the dictionary.

====1768–1826====

In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the Britannica was managed and published by its founders, Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, by Archibald Constable, and by others. The Britannica was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh as the Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by Chambers's Cyclopaedia (first edition 1728). The Britannica was primarily a Scottish enterprise; it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment.[tpl]cite book | last = Herman | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur L. Herman | year = 2002 | title = How the Scots Invented the Modern World | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 978-0-609-80999-0[/tpl] In this era, the Britannica moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—William Smellie[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Krapp |first=Philip |coauthors=Balou, Patricia K. |year=1992 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia |volume=9 |pages=135 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Company |location=New York |lccn=9161165[/tpl] The Britannica's 1st edition is described as "deplorably inaccurate and unscientific" in places.—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of Abraham Rees's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopaedia MetropolitanaOn editions of the Britannica through 1803 see Kafker and Loveland, eds, Early Britannica, and David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.

====1827–1901====

During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the Britannica was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm, A & C Black. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably Macvey Napier, others were attracted by the Britannica's reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974. The first English-born editor-in-chief was Thomas Spencer Baynes, who oversaw the production of the 9th edition; dubbed the "Scholar's Edition", the 9th is the most scholarly Britannica.[tpl]cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | lccn = 588379[/tpl] After 1880, Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith.[tpl]Cite SBDEL|Baynes, Thomas Spencer[/tpl] No biographies of living persons were included.[tpl]Cite EB9|wstitle=Editor's Advertisement|volume=1[/tpl] James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science.[tpl]Cite EB9|wstitle=Prefatory Notice[/tpl] However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated and the Britannica faced financial difficulties.

====1901–1973====

In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–73), the Britannica was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door-to-door sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, Horace Hooper, lavished enormous effort on its perfection. When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the Britannica was managed by Sears Roebuck for 18 years (1920–23, 1928–43). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, Elkan Harrison Powell, assumed presidency of the Britannica; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions. Powell developed new educational products that built upon the Britannica's reputation. In 1943 Sears, through its attorneys, Lederer, Livingston, Kahn & Adsit (now known as Arnstein & Lehr, LLP) made a gift of Encyclopædia Britannica to the University of Chicago.  William Benton, a vice president of the University provided the working capital for its operation.  The stock was divided between Benton and the University with the University holding an option on the stock.Chicago Tribune, February 22, 1945  William B. Benton, became Chairman of the Board and managed the Britannica until his death in 1973.Chicago Tribune, January 28, 1943 Benton set up the Benton Foundation, which managed the Britannica until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the Britannica celebrated its bicentennial.

====1974–1994====

In the fourth era (1974–94), the Britannica introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organised into three parts: the Micropædia, the Macropædia, and the Propædia. Under Mortimer J. Adler (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of Britannica from 1965),Mortimer J. Adler, A Guidebook to Learning: for the lifelong pursuit of wisdom. MacMillan Publishing Company, New York, 1986. p.88 the Britannica sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool but to systematise all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the Micro- and Macropædia) provoked a "firestorm of criticism" of the initial 15th edition.[ref][tpl]cite news | last = Baker | first = John F. | title = A New Britannica Is Born | work = Publishers Weekly | date = 14 January 1974 | pages = 64–65[/tpl]

This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the New Encyclopædia Britannica, although it has also been promoted as Britannica 3.

====1994–present====

In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online. In 1996, the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, Britannica.com Inc., developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, Ilan Yeshua, who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, Jorge Cauz, announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.[tpl]cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/13/technology/encyclopedia-britannica-books/|title=Encyclopedia Britannica to stop printing books|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|date=13 March 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 March 2012[/tpl]
Britannica Global Edition was printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller "compact" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain Macro- and Micropedia sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is Britannica's description of the work:The Britannica online store http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100

===Dedications===

The Britannica was dedicated to the reigning British monarch from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States. Thus, the 11th edition is "dedicated by Permission to His Majesty George the Fifth, King of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, and to William Howard Taft, President of the United States of America."[tpl]cite book | year = 1910 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 11th | page = 3[/tpl] The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is "Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, Dwight David Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the Second."[tpl]cite book | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 14th | page = 3[/tpl] Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was "dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, George W. Bush, and Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II,"[tpl]cite book | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 15th edition, Propædia | page = 3[/tpl] while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is "dedicated by permission to Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II."The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Propædia: Outline of Knowledge and Guide to the Britannica, 15th edition, 2010.

==Critical and popular assessments==

===Reputation===

Since the 3rd edition, the Britannica has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence.[tpl]cite book | last = Sader | first = Marian | coauthors = Lewis, Amy | year = 1995 | title = Encyclopedias, Atlases, and Dictionaries | publisher = R.

The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London, Gilbert Inglefield, at the bicentennial of the Britannica.
The Britannica has a reputation for summarising knowledge.[tpl]cite book| last = Thomas | first = Gillian | authorlink = Gillian Thomas | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = Scarecrow Press | isbn = 0-8108-2567-8[/tpl] To further their education, some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire Britannica, taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so. When Fat'h Ali became the Shah of Persia in 1797, he was given a set of the Britannica's 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include "Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclopædia Britannica".[tpl]cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the Encyclopædia Britannica and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chair and Publisher | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica International, Ltd. | location = United Kingdom[/tpl] Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete 9th edition—except for the science articles—and Richard Evelyn Byrd took the Britannica as reading material for his five-month stay at the South Pole in 1934, while Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, A.J. Jacobs, an editor at Esquire magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World. Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author C. S. Forester and Amos Urban Shirk, an American businessman, who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.[tpl]cite news | title = Reader |work=The New Yorker | volume = 9 | date = 3 March 1934 | page = 17[/tpl] Several editors-in-chief of the Britannica are likely to have read their editions completely, such as William Smellie (1st edition), William Robertson Smith (9th edition), and Walter Yust (14th edition).

===Awards===

The CD/DVD-ROM version of the Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite, received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm | title = 2004 Distinguished Achievement Awards Winners: Technology | date = 1 August 2003 | accessdate =11 April 2007 | publisher = Association of Educational Publishers|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017162810/http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm |archivedate = 17 October 2006[/tpl] On 15 July 2009, Encyclopædia Britannica was awarded a spot as one of "Top Ten Superbrands in the UK" by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8149460.stm | title = Top Ten Superbrands 2009–2010 | accessdate =15 July 2009 |publisher=BBC | date=14 July 2009[/tpl]

===Coverage of topics===

Topics are chosen in part by reference to the Propædia "Outline of Knowledge". The bulk of the Britannica is devoted to geography (26% of the Macropædia), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%). A complementary study of the Micropædia found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%. Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the "range, depth, and catholicity of coverage the Britannica are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia."[tpl]cite book | last = Lang | first = JP | year = 1992 | title = Reference Sources for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries | edition = 5th | publisher = American Library Association | location = Chicago | page = 34 | isbn = 0-8389-3406-4[/tpl]
The Britannica does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single Macropædia article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Macropædia[/tpl] However, the Britannica has been lauded as the least biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.

===Editorial choices===

The Britannica is occasionally criticised for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, military decorations, and the French poet Joachim du Bellay; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies. Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the Micropædia and Macropædia. Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a "qualified failure...that cares more for juggling its format than for preserving information."[tpl]cite journal | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | journal = Newsweek | date = 8 July 1974 | pages = 71–72[/tpl] More recently, reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 Macropædia, along with the article on psychology.
Britannica-appointed contributors are occasionally mistaken or unscientific. A notorious instance from the Britannica's early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig, the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire. However, the Britannica has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to emotional topics, as it did with William Robertson Smith's articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).
Wendy Doniger, who is on the editorial board of Britannica,[tpl]cite web|url=https://corporate.britannica.com/board/doniger.html |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 August 2012[/tpl] has been criticised for her negative portrayal of Hinduism.Ramaswamy, Krishnan ed.

===Criticism of Encyclopædia Britannica===

The Britannica has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the Britannica,According to Kister (1994), the initial 15th edition (1974) required over $32 million dollars to produce. and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years). For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his 1964 book, The Myth of the Britannica,[tpl]cite book | last = Einbinder | first = Harvey | authorlink = Harvey Einbinder | year = 1964 | title = The Myth of the Britannica | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-384-14050-9[/tpl] the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work. It is still difficult to keep the Britannica current; one recent critic writes, "it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision", noting that the longer Macropædia articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter Micropædia articles. Information in the Micropædia is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding Macropædia article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other. The bibliographies of the Macropædia articles have been criticised for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.
In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the Irish civil war was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/britannica-errors-spark-unholy-row-2045150.html |title=Britannica errors spark unholy row|work=Irish Independent |date= 3 February 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010 |first=Grainne |last=Cunningham[/tpl]Sheehy, Clodagh (4 February 2010). "Are they taking the Mick? It's the encyclopedia that thinks the Civil War was between the north and south". Evening Herald (Dublin).
Speaking of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), Britannica's chief editor George Gleig wrote that "perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects."[tpl]cite book|title=Supplement to the Encyclopædia or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Miscellaneous Literature|year=1803|pages=iv[/tpl] In March 2006, the Britannica wrote, "we in no way mean to imply that Britannica is error-free; we have never made such a claim." The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, William Smellie:
However, Jorge Cauz (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that "Britannica ... will always be factually correct."

==Present status==

===Print version===

Since 1985, the Britannica has had four parts: the Micropædia, the Macropædia, the Propædia, and a two-volume index. The Britannica's articles are found in the Micro- and Macropædia, which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 Macropædia has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 Micropædia has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors. The Micropædia articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the Macropædia. The Macropædia articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere. The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states.
Information can be found in the Britannica by following the cross-references in the Micropædia and Macropædia; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page. Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the Propædia, which organises the Britannica's contents by topic.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Index preface[/tpl]
The core of the Propædia is its "Outline of Knowledge", which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge. Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the Britannica's editors to decide which articles should be included in the Micro- and Macropædia. The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of Britannica articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth. However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia.[tpl]cite book | year = 1992 | title = Purchasing an Encyclopedia: 12 Points to Consider | edition = 4th | publisher = Booklist Publications, American Library Association | isbn = 0-8389-5754-4 | author = reviews by the Editorial Board of Reference Books Bulletin ; revised introduction by Sandy Whiteley.[/tpl] The Propædia also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.
Taken together, the Micropædia and Macropædia comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images. The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the Britannica, together with 474,675 subentries under those topics. The Britannica generally prefers British spelling over American; for example, it uses colour (not color), centre (not center), and encyclopaedia (not encyclopedia).

Since 1936, the articles of the Britannica have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year. According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html | title = Encyclopædia Britannica: School & Library Site, promotional materials for the 2007 Britannica | accessdate =11 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 | title = Australian Encyclopædia Britannica, promotional materials for the 2007 Britannica | accessdate =10 April 2007[/tpl]
The alphabetisation of articles in the Micropædia and Macropædia follows strict rules.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Micropædia preface[/tpl] Diacritical marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as "1812, War of" are alphabetised as if the number had been written out ("Eighteen-twelve, War of"). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organised first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England, listed in Britannica as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetised as if their titles were "Charles, France, 3" and "Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1".) Similarly, places that share names are organised alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.
In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2012/03/change/|title=Change: It's OK.

===Contributors===

The 2007 print version of the Britannica has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel Laureate economist Milton Friedman, astronomer Carl Sagan, and surgeon Michael DeBakey.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| pages = 531–674[/tpl] Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 (Alfred North Whitehead), while another quarter are retired or emeritus. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on particle physics.
While Britannica's authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Leon Trotsky, as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov, some have been criticised for lack of expertise:[tpl]cite journal | last = Burr | first = George L. | authorlink = George Lincoln Burr | year = 1911 | title = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 17 | pages = 103–109 | doi = 10.2307/1832843 | issue = 1 | publisher = American Historical Association | jstor = 1832843[/tpl]

Anita Wolff and Theodore Pappas serve as the current Deputy Editor and Executive Editor, respectively. Prior Executive Editors include John V. Dodge (1950–1964) and Philip W. Goetz.
The current editorial staff of the Britannica includes five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others. The editorial staff help to write the articles of the Micropædia and some sections of the Macropædia.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Biochemical Components of Organisms | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc | year = 2007 | volume = 14 | pages = 1007–1030[/tpl]
The preparation and publication of the Encyclopædia Britannica requires trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 Propædia, the staff are organised into ten departments:[tpl]cite book |year=2007 |title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=15th edition, Propædia[/tpl]
Some of these departments are organised hierarchically. For example, the copy editors are divided into 4 copy editors, 2 senior copy editors, 4 supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department is headed by Dale Hoiberg and assisted by four others; they oversee the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.

===Editorial advisors===

The Britannica has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| page = 5[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 June 2011[/tpl] non-fiction author Nicholas Carr, religion scholar Wendy Doniger, political economist Benjamin M.

The Propædia and its Outline of Knowledge were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of Mortimer J. Adler.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| pages = 524–530[/tpl] Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects: Rene Dubos (d. 1982), Loren Eiseley (d. 1977), Harold D. Lasswell (d. 1978), Mark Van Doren (d. 1972), Peter Ritchie Calder (d. 1982) and Mortimer J. Adler (d. 2001). The Propædia also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned Micropædia articles.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| pages = 675–744[/tpl]

===Corporate structure===

In January 1996, the Britannica was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra,[tpl]cite news | url = http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960104/britannica.shtml | title = Britannica sold by Benton Foundation | publisher = University of Chicago Chronicle | date = 4 January 1996[/tpl] who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[tpl]cite press release | url = http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html | title = Encyclopædia Britannica Announces Appointment Of Don Yannias As Chief Executive Officer | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 4 March 1997 | accessdate =15 March 2012|archivedate=9 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709103523/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html[/tpl] A new company, Britannica.com Inc. was spun off in 1999 to develop the digital versions of the Britannica; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while that of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, large lay-offs and financial losses.[tpl]cite journal | last = Abramson | first = Ronna | date = 9 April 2001 | title = Look Under "M" for Mess—Company Business and Marketing | journal = The Industry Standard | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 | accessdate =26 March 2007[/tpl] In 2001, Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua, who reunited the leadership of the two companies.[tpl]cite press release | title = Ilan Yeshua Named Britannica CEO. Veteran Executive to Consolidate Operations of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica.com | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 16 May 2001 | accessdate =[/tpl] Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the Britannica′s Board of Directors.
In 2003, former management consultant Jorge Aguilar-Cauz was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the Britannica's Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the Britannica brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid-1930s.[tpl]cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, Propædia| page = 2[/tpl]
Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the New York Post, the Britannica management has eliminated employee 401(k) accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the Britannica staff have gone years without pay rises.[tpl]cite news | title = Cash-shy Britannica | page = 6 |work=New York Post | date = 11 September 2003 | url = http://www.pagesix.com/story/cash-shy+britannica | accessdate =26 March 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Competition==

As the Britannica is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialised encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the Britannica's main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and, soon thereafter, Rees's Cyclopædia and Coleridge's Encyclopaedia Metropolitana. In the 20th century, successful competitors included Collier's Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Americana, and the World Book Encyclopedia. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia, especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors. The print version of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors.
Since the early 1990s, the Britannica has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title=Accessibility of information on the web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6740/abs/400107a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6740 |year=1999 |doi=10.1038/21987 |pmid=10428673|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..107L |pages=107–9 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title= Searching the Web: general and scientific information access | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=739314 |journal=Communications Magazine, IEEE |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=116–122 |year=1999 |doi=10.1109/35.739314[/tpl] In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.[tpl]cite web | title=Electronic publishing takes journals into a new realm |publisher=American Chemical Society | url=http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html |accessdate=11 April 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the Britannica has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust. Although the Britannica is now available both in multimedia form and over the Internet, its preeminence is being challenged by other online encyclopaedias, such as Wikipedia.

===Print encyclopaedias===

The Encyclopædia Britannica has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A well-known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the Britannica with two comparable encyclopaedias, Collier's Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Americana. For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the Britannica received one "D" and seven "A"s, Encyclopedia Americana received eight "A"s, and Collier's received one "D" and seven "A"s; thus, Britannica received an average score of 92% for accuracy to Americana[tpl]'[/tpl]s 95% and Collier's 92%. The 1994 Britannica was faulted for publishing an inflammatory story about Charles Drew that had long been discredited. In the timeliness category, Britannica averaged an 86% to Americana's 90% and Collier's 85%. After a more thorough qualitative comparison of all three encyclopaedias, Kister recommended Collier's Encyclopedia as the superior encyclopaedia, primarily on the strength of its writing, balanced presentation and easy navigation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Collier's has not been in print since 1998; the Encyclopedia Americana was last published in 2006[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] and Britannica announced the discontinuation of its print editions in 2012.

===Digital encyclopaedias on optical media===

The most notable competitor of the Britannica among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was Encarta, now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: Funk & Wagnalls, Collier's and the New Merit Scholar. Encarta was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Microsoft | title = Microsoft Encarta—Premium 2007: Overview | url = http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=002 | accessdate =6 April 2007[/tpl] Sales figures for January 2000 – February 2006 as provided by the NPD Group. Both occupied the same price range, with the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing US$50[tpl]cite web |url= http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&itemType=PRODUCT&iMainCat=4&iSubCat=14&iProductID=765&show=all|title= The Britannica Store| work = Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate =21 November 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessdate=21 November 2006[/tpl] The Britannica contains 100,000 articles and Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions. Encarta contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition. Like Encarta, the Britannica has been criticised for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 9 November 2006|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG[/tpl] Like the Britannica, Encarta was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed for free.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | url = http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html | title = Encarta's Encyclopedia Article Center | accessdate=11 April 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbm2bZC|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Internet encyclopaedias===

Online alternatives to the Britannica include Wikipedia, a freely available Web-based free-content encyclopaedia. A key difference between the two encyclopaedias lies in article authorship. The 699 Macropædia articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 Micropædia articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a Britannica article either has known authorship  or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the Britannica's contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates. By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people with varying levels of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials. Another difference is the pace of article change: the Britannica was published in print every few years, while many of Wikipedia's articles are frequently updated. Robert McHenry, paid by the Encyclopaedia, stated that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the Britannica in accuracy.[tpl]cite news | first=Robert | last=McHenry | title=The Faith-Based Encyclopedia | work=TCS Daily | date=15 November 2004 | url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=111504A[/tpl]
In 2005, the journal Nature chose articles from both websites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called "relevant" field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. Nature got back 42 usable reviews.
In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in Britannica, an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for Britannica.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/438900a[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|url=http://news.cnet.com/Study-Wikipedia-as-accurate-as-Britannica/2100-1038_3-5997332.html|work=Staff Writer, CNET News|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] In its detailed 20-page rebuttal, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. called Nature's study flawed and misleading and called for a "prompt" retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a Britannica yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from Compton's Encyclopedia (called the Britannica Student Encyclopedia on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalised for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what Nature called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. Nature defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica, it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica's website.
Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of Britannica UK said: [tpl]quote|Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there, but their approach wouldn't work for Encyclopædia Britannica. My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind. They're a chisel, we're a drill, and you need to have the correct tool for the job.[/tpl]
