[[Field trace]]

CATEGORIES: Field theory

In mathematics, the field trace is a particular function defined with respect to a finite field extension L/K, which is a K-linear map from L to K. 

==Definition==

Let K be a field and L a finite extension (and hence an algebraic extension) of K. L can be viewed as a vector space over K. Multiplication by α, an element of L,
is a K-linear transformation of this vector space into itself. The trace, TrL/K(α), is defined as the (linear algebra) trace of this linear transformation.[tpl]harvnb|Rotman|2002|loc=p. 940[/tpl]
For α in L, let σ[tpl]sub|1[/tpl](α), ..., σ[tpl]sub|n[/tpl](α) be the roots (counted with multiplicity) of the minimal polynomial of α over K  (in some extension field of L), then
If L/K is separable then each root appears only once and the coefficient above is one.[tpl]harvnb|Rotman|2002|loc=p. 941[/tpl]
More particularly, if L/K is a Galois extension and α is in L, then the trace of α is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of α, i.e.
where Gal(L/K) denotes the Galois group of L/K. 

==Example==

==Properties of the trace==

Several properties of the trace function hold for any finite extension.[tpl]harvnb|Roman|1995|loc=p. 151 (1st ed.)[/tpl]
The trace [tpl]nowrap|Tr[tpl]sub|L/K[/tpl] : L → K[/tpl] is a K-linear map (a K-linear functional), that is
Additionally, trace behaves well in towers of fields: if M is a finite extension of L, then the trace from M to K is just the composition of the trace from M to L with the trace from L to K, i.e.

==Finite fields==

Let L = GF(qn) be a finite extension of a finite field K = GF(q). Since L/K is a Galois extension, if α is in L, then the trace of α is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of α, i.e.[tpl]harvnb|Lidl|Niederreiter|1997|loc=p.54[/tpl]
In this setting we have the additional properties,[tpl]harvnb|Mullen|Panario|2013|loc=p. 21[/tpl]
And,[tpl]harvnb|Lidl|Niederreiter|1997|loc=p.56[/tpl]
When K is the prime subfield of L, the trace is called the absolute trace and otherwise it is a relative trace.

===Application===

When h = 2m + 1, a solution is given by the simpler expression:

==Trace form==

When L/K is separable, the trace provides a duality theory via the trace form: the map from [tpl]nowrap|L × L[/tpl] to K sending (x, y) to Tr[tpl]sub|L/K[/tpl](xy) is a nondegenerate, symmetric, bilinear form called the trace form. An example of where this is used is in algebraic number theory in the theory of the different ideal.
The trace form for a finite degree field extension L/K has non-negative signature for any field ordering of K.  The converse, that every Witt equivalence class with non-negative signature contains a trace form, is true for algebraic number fields K.Lorenz (2008) p.38
If L/K is an inseparable extension, then the trace form is identically 0.[tpl]harvnb|Isaacs|1994|loc=p. 369[/tpl] as footnoted in [tpl]harvnb|Rotman|2002|loc=p. 943[/tpl]
