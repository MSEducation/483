Raroa Railway Station is one of eight stations on the Johnsonville Branch, a commuter branch railway north of Wellington in New Zealand's North Island.  It serves the suburbs of Raroa and Broadmeadows, and is one of four stations on the line to be located on a curve.
Electric multiple unit trains are operated by Tranz Metro under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).

==History==

Raroa came into existence subsequent to electrification to serve the needs of the expanding population north of Wellington and was opened on 17 June 1940.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoy |first=Douglas G. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Rails Out Of The Capital |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1970 |month= |publisher=The New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society |location=Wellington |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=93â€“95 |chapter=Appendix A: Stations and Stopping Places |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl]  Evening Post 12 June 1940 page 6  
Raroa Station is notable as the terminus for the last freight traffic on the Johnsonville Branch.  Because of transport licensing regulations under a 1931 Act of parliament that required rail to be used in preference to road to cart goods over certain distances if there was a rail option, livestock trains were run on the Johnsonville Branch to transport livestock to the railhead nearest the abattoirs in the Ngauranga Gorge.  The terminus of this service used to be the stockyards at Johnsonville station, but public pressure in the 1950s resulted in the stockyards being relocated to Raroa and livestock transhipped there from 2 February 1958.  From the stockyards, the livestock were transported by truck to the abattoir.  Though the provision relating to the transport of livestock was repealed in 1962, the trains continued to run until about 1973.[tpl]cite book |last=Churchman |first=Geoffrey B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Story of The Wellington to Johnsonville Railway |origdate= |origyear=1988 |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=Second Edition |series= |date= |year=1998 |month= |publisher=IPL Books |location=Wellington |language= |isbn=0-908876-05-X |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Electrified Operations |chapterurl= |quote=... This was a train bringing livestock for sale at the yards in Johnsonville, after which it was driven by road to the abattoirs in the Ngauranga Gorge. ... In the 1950s, local pressure saw the stock yards transferred to Raroa.  The transportation of livestock on the line was due to transport licensing regulations which prevented the transport of goods by road for more than specified distances if rail transport between the localities existed.  With the repeal of the particular provision relating to livestock in 1962, the way was open for the railing of livestock on the Johnsonville Line to be replaced by road.  Stock trains in fact lingered on and ceased about 1973. [/tpl]  The siding was not closed until 4 October 1976, and the track was lifted about 1982.
