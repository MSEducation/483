Friolzheimer Riese, German for Giant of Friolzheim is the designation of a 47 metres tall lattice tower on Geissberg northeast of
Friolzheim, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. It was used until 2003 for radio relay links of US military (during its final use as a U.S. facility, part of the Defense Information Systems Network) in Germany. The tower is now used for non-military communication purposes. 
A special feature of it are the four large concrete basements on which its 4 legs stand on.
