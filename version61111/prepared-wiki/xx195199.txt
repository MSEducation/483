==Fez==

The fez is also worn with the kanzu and dashiki in East Africa. The East African style has a tassel that hangs from the top of the hat.  The red fez was introduced into the region by the military. During British colonial rule of East Africa, the red fez was worn by a regiment called the King's African Rifles.  The fez is also worn in West Africa, but the West African version has a stem on top of the hat, and no tassel.
