[[Zinc protoporphyrin]]

CATEGORIES: Porphyrins, Blood cells

Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is a compound found in red blood cells when heme production is inhibited by lead and/or by lack of iron.

The reaction to insert a ferrous ion into protoporphyrin IX is catalyzed by the enzyme ferrochelatase.

==Clinical utility==

Measurement of zinc protoporphyrin in red cells has been used as a screening test for lead poisoning.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin CJ, Werntz CL, Ducatman AM |title=The interpretation of zinc protoporphyrin changes in lead intoxication: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Occupational Medicine |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=587–91 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15576877 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqh123[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Verschoor M, Herber R, Zielhuis R, Wibowo A |title=Zinc protoporphyrin as an indicator of lead exposure: precision of zinc protoporphyrin measurements |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=613–21 |year=1987 |pmid=3679557 |doi=10.1007/BF00377923[/tpl]
and for iron deficiency.[tpl]cite journal |author=Crowell R, Ferris AM, Wood RJ, Joyce P, Slivka H |title=Comparative effectiveness of zinc protoporphyrin and hemoglobin concentrations in identifying iron deficiency in a group of low-income, preschool-aged children: practical implications of recent illness |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=224–32 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16818569 |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0156[/tpl]
There are a number of specific clinical situations in which this measurement has been found to be useful.
Zinc protoporphyrin levels can be elevated as the result of a number of conditions, for instance:
The virtue of ZPP testing as a screen is that all of these conditions can be considered worth discovering. 
The fluorescent properties of ZPP in intact red cells allows the ZPP/heme molar ratio to be measured quickly, at low cost, and in a small sample volume.[tpl]cite journal |author=Blumberg WE, Eisinger J, Lamola AA, Zuckerman DM |title=The hematofluorometer |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=23 |issue=2 PT. 1 |pages=270–4 |date=February 1977 |pmid=832391 |url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=832391[/tpl]

==History==

Porphyrin compounds containing zinc have been known since the 1930s. They became of more than academic interest with the discovery, in 1974,[tpl]cite journal |author=Lamola AA, Yamane T |title=Zinc protoporphyrin in the erythrocytes of patients with lead intoxication and iron deficiency anemia |journal=Science |volume=186 |issue=4167 |pages=936–8 |date=December 1974 |pmid=4469690 |doi=10.1126/science.186.4167.936[/tpl] that ZPP was the major non-heme porphyrin formed in red cells as the result of lead poisoning or iron deficiency.
It was already known at this time that non-heme Protoporphyrin IX levels were elevated in these conditions, but prior investigators had used extraction methods that converted ZPP to unbound Protoporphyrin IX.[tpl]cite journal |author=Piomelli S |title=A micromethod for free erythrocyte porphyrins: the FEP test |journal=The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=932–40 |date=June 1973 |pmid=4710372[/tpl]
The early literature is sometimes confusing, and results are hard to compare without detailed examination of the measurement methods and the conversion factors used to report the results.Some reports, for instance, measured the ZPP/Heme molar ratio (μmole ZPP per mole of heme), but reported this as the weight concentration (μg of EP per deciliter of packed red cells, or μg of EP per g hemoglobin at an assumed hematocrit of 35), and sometimes without easy access to the assumptions used in the conversion.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Reports may refer to Free Erythrocyte Protoporphyrin (FEP) or Erythrocyte Protoporphyrin (EP or EPP). ZPP is also abbreviated ZP and ZnPP. Current practice is tending to measure and report the molar ratio of ZPP to Heme (μmole/mole).
