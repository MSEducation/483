Stephen Brent Lowery (born October 12, 1960) is an American professional golfer. 
Lowery was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He has PGA Tour victories in 1994, 2000 and 2008. All three of his victories on the PGA Tour have come in playoffs. 
Lowery has been featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings. His best season on the PGA Tour was in 1994, when he finished 12th on the money list. He missed most of 2007 with a wrist injury. The PGA Tour granted him a partial exemption for the 2008 season. He needed to win more than $250,000 during his first eight starts in 2008 in order to re-gain his full exemption on the PGA Tour, but that became a moot point when he won the 2008 AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. The victory gave him a full two-year exemption. 
Lowery also won the Birmingham Golf Association Junior and State Junior in the late 70's, before embarking on his four years of college at the University of Alabama. He played for coach Conrad Rehling from 1979-1983, on the Alabama Crimson Tide golf team.
In 1998, Lowery was involved in a bizarre incident at The Players Championship, in which his successful approach shot to the infamous island green on the 17th hole was stolen by a seagull (which then dropped his ball into the adjacent water hazard).  Under PGA rules, Lowery was allowed to replace his ball with no penalty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usga.org/Rule-Books/Rules-of-Golf/Rule-18/|title=USGA - Rule 18|accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]
Though it was in a losing effort, Lowery played a memorable stretch of golf at The International in 2002. He holed out a shot from over 200 yards for a rare albatross (or double eagle) on the 71st hole to pull within one point, ultimately losing by the same margin after missing a birdie putt on the last hole. Coming near the very end of the tournament and affecting such a close finish, Lowery's double eagle was one of the most dramatic in PGA Tour history since Gene Sarazen made a double eagle at 15 in the final round of The Masters in 1935. Two holes before his double eagle, Lowery also holed out a wedge from the fairway for an eagle .
