==Biography==

===Early years===

In the late 1980s, founding members Paul DiBartolo, Rob De Luca and Tommi Gallo were playing in a Boston based band called Bang.
In 1989  guitarist Paul Di Bartolo (real name Salvadore Poe) traveled to New York where he met singer Ray West. Paul was so impressed by his voice, that he immediately convinced bassist Rob De Luca and drummer Tommi Gallo to follow him to New York and start a new band with Ray which became Spread Eaglesleazeroxx.com - Paul DiBartolo interview

As they were signed while still rehearsing for their first gig, they wrote most songs for their debut 1990 debut album Spread Eagle in the studio. Receiving little promotion from MCA the band produced the video for "Scratch Like A Cat" using their own money and with the help of friends.Spread Eagle interview from the 90's

===Open To The Public===

The band spent a lot of time on the road before recording their follow-up album and began burning out. First to leave was drummer Tommi Gallo. He was replaced by Kirke Blankenship who did not stay for long and played drums on one track (High Horses) of the second album Open To The Public. That album was then recorded with session drummers John Macaluso from TNT and Thommy Price from Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Open to the Public was released in 1993. Dave Femia played the drums on the following tour.sleazeroxx.com - Spread Eagle The new record did not meet the expectations of their fans and Grunge took over the music scene. So in 1995 Spread Eagle resigned and split up.
