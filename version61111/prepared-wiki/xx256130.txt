==Background==

Unlike the first single from the album, "It's OK" was exclusively released in the UK and certain areas of Europe. The song received its first recognition on the British charts following the video premiering on 4 Music on December 9, 2010. The single was released on two formats only: the physical release, which features the main album version and the Paul Epworth remix of the title track; and the digital release, which includes two remixes of the title track, exclusive B-Side "Bridges" and a live recording of "Radioactive" taken from the Radio 1 Live Lounge Sessions.[tpl]cite web|title=It's OK (Explicit) at Amazon.co.uk|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004FYCYZ6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

In the context of The Lady Killer, the song was positively reviewed. David Carr for Chicks With Guns (CWG) Magazine says, "On the more up tempo numbers The Lady Killer, “Cry Baby, and It’s OK,” you may feel as if you are watching reruns of the 70’s TV show Love American Style as Cee Lo creates some great lyrical vignettes to go with his amazingly versatile voice. Don’t even think of asking if the man uses auto-tune because the answer is a resounding no!"[tpl]cite journal|last=Carr|first=David|title=Must Hear Albums for the Winter Season|journal=Chicks with Guns Magazine|date=December 13, 2010|url=http://www.cwgmagazine.com/features/2010/12/must-hear-albums-for-the-winter-season/|accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl] Leah Greenblatt for Entertainment Weekly says, "OK honors and tweaks the tropes of vintage songcraft with hefty doses of sweet Motown/Stax boogie."[tpl]cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|title=MUSIC REVIEW: The Lady Killer|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 3, 2010|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20439021,00.html|accessdate=28 January 2011[/tpl] Andy Gill for The Belfast Telegraph argues, "when Green pushes the Motown buttons again, as in "Cry Baby", and "It's OK", it's done with such panache and wit that staleness never becomes an issue: rather than just footnotes to the source inspiration, these are fully rounded artworks in their own right."[tpl]cite news|last=Gill|first=Andy|title=Album: Cee Lo Green, The Lady Killer (Elektra)|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/album-cee-lo-green-the-lady-killer-elektra-14990510.html|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|date=29 October 2010[/tpl] Colin Somerville of Scotland on Sunday describes It's OK as a "luxuriant stomp" with a "Northern Soul" influence, and lists it in his tracks to download from The Lady Killer.[tpl]cite news|last=Somerville|first=Colin|title=Album review: Cee Lo Green, The Lady Killer|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/features/Album-review-CeeLo-Green-The.6606689.jp|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday|date=October 31, 2010[/tpl]
Not all reviews of "It's OK" were positive, however. Robin Murray for Clash Magazine (reviewing It's OK as a single release) opines, "blessed with an undoubtedly pleasant voice, it’s a shame that Cee Lo Green uses it on such undramatic material. Sure, ‘Forget You’ had it’s cheeky charm but you can’t help but feel that Cee Lo could do so much more. ‘It’s OK’ is another pleasant, melodic single which will be adopted by the nation but the middle of the road is such a boring way to travel."[tpl]cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin|title=Singles Roundup, January 10th|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/singles-round-up-january-10th|journal=Clash Magazine|accessdate=28 January 2011|date=January 10, 2011[/tpl]
