Goddess of the Market is a biography of Ayn Rand by historian Jennifer Burns. Subtitled "Ayn Rand and the American Right", it explores Rand's intellectual development and her relationship to the conservative and libertarian movements. The writing of her books and the development of her philosophy of Objectivism are also covered.

==Background and publication history==

Burns spent eight years working on the book, which began as a dissertation for her doctoral degree from the University of California at Berkeley. In the process of writing the book, Burns became the first independent historian given access to the Ayn Rand Archives, a collection of Rand's personal papers hosted by the Ayn Rand Institute.[tpl]harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=287–288[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |url=http://www.jenniferburns.org/author-bio |title=Jennifer Burns Bio |accessdate=October 18, 2009[/tpl] When the book was published by Oxford University Press in September 2009, Burns was an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia. A paperback edition of the book was released in August 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/CulturalStudies/WomensStudies/HistoryPoliticsSociety/~~/dmlldz11c2EmY2k9OTc4MDE5OTgzMjQ4NA== |title=Goddess of the Market: Jennifer Burns |publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl]

==Contents==

The book is divided into four main sections. The first, titled "The Education of Ayn Rand, 1905–1943", covers Rand's life and intellectual development from birth until the publication of her novel The Fountainhead. The second, "From Novelist to Philosopher, 1944–1957" covers the period in which she wrote her last novel, Atlas Shrugged. The third section, "Who Is John Galt? 1957–1968", discusses the growth of the Objectivist movement based on Rand's philosophy, and her relationship and eventual break with her protégé Nathaniel Branden. The final section, "Legacies", covers the final years of Rand's life and the continuing reaction to her after her death. Burns also includes an "Essay on Sources" describing the scholarship about Rand and her own use of the Ayn Rand Archives.

==Reception==

The book has received generally positive reviews. Booklist described it as a "thoroughly engaging biography" and "eminently readable".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.booklistonline.com/default.aspx?page=show_product&pid=3684487 |title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right (Review) |first=Kristine |last=Huntley |work=Booklist Online |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2009[/tpl] In a review for The Washington Times, libertarian journalist Brian Doherty said that the book provides "a proper sense of where Rand really stands in American ideological history." However, he says Burns is "less convincing" in showing "the connections between Rand and the American right wing" as indicated in the book's subtitle.[tpl]cite news |first=Brian |last=Doherty |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |title=Why Ayn Rand is hot again |work=The Washington Times |url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/oct/05/why-ayn-rand-is-hot-again/ |date=October 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2009[/tpl] A review by Nick Gillespie in The Wilson Quarterly said, "Burns is particularly sharp at analyzing how Cold War conservatives such as Buckley rejected Rand’s rationalism but eventually benefited from her popularity with college students during the 1960s."[tpl]cite journal|first=Nick |last=Gillespie |authorlink=Nick Gillespie |title=Ready for Her Close-up |journal=The Wilson Quarterly |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=wq.essay&essay_id=554064 |date=Autumn 2009[/tpl] The American Thinker, a conservative website, described Burns as "honest about contradictions that plagued Rand" and said the book shows "the power of Rand's ideas and the hold she maintained over her followers".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/07/ayn_rand_goddess_of_the_market.html |first=Richard |last=Baehr |title=Ayn Rand: 'Goddess of the Market' |date=July 28, 2009 |publisher=The American Thinker |accessdate=October 18, 2009[/tpl] A brief review from Publishers Weekly was mixed, calling the book "exasperatingly detailed and slow-going at times", but complimenting Burns for her ability to "explicate the evolution of Rand's individualist worldview".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/reviews/search/index.html?page=1&search=1&author=&issue=&category=&isbn=&publisher=&title=Goddess%20of%20the%20Market |title=Nonfiction Reviews: 9/7/2009 |publisher=Publishers Weekly |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2009[/tpl][tpl]registration required[/tpl]
Several of the reviews compared the book with another biography of Rand, Ayn Rand and the World She Made by Anne Heller, which focuses on the details of Rand's life, in contrast to the intellectual history focused on by Burns. In a review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said the two books "make many of the same points and touch on many of the same biographical details", although Maslin prefers Heller's book for its greater detail.[tpl]cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |title=Twin Biographies of a Singular Woman, Ayn Rand |work=The New York Times |date=October 22, 2009 |page=C6 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/books/22rand.html?_r=2[/tpl] The two books were also reviewed jointly in The New Republic[tpl]cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Chait |date=September 14, 2009 |title=Wealthcare |work=The New Republic |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/wealthcare-0[/tpl] and Time.[tpl]cite news |first=Andrea |last=Sachs |title=Ayn Rand: Extremist or Visionary? |work=Time |date=October 12, 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1927269-1,00.html[/tpl]
On October 15, 2009, Burns was interviewed about the book on The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart said it was "incredible timing" for the book to be released at a time when Rand was experiencing a "resurgence ... in the culture",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/thu-october-15-2009/jennifer-burns |title=The Daily Show: Jennifer Burns, Thursday October 15, 2009 |publisher=Comedy Central |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl] a reference to the popularity of Rand's writing among contemporary conservatives, including the Tea Party movement.
