==History==

On July 25, 1949 the [tpl]nihongo|Hirosaki Electric Railway|弘前電気鉄道株式会社|Hirosaki Denki-Tetsudō  Kabushika-kaisha[/tpl] was established, and connected  Ōwani Station with Chuo-Hirosaki Station by January 26, 1952. The company was founded by a combination of capital from the Hirosaki city government, and Mitsubishi Electric, with the line intended by Mitsubishi to be a test platform for future local train systems. On October 1, 1970, the Hirosaki Electric Railway was acquired by the Kōnan Railway Company, and its line became the Kōnan Railway Ōwani Line. At the same time all freight operations were suspended. A new Automatic Block Signal system became operational from November 1, 2003. Express services were suspended from November 2006.
