==History==

On October 4, 2008, Thomas S. Monson announced the plans to build a temple in Rome, Italy. The temple site was purchased by the church during the late 1990s and was originally the site of a home; which was razed during the fall of 2009.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.acerson.com/temple |title= Roman Italy Temple |author= Acerson Family |year= 2008 |accessdate= 7 December 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl] In preparation for the construction, and as part of the permit process, all potential building sites in Rome must undergo a search for ancient Roman ruins by digging trenches every 10 to 15 feet apart across the entire property. Following the search for ruins on the temple property, it was announced that none were found, and construction would be permitted. 
The groundbreaking ceremony for the temple was held October 23, 2010, with Thomas S. Monson presiding.[tpl]citation |first= Jason |last= Swensen |date= October 30, 2010 |title= Groundbreaking for Rome Italy Temple |url= http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/60065/Groundbreaking-for-Rome-Italy-Temple.html |newspaper= Church News |accessdate= 2012-10-31 [/tpl] Only invited guests were allowed to be at the groundbreaking, but to allow all members to participate the ceremony was rebroadcast to LDS meetinghouses in Italy the following day.[tpl]citation |url= http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/rome/ |title= Rome Italy Temple |first= Rick |last= Satterfield |work= LDSChurchTemples.com |accessdate= 2012-10-31 [/tpl] Dignitaries at the groundbreaking included Vice Mayor of Rome, Giuseppe Ciardi, Italian senator Lucio Malan,[tpl]citation |url= http://www.ldschurchnews.com/articles/62519/Rome-Italy-Temple-update.html |title= Rome Italy Temple update |newspaper= Church News |date= July 10, 2012 |accessdate= 2012-10-31 [/tpl] along with Thomas S.
