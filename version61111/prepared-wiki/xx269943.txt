CATEGORIES: Museums in Saarland

The Saarländisches Karnevalsmuseum (English: Saarland Carnival Museum) is located in St. Ingbert, Saarpfalz (Saar-Palatinate) district in the south-east part of the Saarland, Germany.. The museum is in the Becker tower of the former Becker brewery (Kaiserstraße 176, Sankt Ingbert), which later became the Karlberg brewery.
The Mardi Gras Museum was founded in late 2002 by the Association of Saarland Carnival Clubs (Verband Saarländischer Karnevalsvereine "VSK"). In over 300 m², the association shows a large number of carnival exhibits.  Medals, costumes, commemorative lively speeches and much more are presented.
