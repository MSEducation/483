The Institute of Algological Research (sometimes referred to as Muroran Marine Station, or Northern Hemisphere Field Station) in Muroran, is one of the oldest research institutes for Phycology research in Japan. Institute of Algological Research is located in the town of Muroran, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan and is involved in research leading to MS and PhD degrees in Phycology.  Graduate students are often registered with Hokkaido University. 

==History==

The Institute of Algological Research was founded in 1933. 

==Habitat==

Coastal zone surrounding the institute has one of the largest seaweed biodiversity in  Japan, with over 200 species of macroalgae.
