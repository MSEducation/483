Lincoln is the capital and the second-most populous city of the state of Nebraska, after Omaha. Lincoln is also the county seat of Lancaster County and the home of the University of Nebraska. Lincoln's population in 2012 was estimated at 265,404.
Lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster, and became the county seat of the newly created Lancaster County in 1859. The capital of Nebraska Territory had been Omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854; however, most of the territory's population lived south of the Platte River. After much of the territory south of the Platte considered annexation to Kansas, the legislature voted to move the capital south of the river and as far west as possible. The village of Lancaster was chosen, in part due to the salt flats and marshes.[ref]
</ref>
Omaha interests attempted to derail the move by having Lancaster renamed after the recently assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. Many of the people south of the river had been sympathetic to the Confederate cause in the recently concluded Civil War, and it was assumed that the legislature would not pass the measure if the future capital were named after Abraham Lincoln. The choice to name the capital city "Lincoln" caused quite a stir among the constituents, whose sentiments were mixed regarding who should have won the Civil War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lincoln.org/visiting/whyvisit/history |title=Lincoln Convention and Visitors Bureau | Why Visit Lincoln? | History |publisher=Lincoln.org |accessdate=August 29, 2011[/tpl]

==Geography==

Lincoln is located at [tpl]Coord|40|48|38|N|96|40|49|W|type:city[/tpl] (40.810446, −96.680345).[tpl]GR|1|dateform=mdy[/tpl] According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2013, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|91.77|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|90.42|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] of it is land and [tpl]convert|1.35|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2013 - Places|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/gazetteer/2013_Gazetteer/2013_Gaz_place_national.zip|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl]
Lincoln is one of the few large cities of Nebraska not located along either the Platte River or the Missouri River. The city was originally laid out near Salt Creek and among the nearly flat saline wetlands of northern Lancaster County. The city's growth over the years has led to development of the surrounding land, much of which is composed of gently rolling hills. In recent years, Lincoln's northward growth has encroached on the habitat of the endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle.

===Metropolitan area===

The Lincoln metropolitan area consists of Lancaster County and Seward County, which was added to the metropolitan area in 2003. Lincoln has very little development outside its city limits and has no contiguous suburbs (the largest town that can be considered a suburb of Lincoln is Waverly). This is due primarily to the fact that most land that would otherwise be developed as a suburban town has already been annexed by the city of Lincoln itself.

===Neighborhoods===

Lincoln's neighborhoods, like in other cities, include both old and new development.  Some neighborhoods in Lincoln were formerly small towns that Lincoln later annexed, including University Place, Belmont, Bethany, College View, Havelock, and Hartley.  A number of Historic Districts are located near Downtown Lincoln[tpl]cite web|url=http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/plan/long/hp/histlist.htm |title=lincoln.ne.gov - Planning Department - Long Range Planning - Historic Preservation - Sites and Districs |publisher=City of Lincoln, Nebraska |accessdate=13 December 2013[/tpl] while newer neighborhoods have appeared primarily in the south and east.  As of December 2013, Lincoln had 45 registered neighborhood associations within the city limits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/urban/Neighborhoods/NAstatistics.htm |title=lincoln.ne.gov - Urban Development - Neighborhood Statistics |publisher=City of Lincoln, Nebraska |accessdate=13 December 2013[/tpl]

===Climate===

Located on the Great Plains far from the moderating influence of mountains or large bodies of water, Lincoln possesses a highly variable four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa): winters are cold but relatively dry, summers are hot and occasionally humid. With little precipitation falling during winter, precipitation is concentrated in the warmer months, when thunderstorms frequently roll in, often producing tornadoes. Snow tends to fall in light amounts, though blizzards are possible. Snow cover is not very reliable due to both the low precipitation and the frequent thaws during winter.
The monthly daily average temperature ranges from [tpl]convert|24.6|°F|1[/tpl] in January to [tpl]convert|77.6|°F|1[/tpl] in July. However, the city is subject both to episodes of bitter cold in winter and heat waves during summer, with 11.4 nights of sub-[tpl]convert|0|°F|0[/tpl] lows, 41 days of [tpl]convert|90|°F|0[/tpl]+ highs, and 4.6 days of [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl]+ highs. The city straddles the boundary of USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b and 6a,http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=68502&submit=Look+it+up%21 indicating an annual minimum temperature of around [tpl]convert|−10|°F|0[/tpl]. Temperature extremes have ranged from [tpl]convert|−33|°F|0[/tpl] on January 12, 1974 up to [tpl]convert|115|°F|0[/tpl] on July 25, 1936.
