==History==

Gunton Hall was built for Sir William Harbord in the 1740s by the architect Matthew Brettingham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/real_life_downton_abbey_rediscovered_in_norfolk_1_1190052|title=Real-life Downton Abbey rediscovered in Norfolk|publisher=EDP24|date=28 January 2012|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl] In 1775 Harbord Harbord, 1st Baron Suffield, Member of Parliament for Norwich, commissioned James Wyatt to make significant additions to the house. The house was almost destroyed by fire in 1882 and lay derelict for nearly a century before Kit Martin, an architect, bought the house in 1980 and converted it into apartments. It is surrounded by a 1,000 acre deer park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguntonarms.co.uk/history.php|title=The Gunton Arms, History|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]
