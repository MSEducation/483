"Heaven Knows I'm Missing Him Now" is the twenty-third single by 1960s British girl singer Sandie Shaw, and her final single of that decade, marking the end of a string of singles which had made her the most successful British female singer of that era. 
Though the song failed to enter the UK chart, it would later influence 1980s singer Morrissey, a big fan of Shaw, to write a song for his band The Smiths entitled "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now", which became one of their biggest hits. Shaw's song was in the typical pop style that people were accustomed to hearing from her, which was a direct contrast to the album she released around the same time entitled Reviewing the Situation. That album was full of much more alternative material, to which Shaw felt she was more suited at the time.
