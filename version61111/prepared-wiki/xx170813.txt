Marching Out of Time is a 1994 comedy film directed by Anton Vassil.

==Plot==

When a wacky squadron of WWII soldiers are mistakenly teleported to present day California, Fred must convince the police and his family that he is not losing his mind and that the future of the world is in danger.

==Summary==

Fred Johnson is an average American with a simple life, until he hears peculiar noises next door.  His neighbor, Professor Memo, has conducted experiments which have crossed paths with a German time machine from 1942.
Fred and the professor must find a way to stop the Germans from taking vital information back through time, and change the course of history.  Fred calls on police officer Butch, a by-the-book cop, who finds this story absurd... until he too finds himself face to face with the outlandish soldiers.
On a roller coaster rescue mission, Butch and Johnson overtake the squadron but it's too late.  The records have already been taken back in time, leaving our heroes only one choice.... they must ride the vortex back to World War II.
Directed by Anton Vassil, this outrageous comical adventure takes us from Venice Beach to the bunker of 1942, and with history at stake, our modern day heroes are not just travelling through time, they're also saving the world.
