==Biography==

Élodie Frégé was born on 15 February 1982 in Nièvre, France. She comes from a family with a musical background; her grandfather was a professional accordionist. She started her musical interest at the age of 6. She started learning guitar when she was a child and took classes for 8 years. She also trained ballet for 12 years, so that gave her good basic dancing skills which have helped her later in her music career. Her brother and sister showed musical interest; they also sing and perform.
She has a cat calle Winter. She auditioned for Star Academy Season 3 and won the title in 2004. Many people, including the professors and critics, felt Sofia Essaïdi should have been the winner.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] However, the French public chose Elodie, the emotional singer against the vocal performer Sofia.
Later in 2004 she released her debut self-titled album, Élodie Frégé. Her hit singles were "De L'eau" and "Viens jusqu'à moi". In 2006, she released her second album, Le Jeu des 7 Erreurs, written and composed with a French artist Benjamin Biolay. The first single is "La ceinture".
She made her first solo concerts in Paris on December 2006 at Café de la Danse, and on January 2007 at La Cigale, beginning her first tour through France and Belgium.
