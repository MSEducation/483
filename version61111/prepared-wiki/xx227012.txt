A Bloody Mary is a popular cocktail containing vodka, tomato juice, and usually other spices or flavorings such as Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, piri piri sauce, beef consommé or bouillon, horseradish, celery, olives, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and celery salt.

==History==

The Bloody Mary's origin is unclear, and there are three conflicting claims of who invented the Bloody Mary.
New York's 21 Club has two claims associated with it. One is that it was invented in the 1930s at by a bartender named Henry Zbikiewicz, who was charged with mixing Bloody Marys. Another attributes its invention to the comedian George Jessel, who frequented the 21 Club.Smith, Andrew F. (2007). The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, p. 55. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York. In 1939, Lucius Beebe printed in his gossip column This New York one of the earliest U.S. references to this drink, along with the original recipe: "George Jessel's newest pick-me-up which is receiving attention from the town's paragraphers is called a Bloody Mary: half tomato juice, half vodka."New York Herald Tribune, December 2, 1939, page 9[tpl]verify source|date=March 2014[/tpl] 
Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary before either, in 1921, while working at the New York Bar in Paris, which later became Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Ernest Hemingway and other American expatriates.Andrew MacElhone and Duncan MacElhone: Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails, page 35. ISBN 0-285-63358-9, Souvenir Press, 1986, 1996.
Petiot also claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary as a refinement to Jessel's drink, when Petiot spoke to The New Yorker magazine in July 1964, saying:
  "I initiated the Bloody Mary of today," he told us. "Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/blogs/editor/2008/12/happy-birthday.html|title=Happy Birthday, Bloody Mary!|last=Park|first=Michael Y.|date=12/01/08|publisher=Epicurious|accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl] 
The cocktail was claimed as a new cocktail under the name "Red Hammer" in Life Magazine in 1942, consisting of tomato juice, vodka and lemon juice.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Hollywood goes Russian |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fk4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38 |journal=Life magazine |location= |publisher= |date=1942 |page=38 |volume=13 |issue=8 |quote="Red Hammer" is a new Hollywood cocktail.

==Origin of the name==

The name "Bloody Mary" is associated with a number of historical figures — particularly Queen Mary I of England, who was nicknamed as such in Foxe's Book of Martyrs for attempting to re-establish the Catholic Church in Britain — and fictional women from folklore. Some drink aficionados believe the inspiration for the name was Hollywood star Mary Pickford. Others trace the name to a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood.Bloody Marys at 1933 prices just the tonic for NYC Reuters, 2 December 2008
However, another argument for the origin of "Bloody Mary", that the name in English simply arose from "a failure to pronounce the Slav syllables of a drink called Vladimir"[tpl]cite book |last=Leigh Fermor |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Leigh Fermor |editor-last=Joliffe |editor-first=John |title=Auberon Herbert: A Composite Portrait |publisher= Michael Russell |date=November 1, 1976 | chapter=Auberon Herbert |isbn=978-0859550482[/tpl] Cited in [tpl]cite book |last=Leigh Fermor |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Leigh Fermor |editor-last=Cooper |editor-first=Artemis |title=Words of Mercury |publisher=John Murray |year=2003 |isbn=978-0719561061 |page=160[/tpl]
gains some credibility from the observation that the customer at Harry's Bar in Paris for whom Fernand Petiot prepared the drink in 1920 was Vladimir Smirnov, of the Smirnoff vodka family.[tpl]cite web |last=Samuels |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Samuels |title=The History of the Bloody Mary |publisher=The Boys Club |date=March 18, 2013 |url=http://theboysclub.net/brian/the-history-of-the-bloody-mary/ |accessdate=November 30, 2013[/tpl]

==Preparation and serving==

In the United States, the Bloody Mary is a common "Hair of the dog" drink, erroneously reputed to cure hangovers; however, the alcohol only numbs the discomfort (only rest, water, and electrolyte replacement can cure a hangover).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/restaurants/8837.html|title=Here's to the Bloody Mary|last=Shoffner|first=Robert|date=2008-07-01|work=The Washingtonian|accessdate=2009-06-09[/tpl]"9 Myths About Your Hangover" by Dana Dudepohl, Marie Claire, at WebMD.comBut Does It Actually Cure Hangovers?

While there is not much complexity in mixing vodka and tomato juice, more elaborate versions of the drink have become trademarks of the bartenders who make them. A common garnish is a celery stalk when served in a tall glass, often over ice.
