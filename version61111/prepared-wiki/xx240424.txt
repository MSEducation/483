==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars and states "a fine all-around set from the Cannonball Adderley Quintet... finds his band in top form... It's a strong introduction to the music of this classic hard bop group".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed 19 October 2009  The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 4 stars stating "At the Lighthouse, which marked Vic Feldman's arrival in the group, is a near-classic, opening on the immortal version of "Sack O' Woe" and steaming through a vintage Adderley set in front of a cheering and fingersnapping crowd".
