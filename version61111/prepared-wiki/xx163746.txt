Robert Alfred Adcock (3 November 1916 â€“ 18 March 2005) was an English cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played first-class cricket for Leicestershire in 1938. He was born in Ibstock and died in Leicester.
Adcock played for just one County Championship season, making his debut against Warwickshire in a rain-interrupted draw. Adcock played four further matches during the 1938 season, and was never on the winning side in a County Championship game. Three of the five first-class games in which Adcock participated were lost by an innings margin. Adcock was a lower-middle order batsman.
Adcock bowled just ten overs in his first-class career, and the following year, played in the Minor Counties Championship for Lincolnshire. He died at the age of 88.
