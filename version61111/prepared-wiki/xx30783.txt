Members are first elected to the legislature during general elections. General elections must be conducted every five years from the date of the last election, but the Premier may ask for early dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. An election may also take place if the governing party loses the confidence of the legislature by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.electionspei.ca/provincial/guide/|title=Guide to Provincial General Elections |publisher=Elections Prince Edward Island [/tpl]
