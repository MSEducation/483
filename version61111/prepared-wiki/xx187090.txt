==Submissions==

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Armenia for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.
The Armenian film industry has had a difficult time in this category, and has never yet been nominated. They tried to submit a film for the first time in 1991 after declaring independence form the USSR, but were rejected because Armenia was not yet an internationally recognized state. They tried again ten years later with the well-received drama "Symphony of Silence", about a terminally ill man who returns from the USA to his Armenian homeland. In 2003, they sent "Vodka Lemon", a black comedy set in Armenia and made by French-based Iraqi Kurdish director Hiner Saleem. AMPAS originally disqualified the film saying that the film was not a majority Armenian production, but changed its mind after Armenia was able to prove "sufficient creative control" during the making of the film. The film was screened alongside 55 other films but failed to receive a nomination.
In 2009, Armenia rejoined the Oscar competition with a 52-minute documentary short called Autumn of the Magician about the life and career of 89-year old Italian screenwriter and artist Tonino Guerra.
