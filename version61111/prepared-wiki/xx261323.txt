Historically part of Lancashire, it lies mainly along the A58 road.

==History==

The area's name is taken from a prominent local family, the Harts. In 1642, during the English Civil War, a battle was fought at Hart Common between Lord Derby's forces and Parliamentarians. Men taken in the battle by the Royalists were commemorated in a mural painted above the market hall in Westhoughton.[tpl]when|date=November 2013[/tpl] An inscription on the mural read: 'OUR FORCES WILL NOT FLIE THROUGH EIGHTY MUSQUETEERS THEY CONFLICT WITH THE ENEMIE TO OUR GREAT LOSSE. GOD FIRES OUR MAGAZINE UPON THE COMMON AT HOUGHTON CHAPPEL 1642.'
In 1874 the Hewlett pits were sunk by the Wigan Coal and Iron Company and the hamlet was built to house the colliers and staff. The managers were housed in higher quality terraces on the north side of the A58, either side of Patterson Street. The colliery superintendent's house, 552 Wigan Road, overlooked the entrance to the colliery on Hewlett Street and a cast iron footbridge over the railway.Many men in the district found work in there. Before this, the area was mainly agricultural. There was a shortage of labour when the pit first opened and many Irish agricultural labourers found work in the pits. During the Franco-Prussian War in the mid-1870s, the miners were able to earn Â£1 per day.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] When the war ended the price of coal fell to 6 shillings per ton and Mr Hewlett[tpl]who|date=December 2011[/tpl] called for large reductions in the miners' wages. These were strenuously opposed by the miners and a strike ensued. Newcomers arrived and settled in the village - the villagers said they had "arrived at Crows Nest Siding under a tar sheet", they were said to have a strange 'lingo'. The villagers did not take kindly to the newcomers, and for many years afterwards the remark "Thi fayther cum fr' under't tar sheet" was enough to start a fight.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
By 1896 the Wigan Coal and Iron Company who owned the Hewlett Pits, employed 981 men underground and 182 surface workers.[tpl]citation |title=Wigan Coal & Iron Co. Ltd. |url= http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/w1002.htm|publisher=Durham Mining Museum |accessdate=22 November 2013[/tpl]
The pits closed 1913 and 1931. A plaque on 552 Wigan Road (now the Saplings Day Nursery) reads IN MEMORIAM.. ..THE NAMES HERE RECORDED ARE OF THOSE MEN WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE GREAT WAR AUGUST 1914 TO NOVEMBER 1918 AS WELL AS THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO OBTAINED MILITARY DISTINCTIONS IN THE WAR.. ..1&2 HEWLETT PITS KILLED.. which is followed by the names of those killed, and the men who received military honours.
The colliery site has been landscaped and returned to pasture. The principal roads in the hamlet were Hart Street and Common Street which retains its terrace of miners' cottages. The terraces on Hart Street were demolished many years ago and the rubble covered with earth and grassed over. Hart Street is the cobbled entrance way to Hart Common which contains a children's playground and football pitches.
Coleman Milne, manufacturer of funerial vehicles, stretch limousines and other specialist vehicles is located at Hart Common.
The village has a golf course, converted from farmland and is home to Westhoughton Rangers Football Club, who play on playing fields on common land leased for a peppercorn rent fron the Hart Common Mission Church Trust.
