The Kyrgyzstan Emergency Ministry said that few buildings remained standing in the village: "Almost all buildings in the village have been destroyed. The only buildings remaining are the properly engineered ones which were built recently: the school and a medical clinic." Kanatbek Abdrakhmatov, head of the Institute of Seismology, attributed much of the destruction due to inferior construction of the buildings, many of which were built out of clay and straw.
The injured were paid 5,000 Kyrgyzstani soms (US$ 136) and 3 tons of coal, and families of the dead received 50Â kg of flour.[tpl]cite news|url=http://eng.24.kg/community/2008/10/09/6272.html|title=Kyrgyz government allocates 36mln KGS for earthquake victims support|last=Kutueva|first=Aizada|date=2008-10-09|publisher=24 Kyrgyzstan|accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029012339/http://eng.24.kg/community/2008/10/09/6272.html| archivedate= 29 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] 200 people wish to remain in Nura, and were provided with 100 6-person tents.[tpl]cite news|url=http://eng.24.kg/community/2008/10/08/6259.html|title=New houses for earthquake victims to be built in spring 2009|last=Cheban|first=Olga|date=2008-10-08|publisher=24 Kyrgyzstan|accessdate=2008-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029005734/http://eng.24.kg/community/2008/10/08/6259.html| archivedate= 29 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] 100 mobile homes are being transported to Nura, and the village will be rebuilt in the spring of 2009, and should be completed by August 2009.
