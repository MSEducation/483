wrote that the album is "a collection so bland, it makes hardtack seem sumptuous".

==Personal life==

Blunt says that he has become closer to his family since his musical success. His father manages his finances[tpl]cite news|first=Marianne|last=Macdonald|title=Blunt ambition|work=ES Magazine|publisher=Evening Standard[/tpl] and his mother arranged the purchase of his principal residence in Ibiza, where Blunt has holidayed since he was a teenager.[tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Mason|title=Offshore tax probe comes to Spain|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=The Olive Press|date=15 November 2012|url=http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2012/11/15/offshore-tax-probe-comes-to-spain/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CD7HD15G|archivedate=16 November 2012[/tpl] Blunt also owns a châlet in the Swiss town of Verbier, which he purchased in February 2007, and he was named "godfather" of one of the town's new ski lifts.
Blunt was instrumental in introducing his sister to her eventual husband after offering her for "sale" on eBay. She was having difficulty obtaining transport to a funeral in Ireland, and Blunt listed her as a "damsel in distress". A person responded saying his friend had a helicopter his sister could charter, but it turned out he was in Sweden and she did not attend the funeral. The respondent suggested she still meet up with the helicopter owner, Guy Harrison, and they began a relationship and eventually married.[tpl]cite news|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2123786,00.html |title=Blunt sold sister on eBay|accessdate=11 July 2007|author=Rosie Swash|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=11 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/fashion/trends/article232456.ece|title=Best of Times, Worst of Times: Emily Harrison, James Blunt's sister|accessdate=31 August 2008|author=Audrey Ward|work=The Sunday Times | location=London | date=31 August 2008[/tpl]
The musician's private life has been the subject of significant commentary, particularly in the tabloid press. Blunt himself has found the degree of interest in his personal life to be bizarre, stating that "fame and celebrity is something that other people have constructed that I'm not really party to".[tpl]cite news|first=Mark|last=Lepage|title=Being Blunt|work=Strut Magazine|location=Toronto, Canada|page=143|date=Fall 2007[/tpl]

==Charitable and environmental causes==

Blunt has raised funds for the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières through benefit concerts and by auctioning opportunities to meet him at his own shows.
