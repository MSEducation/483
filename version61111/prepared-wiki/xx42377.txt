[[Ohana]]

CATEGORIES: Hawaii culture, Hawaiian words and phrases

Part of Hawaiian culture, [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana means family (in an extended sense of the term, including blood-related, adoptive or intentional). The concept emphasizes that families are bound together and members must cooperate and remember one another. The term is cognate with (and its usage is similar to) the New Zealand Māori term whānau.
In current Hawaiian culture the term [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana is strictly used for blood relations.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]  Non-familial groupings always instead use the word "hui".[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In Hawaiian, the word [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana begins with an ʻokina, indicating a glottal stop.
The root word [tpl]okina[/tpl]ohā refers to the root or corm of the kalo, or taro plant (the staple "staff of life" in Hawaii), which Kanaka Maoli consider to be their cosmological ancestor.
In contemporary Hawaiian economic and regulatory practice, an "[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohana unit" is a part of a house or a separate structure on the same lot that may contain a relative but which may not be rented to the general public.http://www.takitaniconstruction.com/ohanazoning.html, honoluludpp.org/downloadpdf/zoning/lupdfaqs.pdf, www.honoluludpp.org/downloadpdf/construction/ohana.pdf
Ohana is a key theme in Disney's 2002 film, Lilo & Stitch and the succeeding television series based on the film.
