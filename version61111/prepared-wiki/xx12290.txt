This is a list of cocktails. A cocktail is a mixed drink typically made with a distilled beverage (such as, gin,  brandy, vodka, whiskey, tequila, or rum) that is mixed with other ingredients.  If beer is one of the ingredients, the drink is called a beer cocktail.
Cocktails contain one or more types of liqueur, juice, fruit, sauce, honey, milk or cream, spices, or other flavorings. Cocktails may vary in their ingredients from bartender to bartender, and from region to region. Two creations may have the same name but taste very different because of differences in how the drinks are prepared.
