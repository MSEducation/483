The Catholic Diocese of Como ([tpl]lang-la|Dioecesis Comensis[/tpl]) in northern Italy, has existed since the fourth century. It is a suffragan of the archdiocese of Milan. The bishops' seat is in Como Cathedral.
Local legend credits the conversion of Como to the apostolate of Hermagoras of Aquileia (died c. 70). Until 1528 Como was, indeed, a suffragan of the patriarchate of Aquileia (later of Venice) and followed the Aquileian Rite. In 1528 Como was placed under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Milan.

==History==

The first known bishop was Saint Felix, ordained by Saint Ambrose
In the tenth century the Bishops of Como were also its temporal lords. Como Cathedral was begun in 1396, and was completed only in 1595; later the cupola and some small chapels were added (1730â€“44).
