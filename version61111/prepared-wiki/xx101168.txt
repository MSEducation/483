==Cancer experience and charitable mission==

In 2001, Andruzzi and his wife, Jen, were introduced to C.J. Buckley, who had an inoperable brain tumor. The families became very close and, therefore, it was devastating when C.J. died late in 2002. Always driven to help others in need, the couple launched the C.J. Buckley Brain Cancer Research Fund at Children's Hospital.
On May 30, 2007, Andruzzi was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt's lymphoma, predicted to double in size in just 24 hours.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/the_bonus/01/28/andruzzi/index.html?eref=si_mostpopular | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Fight of his life - Jan 29, 2008 | date=January 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 6, 2010[/tpl] The family relocated back to New England where Andruzzi had an aggressive form of chemotherapy treatment over three months at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital.
