Many of Cronley's novels have been made into feature films.  Good Vibes was made into the 1989 comedy Let It Ride, which starred Richard Dreyfuss, David Johansen, Richard Edson, and Teri Garr.  Quick Change was the source of two film adaptations, in 1985 and in 1990.  The 1985 version, re-titled Hold-Up, was directed by Alexandre Arcady and was set in Montreal.  The 1990 version starred Bill Murray, Geena Davis, Jason Robards, and Philip Bosco, and was directed by Murray and Howard Franklin; like the novel, it was set in New York City.  George Roy Hill directed Chevy Chase, Madolyn Smith Osborne, Alice Drummond, and Mike Starr in the 1988 adaptation of Funny Farm.  The 2004 French film Nos Amis Les Flics, directed by Bob Swaim, is based on Cheap Shot.
Cronley also writes about horse racing for ESPN.
