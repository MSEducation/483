==Fleet==

The Gearbulk fleet consists of over 70 vessels, most of which are "open hatch gantry craned (OHGC)" vessels.  Standardising on this design makes the vessels interchangeable, and offers operational flexibility.
Gearbulk also operates open hatch jib craned (Fleximax) vessels and several bulk carriers for general bulk cargoes.  The company has an extensive new building programme.
