Inwood was born  in about 1771.  His father, Daniel Inwood, was bailiff to Lord Mansfield, at  Kenwood, Highgate, then just north of London. He was steward to Charles Abbot,[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nJBGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA106&dq|page=106|title=The Supplement to the Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge: Habenaria-Zingiber|first= George|last= Long|publisher=C.

Inwood waived his fee for the commission.[tpl]cite book|title=Fourth Annual Report of the Westminster National Free School| date=14 May 1816|location=London|pages= 5–16|url=[/tpl]
His most notable works are the four churches built in the parish of St Pancras, all designed in  collaboration  with his eldest son, Henry William Inwood (1794–1843). Three were Neoclassical: St Pancras New Church (1819–22), All Saints, Camden Town (1822–4), and St Peter's, Regent Square (1822–5, demolished). The other, St Mary's Chapel, Somers Town (1824–7) is in a simplistic Gothic style.[tpl]cite book |last1=Summerson |first1=John |title= Georgian London|year=1962 |edition=revised|publisher=Penguin Books |location= Harmondsworth  |page=219[/tpl] Summerson calls St Mary's "one of the most pitiful performances in the way of Gothic Revivalism ever perpetrated." The commission to design the parish church was won in a competition, held in 1818. It was a prestigious project, often said to  have been the most expensive church constructed  in London since the rebuilding of  St Paul's Cathedral. The design draws heavily on the Erechtheum and the Tower of the Winds, both in Athens, for inspiration.[tpl]cite book |last1= |first1=  |last2= |first2=  |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last=  |others= |title=The parish of St Pancras part 4: King’s Cross Neighbourhood |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65559   |accessdate= |edition= |series= Survey of London|volume=24 |year= 1952 |publisher= |location=London |isbn=  |pages=1–4 [/tpl] The extent of  Inwood's contribution to it has been questioned,  John Summerson believing it to be substantially by Henry William Inwood,[tpl]cite book |last1=Summerson |first1=John |title= Georgian London|year=1962|edition=revised |publisher=Penguin Books |location= Harmondsworth |page=217[/tpl] who visited Athens in 1819, after the initial plans had been drawn up. and later published a book on the Erechtheum.
In 1823 Inwood repaired the roof at St Anne's, Soho,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41107 |title=St. Anne's Church |author=F. H. W.

In 1832  Inwood’s designs  for the new Westminster Hospital  in Broad Sanctuary, made in collaboration with  another son, Charles Frederick Inwood (1799–1840), were chosen from a number of invited submissions . The specifications had stipulated a Tudor-Gothic style, in sympathy with the nearby  Westminster Abbey. The Lancet described the design  for the 200-bed hospital as being in the “collegiate style”, and praised the practicality of its arrangement,  and its provision of light and ventilation.[tpl]cite journal|journal=The Lancet|date=18  August  1832|title=Rebuilding  of Westminster Hospital|page=631[/tpl]
Inwood exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1813 and 1817, showing two works entitled "Design for a Public Building" one for "a National building", and in 1817, a picture of East Grinstead church. Between 1819 and 1824 he showed, jointly with Henry William Inwood, drawings for St Pancras New Church and the chapels at Regent Square and Camden Town, and in 1838 a design for an Ionic garden temple at Clandon Park, then under construction.  In 1832-3 he showed drawings for Westminster Hospital jointly with Charles  Inwood. His address is given with various street numbers as Southampton Place or Euston Square.
He was the author of the Tables for the Purchasing of Estates, Freehold, Copyhold, or Leasehold, Annuities, &c, a work based on the tables of Baily and Smart, first published  in 1811 and frequently revised and reprinted.
William Railton, the architect of Nelson's Column, was his pupil.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Railton, William|last= Marius O'Donoghue|first=Freeman|volume=47|no-icon=1[/tpl]
