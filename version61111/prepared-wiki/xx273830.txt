They widened when they realized no Notre Dame jerseys were in the picture they'll remember forever. 'Oh my god. Where did he come from?' said one man standing in the South endzone.  ...  Gallon blended in with his teammates on the sideline, until a blue blur came streaking out of nowhere."[tpl]cite news|author=Tim Rohan|title=Tim Rohan: History won't care Michigan wasn't supposed to win this game|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=September 11, 2011|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/sports/tim-rohan-history-doesnt-care-michigan-wasnt-supposed-win-game[/tpl]
