Gallon blended in with his teammates on the sideline, until a blue blur came streaking out of nowhere."[tpl]cite news|author=Tim Rohan|title=Tim Rohan: History won't care Michigan wasn't supposed to win this game|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=September 11, 2011|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/sports/tim-rohan-history-doesnt-care-michigan-wasnt-supposed-win-game[/tpl]
