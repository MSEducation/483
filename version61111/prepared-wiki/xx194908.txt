Wainscott was a former railroad station on the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road in Wainscott, New York. It was opened in either 1897 or 1898 by the Brooklyn and Montauk Railroad, rebuilt in 1915 by the LIRR, and closed in 1938.
Wainscott Station has the distinction of being the only LIRR station to have segregated waiting rooms, in spite of the fact that New York State Legislature never allowed segregated facilities.[tpl]cite book |last=Ziel |first=Ron |title=The Long Island Rail Road in Early Photographs |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-486-26301-0 |page=76[/tpl] Some sources claim that another station was segregated, but this has yet to be confirmed. In early 1938, the station was closed due to the effects of the Great Depression, and was moved to a beach, where it has served as a private residence since then.[tpl]cite book |first=Ron |last=Zeil |first2=Richard |last2=Wettereau |title=Victorian Railroad Stations of Long Island |year=1988 |publisher=Sunrise Special |location=Bridgehampton |page=103 |oclc=19319353[/tpl]
