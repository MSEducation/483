Potiphar or Potifar [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|t|ɨ|f|ər[/tpl][tpl]Hebrew Name 2 |hebrew1=פּוֹטִיפַר |hebrew2=פּוֹטִיפָר |stan1=Potifar |tiber1=Pôṭîp̄ar |tiber2=Pôṭîp̄ār[/tpl]; Arabic: بوتيفار ; Egyptian origin: [tpl]unicode|p-di-p-rʿ[/tpl] "he whom Ra gave" is a person in the Book of Genesis's account of Joseph. Potiphar is said to be the captain of the palace guard and is referred to without name in the Quran. Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, is taken to Egypt where he is sold to Potiphar as a household slave. Potiphar makes Joseph the head of his household, but Potiphar's wife, furious at Joseph for resisting her attempts to seduce him, accuses him falsely of attempted rape. Potiphar casts Joseph into prison,  to the notice of Pharaoh through his ability to interpret the dreams of other prisoners.
Potiphar's wife is not named in the Bible. The medieval Sefer HaYashar, a commentary on the Torah, gives it as Zuleikha, as do many Islamic traditions and thus the Persian poem called Yusuf and Zulaikha from Jami's Haft Awrang ("Seven thrones"). Because of the Egyptian location wherein the scene is staged, it is not impossible to detect in this biblical tale also a more recent echo of the very old Egyptian fable of the two brothers Bata and Anpu.Encyclopedia Britannica, Jospeh (biblical figure)http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/anpu_and_bata.htm

==Etymology==

Potiphar is the shortened form of "Potiphera" meaning "he whom Ra gave." This is analogous to the name "Theodore" in our own Western world.[tpl]cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Guide to the Bible - Old Testament|year=1967|page=106[/tpl]

It is difficult to place Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or time period. On the Jewish calendar, Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the Second Intermediate Period or very beginning of the New Kingdom. The Torah in which the story appears (see also the Bible and the Koran) was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the documentary hypothesis, the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the Yahwist source, and stands in the same place that the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh's dreams stand in the Elohist text. 
According to Dr. G.J. Wenham (IVP New Bible Commentary) execution was normal for rape cases, and thus the story implies that Potiphar may have had doubts about his wife's account.
