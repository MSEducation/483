''Trans'' fats are unsaturated fats which are uncommon in nature but can be created artificially.
Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated i.e. have double bonds, or saturated i.e. have no double bonds. In nature, fatty acids generally have cis (as opposed to trans) configurations.[tpl]cite pmid|17625687[/tpl] In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40 °C). Trans fats are a contaminant introduced by a side reaction on the catalyst in partial hydrogenation.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

Trans fats levels can be reduced or eliminated: alternatives are using saturated fats such as lard, palm oil or completely hydrogenated fats, interesterified fat, and alternative formulations that allow unsaturated fats to be used to replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats. Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for trans fat: complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated, both cis and trans, fats.

==History==

Nobel laureate Paul Sabatier worked in the late 1890s to develop the chemistry of hydrogenation, which enabled the margarine, oil hydrogenation, and synthetic methanol industries.[tpl]cite book|title=Nobel Lectures, Chemistry, 1901–1921|year=1966|publisher=Elsevier[/tpl] Reprinted online: [tpl]cite web|title=Paul Sabatier, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1912|publisher=Nobel Foundation|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1912/sabatier-bio.html|accessdate=2007-01-07[/tpl] Whereas Sabatier considered hydrogenation of only vapors, the German chemist Wilhelm Normann showed in 1901 that liquid oils could be hydrogenated, and patented the process in 1902.[tpl]patent|de|141029|Process for converting unsaturated fatty acids or their glycerides into saturated compounds[/tpl][tpl]patent|gb|190301515|Process for converting unsaturated fatty acids or their glycerides into saturated compounds[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Patterson|first=HBW|title=Hydrogenation|journal=Sci Lecture Papers Series|year=1998|url=http://www.soci.org/SCI/publications/2001/pdf/pb97.pdf|accessdate=2007-01-07|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] During the years 1905–1910, Normann built a fat-hardening facility in the Herford company. At the same time, the invention was extended to a large-scale plant in Warrington, England, at Joseph Crosfield & Sons, Limited. It took only two years until the hardened fat could be successfully produced in the plant in Warrington, commencing production in the autumn of 1909. The initial year's production totalled nearly 3,000 tonnes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dgfett.de/history/normann/nr_fiedler.htm|title=Wilhelm Normann und die Geschichte der Fetthärtung von Martin Fiedler, 2001|date=2011-12-20[/tpl]
In 1909, Procter & Gamble acquired the US rights to the Normann patent;[tpl]cite web| last=Shurtleff|first=William|coauthors=Akiko Aoyagi|title=History of Soybeans and Soyfoods: 1100 B.C. to the 1980s|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051018105337/http://www.thesoydailyclub.com/SFC/MSPproducts501.asp|url=http://www.thesoydailyclub.com/SFC/MSPproducts501.asp|archivedate=2005-10-18[/tpl] in 1911, they began marketing the first hydrogenated shortening, Crisco (composed largely of partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil). Further success came from the marketing technique of giving away free cookbooks in which every recipe called for Crisco.
Normann's hydrogenation process made it possible to stabilize affordable whale oil or fish oil for human consumption, a practice kept secret to avoid consumer distaste.
Prior to 1910,[tpl]where|date=September 2012[/tpl] dietary fats consisted primarily of butterfat, beef tallow, and lard. During Napoleon's reign in France in the early 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk; it did not gain acceptance in the U.S. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the U.S. as a source of protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the "need" (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that hydrogenated fats provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of the refrigerator and immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat. Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry, sold in England, began to replace lard in the baking of bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920.[tpl]cite book|author=Fred A.

In the 1940s, Catherine Kousmine researched the effects of trans fats on cancer.http://www.news-medical.net/health/Trans-Fat-History.aspx
Production of hydrogenated fats increased steadily until the 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the US and other western countries. At first, the argument was a financial one due to lower costs; advocates also said that the unsaturated trans fats of margarine were healthier than the saturated fats of butter.[tpl]cite web| author=Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC|title=Trans fatty acids and coronary heart disease|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/reviews/transfats.html|accessdate=2006-09-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060903061226/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/reviews/transfats.html|archivedate=September 3, 2006[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

In chemical terms, trans fat is a fat (lipid) molecule that contains one or more double bonds in trans geometric configuration.
A double bond may exhibit one of two possible configurations: trans or cis. In trans configuration, the carbon chain extends from opposite sides of the double bond, whereas, in cis configuration, the carbon chain extends from the same side of the double bond. The trans molecule is a straighter molecule. The cis molecule is bent.
Fatty acids are characterized as either saturated or unsaturated based on the presence of double bonds in its structure. If the molecule contains no double bonds, it is said to be saturated; otherwise, it is unsaturated to some degree.[tpl]cite book|title=Food lipids: chemistry, nutrition, and biotechnology|pages=1–2|isbn=0-8247-0749-4|editors=Casimir C. Akoh, David B. Min.|year=2002|publisher=M. Dekker|location=New York[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02330.html|chapter="fatty acid"|title=IUPAC Gold book|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry[/tpl]
Only unsaturated fats can be trans or cis fat, since only a double bond can be locked to these orientations. Saturated fatty acids are never called trans fats because they have no double bonds, and, therefore, all their bonds are freely rotatable. Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance.
Carbon atoms are tetravalent, forming four covalent bonds with other atoms, whereas hydrogen atoms bond with only one other atom. In saturated fatty acids, each carbon atom (besides the last) is connected to its two neighbour carbon atoms as well as two hydrogen atoms. In unsaturated fatty acids, the carbon atoms that are missing a hydrogen atom are joined by double bonds rather than single bonds so that each carbon atom participates in four bonds.
Hydrogenation of an unsaturated fatty acid refers to the addition of hydrogen atoms to the acid, causing double bonds to become single ones, as carbon atoms acquire new hydrogen partners (to maintain four bonds per carbon atom). Full hydrogenation results in a molecule containing the maximum amount of hydrogen (in other words, the conversion of an unsaturated fatty acid into a saturated one). Partial hydrogenation results in the addition of hydrogen atoms at some of the empty positions, with a corresponding reduction in the number of double bonds. Typical commercial hydrogenation is partial in order to obtain a malleable mixture of fats that is solid at room temperature, but melts upon baking (or consumption).
In most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bonds of the carbon chain (cis configuration — from the Latin, meaning "on the same side"). However, partial hydrogenation reconfigures most of the double bonds that do not become chemically saturated, twisting them so that the hydrogen atoms end up on different sides of the chain. This type of configuration is called trans, from the Latin, meaning "across".[tpl]cite book|author=Hill, John W and Kolb, Doris K|isbn=0136054498|title=Chemistry for changing times|publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall|year=2007[/tpl] The trans configuration is the lower energy form, and is favored when catalytically equilibrated as a side reaction in hydrogenation.
The same molecule, containing the same number of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2. They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that sets them apart. The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule. The trans configuration is straighter, while the cis configuration is noticeably kinked as can be seen from the three-dimensional representation shown above.
The trans fatty acid elaidic acid has different chemical and physical properties, owing to the slightly different bond configuration. It has a much higher melting point, 45 °C, than oleic acid, 13.4 °C, due to the ability of the trans molecules to pack more tightly, forming a solid that is more difficult to break apart.[tpl]cite book|title=Handbook of chemistry and physics|url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com|accessdate=2007-11-19|edition=88th|series=2007–2008|year=2007|publisher=Taylor and Francis|chapter=Section 7: Biochemistry|chapterurl=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com.proxy.library.vcu.edu/articles/07_05_86.pdf[/tpl] This notably means that it is a solid at human body temperatures.
In food production, the goal is not to simply change the configuration of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon. Instead, the goal is to decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid. This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity (in which free radicals attack double bonds). Production of trans fatty acids is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.
Catalytic partial hydrogenation necessarily produces trans-fats, because of the reaction mechanism. In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid. The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either cis or trans, of which trans is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats.
Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have investigated whether hydrogenation can be achieved without the side effect of trans fat production. They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted — applying 1400 kPa (200 psi) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140 °C and 170 °C. The standard 140 kPa (20 psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat.[tpl]cite journal|author=Eller FJ|title=Preparation of spread oils meeting U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling requirements for trans fatty acids via pressure-controlled hydrogenation|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|year=2005|volume=53|issue=15|pages=5982–5984|pmid=16028984|doi=10.1021/jf047849|last2=List|first2=GR|last3=Teel|first3=JA|last4=Steidley|first4=KR|last5=Adlof|first5=RO[/tpl] The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature and the length of time during hydrogenation.
Trans fat levels may be measured. Measurement techniques include chromatography (by silver ion chromatography on thin layer chromatography plates, or small high-performance liquid chromatography columns of silica gel with bonded phenylsulfonic acid groups whose hydrogen atoms have been exchanged for silver ions). The role of silver lies in its ability to form complexes with unsaturated compounds. Gas chromatography and mid-infrared spectroscopy are other methods in use.

==Presence in food==

A type of trans fat occurs naturally in the milk and body fat of ruminants (such as cattle and sheep) at a level of 2–5% of total fat.[tpl]cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force|title=TRANSforming the Food Supply|date=June 2006|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_rep-rap_e.html|accessdate=2007-01-07[/tpl] Natural trans fats, which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic acid, originate in the rumen of these animals. CLA has two double bonds, one in the cis configuration and one in trans, which makes it simultaneously a cis- and a trans-fatty acid.
Animal-based fats were once the only trans fats consumed, but by far the largest amount of trans fat consumed today is created by the processed food industry as a side effect of partially hydrogenating unsaturated plant fats (generally vegetable oils). These partially hydrogenated fats have displaced natural solid fats and liquid oils in many areas, the most notable ones being in the fast food, snack food, fried food, and baked goods industries.
Partially hydrogenated oils have been used in food for many reasons. Partial hydrogenation increases product shelf life and decreases refrigeration requirements. Many baked foods require semi-solid fats to suspend solids at room temperature; partially hydrogenated oils have the right consistency to replace animal fats such as butter and lard at lower cost. They are also an inexpensive alternative to other semi-solid oils such as palm oil.
Up to 45% of the total fat in those foods containing artificial trans fats formed by partially hydrogenating plant fats may be trans fat. Baking shortenings, in general, contain 30% trans fats compared to their total fats, whereas animal fats from ruminants such as butter contain up to 4%. Margarines not reformulated to reduce trans fats may contain up to 15% trans fat by weight.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hunter|first=JE|year=2005|title=Dietary levels of trans fatty acids" basis for health concerns and industry efforts to limit use|journal=Nutrition Research|volume=25|pages=499–513|doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2005.04.002|issue=5[/tpl]
It has been established that trans fats in human milk fluctuate with maternal consumption of trans fat, and that the amount of trans fats in the bloodstream of breastfed infants fluctuates with the amounts found in their milk. Reported percentages of trans fats (compared to total fats) in human milk range from 1% in Spain, 2% in France, 4% in Germany, and 7% in Canada and the United States.[tpl]cite journal|author=Innis, Sheila M and King, D Janette|title=trans fatty acids in human milk are inversely associated with concentrations of essential all-cis n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and determine trans, but not n-6 and n-3, fatty acids in plasma lipids of breast-fed infants|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=September 1, 1999|volume=70|issue=3|pages=383–390|pmid=10479201|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/383.abstract[/tpl]
Trans fats are used in shortenings for deep-frying in restaurants, as they can be used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available.[tpl]cite web|last=NYC Board of Health|title=Board of Health Approves Regulation to Phase Out Artificial Trans Fat: FAQ|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/cardio/cardio-transfat-healthcode-faq.shtml#7|accessdate=2007-01-07[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl] As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark (where trans fats are restricted). At KFC, the pattern was reversed with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the US there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.[tpl]cite news|title=What's in that french fry?

==Nutritional guidelines==

The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) advises the United States and Canadian governments on nutritional science for use in public policy and product labeling programs. Their 2002 Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids[tpl]cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|pages=i|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/R1.html[/tpl] contains their findings and recommendations regarding consumption of trans fat (summary).
Their recommendations are based on two key facts. First, "trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health", whether of animal or plant origin.[tpl]cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=447|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/447.html[/tpl] Second, while both saturated and trans fats increase levels of LDL, trans fats also lower levels of HDL; thus increasing the risk of coronary heart disease. The NAS is concerned "that dietary trans fatty acids are more deleterious with respect to coronary heart disease than saturated fatty acids". This analysis is supported by a 2006 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) scientific review that states "from a nutritional standpoint, the consumption of trans fatty acids results in considerable potential harm but no apparent benefit."[tpl]cite journal|author=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|year=2006|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|pmid=16611951[/tpl]
Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.
Despite this concern, the NAS dietary recommendations have not recommended the elimination of trans fat from the diet. This is because trans fat is naturally present in many animal foods in trace quantities, and therefore its removal from ordinary diets might introduce undesirable side effects and nutritional imbalances if proper nutritional planning is not undertaken. The NAS has, therefore, "recommended that trans fatty acid consumption be as low as possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet".[tpl]cite book|last=Food and nutrition board, institute of medicine of the national academies|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients)|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|page=424|url=http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309085373/html/424.html[/tpl] Like the NAS, the World Health Organization has tried to balance public health goals with a practical level of trans fat consumption, recommending in 2003 that trans fats be limited to less than 1% of overall energy intake.
The US National Dairy Council has asserted that the trans fats present in animal foods are of a different type than those in partially hydrogenated oils, and do not appear to exhibit the same negative effects.[tpl]cite journal| author=National Dairy Council|title=comments on 'Docket No. 2003N-0076 Food Labeling: Trans Fatty Acids in Nutrition Labeling'|date=2004-06-18|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/04/June04/062304/03N-0076-emc00228-01.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-01-07[/tpl] While a recent scientific review agrees with the conclusion (stating that "the sum of the current evidence suggests that the Public health implications of consuming trans fats from ruminant products are relatively limited"), it cautions that this may be due to the low consumption of trans fats from animal sources compared to artificial ones.
More recent inquiry (independent of the dairy industry) has found in a 2008 Dutch meta-analysis that all trans fats, regardless of natural or artificial origin equally raise LDL and lower HDL levels [tpl]cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0009434[/tpl] Other studies though have shown different results when it comes to animal based trans fats like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). Although CLA is  known for its anticancer properties, researchers have also found that the cis-9, trans-11 form of CLA can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease and help fight inflammation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tricon S |title=Opposing effects of cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid on blood lipids in most healthy humans |journal=Am.

==Health risks==

Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils have been an increasingly significant part of the human diet for about 100 years (in particular, since the later half of the 20th century and where more processed foods are consumed), and some deleterious effects of trans fat consumption are scientifically accepted, forming the basis of the health guidelines discussed above.
The exact biochemical methods by which trans fats produce specific health problems are a topic of continuing research. One theory is that the human lipase enzyme works only on the cis configuration and cannot metabolize a trans fat.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] A lipase is a water-soluble enzyme that helps digest, transport, and process dietary lipids such as triglycerides, fats, and oils in most – if not all – living organisms. While the mechanisms through which trans fats contribute to coronary heart disease are fairly well understood, the mechanism for trans fat's effect on diabetes is still under investigation. Trans fatty acids may impair the metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs),[tpl]cite journal|author=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC|title=Influence of trans fatty acids on infant and fetus development|journal=Acta Microbiologica Polonica|volume=52|pages=67–74|year=2003|pmid=15058815[/tpl] but maternal pregnancy trans fatty acid intake has been inversely associated with LCPUFAs levels in infants at birth thought to underlie the positive association between breastfeeding and intelligence.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
High intake of trans fatty acids can lead to many health problems throughout one's life. Trans fat is abundant in fast food restaurants. It is consumed in greater quantities by people who do not have access to a diet consisting of fewer hydrogenated fats, or who often consume fast food. A diet high in trans fats can contribute to obesity, high blood pressure, and a greater risk for heart disease. East Harlem, for example, mostly has fast food restaurants and bodegas with few healthy alternatives, which might be a part of why 31% of adults in East Harlem are obese compared to 22% citywide and only 9% in the Upper East Side.NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Eating Well in Harlem: How Available is Healthy Food? 2007

===Coronary heart disease===

The primary health risk identified for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).[tpl]cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force|title=TRANSforming the Food Supply (Appendix 9iii)|date=June 2006|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070225021532/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html|accessdate=2007-01-09[/tpl] (Consultation on the health implications of alternatives to trans fatty acids: Summary of Responses from Experts) A 1994 study estimated that over 30,000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States are attributable to the consumption of trans fats.[tpl]cite journal|author=Willett W, Ascherio, A|title=Trans Fatty Acids: Are the Effects Only Marginal?|journal=Circulation|volume=84|issue=5|pages=722–724|year=1994|doi=10.2105/ajph.84.5.722[/tpl] By 2006 upper estimates of 100,000 deaths were suggested.[tpl]cite journal|author=Zaloga GP, Harvey KA, Stillwell W, Siddiqui R|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Coronary Heart Disease|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume=21|pages=505–512|year=2006|doi=10.1177/0115426506021005505|pmid=16998148|issue=5[/tpl] A comprehensive review of studies of trans fats published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine reports a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and CHD, concluding that "On a per-calorie basis, trans fats appear to increase the risk of CHD more than any other macronutrient, conferring a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption (1 to 3% of total energy intake)".[tpl]cite journal|author=Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC|title=Trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease|journal=N.

The major evidence for the effect of trans fat on CHD comes from the Nurses' Health Study — a cohort study that has been following 120,000 female nurses since its inception in 1976. In this study, Hu and colleagues analyzed data from 900 coronary events from the study's population during 14 years of followup. He determined that a nurse's CHD risk roughly doubled (relative risk of 1.93, CI: 1.43 to 2.61) for each 2% increase in trans fat calories consumed (instead of carbohydrate calories). By contrast, for each 5% increase in saturated fat calories (instead of carbohydrate calories) there was a 17% increase in risk (relative risk of 1.17, CI: 0.97 to 1.41). "The replacement of saturated fat or trans unsaturated fat by cis (unhydrogenated) unsaturated fats was associated with larger reductions in risk than an isocaloric replacement by carbohydrates."[tpl]cite journal|last=Hu|first=FB|coauthors=Stampfer, MJ, Manson, JE, Rimm, E, Colditz, GA, Rosner, BA, Hennekens, CH, Willett, WC|year=1997|title=Dietary fat intake and the risk of coronary heart disease in women|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=21|pages=1491–1499|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711203372102|format=PDF|pmid=9366580[/tpl] Hu also reports on the benefits of reducing trans fat consumption. Replacing 2% of food energy from trans fat with non-trans unsaturated fats more than halves the risk of CHD (53%). By comparison, replacing a larger 5% of food energy from saturated fat with non-trans unsaturated fats reduces the risk of CHD by 43%.
Another study considered deaths due to CHD, with consumption of trans fats being linked to an increase in mortality, and consumption of polyunsaturated fats being linked to a decrease in mortality.[tpl]cite journal|last=Oh|first=K|coauthors=Hu, FB, Manson, JE, Stampfer, MJ, Willett, WC|year=2005|title=Dietary fat intake and risk of coronary heart disease in women: 20 years of follow-up of the nurses' health study|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=161|issue=7|pages=672–679|doi=10.1093/aje/kwi085|pmid=15781956[/tpl]
There are two accepted tests that measure an individual's risk for coronary heart disease, both blood tests. The first considers ratios of two types of cholesterol, the other the amount of a cell-signalling cytokine called C-reactive protein. The ratio test is more accepted, while the cytokine test may be more powerful but is still being studied. The effect of trans fat consumption has been documented on each as follows:

===Other health risks===

There are suggestions that the negative consequences of trans fat consumption go beyond the cardiovascular risk. In general, there is much less scientific consensus asserting that eating trans fat specifically increases the risk of other chronic health problems:

==Public Perception of trans fat==

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. Research scientist Ali Bell, and research associate Dufton Lewis, wanted to find out how much the public knows about trans fatty acids, and what it feels about it. Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that they looked at the ingredients, and neglected to pay attention to the amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, “Yes.” However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn’t change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because the taste and food gratification takes more precedence over the perceived risk to health. “The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status”.Nasser, Roseann, Stephanie Cook, and Sharon Walker.

===International===

The international trade in food is standardized in the Codex Alimentarius. Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/74/CXS_019e.pdf|title=CODEX STAN 19-1999|format=PDF[/tpl] Non-dairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 256-2007.CODEX STAN 256–2007 "Standard for Fat Spreads and Blended Spreads" (PDF file) In the Codex Alimentarius, trans fat to be labelled as such is defined as the geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated by at least one methylene group (−CH2−) carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration. This definition excludes specifically the healthy trans fats (vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) that are present especially in human milk, dairy products, and beef.

===Australia===

The Australian federal government has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy of reducing trans fats from fast foods. The former federal assistant health minister, Christopher Pyne, asked fast food outlets to reduce their trans fat usage. A draft plan was proposed, with a September 2007 timetable, in order to reduce reliance on trans fats and saturated fats.[tpl]cite news|title=Fast food outlets asked to cut down trans fat usage|date=2007-03-12|publisher=ABC|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090308124535/http://abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1869810.htm|accessdate=2007-03-12[/tpl]

The NICE report predicted that 40,000 out of 150,000 cardiovascular disease deaths this year[tpl]when|date=April 2013[/tpl] could be prevented by eliminating industrial trans fats and lowering salt and saturated fat intake. This would also save the National Health Service over £1bn. However, the recommendations were greeted unhappily by the food industry, which stated that it was already voluntarily dropping the trans fat levels to below the WHO recommendations of a maximum of 2 per cent.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Rejecting an outright ban, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley launched on 15 March 2012 a voluntary pledge to remove artificial trans fats by the end of the year. Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so.

===United States===

Before 2006, consumers in the United States could not directly determine the presence (or quantity) of trans fats in food products. This information could only be inferred from the ingredient list, notably from the partially hydrogenated ingredients. According to the FDA, the average American consumes 5.8 grams of trans fat per day (2.6% of energy intake)"Revealing 'trans' fats". US Food and Drug Administration Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during actual ingestion."World Health Organization", Toxicological Evaluation of Some Food Additives Including Anticaking Agents, Antimicrobials, Antioxidants, Emulsifiers and Thickening Agents" Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee, 25 June – 4 July 1975. Inchem.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-22. Critically important is the apparent fact [tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] that trans fatty acids that are part of mono- and diglycerides are not required to be listed on the ingredients label as making contributions to calorie count or trans fatty acid content.
On July 11, 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a regulation requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements.Regulation: 21 CFR 101.9 (c)(2)(ii).

However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5 grams per serving can be listed as 0 grams trans fat on the food label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080329060919/http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/laws-government-regulations/672109-1.html|title=FDA requires trans fatty acid labeling for foods and dietary supplements|publisher=Allbusiness.com|accessdate=2011-07-14|author=Misko, George|date=2003-10-01[/tpl] According to a study published in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at risk for heart disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/541842/|title=Newswise: most consumers misinterpret meaning of trans fat information on Nutrition Facts panel|accessdate=2008-06-19[/tpl] The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as "trans fat free" or "low trans fat", as they could not determine a "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods.[tpl]cite web|last=Food and Drug Administration|title=FDA food labeling: trans fatty acids in nutrition labeling; consumer research to consider nutrient content and health claims and possible footnote or disclosure statements|page=41059|date=2003-07-11|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr03711b.html|accessdate=2007-01-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061219020542/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr03711b.html|archivedate=December 19, 2006[/tpl] However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.[tpl]cite web|last=American Public Health Association|title=Restricting trans fatty acids in the food supply|url=http://www.apha.org/advocacy/policy/policysearch/default.htm?id=1366|accessdate=2008-02-28[/tpl] The FDA defines trans fats as containing one or more trans linkage that are not in a conjugated system. This is an important distinction, as it distinguishes non-conjugated synthetic trans fats from naturally occurring fatty acids with conjugated trans double bonds, such as conjugated linoleic acid.
Critics of the plan, including FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, have expressed concern that the 0.5 gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat. This is because a person eating many servings of a product, or eating multiple products over the course of the day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat.[tpl]cite news|last=Shockman|first=Luke|title=Trans fat: 'Zero' foods add up|publisher=Toledo Blade|date=2005-12-05|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090621150507/http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051205/NEWS32/512030320|accessdate=2007-01-18[/tpl] Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary heart disease and 250 to 500 deaths each year. This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats as well as manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products.
The American Medical Association supports any state and federal efforts to ban the use of artificial trans fats in U.S. restaurants and bakeries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/11/11/us-ama-trans-fat-idUSTRE4AA6C720081111|title=AMA supports trans-fat bans|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-11-11|accessdate=2011-07-14[/tpl]
The American Public Health Association adopted a new policy statement regarding trans fats in 2007. These new guidelines, entitled Restricting Trans Fatty Acids in the Food Supply, recommend that the government require nutrition facts labeling of trans fats on all commercial food products. They also urge federal, state, and local governments to ban and monitor use of trans fats in restaurants. Furthermore, the APHA recommends barring the sales and availability of foods containing significant amounts of trans fat in public facilities including universities, prisons, and day care facilities etc.
On November 7, 2013, the FDA issued a preliminary determination that trans fats are not "generally recognized as safe", which was widely seen as a precursor to a reclassification of trans fats as a "food additive," meaning they could not be used in foods without specific regulatory authorization. This would have the effect of virtually eliminating trans fats from the US food supply.[tpl]cite news|title=Citing health risks, FDA moves to virtually eliminate trans fat|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-fda-trans-fat-20131107,0,5415335.story#axzz2jygxXj6U|date=2013-11-07|publisher=Los Angeles Times|last=Lopez|first=Ricardo[/tpl][ref]

Palm oil, a natural oil extracted from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), is increasingly being used as an alternative to partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications.Palm oil 'reasonable' replacement for trans fats, say experts Food Navigator, (2005-12-16).Palm oil blend could offer trans fat free shortenings for bakery: Study Food Navigator, 17 Feb 2009. However, a 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.[tpl]cite journal|author=Vega-López, Sonia et al.|date=July 2006|title=Palm and partially hydrogenated soybean oils adversely alter lipoprotein profiles compared with soybean and canola oils in moderately hyperlipidemic subjects|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|publisher=American Society for Nutrition|volume=84|issue=1|pages=54–62|pmid=16825681[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090502084827.htm |title=Palm oil not a healthy substitute for trans fats, study finds|date=2009-05-11 |work=ScienceDaily |accessdate=2010-05-12[/tpl]
