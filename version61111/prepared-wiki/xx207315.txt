[[Sahib ul-Makam al-Rafi]]

CATEGORIES: Styles (manners of address), Noble titles of Egypt

Sahib ul-Makam al-Rafi ([tpl]Lang-ar|صاحب المقام الرفيع[/tpl]) (alternative spelling: Saheb Al-Makam Al-Rafie) was a manner of address used in Egypt during the monarchical era that was attached to the second highest court rank. After 1936, it was conferred for life on recipients of the Chain of Fuad I. As it has no equivalent in the English language, it is generally translated as His Excellency. If translated literally, the exact title in English would be Holder of the Eminent Position.
