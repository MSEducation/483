हरियाणए देसे असंखगाम, गामियण जणि अणवरथ काम| 
परचक्क विहट्टणु सिरिसंघट्टणु, जो सुरव इणा परिगणियं| 
रिउ रुहिरावट्टणु बिउलु पवट्टणु, ढिल्ली नामेण जि भणियं|
Translation: There are countless villages in Haryana country. The villagers there work hard. They don't accept domination of others, and are experts in making the blood of their enemies flow. Indra himself praises this country. The capital of this country is Dhilli.
जहिं असिवर तोडिय रिउ कवालु, णरणाहु पसिद्धउ अणंगवालु || 
वलभर कम्पाविउ णायरायु, माणिणियण मणसंजनीय ||
