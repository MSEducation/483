==Silent Splendor==

By far the most famous section of the Cave of the Winds is the Silent Splendor room.  Discovered in 1984,History of Cave - from the official website the room contains numerous rare crystalline speleothems.  Unfortunately, the room must be sealed off from the general public in order to maintain its delicate environment.
Other names for the crystal formations are White Beaded Anthodite, Cave Coral, or Cave Flowers. Also commonly considered to be Beaded Helectites which  defy the laws of gravity by growing in strange directions and not gravity forced down like many cave formations.
Silent Splendor is sealed from public view by an Environmental Gate, a large tube made of PVC that seals in moisture to allow the area of the cave to continue forming.
