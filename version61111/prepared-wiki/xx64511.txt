The minim (abbreviated min, ♏ or 13px) is a unit of volume in both the imperial and US customary systems of measurement.  Specifically it is [tpl]frac|60[/tpl] of a fluidramalso spelt fluid drachm or fluid dram or [tpl]frac|480[/tpl] of a fluid ounce.CIA World Factbook[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Thomas (médecin)|title=The modern practice of physic, exhibiting the... symptoms, prognostics, morbid appearances and improved method of treating the diseases of all climates...|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V_laAAAAQAAJ&pg=PAxv#v=onepage&q=Octarius&f=false|accessdate=17 December 2011|year=1819|publisher=Longman|page=xv[/tpl]
The minim was introduced in the 1809 edition of the The pharmacopœia of the Royal College of Physicians of London as an alternative to the drop, which had previously been the smallest unit of Apothecaries' measure.[tpl]cite book|author1=Royal College of Physicians of London|author2=Richard Powell|title=The pharmacopoeia of the Royal College of Physicians of London, M.

(At the time, the phenomenon of surface tension was not well-understood.) The minim, on the other hand, was measured with a graduated glass tube known as a "minimometer"[tpl]cite book|author=Philological Society (Great Britain)|title=The European magazine, and London review|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lyEYAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA123|accessdate=18 December 2011|year=1814|publisher=Philological Society of London|page=123[/tpl] later known as the minim-tube.[tpl]cite book|author=Clara S.

Apothecaries' measures are fully described in the Weights and Measures Act of 1878. In the United Kingdom, the 1963 Weights and Measures Act provided for the abolition of the minim, fluid scruple, and fluid drachm, all already obsolete. Actual delegalization occurred on February 1, 1971. 
While the use of the minim, along with other such measures, has been reduced by the adoption of the metric system, it still persists in some countries in the measurement of dosages of medicine.
