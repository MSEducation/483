Lieutenant Jean Chaput was a World War I flying ace credited with 16 aerial victories. He served in the army infantry beginning in 1913. He transferred to aviation in 1914. He qualified as a pilot by February 1915, was assigned to Escadrille 28, and scored his first victory on 12 June 1915 while piloting a Caudron. He was awarded the Medaille Militaire for this action. Three days later, he was wounded. On 10 July, he suffered the first of two serious wounds that would cause lengthy interruptions in his flying career. He did not return to duty until January 1916.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/france/chaput.php Retrieved 7 January 2010.
