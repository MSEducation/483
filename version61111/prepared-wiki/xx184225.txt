Zengena Lake ([tpl]lang-am|ዘንገና ህይቅ[/tpl]) is a crater lake located at [tpl]coord|10|54|50|N|36|58|00|E[/tpl] in the Awi Zone of the Amhara Region in Ethiopia. It is situated between the towns of Injibara and Kessa, only 200 m from the Addis Ababa-Bahir Dar highway at an elevation of 2500 m. The diameter of the lake is roughly 1 km. With a maximum depth of 166 m, it is the second deepest lake in Ethiopia after Lake Shala. Its rim is made of unconsolidated ash deposits. Zengena is most likely a maar lake formed by volcanic explosion and collapse.Tenalem 2009, p. 65
