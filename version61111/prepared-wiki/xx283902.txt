CATEGORIES: 2012 EPs, Charlotte Church albums

ONE is the first extended play by Welsh recording artist Charlotte Church. It is the first in a series of five EPs and marks another musical direction of Church, departing her pop sound that is heard in her last two albums Tissues and Issues and Back to Scratch. This marks her first alternative rock material. It was released on 3 September 2012 and is preceded by the lead single "How Not to Be Surprised When You're a Ghost". ONE and TWO were combined for a US release on 12 March 2013.[tpl]cite web|author=Jason Lipshutz |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1548402/charlotte-church-talks-first-us-album-in-a-decade-listen-to-new-song|title=Charlotte Church Talks First U.S. Album in a Decade: Listen to New Song 'Glitterbombed' |publisher=Billboard Magazine |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] Church promoted ONE and TWO in the US with her first North American performances in almost a decade.
