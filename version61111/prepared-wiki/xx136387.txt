[[Black and white cookie]]

CATEGORIES: Cookies

A black and white cookie, or half and half cookie, is a soft, sponge-cake-like shortbread which is iced on one half with vanilla fondant, and on the other half by chocolate fondant. It is similar to a neenish tart, although neenish tarts are filled with a cream center, whereas a black and white cookie is not.
Notably, this style cookie is often seen as a particularly "New York" snack.
Although bearing a superficial resemblance to black and white cookies, halfmoon cookies, popular in Central New York, are made with a significantly different recipe. The traditional halfmoon cookie is a devil's food cake cookie with buttercream frosting, resulting in a cookie that is richer and moister than the black and white cookie. Halfmoon cookies are now also available with a vanilla cookie base.

Cookies of this style are collectively known as "Black and White cookies" or "half-and-halfs". In Germany where these cookies usually are completely iced with the vanilla or with chocolate fondant only, they are called an Amerikaner (American).http://www.beyondburgersandbratwurst.com/2007/03/29/the-black-and-white-cookie-meets-the-amerikaner/ On October 19, 2008, Barack Obama dubbed them Unity Cookies at a deli in Ft.

==History and half-moons==

There is some confusion as to the origin of the black-and-white cookie. The half-moon common in Upstate New York and New England is sometimes confused with the black and white cookie but is made with a different recipe. In New York City, however, one will find only black-and-whites. None-the-less, while the two names are often used interchangeably, there are considerable differences between the two; most notably in the textures of the base and the icing, with black-and-whites having a drier, cookie-like base and fondant frosting. And with the cookie also being bigger than most half-moons.http://inwithskin.com/half-moon-cookies-easter-stylehttp://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/01/best-black-and-white-cookie-nyc-nussbaum-wu.htmlhttp://www.originalhalfmooncookie.com/spot-the-fakes.html
Half-moons originated in Utica, New York at Hemstrought's Bakery in the early part of the 20th century. Half-moons most often come with a chocolate cake base, dark fudge icing on one side and sugary white frosting for the "half moon" side.  Hemstrought's also made a vanilla cake base with fudge and white frosting, as well as full 'vanilla moons' and 'coconut moons,' with either a chocolate or vanilla cake base. The original Hemstrought's half moons bakery closed their doors a few years ago;  they, however,  still bake half-moons for local supermarkets, where they are still available.http://www.howeieat.com/in-search-of/hemstrought-bakerys-chocolatehalf-moon-cookie-recipe/http://cnynews.com/happy-birthday-half-moon-cookies-an-upstate-tradition-but-which-side-do-you-eat-first/ 
The typical New York City and Long Island black-and-whites have a vanilla cake base with fudge and white frosting.  In the Seinfeld episode "The Dinner Party", Jerry eats a black-and-white cookie while waiting in a bakery with Elaine. He compares the cookie to a metaphor for racial harmony and that people should "Look to the cookie!"http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/01/the-best-black-and-white-cookies.html
