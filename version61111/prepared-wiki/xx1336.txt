Caelum [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|əm[/tpl] is a faint constellation in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Its name means "the chisel" in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Scalptorium ("the engraver's chisel"). It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0.038 steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis.
Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. The constellation's brightest star, Alpha Caeli, is only of magnitude 4.45, and only one other star (Gamma1 Caeli) is brighter than magnitude 5. Other notable objects in Caelum are RR Caeli, a binary star with one planet approximately [tpl]convert|20.13|pc|ly[/tpl] away; X Caeli, a Delta Scuti variable that forms an optical double with Gamma1 Caeli; and HE0450-2958, a Seyfert galaxy that at first appeared as just a jet with no host galaxy visible.

==History==

Caelum was first introduced in the eighteenth century by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a French astronomer who also introduced thirteen other southern constellations at the same time.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Lacaille |last = Ridpath |first = Ian[/tpl] While the name Lacaille gave the constellation was originally romanized to Caelum Scalptorium ("The Engraver's Chisel"), Francis Baily shortened this name to Caelum after a suggestion by John Herschel.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Caelum |last = Ridpath |first = Ian[/tpl] In Lacaille's original chart, the constellation was shown as a burin and an échoppe, although it has come to be recognized simply as a chisel.[tpl]cite book |last1= Ridpath  |first1= Ian  |first2 = Wil|last2 = Tirion |title= Stars and Planets Guide |year= 2001|publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn = 0-691-08913-2[/tpl] Johann Elert Bode stated the name as plural, Caela Scalptoris, but this did not stick.

==Characteristics==

Caelum is bordered by Dorado and Pictor to the south, Horologium and Eridanus to the east, Lepus to the north, and Columba to the west. Covering 125 square degrees, it ranks 81st of the 88 modern constellations in size. It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Southern Hemisphere's summer, and the whole constellation is visible for at least part of the year to observers south of latitude 41°N.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]efn|1=While parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between 41°N and 62°N, stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.[/tpl] Its main asterism consists of four stars, and twenty stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5. The constellation's boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 12-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [tpl]RA|04|19.5[/tpl] and [tpl]RA|05|05.1[/tpl], while the declination coordinates are between [tpl]dec|−27.02[/tpl] and [tpl]dec|−48.74[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal | title=Caelum, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cae|accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl] The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation "Cae" for the constellation in 1922.[tpl]cite journal | last=Russell | first=H.

==Notable features==

===Stars===

Caelum is a faint constellation, having no star brighter than fourth magnitude and only two brighter than fifth magnitude. Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, labeling them Alpha to Zeta in 1756, but omitted Epsilon and designated two nearby stars as Gamma. Bode extended the designations to Rho for other stars but most have fallen out of use.[tpl]cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company | location = Blacksburg, VA  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=58–59[/tpl] Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear Flamsteed designations.
The brightest star, Alpha Caeli, is a double star, containing an F-type main-sequence star of magnitude 4.45 and a red dwarf of magnitude 12.5, [tpl]convert|20.17|pc|ly[/tpl] from Earth.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=alf+Cae |title = * Alpha Caeli – Star in double system|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=CCDM%20J04406-4152%20B |title = GJ 174.1 B – Flare star|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl] Beta Caeli, another F-type star of magnitude 5.05, is further away, being located [tpl]convert|28.67|pc|ly[/tpl] from Earth. Unlike Alpha, Beta Caeli is a subgiant star, slightly evolved from the main sequence.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=bet+Cae |title = LTT 2063 – High proper-motion Star|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl] Delta Caeli, also of magnitude 5.05, is a B-type subgiant and is much farther from Earth, at [tpl]convert|216|pc|ly[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=del+Cae |title = * Delta Caeli – Star|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl]
Gamma1 Caeli is a double star with a red giant primary of magnitude 4.58 and a secondary of magnitude 8.1. The primary is [tpl]convert|55.59|pc|ly[/tpl] from Earth. The two components are difficult to resolve with small amateur telescopes because of their difference in visual magnitude and their close separation.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=gam+Cae |title = * Gamma Caeli – Star|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl] This star system forms an optical double with the unrelated X Caeli (Gamma2 Caeli), a Delta Scuti variable located [tpl]convert|98.33|pc|ly[/tpl] from Earth.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=X+Cae |title = V* X Caeli – Variable Star of Delta Scuti type|publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 13 January 2013[/tpl] These are a class of short-period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delsct|title=Delta Scuti and the Delta Scuti Variables|last=Templeton|first=M. |date=16 July 2010|work=Variable Star of the Season|publisher=AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers)|accessdate=2 February 2014[/tpl] X Caeli itself is also a binary star, specifically a contact binary,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=4518 |title=X Caeli |last1=X. |first1=V.

The only other variable star in Caelum visible to the naked eye is RV Caeli, a pulsating red giant of spectral type M1III,[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=RV+Cae |title = V* RV Caeli – Pulsating variable Star |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 17 January 2013[/tpl] which varies between magnitudes 6.44 and 6.56.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=4525 |title=RV Caeli |author=VSX|date=25 August 2009|work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=3 February 2014[/tpl]
Three other stars in Caelum are still occasionally referred to by their Bayer designations, although they are only on the edge of naked-eye visibility. Nu Caeli[tpl]cite web|author=Ashland Astronomy Studio: Where Art and Science Converge|title=Nu Caeli (HIP 22488) |url=http://www.astrostudio.org/xhip.php?hip=22488 |accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl] is another double star, containing a white giant of magnitude 6.07[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+30985 |title = HR 1557 – Star in double system |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 15 January 2013[/tpl] and a star of magnitude 10.66 with unknown spectral type.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=CD-41%20%201593B |title = CD-41 1593B – Star in double system |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 15 January 2013[/tpl] The system is approximately [tpl]convert|52.55|pc|ly[/tpl] away. Lambda Caeli,[tpl]cite web|author=Ashland Astronomy Studio: Where Art and Science Converge|title=Lambda Caeli (HIP 21998) |url=http://www.astrostudio.org/xhip.php?hip=21998 |accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl] at magnitude 6.24, is much redder and farther away, being a red giant around [tpl]convert|227|pc|ly[/tpl] from Earth.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HR+1518 |title = HR 1518 – Star |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 15 January 2013[/tpl] Zeta Caeli is even fainter, being only of magnitude 6.36. This star, located [tpl]convert|132|pc|ly[/tpl] away, is a K-type subgiant of spectral type K1.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=zet+Cae |title = Zeta Caeli – Star |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 15 January 2013[/tpl] The other twelve naked-eye stars in Caelum are not referred to by Bode's Bayer designations anymore, including RV Caeli.
One of the nearest stars in Caelum is the eclipsing binary star RR Caeli, at a distance of [tpl]convert|20.13|pc|ly[/tpl]. This star system consists of a dim red dwarf and a white dwarf.[tpl]cite doi|10.1086/300471[/tpl] Despite its closeness to the Earth, the system's apparent magnitude is only 14.40[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=RR+Cae |title = V* RR Caeli – Eclipsing binary of Algol type (detached) |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 15 January 2013[/tpl] due to the faintness of its components, and thus cannot be easily seen with amateur equipment. In 2012, the system was found to contain a giant planet, and there is evidence for a second substellar body.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1745-3933.2012.01228.x[/tpl] The system is a post-common-envelope binary and is losing angular momentum over time, which will eventually cause mass transfer from the red dwarf to the white dwarf. In approximately 9–20 billion years, this will cause the system to become a cataclysmic variable.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11564.x[/tpl]

===Deep-sky objects===

Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is rather devoid of deep-sky objects, and contains no Messier objects. Two galaxies somewhat of note are NGC 1571, a lenticular galaxy,[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=NGC+1571|title = NGC 1571 – Galaxy in Group of Galaxies |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 18 January 2013[/tpl] and NGC 1679, a barred spiral galaxy with a spectrum containing emission lines.[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=NGC+1679|title = NGC 1679 – Emission-line galaxy |publisher = SIMBAD | accessdate = 18 January 2013[/tpl] The only deep-sky object in Caelum to receive much attention is HE0450-2958, an unusual Seyfert galaxy. Originally, the jet's host galaxy proved elusive to find, and this jet appeared to be emanating from nothing.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nature04013[/tpl] Although it has been suggested that the object is an ejected supermassive black hole,[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1745-3933.2005.00124.x[/tpl] the host is now agreed to be a small galaxy that is difficult to see due to light from the jet and a nearby starburst galaxy.[tpl]cite doi|10.1086/518027[/tpl]
