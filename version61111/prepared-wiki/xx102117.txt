The Speaker of the Parliament of Finland (Finnish Eduskunnan puhemies, Swedish Riksdagens talman), along with two Deputy Speakers, is elected by Parliament during the first plenary session each year. Speakers are chosen for a year at a time. In addition to their preparing the work in plenary sessions the speakers also play a key role in Parliament's international co-operation, which includes visits by speakers and international delegations as well as participation in numerous interparliamentary organisations.
The Speaker and two Deputy Speakers are elected by Parliament from among its members by secret ballot. After the election the Speaker and Deputy Speakers each make the following solemn affirmation before Parliament:
Formally, the Speaker ranks second in the protocol, after the President of Finland.
An interim speaker is elected for the duration of government formation talks.
