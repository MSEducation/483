==Somoza's Dictatorship and Subsequent History==

Many locals that lived on the islands were forced to relocate to the mainland in the 1990s after having lived there for several generations.  During Somoza's dictatorship, members of his National Guard forced many of locals to either sell their islands or risk being forcibly removed.  After the Sandinista revolution, many of islands were returned to what should be considered their rightful owners.  By 1990 when the Sandinistas lost the election, land titles had yet to be provided to the residents.  Working through the then anti-Sandinista court system, the islands were returned to family members of the original National Guard who had "confiscated" the islands.  Some of these islands have been sold to wealthy Nicaraguans and foreigners resulting in an uncertain future for the local Nicaraguans who have traditionally lived on the islands and nearby peninsula.
