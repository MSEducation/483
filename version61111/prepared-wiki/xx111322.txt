Below the Radio is a compilation album put together by Jason Lytle of Grandaddy, and released in 2004 by Ultra Records. 
Ultra had approached Lytle via his management some time earlier with the idea, and he decided to include tracks that he considered "sleeper hits", identifying a common theme: "They all seem to have pretty conventional and familiar chord progressions. They all have vivid imagery for me with their words. There also seems to be a bit of sadness, but not necessarily despair."MacDonald, John (2002) "Jason Lytle made you a mixtape", Prefix, January 1, 2002, retrieved 2011-08-07 
The album also included a new Grandaddy track, "Nature Anthem".
Allmusic's Matt Collar stated the album "plays like a K-Tel commercial for Gen X sad sack-ism", calling it "pretty cool".
