==Description==

The front page of the newspaper features major news in the stamp world, including significant new stamp issues around the world, major auctions of rare items, significant new discoveries, philatelic controversies, and oddball news, such as a high price paid for an obvious fake put up on eBay.
Each issue has additional news stories inside, typically of limited or specialized interest. The bulk of the content, however, is in about a dozen regular features and an additional two dozen departments.
While many of the regular features go into more depth on traditional philatelic topics such as airmail or postmarks, several are notable:
The "Stamp Events Calendar" and "Auction Calendar" indicate forthcoming events.
Finally, there is a classified advertising section. A famous alumnus of this section is founder of Dell Computer,  Michael Dell, who sold stamps here at the age of 12.

==Format changes==

The periodical's format changed in 2006-7. Page dimensions shrank in two steps. Despite use of a small typeface, the length of feature articles shrank accordingly. In the most recent of the two reincarnations, the change in production technique allowed for an expanded use of color. Subscribers can read the complete contents online; a free monthly emailed newsletter contains excerpts. 
Linns now is produced by Amos Advantage, the owners of Scott Publishing Co., which also produces Scott Stamp Monthly magazine.  Linns' only significant, independently-owned rival in the U.S. is Global Stamp news.
