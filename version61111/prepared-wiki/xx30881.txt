Jolt Cola was a beverage originally made by The Jolt Company, Inc. Rochester, New York, which has since changed its name to Wet Planet Beverages. From the outset, Jolt's marketing strategy centered on the caffeine content, billing the drink as a means to promote wakefulness. The initial slogan was "All the sugar and twice the caffeine"; this slogan survived for 24 years.[tpl]cite web | url=http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2009/09/29/jolt-cola-looks-to-recharge-in-bankruptcy/ | accessdate=2014-04-14 | title=Jolt Cola Looks to Recharge In Bankruptcy[/tpl] This slogan was changed to "Maximum caffeine, more power" when cane sugar in the drink was replaced with the less expensive sweetener high fructose corn syrup.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
In the fall of 1987, the company began marketing a low calorie version, called Jolt 25, which was sweetened with a mixture of sugar and NutraSweet, and had 25 calories per 12-ounce can.
Jolt Cola later diversified into additional flavors named Cherry Bomb, Citrus Climax, Orange Blast, White Lightning (grape), Red Eye, and Electric Blue.
In 2003, the name was licensed to a Hackensack, New Jersey company named Gumrunners, Inc., which manufactures a line of caffeinated gum and mints bearing the Jolt label and the slogan "Chew More, Do More."[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] The gum comes in two flavors: Spearmint and Icy Mint.
In 2005, Jolt Cola revamped its product line. Jolt Cola changed its logo, and came in "battery" bottles, which make a loud popping sound when opened. The cans are 23.5 oz / 695 ml resealable aluminium bottles; the body of the bottle was similar to that of a standard aluminium can, but the top had a twist-off aluminum cap with a plastic gasket liner), and in smaller "Quick Fix" cans (8.4 oz / 250 ml single-use pull-tab aluminium cans, similar to those used for Red Bull) and "battery" cans (16 oz / 473 ml resealable aluminium cans with the same twist-off top as the Battery bottles). The Jolt Cola website claimed that the "Quick Fix" sizes were available at establishments that serve "adult beverages," for use as a mixer. The flavors of Jolt offered were also changed. Flavors offered were Cola, Blue Raspberry, Cherry Bomb (cherry cola), Silver (lemon-lime), Wild Grape, Orange Blast, Passionfruit (featuring a yellow can) and Ultra (a diet drink with Splenda as its artificial sweetener alongside guarana, ginseng, taurine, and vitamin B complex).
On September 28, 2009, The Jolt Company, Inc. filed Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Rochester, New York and simultaneously filed a motion to permit sale of the company's assets through a court-approved sale. The restructured company has now opened headquarters in Moonachie, New Jersey. Production of the Rexam 'battery bottles' ceased, and non-resealable cans is the major focus in the U.S.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
