The community was similar to that found today at the boundary between tundra and taiga in Siberia:[tpl]cite book|title=Prehistoric Europe: the economic basis|first=Grahame|last=Clark|publisher=Taylor&Francis|year=1968|page=13[/tpl]  species included the dwarf birch and the least willow.[tpl]cite book|title=Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future|first1=David|last1=Huddart|first2=Tim|last2=Stott|page=853|publisher=John Wiley&Sons|year=2010[/tpl] Park tundra stretched as far south as the Alps and the Pyrenees. Park tundra was common during the colder post-glacial periods, such as the Older Dryas (12,000-10,000 BCE) and the Younger Dryas (8800-8300 BCE).
