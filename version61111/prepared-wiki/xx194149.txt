==History==

Oshima launched its first ship in 1975.  The disruptions in the oil industry of the 1970s caused the company difficulties.  Between 1975 and 1979 Oshima reduced its workforce from 1,800 to 785.  In response, the company repositioned itself to specialize in building handymax and panamax bulk carriers.
The company has built 400 bulk carriers and delivers about 25 new ships annually to a worldwide client base.  As of 2003, the company has annual revenues of 61,900,000,000 Yen and a staff of 975 full-time employees.  An additional 660 workers work for Oshima on a subcontracting basis.
