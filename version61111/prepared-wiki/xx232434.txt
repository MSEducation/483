In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as B/side(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city,  and Below the New: A Russian Chronicle (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.[tpl]cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Skoller |title=Home sweet home.(Abigail Child's 1996 documentary film 'B/side') |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53436065.html |work=Afterimage |date=1998-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp |title=SMFA Boston - Abigail Child|accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081011043201/http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp| archivedate= 11 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity.  Digital works like Cake + Steak (2004) and The Future Is Behind You (2005) investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. MirrorWorld (2007) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess.  Key works include Surface Noise (2000), Dark Dark(2001), Where The Girls Are (2002), Cake and Steak (2004), The Future Is Behind You (2004), To and No Fro (2005), andMirror World (2006). Her feature video documentary On The Downlow (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little viewed underground scene.
In 2012, Child completed a feature film, Shape of Error, an imaginary “home movie”  based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.
Child is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012)  and a book of critical writings: This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film (2005).
A collection of writings by various authors on Is This What You Were Born For?, including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.
