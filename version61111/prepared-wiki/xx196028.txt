Landungsbrücken station is a railway station and transportation hub, located in Hamburg's St. Pauli quarter at the Landungsbrücken. It is located on the City S-Bahn line and the Hamburg U-Bahn.

==U-Bahn station==

The first U-Bahn line in Hamburg was begun in 1906 by the Hamburger Hochbahn. It forms a ring around the inner city. A station was also built near the Landungsbrücken in the slope of the Stintfang, designed by the architects, Johann Emil Schaudt and Walter Puritz. The station, which is called Landungsbrücken today, was built semi-open, which means that the western end is roofed with a concrete slab and the eastern end is left open. The station with the name of Hafentor (Harbor gate), together with the stretch Millerntor - Rathaus (today St. Pauli - Rathaus), finally went into operation on 29 June 1912. The striking tower at the entrance and the elevated railway stop, designed by Emil Schaudt, were torn down during construction of the City-S-Bahn. The new entrance with a copper roof (designed by Hans L. M. Loop and Fritz Trautwein) is connected to the ferry piers by a pedestrian bridge.
The eastern entrance was designed by Walter Puritz and was built in the 1920s.

==S-Bahn station==

The Landungsbrücken station of the S-Bahn has existed since 1975. It is part of the city line tunnel from the Hamburg main station to Altona, which was completely opened in 1979. Because of an S-Bahn train that burned in the station on 30 September 1984, the station has already had to be completely renovated.
The main entrance to the station has an escalator and is inside of the U-Bahn station building. There is a side entrance on Eichholz street.
The station can also be used as an air-raid shelter.
