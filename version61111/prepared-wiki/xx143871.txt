==Legend==

The Passio Typasii records that Typasius was a veteran of Tigava (today El Kherba), in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis.  Called to service by Maximian against the native Quinquegentiani, who were revolting against Roman rule, Typasius, who had become a Christian, refused to participate in this campaign.  He had retired from military life.  This brought him in direct confrontation with the authorities.  As his legend records:
It came to pass that Maximian was able to crush the rebels and thus fulfill Typasius' prophecy.  Typasius received an honorable discharge with the whole army as witness.  Typasius returned home and put away his weapons and military belt and built a monastery for himself on his land, where he remained for a long time.
However, after some years he was brought again to the authorities to enlist for active service and asked to sacrifice to the pagan gods.  Typasius refused to do either.  His belt and spears were then forcefully attached and handed to him; miraculously, his belt was immediately torn into pieces, and his spears were shattered.
Typasius was then taken into custody and soon cured the comes who had interrogated him, Claudius, from a seizure.  When Typasius was ordered to offer sacrifice once again to the gods, Claudius was unable to save him and reluctantly read the sentence.  Typasius was beheaded.  The men who had instigated his death burned with fever and pain and lost control of their limbs and bowels.  Their eyes fell out, and they died.
