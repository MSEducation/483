The Cuban Revolution (1953–1959) or the revolution on Cuba was an armed revolt conducted by Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and its allies against the government of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution began in July 1953, and finally ousted Batista on 1 January 1959, replacing his government with a revolutionary socialist state. The Movement organization later reformed along communist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October 1965."Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'". Jason Beaubien. NPR. 1 January 2009. Retrieved 9 July 2013. The Communist Party, now headed by Castro's brother Raúl, continues to govern Cuba today.
The Cuban Revolution had great domestic and international repercussions; in particular, it reshaped Cuba's relations with the United States, which continues an embargo against Cuba as of 2014. In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society. The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention into foreign military conflicts, including the Angolan Civil War and Nicaraguan Revolution.

==Background and causes==

Fulgencio Batista, who had served as the elected President of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, became President for the second time in March 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and cancelling the 1952 elections.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2013/mar/11/cuba-batista-fifth-revolution-1952|title=From the archive, 11 March 1952: Batista's revolution|work=The Guardian|date=11 March 2013|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] Although Batista had been a relative progressive during his first term,[tpl]Cite book|title=Inside the Cuban Revolution|author=Julia E.

During his first term as President, Batista had been supported by the Communist Party of Cuba, but during his second term he became strongly anti-communist, gaining him political support and military aid from the United States.James Stuart Olson (2000). Historical Dictionary of the 1950s. Greenwood Publishing Group. ISBN 0-313-30619-2. pp. 67–68. Batista developed a powerful security infrastructure to silence political opponents, leading John F. Kennedy to describe the Cuban government as a "complete police state" in 1960. In the months following the March 1952 coup, Fidel Castro, then a young lawyer and activist, petitioned for the overthrow of Batista, whom he accused of corruption and tyranny. However, Castro's constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/historyofthecaribbean/p/08fidelcastro.htm|title=Biography of Fidel Castro|publisher=About.com|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] After deciding that the Cuban state could not be overthrown through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed revolution. To this end, he and his brother Raúl founded a paramilitary organization known as "The Movement", stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana's disgruntled working class by the end of 1952.[tpl]cite book |title=Fidel: A Biography of Fidel Castro |last=Bourne |first= Peter G. |authorlink=Peter Bourne |year= 1986 |publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company |location=New York City |isbn=978-0396085188 |ref=harv|pages=68–69[/tpl]

==Early stages==

To strike their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Raúl Castro gathered 123 Movement fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on military installations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cubatravelinfo.com/historical-sites/moncada-army-barracks.html|title=Historical sites: Moncada Army Barracks|publisher=CubaTravelInfo|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] On 26 July 1953, the rebels unsuccessfully attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo.Faria, Miguel A. "Fidel Castro and the 26th of July Movement". NewsMax.com. 27 July 2004. Retrieved 10 July 2013. The exact number of rebels killed in the battle is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Castro claimed that nine were killed in the fighting, and an additional 56 were killed later after being captured by the Batista government.Ramonet, Ignacio, ibid, p. 133 Among the dead was Abel Santamaría, Castro's second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack.Ramonet, Ignacio, ibid, p. 672
The survivors, including Fidel and Raúl Castro, were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words; "Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me." Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the Presidio Modelo prison, located on Isla de Pinos, while Raúl was sentenced to 13 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~fcf/estoria.presidio.html|title=CHRONICLE OF AN UNFORGETTABLE AGONY: CUBA'S POLITICAL PRISONS|work=Contacto Magazine|date=September 1996|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] However, in 1955, under broad political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel's Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Raúl in the release.Ramonet, Ignacio, ibid, p. 174
Soon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in Mexico to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, receiving training from Alberto Bayo, a leader of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In June 1955, Fidel met the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who joined his cause.Ramonet, Ignacio, ibid, p. 174 The revolutionaries named themselves the "26th of July Movement", in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953.

==Guerrilla warfare==

The yacht Granma arrived in Cuba on 2 December 1956, carrying the Castro brothers and 80 others of the 26th of July Movement. It landed on Playa Las Coloradas, in the municipality of Niquero, arriving two days later than planned because the boat was heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs.Ramonet, Ignacio, ibid, p. 182 This dashed any hopes for a coordinated attack with the llano wing of the movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began to make their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek began, Batista's army attacked and killed most of the Granma participants – while the exact number is disputed, no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains.[tpl]cite book | last = Thomas | first = Hugh | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1998 | title = Cuba or The Pursuit of Freedom (Updated Edition) | publisher=Da Capo Press|location = New York|isbn = 0-306-80827-7[/tpl]
The group of survivors included Fidel and Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again – with the help of peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. Celia Sanchez and Haydee Santamaria (the sister of Abel Santamaria) were among the female revolutionaries who assisted Fidel Castro in the mountains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://laventana.casa.cult.cu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2014|title=Opiniones: Haydee Santamaría, una mujer revolucionaria|publisher=La Ventana|date=2 July 2004|accessdate=14 June 2013|language=Spanish[/tpl]
On 13 March 1957, a separate group of revolutionaries – the anticommunist Student Revolutionary Directorate (Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil, DRE), composed mostly of students – stormed the Presidential Palace in Havana, attempting to assassinate Batista and decapitate the government. The attack ended in utter failure. The RD's leader, student José Antonio Echeverría, died in a shootout with Batista's forces at the Havana radio station he had seized to spread the news of Batista's anticipated death. The handful of survivors included Dr. Humberto Castello (who later became the Inspector General in the Escambray), Rolando Cubela and Faure Chomon (both later Commandantes of the 13 March Movement, centered in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province).Faria, Cuba in Revolution, 2002, Notes pp.40–41
Thereafter, the United States imposed an economic embargo on the Cuban government and recalled its ambassador, weakening the government's mandate further.[tpl]cite book|title=Cuba and the United States|author=Louis A. Pérez[/tpl] Batista's support among Cubans began to fade, with former supporters either joining the revolutionaries or distancing themselves from Batista. Nonetheless, the Mafia and U.S. businessmen continued their support.English, T.J. (2008). Havana nocturne: how the mob owned Cuba – and then lost It to the revolution.
The government resorted to often brutal methods to keep Cuba's cities under government control. However, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro, aided by Frank País, Ramos Latour, Huber Matos, and many others, staged successful attacks on small garrisons of Batista's troops. Che Guevara and Raúl Castro helped Fidel to consolidate his political control in the mountains, often through execution of suspected Batista loyalists or other rivals of Castro's.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?id=1535|title = The Killing Machine: Che Guevara, from Communist Firebrand to Capitalist Brand|publisher = Independent.org|date=11 July 2005|accessdate= 14 April 2012|quote=Guevara murdered or oversaw the executions in summary trials of scores of people—proven enemies, suspected enemies, and those who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.[/tpl] In addition, poorly armed irregulars known as escopeteros harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of Oriente Province. The escopeteros also provided direct military support to Castro's main forces by protecting supply lines and by sharing intelligence.[tpl]cite book|first=Don A.|last=Dewitt|title=U.S. Marines at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba|publisher=iUniverse via Google Books|year=2011|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f36zpcqLxQ4C&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=batista+escopeteros&source=bl&ots=mkBKLPMHjc&sig=Q4XXGa4rO20ZxI1tUl904H4T6O4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=un26UenZA8W00QWQ-YHwCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=batista%20escopeteros&f=false|page=31[/tpl] Ultimately, the mountains came under Castro's control.
In addition to armed resistance, the rebels sought to use propaganda to their advantage. A pirate radio station called Radio Rebelde ("Rebel Radio") was set up in February 1958, allowing Castro and his forces to broadcast their message nationwide within enemy territory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radiorebelde.cu/english/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Radio Rebelde|accessdate=11 March 2013[/tpl] The radio broadcasts were made possible by Carlos Franqui, a previous acquaintance of Castro who subsequently became a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/7760752/Carlos-Franqui.html|title=Carlos Franqui|work=Daily Telegraph|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]
During this time, Castro's forces remained quite small in numbers, sometimes fewer than 200 men, while the Cuban army and police force had a manpower of around 37,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1697&dat=19590101&id=FsEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0EUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5002,96492|title=Batista Says Manpower Edge Lacking|work=Park City Daily News|date=1 January 1959|publisher=Google News Archive|accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl] Even so, nearly every time the Cuban military fought against the revolutionaries, the army was forced to retreat. An arms embargo – imposed on the Cuban government by the United States on 14 March 1958 – contributed significantly to the weakness of Batista's forces. The Cuban air force rapidly deteriorated: it could not repair its airplanes without importing parts from the United States.
Batista finally responded to Castro's efforts with an attack on the mountains called Operation Verano, known to the rebels as la Ofensiva. The army sent some 12,000 soldiers, half of them untrained recruits, into the mountains. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro's determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army. In the Battle of La Plata, which lasted from 11 July to 21 July 1958, Castro's forces defeated a 500-man battalion, capturing 240 men while losing just three of their own.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cuba1952-1959.blogspot.co.uk/2009/12/1958-battle-of-la-plata-el-jigue.html|title=1958: Battle of La Plata (El Jigüe)|publisher=Cuba 1952–1959|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=26 June 2013[/tpl]
However, the tide nearly turned on 29 July 1958, when Batista's troops almost destroyed Castro's small army of some 300 men at the Battle of Las Mercedes. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while fruitless negotiations took place, Castro's forces gradually escaped from the trap. By 8 August, Castro's entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government.

==Final offensive and rebel victory in war==

On 21 August 1958, after the defeat of Batista's Ofensiva, Castro's forces began their own offensive. In the Oriente province (in the area of the present-day provinces of Santiago de Cuba, Granma, Guantánamo and Holguín), Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro and Juan Almeida Bosque directed attacks on four fronts. Descending from the mountains with new weapons captured during the Ofensiva and smuggled in by plane, Castro's forces won a series of initial victories. Castro's major victory at Guisa, and the successful capture of several towns including Maffo, Contramaestre, and Central Oriente, brought the Cauto plains under his control.
Meanwhile, three rebel columns, under the command of Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos and Jaime Vega, proceeded westward toward Santa Clara, the capital of Villa Clara Province. Batista's forces ambushed and destroyed Jaime Vega's column, but the surviving two columns reached the central provinces, where they joined efforts with several other resistance groups not under the command of Castro. When Che Guevara's column passed through the province of Las Villas, and specifically through the Escambray Mountains – where the anticommunist Revolutionary Directorate forces (who became known as the 13 March Movement) had been fighting Batista's army for many months – friction developed between the two groups of rebels. Nonetheless, the combined rebel army continued the offensive, and Cienfuegos won a key victory in the Battle of Yaguajay on 30 December 1958, earning him the nickname "The Hero of Yaguajay".
On 31 December 1958, the Battle of Santa Clara took place in a scene of great confusion. The city of Santa Clara fell to the combined forces of Che Guevara, Cienfuegos, Revolutionary Directorate (RD) rebels led by Comandantes Rolando Cubela, Juan ("El Mejicano") Abrahantes, and William Alexander Morgan. News of these defeats caused Batista to panic. He fled Cuba for the Dominican Republic just hours later on 1 January 1959. Comandante William Alexander Morgan, leading RD rebel forces, continued fighting as Batista departed, and had captured the city of Cienfuegos by 2 January.Faria, Cuba in Revolution, 2002, pp.69
Castro learned of Batista's flight in the morning and immediately started negotiations to take over Santiago de Cuba. On 2 January, the military commander in the city, Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers not to fight, and Castro's forces took over the city. The forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. They had met no opposition on their journey from Santa Clara to Cuba's capital.  Castro himself arrived in Havana on 8 January after a long victory march.  His initial choice of president, Manuel Urrutia Lleó, took office on 3 January.Thomas, Hugh, Cuba: The pursuit of freedom, pp. 691–3

==Aftermath==

In 1959, Castro travelled to the United States to explain his revolution. He said, "I know what the world thinks of us, we are Communists, and of course I have said very clearly that we are not Communists; very clearly.""Year in Review – 1959". UPI archive. Retrieved 24 December 2011.
Hundreds of Batista-era agents, policemen and soldiers were put on public trial for human rights abuses, war crimes, murder and torture. Most of the people accused were convicted by revolutionary tribunals of political crimes, and were executed by firing squad; others received long sentences of imprisonment. A notable example of revolutionary justice was after the capture of Santiago, Raul Castro directed the execution of more than seventy Batista POWs.Juan Clark Cuba (1992). Mito y Realidad: Testimonio de un Pueblo. Saeta Ediciones (Miami). pp. 53–70. For his part in taking Havana, Che Guevara was appointed supreme prosecutor in La Cabaña Fortress. This was part of a large-scale attempt by Fidel Castro to cleanse the security forces of Batista loyalists and potential opponents of the new revolutionary government. Though many were killed or imprisoned, others were fortunate enough to be dismissed from the army and police without prosecution, and some high-ranking officials of the Batista administration were exiled as military attachés.

===Reforms and nationalization===

During its first decade in power, the Castro government introduced a wide range of progressive social reforms. Laws were introduced to provide equality for black Cubans and greater rights for women, while there were attempts to improve communications, medical facilities, health, housing, and education. In addition, there were touring cinemas, art exhibitions, concerts, and theatres. By the end of the 1960s, all Cuban children were receiving some education (compared with less than half before 1959), unemployment and corruption were reduced, and great improvements were made in hygiene and sanitation.Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition.
According to geographer and Cuban Comandante Antonio Núñez Jiménez, 75% of Cuba’s best arable land was owned by foreign individuals or foreign (mostly American) companies at the time of the revolution. One of the first policies of the newly formed Cuban government was eliminating illiteracy and implementing land reforms. Land reform efforts helped to raise living standards by subdividing larger holdings into cooperatives. Comandante Sori Marin, who was nominally in charge of land reform, objected and fled, but was eventually executed when he returned to Cuba with arms and explosives, intending to overthrow the Castro government.Escalante 1995, pp. 80-81Lazo 1968, p. 288 Many other non-Marxist, anti-Batista rebel leaders were forced into exile, purged in executions, or eliminated in failed uprisings such as that of the Beaton brothers."Cuba Orders Rebel's Death". The Milwaukee Journal. 14 June 1960 (via Google News archive). Retrieved 28 April 2012.
Shortly after taking power, Castro also created a revolutionary militia to expand his power base among the former rebels and the supportive population.  Castro also created the informant Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) in late September 1960. Local CDRs were tasked with keeping "vigilance against counter-revolutionary activity", keeping a detailed record of each neighborhood’s inhabitants' spending habits, level of contact with foreigners, work and education history, and any "suspicious" behavior.Juan Clark Cuba: Mito y Realidad (1992), pp. 131–58. Among the increasingly persecuted groups were homosexual men.[tpl]cite book|last=Young|first=Allen|title=Gays under the Cuban revolution|year=1982|publisher=Grey Fox Press|isbn=0-912516-61-5[/tpl]
In February 1959, the Ministry for the Recovery of Misappropriated Assets (Ministerio de Recuperación de Bienes Malversados) was created. Cuba began expropriating land and private property under the auspices of the Agrarian Reform Law of 17 May 1959. Farms of any size could be and were seized by the government, while land, businesses, and companies owned by upper- and middle-class Cubans were nationalized (notably, including the plantations owned by Fidel Castro's family). By the end of 1960, the revolutionary government had nationalized more than $25 billion worth of private property owned by Cubans.Lazo, Mario (1970). American Policy Failures in Cuba – Dagger in the Heart. Twin Circle Publishing Co.: New York. pp. 198–200, 204. Library of Congress Card Catalog Number: 68-31632. The Castro government formally nationalized all foreign-owned property, particularly American holdings, in the nation on 6 August 1960.
In 1961, the Cuban government nationalized all property held by religious organizations, including the dominant Roman Catholic Church. Hundreds of members of the church, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation, as the new Cuban government declared itself officially atheist. Education also saw significant changes – private schools were banned and the progressively socialist state assumed greater responsibility for children.Faria (2002), op. cit. pp. 215–28.
In July 1961, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (IRO) was formed by the merger of Fidel Castro’s 26th of July Movement, the People's Socialist Party led by Blas Roca, and the Revolutionary Directorate of 13 March led by Faure Chomón.[tpl]cite web| last =Faria| first =Miguel| title =Interview With Dr. Miguel Faria (Part I) by Myles Kantor| publisher =Hacienda Publishing| date =14 June 2002| url =http://haciendapublishing.com/articles/interview-dr-miguel-faria-part-i-myles-b-kantor| accessdate =25 October 2012[/tpl]
On 26 March 1962, the IRO became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC) which, in turn, became the modern Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965, with Castro as First Secretary. Castro remained the ruler of Cuba, first as Prime Minister and, from 1976, as President, until his retirement in February 2008.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/world/americas/20castro.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Fidel Castro Resigns as Cuba’s President|work=New York Times|date=20 February 2008|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl] His brother Raúl officially replaced him as President later that same month.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/americas/24iht-cuba.5.10342397.html|title=Raúl Castro becomes Cuban president|work=New York Times|date=24 February 2008|accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]

===International reactions and foreign policy===

The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the American government was initially willing to recognize Castro's new government,Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington and Africa, 1959–1976. University of North Carolina Press. p. 14. it soon came to fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had in Southeast Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/04/17/135493605/ahead-of-bay-of-pigs-fears-of-communism|title=Ahead Of Bay Of Pigs, Fears Of Communism|publisher=NPR|date=17 April 2011|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl] Castro, meanwhile, resented the Americans for providing aid to Batista's government during the revolution. After the revolutionary government nationalized all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties,Gary B. Nash, Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R. Howe, Peter J. Frederick, Allen F. Davis, Allan M. Winkler, Charlene Mires and Carla Gardina Pestana. The American People, Concise Edition: Creating a Nation and a Society, Combined Volume (6th edition, 2007).

In 1961, the U.S. government backed an armed counterrevolutionary assault on the Bay of Pigs with the aim of ousting Castro, but the counterrevolutionaries were swiftly defeated by the Cuban military. The American embargo against Cuba – the longest-lasting single foreign policy in American history[tpl]cite web|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/2012/06/washington-and-the-cuban-revolution-today-ballad-of-a-never-ending-policy-2/|title=Washington and the Cuban Revolution Today: Ballad of a Never-Ending Policy – Part I: The Myth of the Miami Lobby|work=Dissident Voice|date=22 June 2013|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl] – is still in force as of 2014, although there have been some efforts to loosen it in recent years.
Castro's victory and post-revolutionary foreign policy had global repercussions. Influenced by the expansion of the Soviet Union, Castro immediately sought to "export" his revolution to other countries in the Caribbean and beyond, sending weapons to Algerian rebels as early as 1960.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alfred-stepan/makers-twentieth-century-castro|title=Makers of the Twentieth Century: Castro|work=History Today|year=1981|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl] In the following decades, Cuba became heavily involved in supporting Communist insurgencies and independence movements in many developing countries, sending military aid to insurgents in Ghana, Nicaragua, Yemen and Angola, among others. Castro's intervention in the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant, involving as many as 60,000 Cuban soldiers."La Guerras Secretas de Fidel Castro" (in Spanish). CubaMatinal.com. Retrieved 9 March 2013.
Following the American embargo, the Soviet Union became Cuba's main ally. The two Communist countries quickly developed close military and intelligence ties, culminating in the stationing of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962, an act which triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cuba maintained close links to the Soviets until the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The end of Soviet economic aid led to an economic crisis and famine known as the Special Period in Cuba.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]

===Exiles and counterrevolutionary rebels===

In the wake of the revolution, thousands of disaffected anti-Batista rebels, former Batista supporters, and campesinos (peasants) fled to Cuba's Las Villas province, where an anticommunist underground had been forming since early 1960. Operating out of the Escambray Mountains, these counterrevolutionary rebels, also known as Alzados, made a number of unsuccessful attempts to overthrow the Cuban government, including the abortive, United States-backed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the United States promised not to invade Cuba in the future; in compliance with this agreement, the U.S. withdrew all support from the Alzados, effectively crippling the resource-starved resistance. The counterrevolutionary conflict, known abroad as the Escambray Rebellion,  lasted until about 1965, and has since been branded the War Against the Bandits by the Cuban government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/Cuba/cuba_intelligenceandbayofpigs92602.html|title=Cuba: Intelligence and the Bay of Pigs|publisher=Stanford University|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=18 July 2013[/tpl]
Between 1959 and 1980, an estimated 500,000 Cubans left the island for the United States, seeking greater political and economic freedoms; 125,000 left in 1980 alone, when the Cuban government briefly permitted any Cubans who wished to leave to do so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/exile-community-statistics.htm|title=Cuban Exile Community|publisher=LatinAmericanStudies.org|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl] By 2010, the Cuban American community numbered over 1.9 million, 67% of whom lived in the state of Florida.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/06/27/hispanics-of-cuban-origin-in-the-united-states-2010/|title=Hispanics of Cuban Origin in the United States, 2010|publisher=Pew Research|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=9 July 2013[/tpl]
