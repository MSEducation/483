As a preventative HIV/AIDS strategy, Lewis has made a somewhat controversial call for male circumcision when African boys receive the first of two UN administered Measles vaccination shots, so that their recovery progress can be monitored at the time of the second vaccination.[tpl]Cite web | last = Lewis | first = Stephen | title = Male Circumcision Part 1 | work = AIDS Free World | publisher = YouTube | date = 2010-01-06  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kIqB_6KRg | format = online video | accessdate = 2014-4-3[/tpl]  Many studies have been conducted into the role circumcision can play in reducing the spread of HIV.
