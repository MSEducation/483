==Background==

The Los Angeles Dodgers laid the groundwork for their championship clubs of the 1970s with an outstanding draft. Among the players the Dodgers selected were: Dave Lopes (2nd round) in the January secondary phase, Bill Buckner (2nd round), Joe Ferguson (6th round), Tom Paciorek (40th round), and Doyle Alexander (42nd round) in the June regular phase; and Steve Garvey (1st round) and Ron Cey (3rd round) in the June secondary phase.
The Dodgers didn't grab all the talent. Other draftees included Al Bumbry (Baltimore), Thurman Munson (Yankees), Greg Luzinksi (Philadelphia) and Gary Matthews (San Francisco). The biggest steal of the June draft was Cecil Cooper, chosen in the 6th round by the Boston Red Sox.
The 1968 June draft also included the four expansion teams that began play in 1969. Montreal, San Diego, Kansas City and Seattle began the selection process at the end of the fourth round of the regular phase.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/index.jsp?feature=decade1960s|title=Background on the 1968 MLB Draft|accessdate=2008-07-27 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080614043354/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/draft/index.jsp?feature=decade1960s| archivedate= 14 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
