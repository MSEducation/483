[[Wikisubtitles]]

CATEGORIES: Multilingual websites

Wikisubtitles is a Spanish wiki site that holds fan created free subtitle files for various movies (not the actual movie files) created for foreign, deaf, and other peoples. It is free and non-profit.
On May 19, 2008, FAP (the Spanish Anti-Piracy Federation) sent a cease and desist letter, citing copyright reasons, despite the site being non-profit, and only carrying text subtitles of the movies.
