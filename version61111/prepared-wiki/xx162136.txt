[[Abraxini]]

CATEGORIES: Abraxini

The Abraxini are a tribe of geometer moths in the subfamily Ennominae. Here, the Cassymini are considered a specialized offshoot of the Abraxini and merged therein; some authors consider them a distinct tribe however.Holloway (1994), Young (2008)

==Genera==

As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe,See references in Savela (2008) the genus list is preliminary. Most of the genera listed here would be placed in the Cassymini if these are considered separate.Holloway (1994)
Heliomata, otherwise placed in the Macariini, might also belong here.
