Originally stated to open in May 2007, it has endured construction problems, however the park finally opened to the public on September 17, 2008.  The park's plans also originally included a roller coaster, but the park has opted to focus on developing the first phase of the park in order to open the park as soon as possible.
Siam Park includes Thai theming on all of its rides, park buildings, and restaurants. The park's 25 buildings are the largest collection of Thai-themed buildings outside Thailand. The park's designer, Christoph Kiessling, received permission from the Thai royal family to use the park's name and theme; but, to respect the family's wishes, he did not copy royal palaces, temples, or statues of Buddha in the park.
In addition, the restaurants serve Thai food as well as family favorites. The park also has a Thai floating market.
