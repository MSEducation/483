Wizards of the Coast (often referred to as WotC or simply Wizards) is an American publisher of games, primarily based on fantasy and science fiction themes, and formerly an operator of retail stores for games. Originally a basement-run role-playing game publisher, the company popularized the collectible card game genre with Magic: The Gathering in the mid-1990s, acquired the popular Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game by purchasing the failing company TSR, and experienced tremendous success by publishing the licensed Pokémon Trading Card Game. The company's corporate headquarters are located in Renton, Washington in the United States of America."Contact Us." Wizards of the Coast. Retrieved on May 2, 2010.
Today, Wizards of the Coast publishes role-playing games, board games, and collectible card games. They have received numerous awards, including several Origins Awards. The company has been a subsidiary of Hasbro since 1999. All Wizards of the Coast stores were closed in 2004.

==History==

Wizards of the Coast was founded by Peter Adkison in 1990 just outside Seattle, Washington, and its current headquarters are located in nearby Renton.About Wizards. Wizards of the Coast (2008). Retrieved on November 3, 2008. Originally the company only published role-playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The Primal Order.

In 1991, Richard Garfield approached Wizards of the Coast with the idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce.[tpl]cite book | last=Tinsman |first=Brian | year=2003 | title=The Game Inventor's Guidebook | publisher=Krause Publications | isbn=0-87349-552-7| pages=11–12, 18, 63, 76 [/tpl] Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.[tpl]Citation   | last =Miller  | first =John Jackson  | title =Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist & Price Guide  | year =2001  | pages =520  | postscript =.[/tpl]
Adkison set up a new corporation, Garfield Games, to develop Richard Garfield's collectible card game concept, originally called Manaclash, into Magic: The Gathering. This kept the game sheltered from the legal battle with Palladium, and Garfield Games then licensed the production and sale rights to Wizards until the court case was settled, at which point the shell company was shut down. Wizards debuted Magic in July 1993 at the Origins Game Fair in Dallas. The game proved extremely popular at Gen Con in August 1993, selling out of its supply of 2.5 million cards, which had been scheduled to last until the end of the year. The success of Magic generated revenue that carried the company out from the handful of employees in 1993 working out of Peter's original basement headquarters into 250 employees in its own offices in 1995. In 1994, Magic won both the Mensa Top Five mind games award[tpl]cite web|url=http://mindgames.us.mensa.org/manufacturer/past_winners.php |title=American Mensa mind games past winners|publisher=Mind Games |accessdate=December 27, 2008[/tpl] and the Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board game of 1993 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board game of 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1993/list-of-winners| title=Origins Award Winners (1993)| publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design| accessdate=November 1, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071106005056/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1993/list-of-winners |archivedate = November 6, 2007[/tpl]
In 1994, Wizards began an association with The Beanstalk Group, a brand licensing agency and consultancy, to license the Magic brand. After the success of Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/Awards/| title=Awards|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=November 8, 2008[/tpl] Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line. Peter Adkison explained that the company was doing a disservice to the games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards' roleplaying game products.[tpl]cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/03/26/wizards_part2/index.html | title=Death to the Minotaur: Part 2 | accessdate=September 1, 2006 | last=Tynes | first=John | authorlink=John Tynes | date=March 23, 2001 | publisher=Salon Media Group [/tpl] Also in 1995, Wizards' annual sales passed US$65 million.[tpl]cite book|title=Visions of Schooling: Conscience, Community, and Common Education |last=Salomone |first=Rosemary C.|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|ISBN=978-0-300-09350-6|page=144[/tpl]

===Acquisition of TSR and Pokémon===

Wizards announced the purchase of TSR, the cash-strapped makers of Dungeons & Dragons on April 10, 1997. Wizards acquired TSR and Five Rings Publishing Group for $25 million.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol17/issue18/screens.gaming.html | title=The Year in Gaming | accessdate=June 3, 2007 | last=Varney | first=Allen | authorlink=Allen Varney | publisher=The Austin Chronicle | date=May 3, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110707190800/http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol17/issue18/screens.gaming.html|archivedate=July 7, 2011 [/tpl] Many of the creative and professional staff of TSR relocated from Wisconsin to the Renton area. Wizards used TSR as a brand name for a while, then retired it, allowing the TSR trademarks to expire. Between 1997 and 1999, the company spun off several well-loved but poorly selling campaign settings (including Planescape, Dark Sun and Spelljammer) to fan groups, focusing business primarily on the more profitable Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms lines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/539/539972p1.html | title=Magic & Memories: The Complete History of Dungeons & Dragons – Part IV | publisher=GameSpy|date= August 18, 2004 | accessdate=November 8, 2008[/tpl]
In Summer 1997, Wizards revisited the concept of a 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons, having first discussed it soon after the purchase of TSR.[tpl]cite book |last=Johnson| first=Harold |coauthors=et al. |title=30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |year=2004|ISBN=0-7869-3498-0[/tpl] In 2004, Adkison looked back on the decision; "Obviously, we Wizards had a strong economic incentive for publishing a new edition; sales for any product line tend to spike when a new edition comes out, assuming the new edition is an improvement over the first. And given the change in ownership we thought this would be an excellent opportunity for WotC to 'put its stamp on D&D.[tpl]' "[/tpl] He later "Set the overall design direction" for the new edition of D&D.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/cg/cg20010525a |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |last=Holzmeier |first=Robert |work=Celebrity Game Table |title=Peter Adkison’s Ilboria Campaign|accessdate=January 3, 2008[/tpl] Wizards released the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons in 2000, as well as the d20 System. With these releases came the Open Game License, which allowed other companies to make use of those systems. The new edition of the D&D game won the 2000 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game. In 2002, Wizards sponsored a design contest which allowed designers to submit their campaign worlds to Wizards, to produce an entirely original campaign world; Wizards selected "Eberron", submitted by Keith Baker, and its first hardcover book was released in June 2004. In 2003 Wizards released version 3.5 of Dungeons & Dragons and the d20 system. Wizards helped to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the D&D game at Gen Con Indy 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.wizards.com/Company/Press/?doc=20040524a | publisher=Wizards of the Coast|title=Celebrate At Gen Con Indy As Dungeons & Dragons Turns 30 | date= May 24, 2004 | accessdate=November 8, 2008[/tpl]
On August 2, 1997, Wizards of the Coast was granted [tpl]US patent|5662332[/tpl] on collectible card games. In January 1999, Wizards of the Coast began publishing the highly successful Pokémon Trading Card Game. The game proved to be very popular, selling nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks, and selling 10 times better than Wizards' initial projections.[tpl]cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_Feb_3/ai_53696127 | title=Pokemon Trading Card Game a Monster Success; Stores Selling Out of Product within Hours of Restocking on Shelves | publisher=Business Services Industry | date=February 3, 1999 | accessdate=December 27, 2008 [/tpl] There was such a high demand for Pokémon cards that some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing Pokémon cards. The game won the 1999 National Parenting Center's Seal of Approval.
Within a year, Wizards had sold millions of copies of the Pokémon game, and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD-ROM.[tpl]cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_March_8/ai_60004920 | title=Pokemon Trading Card Game Phenomenon Celebrates One-year Anniversary With Release of Base Set 2; Base Set 2 Makes Learning the Game Easier with Instructional CD-ROM | publisher=Business Services Industry | date=March 8, 2000 | accessdate=December 27, 2008 [/tpl] Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003. One of Nintendo's affiliates, Pokémon USA, had begun producing a new edition for the game before the last of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30, and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day, October 1, 2003.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2003/10/13/story2.html | title=A suit of cards: Wizards of the Coast sues Nintendo over Pokemon game | first=Eric | last=Engleman | work=Puget Sound Business Journal | date=October 10, 2003 | accessdate=December 27, 2008 [/tpl]Cook, John (October 11, 2003).

===Acquisition by Hasbro===

Seeing the continued success of Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering, the game and toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999, for about US$325 million."Hasbro last Thursday announced its intention to buy Wizards of the Coast, which sells Pokémon trading cards, for about $325 million.

Wizards of the Coast's book publishing division has produced hundreds of titles that have sold millions of copies in over 16 languages.
After the company's great success in 1999 with Pokémon, Wizards of the Coast acquired and expanded "The Game Keeper," a US chain of retail gaming stores, eventually changing its name to "Wizards of the Coast",[tpl]cite book |title=Standard & Poor's 500 Guide: 2006 Edition|publisher=Standard & Poor's|year=2005|ISBN=978-0-07-146823-7|chapter=Hasbro Inc.[/tpl] including the company's flagship gaming center on the Ave in Seattle for several years, and its retail stores, which were mostly in shopping malls in the US. The gaming center was closed by March 2001 and eventually Wizards announced in December 2003 that it would close all of its stores in order to concentrate on game design. The stores were closed in the spring of 2004.

===Recent years===

In early 2006, Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against Daron Rutter, then administrator of the MTGSalvation website (on which he is known as "Rancored Elf"). The charges stemmed from Rutter publicly posting confidential prototypes for upcoming Magic: The Gathering card sets to the MTGSalvation forums, ten months before the cards were to be released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr233 |title=Law & Order |author=Rosewater, Mark|work=Magicthegathering.com|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=December 31, 2008|date=June 19, 2006|authorlink=Mark Rosewater[/tpl] Mark Rosewater explained the outcome: "I can say that we of the Coast settled the lawsuit with Rancored Elf out of court to both parties' satisfaction."
Paizo Publishing's license to produce Dragon and Dungeon magazines, which Paizo had been publishing since it spun off from Wizards of the Coast's periodicals department in 2002, expired in September 2007. Wizards then moved the magazines to an online model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/23/wa/browse?path=paizo/news/v5748eaic9kh0&wosid=1AIO0gcKkNHbmSRwSHYOQM | title=Paizo Publishing to Cease Publication of Dragon and Dungeon | publisher=Paizo Publishing |date= April 19, 2007 | accessdate=December 27, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web| author=Magazine Publishers of America| title = Defunct or Suspended Magazines 2007| work=MPA Website:The Definitive Source of the Magazine Industry| publisher=Magazine Publishers of America| year = 2003 | url = http://www.magazine.org/research/finance_and_operations/finance_operations_trends_and_magazine_handbook/20924.aspx| accessdate =February 5, 2008[/tpl] On June 6, 2008, Wizards released the 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, with the retail availability of a new set of core rulebooks.
