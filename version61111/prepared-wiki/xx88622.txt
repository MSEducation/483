==Professional career==

===Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===

====2002 season====

Rodríguez signed as an undrafted amateur free agent in 1998. Originally a starting pitcher, Rodríguez moved to relief pitching in 2002 after elbow and shoulder injuries shortened his 2001 minor league season with the Lake Elsinore Storm. In 2002, he made his major league debut. At the time, he was the youngest pitcher in the American League. Because of the multiple injuries to the Angels bullpen, the club brought him up during the middle of September. He emerged as a postseason relief hero, winning five postseason games despite never having won a Major League game before. Although he threw a lively fastball, his sharp-breaking curveball was his most effective pitch.
Because Rodríguez had played very little in the Major Leagues, hitters in the postseason had very little idea what to expect from him, a situation that often favors the pitcher. In the 2002 ALDS against the New York Yankees, he got two victories (with 1 win resulting from a blown save). The Angels won the division series against the Yankees in 4 games. During the 2002 ALCS vs the Minnesota Twins, he went 2–0 with seven strikeouts in four and one-third innings. The Angels won the ALCS against the Twins in 5 games. During the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, he had a 1–1 record with 13 strikeouts in eight and two-thirds innings. At 20 years, 286 days old, he became the youngest pitcher ever to win a World Series game. The Angels won the World Series in 7 games.

====2003 season====

In 2003, Rodríguez became a setup man. He gave up an earned run in 9 of his first 15 games, but rebounded to only allow 9 in his last 44 appearances. For the 2003 year, Rodriguez made 59 appearances going 8-3 with a 3.03 ERA.

====2004 season====

In 2004, Rodríguez was selected for the All-Star Game. On August 24, 2004, he became the sixth pitcher in the Angels' 44-year history to strike out at least 100 batters in a season without starting a game — joining Mark Clear (105 in 1980), DeWayne Buice (109, 1987), Bryan Harvey (101, 1991), Troy Percival (100, 1996), and Scot Shields (109, also in 2004). He finished the 2004 year 4-1 with 123 strikeouts and a 1.82 ERA in 69 relief appearances.
During the 2004 ALDS, Francisco Rodriguez had 2 losses as the Angels would eventually lose the division series to the Boston Red Sox in just 3 games.

====2005: Transition to Closer====

Entering the 2005 season, veteran Angels closer Troy Percival departed as a free agent which allowed Rodriguez to become the Angels' full-time closer. Rodríguez ended the season 2-5 with a 2.67 ERA in 66 relief appearances and tied the American League lead in saves with 45.
Rodriguez got his first 2 career postseason saves during the 2005 ALDS as the Angels won the division series against the Yankees in 5 games. He got one save in the 2005 ALCS until the Angels lost the ALCS to the Chicago White Sox in 5 games.

====2006 season====

Rodriguez improved on his share of the 2005 American League saves title by leading the Majors in 2006 with 47 saves, one more than the National League leader Trevor Hoffman and six more than American League runner-up Bobby Jenks. On September 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays, he became the youngest closer in Major League Baseball history, at age 24, to accumulate 100 career saves. He accomplished this feat a year younger than the previous record holder, Gregg Olson.

====2007 season====

At the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, Rodriguez was named as one of three Angels to represent the club, along with teammates Vladimir Guerrero and John Lackey. Rodriguez recorded the save as the American League defeated the National League, 5–4. Rodriguez finished the 2007 season 5-2 with a 1.73 ERA and 40 saves in 64 relief appearances.
In the 2007 ALDS, Rodriguez pitched only [tpl]fraction|1|3[/tpl] of an inning with an ERA accumulating 54.00. The Angels lost the division series to the Red Sox in just 3 games.

He was selected to play in the 2009 All-Star game and pitched a scoreless 9th inning.
On September 30, 2009, Rodríguez surrendered a walk-off grand slam to Justin Maxwell to cap a five-run ninth inning that lifted the Washington Nationals to a 7–4 victory over the Mets. This made him the first pitcher to allow two walk-off grand slams in one season since Lee Smith did in 1995 (on August 7, Rodriguez surrendered a grand slam to Everth Cabrera with no outs to cap another five-run ninth inning that gave the San Diego Padres a 6–2 win over the Mets).
Rodríguez finished the 2009 season 3-6 with a 3.71 ERA and 35 saves converted out of 42 opportunities. It was his fifth consecutive season of 30 or more saves.

He appeared in 3 games of the 2011 NLCS vs the St. Louis Cardinals. His ERA during the series was 3.00 and his new team of the Brewers would eventually lose the series to the Cardinals in 6 games.

====2012 season====

In January 2012, Rodríguez signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Brewers through arbitration. The Brewers again planned to have Rodríguez and Axford in the bullpen, shifting between the two depending on who has been struggling of late.[tpl]cite news|title=Brewers sign K-Rod, Norichika Aoki|date=January 17, 2012|work=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7472058/milwaukee-brewers-avoid-francisco-rodriguez-arbitration-sign-norichika-aoki|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64xdihrCL|archivedate=January 25, 2012[/tpl] In 2012, Rodriguez made a career high of 78 relief appearances going 2-7 with a 4.38 ERA and only 3 saves.

Rodriguez began the season showing signs of returning to All-Star form, not allowing a single hit and earning 4 saves in his first 6 appearances of the season. On April 19 in a win versus the Pittsburgh Pirates, Rodriguez earned his 310th career save, his 6th of the season, which tied him with Goose Gossage for 20th on the all time save list. The next day on April 20, Rodriguez earned his 311th career save in another win versus the Pirates. With this save he passed Gossage, and tied Tom Henke for 19th on the all time saves list. Yet another day later on April 21, Rodriguez earned his 8th save of the season and the 312th of his career in a win versus the San Diego Padres, putting him alone at 19th on the all time saves list. Only two days later on April 23, Rodriguez earned his 9th save of the season in a 5-3 win over the Padres, giving him 9 straight saves without allowing a single run to start the season. Just two more days later on April 25, Rodriguez recorded his 314th career save, his 10th of season, in a 5-2 win over the Chicago Cubs. With this save, Rodriguez tied Robb Nen for 18th on the all time saves list. The very next day on April 26, Rodriguez picked up his 315th career save, his 11th of the season, in another win over the Cubs, which put him alone at 18th place in the all time saves list. Rodriguez would quickly pick up 2 more saves and would tie the record for most saves in the month of April with 13. Rodriguez would also give up only 7 total hits and no runs in 16 April appearances.

==Pitching style==

Rodríguez throws four pitches. He came up throwing a hard four-seam fastball that averaged 95 mph in 2007, but has settled in the 91–94 mph range through the 2012 season. He also throws a two-seam fastball at 90–93 mph. His off-speed pitches are a curveball at 76–79 mph and a changeup at 82–85 mph. He uses his changeup more against left-handed hitters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brooksbaseball.net/player_cards/player_card.php?player=408061|title=Brooks Baseball · Home of the PitchFX Tool - Player Card: Francisco Rodriguez|publisher=Brooks Baseball|accessdate=September 24, 2012[/tpl] It has a whiff rate of 48% since 2007, the third-highest among all changeups thrown by relief pitchers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/pitchfx/leaderboards/index.php?hand=&reportType=pfx&prp=RP&month=&year=&pitch=CH&ds=ws&lim=200|title=PitchFX Leaderboards|work=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=September 24, 2012[/tpl]

===Incidents===

On June 13, 2009, New York Yankees reliever Brian Bruney criticized Rodríguez, calling his antics on the mound "unbelievable" and saying that Rodriguez has "got a tired act," after seeing his reaction to earning a blown save in 2009 against the Yankees where teammate Luis Castillo dropped a pop-up with two outs in the ninth inning allowing the Yankees to score the winning run. Rodríguez responded by saying "somebody like that, it doesn't bother me," and suggesting that Bruney "better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else. I don't even know who the guy is. I'm not going to waste my time with that guy. Instead of sending messages through the paper, next time when you see me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it to my face."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2009/06/13/2009-06-13_bruney_and_krods_war_of_the_words.html|title=Brian Bruney rips Francisco Rodríguez's celebrations, but K-Rod gets final shot|publisher=New York Daily News|work=Nydailynews.com|date=June 13, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2010| first1=Adam|last1=Rubin|first2=Christian| last2=Red[/tpl] During batting practice the following day Rodríguez confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and shouting at him before teammates from both sides separated the two."Mets' Rodríguez confronts Bruney after comments"[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl]
