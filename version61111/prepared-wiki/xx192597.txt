[[Brody Condon]]

CATEGORIES: American artists, 1974 births, Living people

Brody Condon (born 1974 Mexico) is an artist based in Berlin. Concerned with the aftermath of trauma and the over-identification with fantasy in contemporary culture, Condon’s work is best known for its influence on the re-purposing of existing pop cultural material (often computer and LARP games) to create performative situations, video, and sculpture.

==Education==

Condon received his MFA from the University of California, San Diego in 2002. He participated in residencies at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in 2004 and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2001.
