Charles Louis Fleischmann (November 3, 1835 – December 10, 1897) was an innovative manufacturer of yeast and other consumer food products during the 19th Century. In the late 1860s, he and his brother Maximilian created America’s first commercially produced yeast, which revolutionized baking in a way that made today’s mass production and consumption of bread possible.

==Biography==

A native of Jägerndorf ([tpl]lang-cs|Krnov[/tpl]), Moravian Silesia, Charles Fleischmann was educated in Budapest, Hungary, Vienna and Prague. He then managed a distillery in Vienna where he produced spirits and yeast. In 1865, Fleischmann came to the United States, and was disappointed in the quality of locally baked bread in the Cincinnati, Ohio region. The brothers, along with another business partner named James Gaff, founded what became the Fleischmann Yeast Company in Riverside, Cincinnati, in 1868.Klieger, P. Christiaan.

In 1876, they exhibited a Model Vienna Bakery at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, which brought international publicity and sales exposure to the fledgling company, and yeast sales dramatically increased. Eventually, Fleischmann would own 14 manufacturing facilities.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morgan Mergers |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0, 9171, 732595-2, 00. html |quote=But also announced last week was a Morgan-managed merger of Fleischmann Co., Royal Baking Powder Co., and E. W. Gillett, Ltd.... No transportation problem existed in 1868 when Charles and Maximilian Fleischmann, immigrants from Austria-Hungary, and James Gaff of Cincinnati, founded Gaff, Fleischmann & Co. at Riverside, Ohio. Their first great forward step was made in 1876 when they exhibited a Model Vienna Bakery at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. From the fame of this exhibit came an increased demand for Fleischmann's yeast. Soon there was a Fleischmann plant on Long Island, then another at Peekskill, N. Y, Guiding spirit of the early Fleischmann company was Charles Fleischmann, who died in 1897. It was under the leadership (1897-1925) of the late Julius Fleischmann that the company went through its major expansion period. Following his death, his brother, Major Max C. Fleischmann, stepped to the front. |work=Time (magazine) |year=1929 |accessdate=2008-08-04 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Max commuted to New York headquarters from his home in Santa Barbara, California by private railcar.Klieger, Ibid
The company still exists today as a St. Louis-based producer of yeast and other products. The Fleischmann Yeast Company eventually became the world's leading yeast producer and the second largest in the production of vinegar. It was also America's first commercial producer of gin, under the Fleischmann brand name. 
Charles Fleischmann is also responsible for numerous mechanical patents involving yeast production machinery. He helped to organize the Market National Bank and became its president from 1887 until his death in 1897. He was buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in a mausoleum based on the Parthenon.[tpl]cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kgnS65gAbJoC&lpg=PA84&dq=cincinnati%20workhouse&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q=cincinnati%20workhouse&f=false | title=Cincinnati Landmarks | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | date=Oct 29, 2012 | accessdate=2013-05-19 | author=Rolfes, Steven | pages=44[/tpl] His son, Julius Fleischmann, later served as the mayor of Cincinnati.
