A third aircraft, A D.H. Moth (Gipsy) was won by the Club as prize offered by Sir Charles Wakefield to the first Indian flying club which should turn out 12 qualified pilots, of whom at least six were to be Indians.[tpl]cite news |title=Bombay Flying Club "At Home" |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1930/untitled0%20-%200199.html |work=Flight Global |date=7 February 1930 |accessdate=17 September 2011[/tpl] The Club used these aircraft for tuition, joy-rides, and air travel.The activities of the club were, unfortunately, limited by the fact that the aerodrome at Juhu was not suitable during the monsoon.[tpl]cite news |title=Bombay Flying Club First Annual Report |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1929/1929-1%20-%200670.html |work=Flight Global |date=1 August 1929 |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl] This problem was solved by 1937.[tpl]cite news |title=Juhu Improvements |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1937/1937%20-%202980.html |work=Flight Global |date=28 October 1937 |accessdate=17 September 2011[/tpl] The Club received its licence to build a hangar and garages at the aerodrome on 17 August 1931.[tpl]cite news |title=Bombay Flying club moves court against AAI order |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-03/mumbai/31280833_1_bombay-flying-club-aai-airports-authority |work=The Times of India |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=24 April 2012 [/tpl]

The Club shifted its Training operations to Dhule Airport near the town of Dhule in 2009 to avoid the congested air-space of Mumbai. The Club leased the airstrip from the Maharashtra Airport Development Company in order to carry out its training activities without any restrictions.[tpl]cite news |title=Busy city skies push flying club to Dhule  |url=http://www1.lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=9&sectid=edid=&edlabel=TOIM&mydateHid=24-05-2010&pubname=Times+of+India+-+Mumbai&edname=&articleid=Ar00900& |work=The Times of India |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=2 March 2012 [/tpl]
