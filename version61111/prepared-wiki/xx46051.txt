The municipality of Beauraing was created in 1977 from the fusion of Beauraing, Baronville, Dion, Felenne, Feschaux, Focant, Froidfontaine, Honnay, Javingue, Martouzin-Neuville, Pondrôme, Vonêche, Wancennes, Wiesme and Winenne.
Beauraing is a place of pilgrimage for Catholics ever since five children and young adults reported 33 apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary between November 29, 1932 and January 3, 1933. The sobriquet applied to these apparitions is Our Lady of Beauraing, the Virgin of the Golden Heart. The apparitions are among those which are officially sanctioned by the Church.
