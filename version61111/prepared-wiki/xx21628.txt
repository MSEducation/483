[[List of United States federal agencies]]

CATEGORIES: Agencies of the United States Congress, Agencies of the United States government, United States federal executive departments

This is a list of agencies of the United States federal government. 
The executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments (whose secretaries belong to the Cabinet). Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.
The majority of the independent agencies of the United States government are also classified as executive agencies (they are independent in that they are not subordinated under a Cabinet position). There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Library of Congress and Congressional Budget Office, which are administered directly by Congress and thus are legislative branch agencies. The status of these agencies is an open question, however, as Judge Brett Kavanaugh noted in a brief concurrence in SoundExchange, Inc. v. Librarian of Congress. There is one independent agency in the judicial branch.
