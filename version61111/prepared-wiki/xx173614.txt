James Noel (born 18 October 1982) is a British professional basketball player, who most recently played for the Plymouth Raiders in the BBL.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/basketball/7445699.stm|title=Noel decides to stay with Raiders|date=10 June 2008|publisher=BBC Online|accessdate=13 March 2011[/tpl]
Born in London, the 6'7 power forward was educated at the Masters College in California, before returning to England in 2006 to sign with rookie professional outfit Worcester Wolves in the British Basketball League. Despite the Wolves' dismal season, where they ended with a 4-32 record and a last-place finish, Noel shone through as a revelation recruit. Averaging 26.48 minutes per game, Noel posted 8.57 points and 7.96 rebounds in his first season out of college.
However, it was finishing seventh in the Floor Shooting percentages table, with a tally of 54.19% that raised awareness amongst rival coaches in the league. Plymouth Raiders head coach Gary Stronach was the quickest to react and immediately signed him during the 2007 close-season. Although initially signed as a back-up forward to Raiders' 2007 MVP Gaylon Moore, Noel displayed his tough play and strong hustle whenever he got the chance and soon forced his way up the pecking-order on Raiders' deep bench.
James Noel is also a published author.  He is a contributing author to a 2003 anthology titled, "Open My Eyes, Open My Soul: Celebrating Our Common Humanity", co-created by Elodia Tate and the late Yolanda King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King.
James Noel is also the author and creator of the Boris Basketball And Friends, a series of children's books.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071469451 |title=Open My Eyes, Open My Soul |publisher=Mhprofessional.com |date=2003-12-10 |accessdate=2012-01-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://borisandfriends.com |title=Children's Book Author |publisher=Borisandfriends.com |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-21[/tpl]
