Lal Krishna Advani (Sindhi: لال ڪرشنا آڏواڻي, Hindi: लालकृष्ण आडवाणी)  born on 8 November 1927, in Karachi, in Sindh (now Pakistan) is an Indian politician who is a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the current opposition in the Indian Parliament. When the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power from 1998–2004 under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani served as Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister (the latter in 2002–04). He was the Leader of the Opposition in the 10th Lok Sabha and 14th Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament).[tpl]cite web|title=Members Bioprofile|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/Biography.aspx?mpsno=9|publisher=Lok Sabha of India/National Informatics Centre, New Delhi|accessdate=27 April 2011[/tpl] Advani began his political career as a volunteer of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation.

==Early life and education==

L.K Advani was born in Karachi, a Hindu Sindhi familyFriday Times : Analysis: Trading with India to Kishanchand D Advani and Gyani Devi. He completed his early schooling from Saint Patrick's High School, Karachi, and then enrolled at D G National College in Hyderabad (Pakistan) Sindh. He graduated in Law from Government Law College, Mumbai University.

==Political career==

===Early career===

Advani's life as a social servant started in 1947 when he was elected as the Secretary, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Karachi. Advani was later sent to Matsya-Alwar in Rajasthan, which had witnessed communal violence following Partition, to oversee the affairs of the RSS there.

===Bharatiya Jana Sangh===

Advani became a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, also known simply as the Jana Sangh, which was founded in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mookerjee. He became member of the Rajya Sabha from Delhi for the six year tenure from 1970.[tpl]cite web |url=http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/alphabeticallist_all_terms.aspx |title=List of Rajya Sabha members Since 1952 [/tpl] After serving various positions in the Jana Sangh, he became its President in 1973 at the Kanpur session of the party working committee. His first act as president of the BJS was to expel founder member and veteran leader Balraj Madhok from primary membership of the party for supposedly repeatedly violating the party directives and acting against the interests of the party. He was a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat from 1976 to 1982. When Jai Prakash Narayan, who led the public movement against the Emergency refused to campaign for the opposition parties unless all of them joined together, the Jana Sangh and many other opposition parties merged into the Janata Party. With the dissolution of the Jana Sangh, Advani and his colleague Atal Bihari Vajpayee joined the Janata Party to fight the Lok Sabha Elections of 1977.

===Janata Party to Bharatiya Janata Party===

The Janata Party was formed by political leaders and activists of various political parties who had been united in opposing the state of Emergency imposed in 1975 by then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. After elections were called in 1977, the Janata Party was formed from the union of the Congress (O), the Swatantra Party, the Socialist Party of India, the Jana Sangh and the Lok Dal. Jagjivan Ram split from the Indian National Congress, bringing a small faction known as the Congress for Democracy with him, and joined the Janata alliance. The widespread unpopularity of Emergency rule gave the Janata Party and its allies a landslide victory in the election. Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister of India, Advani became the Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Vajpayee became the Foreign Minister.
The erstwhile members of the Jana Sangh, quit the Janata Party and they formed the new Bharatiya Janata Party. Advani became a prominent leader of the newly founded BJP and represented the party in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian Parliament) from Madhya Pradesh for two terms beginning in 1982.

===The rise of the BJP===

Atal Bihari Vajpayee was appointed the first president of the new party. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that despite the factional wars within the Janata government, its period in power had seen a rise in support for the RSS, marked by a wave of communal violence in the early 1980s.[tpl]cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|pages=563–564[/tpl] Despite this, the BJP under Vajpayee initially took a more moderate approach to Hindutva, in order to gain a wider appeal. This strategy was unsuccessful, as the BJP won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984.[tpl]cite journal|last=Malik|first=Yogendra K.|coauthors=V. B. Singh|title=Bharatiya Janata Party: An Alternative to the Congress (I)?|journal=Asian Survey|date=April 1992|volume=32|issue=4|pages=318–336|jstor=2645149|doi=10.2307/2645149[/tpl] A few months prior to the election, Indira Gandhi was assassinated, creating a sympathy wave for the Congress that also contributed to the BJP's low tally, as the Congress won a record number of seats. This failure led to a shift in the party's stance; Advani was appointed party president, and the BJP returned to the hardline Hindutva of its predecessor.[tpl]cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan[/tpl]
Under Advani, the BJP became the political face of the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had begun a movement for the construction of a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that a temple once stood there that had been demolished by the Mughal emperor Babur when he constructed the Babri mosque. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has supported the claim that a Hindu structure once stood at the site, without commenting on a possible demolition.[tpl]cite web|title=Evidence of temple found: ASI|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030826/main6.htm|date=25 August 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm |title=Layers of truth|publisher = The Week|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm|archivedate = 23 March 2005[/tpl] The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election manifesto, which provided rich dividends in the general elections of 1989. Despite the Congress winning a plurality in the election, it declined to form a government, and so the National Front government of VP Singh was sworn in. The support of the BJP, with its tally of 86 seats, was crucial to the new government.[tpl]cite book|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra|title=India After Gandhi|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|pages=582–598[/tpl]
Advani embarked on a "Rath Yatra," or chariot journey, to mobilize karsevaks,  or volunteers, to converge upon the Babri Masjid to offer prayers. This Rath Yatra, undertaken in an air-conditioned van decorated to look like a chariot, began from Somnath in Gujarat and covered a large portion of Northern India until it was stopped by the Chief Minister of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav, on the grounds that it was leading to communal violence. In the 1991 general elections, the BJP won the second largest number of seats, after the Congress.
In 1992, two years after Advani ended his yatra, despite assurances given by the Kalyan Singh led BJP Government to the Supreme Court, the Babri Masjid was demolished by the nationalists with alleged complicity of the Kalyan Singh government.[tpl]cite web|title=Muslims can never forgive Kalyan over Babri issue|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Muslims-can-never-forgive-Kalyan-over-Babri-issue/419656/|publisher=Express India|accessdate=27 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Babri demolition & failure of Muslim leadership|url=http://www.zeenews.com/news657090.html|publisher=Zee News India|accessdate=27 April 2011[/tpl] Advani is one of the main accused in the Babri Masjid case.[tpl]cite news|title=SC notice to Advani, Thackeray in Babri demolition case|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-04/india/28658386_1_demolition-case-allahabad-high-court-bal-thackeray|accessdate=27 April 2011|newspaper=The Times of India|date=4 March 2011[/tpl]
BJP, under Advani, sat in the opposition from 1991–1996 during the reign of P V Narasimha Rao. The Rao regime was repeatedly accused by the BJP of corruption and various scandals.

===Home Minister in the NDA government===

After the 1996 general elections, the BJP became the single largest party and was consequently invited by the President to form the Government. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in as Prime Minister in May 1996. However, the Government did not last long and Vajpayee resigned after thirteen days.

===Second term 1998–1999===

After two years in the political wilderness, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), came to power with Vajpayee returning as Prime Minister in March 1998, when elections were called after India saw two unstable Governments headed by H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral respectively.
After the fall of two United Front government between 1996 and 1998 (H. D. Deve Gowda and I. K. Gujral), the Lok Sabha, (lower house) of India's Parliament was dissolved and new elections were held. Now, a coalition of  political parties signed up with BJP to form the Nationwide Democratic Alliance (NDA), headed by A.B. Vajpayee. The NDA won a majority of seats in parliament. However, the govt survived only 13 several weeks until mid-1999 when All Indian Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) under J. Jayalalitha withdrew its assistance to govt. With the NDA no longer having a majority, India's Parliament was again dissolved and new elections were organized. Vajpayee remained the Prime Minister until elections were organized.
Advani assumed the office of Home Minister and was later elevated to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. As Union Minister, Advani had a tough time with India facing a string of internal disturbances in the form of rebel attacks allegedly supported by Pakistan. The NDA government lasted for its full term of five years till 2004, the only non-Congress government to do so.
Advani was charged in a scandal where he allegedly received payments through hawala brokers. He and others were later discharged by the Supreme Court of India, because there was no additional evidence which could be used to charge them."SC clears Advani, Shukla in hawala case". Indian Express. 3 March 1998. According to the judicial inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) they could not find any substantive evidence; the Supreme Court ruling stated that no statement even mentioned Advani's name and that evidence against him was limited to the mention of his name on a few loose sheets of paper.
However, the failure of this prosecution by the CBI was widely criticized.Advani has hit bull's eye each time Times of India – 30 March 2004 While some believe the CBI probe catapulted his rise through the BJP on his newfound "moral authority",Advani's influence in the BJP sprang from his moral authority The Telegraph, Calcutta – 30 December 2005 others have claimed the inquiry was a political stunt.Which Jain? What Hawala? Indian Express – 15 September 1998[tpl]cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ex-official-says-hawala-probe-was-manipulated/articleshow/589213.cms?referral=PM|title= Ex-official says hawala probe was manipulated|publisher=Times of India|date=27 November 2006|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]
As elections approached in 2004, Advani was supremely confident and conducted an aggressive campaign where he claimed the Congress Party would not get even 100 seats. The BJP suffered a defeat in the general elections held in 2004, and was forced to sit in the opposition. Another coalition, the United Progressive Alliance led by the resurgent Congress came to power, with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. The NDA disintegrated with the Telugu Desam Party, which had supported the NDA government from the outside, deserting the alliance.
Vajpayee retired from active politics after the 2004 defeat, putting Advani to the forefront of the BJP. Advani became Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha from 2004 to 2009. During this period, Advani had to deal with rebellion from within the party. His two close associates, Uma Bharati, and Madan Lal Khurana, and longtime rival Murali Manohar Joshi publicly spoke out against him. In June 2005, he drew much criticism when he, while on a visit to the Jinnah Mausoleum at Karachi – his town of birth, endorsed Mohammad Ali Jinnah and described him a "secular" leader. This did not sit well with the RSS either and Advani was forced to relinquish his post as BJP president. However, he withdrew the resignation a few days later.
The relationship between Advani and the RSS reached a low point when the latter's chief K. S. Sudarshan opined that both Advani and Vajpayee give way to new leaders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldstory.php?storyid=68121|title=Atal, Advani should step aside, let young rise: RSS chief|date=11 April 2005|work=The Indian Express[/tpl] At the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the BJP in Mumbai in December 2005, Advani stepped down as party president and Rajnath Singh, a relatively junior politician from the state of Uttar Pradesh was elected in his place. In March 2006, following a bomb blast at one of the holiest Hindu shrines at Varanasi, Advani undertook a "Bharat Suraksha Yatra" (Sojourn for National Security), to highlight the alleged failure of the ruling United Progressive Alliance in combating terrorism.

===Prime Ministerial candidacy===

In an interview with a news channel in December 2006, Advani stated that as the Leader of the Opposition in a parliamentary democracy, he considered himself the Prime Ministerial candidate for the general elections, ending on 16 May 2009. Some of his colleagues were not supportive of his candidacy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/764246.cms|title=Advani opens his heart, and a can of worms|date=11 December 2006|work=Economic Times |location=India[/tpl]
A major factor in favour of Advani was that he had always been the most powerful leader in the BJP with the exception of Vajpayee, who endorsed Advani's candidacy. On 2 May 2007, BJP President Rajnath Singh stated that: "After Atal there is only Advani. Advani is the natural choice. It is he who should be PM".[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-02/india/27883339_1_mohan-rao-bhagwat-vajpayee-and-advani-suresh-soni|title=LK 'natural' choice for PM: Rajnath|date=2 May 2007|author=Mohua Chatterjee, TNN|work=Times of India[/tpl] On 10 December 2007, the Parliamentary Board of BJP formally announced that L. K. Advani would be its prime ministerial candidate for the general elections due in 2009.
However, Indian National Congress and its allies won the 2009 general elections, allowing incumbent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to continue in office. Following the defeat in the elections, L. K. Advani paved the way for Sushma Swaraj to become the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8421132.stm|title=New India opposition leader named |publisher=BBC News|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/article67005.ece|title=Advani quits as Leader of Opposition  |accessdate=18 December 2009 [/tpl]
Advani unexpectedly resigned from all his posts in the BJP on 10 June 2013 following the appointment of Narendra Modi as the head of the electoral campaign of BJP for the 2014 elections on 9 June 2013. He rued that the BJP was no longer the "same idealistic party" created by Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, Deendayal Upadhyaya, Nanaji Deshmukh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The BJP senior committee rejected his resignation on 10 June 2013. Ultimately, Advani withdrew his resignation on 11 June 2013 after Rajnath Singh (BJP President) assured Advani that his concerns about the functioning of the Party would be properly addressed.
