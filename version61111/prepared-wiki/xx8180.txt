[[Möbius inversion formula]]

CATEGORIES: Arithmetic functions, Enumerative combinatorics, Order theory

In mathematics, the classic Möbius inversion formula was introduced into number theory during the 19th century by August Ferdinand Möbius.    
Other Möbius inversion formulas are obtained when different locally finite partially ordered sets replace the classic case of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility; for an account of those, see incidence algebra.

==Statement of the formula==

The classic version states that if g and f are arithmetic functions satisfying
then
where μ is the Möbius function and the sums extend over all positive divisors d of n. In effect, the original f(n) can be determined given g(n) by using the inversion formula. The two sequences are said to be Möbius transforms of each other.
In the language of Dirichlet convolutions, the first formula may be written as
Many specific examples are given in the article on multiplicative functions.

==Repeated transformations==

Given an arithmetic function, one can generate a bi-infinite sequence of other arithmetic functions by repeatedly applying the first summation. 
If the starting function is the Möbius function itself, the list of functions is:
Both of these lists of functions extend infinitely in both directions.  The Möbius inversion formula enables these lists to be traversed backwards. The generated sequences can perhaps be more easily understood by considering the corresponding Dirichlet series: each repeated application of the transform corresponds to multiplication by the Riemann zeta function.

==Generalizations==

A related inversion formula more useful in combinatorics is as follows: suppose F(x) and G(x) are complex-valued functions defined on the interval  such that
then
Here the sums extend over all positive integers n which are less than or equal to x.
then
A particular application of the first of these extensions arises if we have (complex-valued) functions f(n) and g(n) defined on the positive integers, with
A simple example of the use of this formula is counting the number of reduced fractions 0 Another inversion formula is (where we assume that the series involved are absolutely convergent):

==Multiplicative notation==

As Möbius inversion applies to any abelian group, it makes no difference whether the group operation is written as addition or as multiplication. This gives rise to the following notational variant of the inversion formula:

==Proofs of generalizations==

We have the following:
The proof in the more general case where α(n) replaces 1 is essentially identical, as is the second generalisation.
