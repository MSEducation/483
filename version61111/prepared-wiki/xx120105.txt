[[Agreeable Tiger Moth]]

CATEGORIES: Spilosomini, Moths of Canada

The Agreeable Tiger Moth (Spilosoma congrua) is one of three species of white tiger moth which are common in the US. It has pronounced black eyes, white abdomen, and orange "bib" which set it apart from its cousin the Virginia Tiger Moth. Like its cousins, it tents its wings when at rest.
