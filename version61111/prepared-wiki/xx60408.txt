The first five novels in the Hitchhiker's "trilogy" were written by Douglas Adams. Adams' widow, Jane Belson, and the literary agency that manages Adams' estate asked Colfer to write another book, as Adams had intended to add to the series, agreeing that the end to the fifth book was "very bleak". Already a fan of the series, Colfer called the opportunity "like suddenly being offered the superpower of your choice ... For years I have been finishing this incredible story in my head and now I have the opportunity to do it in the real world ... It is a gift from the gods. So, thank you Thor and Odin."[tpl]cite web|first=Alison|last=Flood|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/sep/17/douglasadams|title=Eoin Colfer to write sixth Hitchhiker's Guide book|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=19 March 2011[/tpl]
