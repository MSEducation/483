Yerevan ([tpl]lang-hy|Երևան[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-hy|jɛɾɛˈvɑn|[/tpl]) is the capital and largest city of Armenia and one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities.[tpl]cite book|last=Bournoutian|first=George A.|title=A concise history of the Armenian people: (from ancient times to the present)|year=2003|publisher=Mazda Publishers|location=Costa Mesa, California|isbn=9781568591414|edition=2nd|authorlink=George Bournoutian[/tpl] Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial center of the country. It has been the capital since 1918, the thirteenth in the history of Armenia.
The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by king Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain.[tpl]cite book|last=Katsenelinboĭgen|first=Aron|title=The Soviet Union: Empire, Nation and Systems|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1990|location=New Brunswick|page=143|isbn=0-88738-332-7[/tpl] Erebuni was "designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital."[tpl]cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans, the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries BC|year=1982|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521224963|page=346|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA346&dq=Erebuni+776&hl=en&sa=X&ei=apvCUs-oMvHB7AaIl4G4AQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Erebuni%20776&f=false|author=R.

Sollberger|chapter=Urartu[/tpl] After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide settled in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century as Armenia became part of the Soviet Union. In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire, to Armenia's principal cultural, artistic, and industrial center, as well as becoming the seat of national government.
With the growth of the economy of the country, Yerevan has been undergoing major transformation as many parts of the city have been the recipient of new construction since the early 2000s, and retail outlets such as restaurants, shops, and street cafes, which were rare during Soviet times, have multiplied.
As of the 2011 census, the population of Yerevan is 1,060,138 people, making up to 35.1% of the total population of Armenia.
Yerevan was named the 2012 World Book Capital by UNESCO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35242&Cr=UNESCO&Cr1= |title=Yerevan named World Book Capital 2012 by UN cultural agency[/tpl]

==Etymology and symbols==

One theory regarding the origin of Yerevan's name is the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand IV (the Last), the last leader of the Orontid Dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city's name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (Էրեբունի), which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I. As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, the name eventually evolved into Yerevan (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan). Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni:
[tpl]quotation|The transcription of the second cuneiform bu emphasis of the word was very essential in our interpretation as it is the Urartaean b that has been shifted to the Armenian v (b > v). The original writing of the inscription read «er-bu-ni»; therefore the prominent Armenianologist-orientalist Prof. G. A. Ghapantsian justly objected, remarking that the Urartu b changed to v at the beginning of the word (Biani > Van) or between two vowels (ebani > avan, Zabaha > Javakhk)....In other words b was placed between two vowels. The true pronunciation of the fortress-city was apparently Erebuny.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Israelyan, Margarit A. Էրեբունի: Բերդ-Քաղաքի Պատմություն (Erebuni: The History of a Fortress-City). Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Hayastan Publishing Press, 1971, p. 137.[/tpl]
Early Christian Armenian chroniclers attributed the origin of the name, "Yerevan," to a derivation from an expression exclaimed by Noah, in Armenian. While looking in the direction of Yerevan, after the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded, Noah is believed to have exclaimed, "Yerevats!" ("it appeared!").[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Baghdasaryan A., Simonyan A, et al. «Երևան» (Yerevan). Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. vol. iii. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1977, pp. 548–564.
In Armenian manuscripts, Yerevan was also mentioned as Erevan, Erivan, Erewan, Ervan, Eruan, Arevan, Iravan, Revan and Ayravan.Armenian Encyclopedia, Vol.3 page 550, Yerevan 1977
However, the predominant former names of the city are Erebuni and Erevan.
The principal symbol of Yerevan is Mount Ararat, which is visible from any area in the capital. The seal of the city is a crowned lion on a pedestal with the inscription "Yerevan." The lion's head is turned backwards while it holds a scepter using the right front leg, the attribute of power and royalty. The symbol of eternity is on the breast of the lion with a picture of Ararat in the upper part. The emblem is a rectangular shield with a blue border.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/index.php?page=emblem&lang=eng |title=Symbols and emblems of the city |publisher=Yerevan.am |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]
On 27 September 2004, Yerevan adopted an anthem, "Erebuni-Yerevan", written by Paruyr Sevak and composed by Edgar Hovhanisyan. It was selected in a competition for a new anthem and new flag that would best represent the city. The chosen flag has a white background with the city's seal in the middle, surrounded by twelve small red triangles that symbolize the twelve historic capitals of Armenia. The flag includes the three colours of the Armenian National flag. The lion is portrayed on the orange background with blue edging.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/FOTW/flags/am-yerev.html |title=Yerevan (Municipality, Armenia) |publisher=CRW Flags |accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Early history===

The ancient kingdom of Van (Ararat or Urartu or Biainili), was formed in the 9th century BC in the basin of Lake Van of the Armenian Highland, including the territory of modern-day Yerevan. King Arame was the founder of the state which was one of the most developed states of its age.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/main.php?page_id=278&lang=3|title=Yerevan Municipality:Old Yerevan[/tpl]
However, the territory of Yerevan-Erebuni was settled in the fourth millennium B.C., fortified settlements from the Bronze Age include Shengavit, Tsitsernakaberd, Teishebaini, Arin Berd, Karmir Berd and Berdadzor. Archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform inscription,Brady Kiesling, [tpl]cite web|url=http://yerevan.usembassy.gov/armenia.pdf|title=Rediscovering Armenia|year=2000|accessdate=27 April 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070926164336/http://yerevan.usembassy.gov/armenia.pdf |archivedate = 26 September 2007[/tpl] indicates that the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni (Էրեբունի) was founded in 782 BC (29 years earlier than Rome) by the orders of King Argishti I at the site of current-day Yerevan, to serve as a fort and citadel guarding against attacks from the north Caucasus. Yerevan, as mentioned, is one of the most ancient cities in the world.
The cuneiform inscription found at Erebuni Fortress reads:
Between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, Yerevan was one of the main centers of the Armenian satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire. During the height of Urartian power, irrigation canals and an artificial reservoir were built on Yerevan's territory. In 585 BC, the fortress of Teishebaini (Karmir Blur), thirty miles to the north of Yerevan, was destroyed by an alliance of Medes and the Scythians.
Due to the absence of historical data, the timespan between the fourth century BC and the third century AD is known as the "Yerevan Dark Ages."
Armenia became a Christian nation in 301. The first church in Yerevan, the church of St. Peter and Paul, was built in the fifth century, and was demolished in 1931 to build a cinema hall. The Katoghike Tsiranavor Church of Avan (595–602) of Avan district, which was partly damaged in the 1679 earthquake, is the city's oldest surviving church.

===Arab, Persian and Ottoman rule===

In 658 AD, during the height of Arab invasions, Yerevan was conquered. Since then, and as a result of the Arab trade activities, the site has been strategically important as a crossroads for the Arab caravan routes passing between Europe and India through lands controlled by the Arabs. It has been known as "Yerevan" since at least the seventh century AD. Between the ninth and eleventh centuries, Yerevan was a secure part of the Armenian Bagratuni Kingdom, before being overrun by Seljuks. The city was seized and pillaged by Tamerlane in 1387 and subsequently became an administrative center of the Ilkhanate. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan was constantly fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of Persia and the Ottomans.
At the height of the Turkish-Persian wars, Yerevan changed hands fourteen times between 1513 and 1737. In 1604, under the order of Shah Abbas I, tens of thousands of Armenians including citizens from Yerevan were deported to Persia. As a consequence, population became 80 percent Muslim (Persians, Turks, and Kurds) and 20 percent Armenian. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians lived in Erevan or the villages. The Armenians dominated the various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration.Encyclopaedia Iranica (George A. Bournoutian and Robert H. Hewsen, Erevan) The Ottomans, Safavids, and Ilkhanids, all maintained a mint in Yerevan. During the 1670s, the Frenchman Jean Chardin visited Yerevan and gave a description of the city in his Travels of Cavalier Chardin in Transcaucasia in 1672–1673. On 7 June 1679, a devastating earthquake razed the city to the ground.
During the Safavid Dynasty rule, Yerevan and adjacent territories were part of the Čoḵūr Saʿd administrative territory. This lasted until 1828, when the region was incorporated into the Russian Empire.

===Russian rule===

During the second Russian-Persian war, Yerevan was captured by Russian troops under general Ivan Paskevich on October 1, 1827.[tpl]cite book|last=Ferro|first=Mark|title=The Use and Abuse of History: How the Past Is Taught to Children|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|location=London|page=233|isbn=0-415-28592-5[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kirakossian|first=Arman J.|title=British Diplomacy and the Armenian Question: From the 1830s to 1914|publisher=Gomidas Institute|year=2003|location=New York|page=142|isbn=1-884630-07-3[/tpl] It was formally ceded by the Persians in 1828, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay. Tsarist Russia sponsored Armenian resettlement from Persia and Turkey. Due to the resettlement, Armenians' share in city population increased from 28% to 53.8%. The resettlement was intended to create Russian power bridgehead in the Middle East.The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict: A Legal Analysis. Heiko Krger, Heiko Krüger. Springer, 2010. ISBN 3-642-11787-2, ISBN 978-3-642-11787-9. In 1829, Armenian repatriates from Persia were resettled in the city and a new quarter was built.
Yerevan served as the seat of the newly formed Armenian Oblast between 1828–1840. By the time of Nicholas I's visit in 1837, Yerevan had become an uyezd. In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a larger new province; the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was reorganized into the Erivan Governorate. Yerevan was the centre of the newly established governorate until 1917, when Erivan governorate was dissolved.
Yerevan began to grow economically and politically, with old buildings torn down and new buildings in European style erected instead. The first general plan of the city was made in 1854, during which, St. Hripsime and St. Gayane women's colleges were opened and the English Park was founded. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan's first printing house and in 1879 the first theatre, sited near the church of St. Peter and Paul, was established.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan city's population was over 29,000, of which 49% were Azerbaijanis, 48% Armenians, and 2% Russians.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] Erivan in the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890–1907. In 1902, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Julfa. In the same year, Yerevan's first public library was opened. In 1905, the grandnephew of Napoleon I; prince Louis Joseph Jérôme Napoléon (1864–1932) was appointed as governor of Yerevan province.
In 1913, for the first time in the city, a telephone line with eighty subscribers became operational.

===Brief independence===

At the start of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small town with a population of 30,000.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Encyclopædia Universalis France S.A., « Erevan », 1995. In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the October Revolution. In the aftermath, Armenian, Georgian and Muslim leaders of Transcaucasia united to form the Transcaucasian Federation and proclaimed Transcaucasia's secession.
The Federation, however, was short-lived and on 28 May 1918, the Dashnak leader Aram Manukian declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the center of the newly independent First Republic of Armenia, although the members of the Armenian National Council were yet to stay in Tiflis until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year.
On May 26, 1919, the government passed a law to open the Yerevan State University, which was situated on the main street of Yerevan, the Astafyan (now Abovyan) street.
However, after a short period of independence, Yerevan fell to the Bolshevik 11th Red Army who entered the city during the Russian Civil War on 29 November 1920, and Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 2 December 1920. Although nationalist forces managed to retake the city in February 1921 and successfully released all the political leaders, the city's nationalist elite were once again defeated by the Soviet forces on April 2, 1921.

===Soviet era===

Yerevan became the capital of the newly formed Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the fifteen republics of the Soviet Union. Yerevan was the first city in the Soviet Union for which a general plan was developed. The "General Plan of Yerevan," approved in 1924, was developed by the academic Alexander Tamanyan. The plan was designed for a population of 150,000.
During the Soviet era, the city was transformed into a modern industrial metropolis of over a million people, ready to become a significant scientific and cultural center.
Tamanian incorporated national traditions with contemporary urban construction. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the Persian fortress, baths, bazaars and caravanserais. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian Genocide. The districts of Arabkir, Malatia-Sebastia and Nork Marash, for example, were named after the towns Arabkir, Malatya, Sebastia, and Marash, respectively. After the end of World War II, German POWs were used to help in the construction of new buildings and structures, such as the Kievyan Bridge.
In 1965, during the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Yerevan was the location of a demonstration, the first such demonstration in the Soviet Union, to demand recognition of the Genocide by the Soviet authorities.[tpl]cite book|last=Suny|first=Ronald Grigor|authorlink=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1993|location=Stanford|page=122|isbn=0-8047-2247-1[/tpl] In 1968, the city's 2,750th anniversary was commemorated.
Yerevan played a key role in the Armenian national democratic movement that emerged during the Gorbachev era of the 1980s. The reforms of Glasnost and Perestroika opened questions on issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the environment, Russification, corruption, democracy, and eventually independence. At the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Yerevantsis engaged in demonstrations concerning these subjects, centered on Theater Square.[tpl]cite book|last=Malkasian|first=Mark|title=Gha-ra-bagh!: The Emergence of the National Democratic Movement in Armenia|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1996|page=41|isbn=0-8143-2605-6[/tpl]

===Independence era===

Following the dismantling of the USSR, Yerevan became the capital of the Republic of Armenia on 21 September 1991. Maintaining supplies of gas and electricity proved difficult; constant electricity was not restored until 1996 amidst the chaos of the badly instingated and planned transition to a market based economy.
Since 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8 billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service. Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times over the last decade.
Political demonstrations are a common scene in Yerevan.  In 2008, unrest in the capital between the authorities and opposition demonstrators led by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrosyan occurred after the 2008 Armenian presidential election. The events resulted in ten deathsDeath Toll in Armenia’s Post-election Melee Rises to Ten", Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), 14 April 2008 and a subsequent 20-day state of emergency declared by President Robert Kocharian.Armenia declares emergency rule", BBC News, 1 March 2008.

==Geography==

===Topography and location===

Yerevan has an average height of [tpl]convert|990|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl], with a minimum of [tpl]convert|865|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] and a maximum of [tpl]convert|1390|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] V. Azatian et T. Hakopian, Երևան Ереван Yerevan, ИПО Parberakan, Erevan, 1989, p. 284. It is located on to the edge of the Hrazdan River, northeast of the Ararat plain (Ararat Valley), to the center-west of the country.
Historically, the city is situated at the heart of the Armenian Highland, in Kotayk canton ([tpl]lang-hy|Կոտայք գաւառ[/tpl] Kotayk gavar, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major.
The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river Hrazdan at the south. Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon. The city's elevation ranges between [tpl]convert|900|to|1300|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level.
As the capital of Armenia, Yerevan is not part of any marz ("province"). Instead, it is bordered with the following provinces: Kotayk from the north and the east, Ararat from the south and the south-west, Armavir from the west and Aragatsotn from the north-west.

===Climate===

The climate of Yerevan is continental semi-arid (Köppen climate classification: BSk), with the influence of mountain climate, with hot and dry summers and cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to the fact that Yerevan is located on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance to the sea and its effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to [tpl]convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl], while winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as [tpl]convert|-15|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about [tpl]convert|318|mm|in[/tpl]. Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunlight hours per year.

==Government and politics==

===Capital===

Yerevan has been the capital of Armenia since the independence of the First Republic in 1918. Situated in the Ararat plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time.
When Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the Government house, the Parliament, ministries, the presidential palace, the constitutional court, judicial bodies and other public organisations.

===Municipality===

The Armenian Constitution, adopted on 5 July 1995, granted Yerevan the status of a marz (region).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=7|title=Article 108 of the Armenian Constitution|accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl] Therefore, Yerevan functions similarly to the other regions of the country with a few specificities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=9|title=Article 117 of the Armenian Constitution|accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl]
The administrative authority of Yerevan is thus represented by:
The last modification to the Constitution on 27 November 2005 turned the city into a "community" (hamaynk); since, the Constitution declares that this community has to be led by a mayor, elected directly or indirectly, and that the city needs to be governed by a specific law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/|title=Articles 88.1 and 108 of the Armenian Constitution |accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl] This law is currently in preparation in the Armenian parliament that adopted its first draft in December 2007 and should do the same in the second draft in spring of 2008.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/APFeaturesManager/defaultArtSiteVoir.asp?ID=729|title=Declaration of a member of the Assembly of the Council of Europe.|accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl] The project on the law envisions an indirect election of the mayor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/society/2007/10/18/ereven/|title=Panorama.am, Executive prefers to have indirect elections for mayor|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=16 May 2008[/tpl]
In addition to the national police and road police, Yerevan has its own municipal police. All three bodies cooperate to maintain law in the city.

===Districts===

Yerevan is divided into twelve "administative districts" (համայնքներ)[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] Վարչական շրջաններ  each with an elected leader. The total area of the 12 districts of Yerevan is [tpl]convert|223|km²|0|abbr=off[/tpl].http://www.armstat.am/file/article/marz_11_32.pdf Armstat:Yerevan

==Demographics==

Originally a small town, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia and a large city with over one million inhabitants.
Until the fall of the Soviet Union, the majority of the population of Yerevan were Armenians with minorities of Russians, Kurds, Azerbaijanis and Iranians present as well. However with the breakout of the Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to 1994, the Azerbaijani minority diminished in the country in what was part of population exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A big part of the Russian minority also fled the country during the 1990s economic crisis in the country. Today, the population of Yerevan is overwhelmingly Armenian.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to economic crises, a lot of people fled Armenia, mostly to Russia and North America. The population of Yerevan fell from 1,250,000 in 1989 to 1,103,488 in 20012001 Census : ArmStat. and to 1,091,235 in 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://docs.armstat.am/census/pdfs/12.pdf|title=ArmStat, 2003 Census|accessdate=21 March 2008[/tpl] However, the population of Yerevan has been increasing since. In 2007, the capital had 1,107,800 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===

Yerevan was inhabited first by Armenians and remained homogeneous until the 15th century.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] M. Karapetyan, Բնակչության էթնիկ կազմը և էթնիկ պրոցեսները Երևանում 1724-1800 թվականներին (Ethnic composition of the population of Yerevan and ethnographic processes in Yerevan from 1724 to 1800), Patma-Banasirakan Handes, 1987, Yerevan, Armenian National Academy of Sciences, ISSN 0135-0536[tpl]cite book | last = Ramirez-Faria | first = Carlos | title = Concise Encyclopaedia of World History | year = 2007 | publisher = Atlantic | isbn= 81-269-0775-4 | pages = 42–44 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gGKsS-9h4BYC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] The population of the Erivan Fortress, founded in the 1580s, was mainly composed of Muslim soldiers, estimated two to three thousand.[tpl]hy icon[/tpl] M.

ISSN 0135-0536 The city itself was mainly populated by Armenians. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who visited Yerevan possibly up to six times between 1631 and 1668, states that the city is exclusively populated by Armenians.Tavernier, Jean-Baptiste. Les six voyages en Turquie, en Perse et aux Indes, Volume 1, p. 623 During the 1720's Ottoman–Persian War its absolute majority were Armenians. The demographics of the region changed because of a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Russia. By the early 19th century, Yerevan's had a Muslim majority.
Until the Sovietizaton of Armenia, Yerevan was a multicultural city, mainly with Armenian and Caucasian Tatar (nowadays Azerbaijanis) population. After the Armenian Genocide, many refugees from Western Armenia (nowadays Turkey, then Ottoman Empire) had escaped to Eastern Armenia. In 1919, about 75,000 Western Armenian refugees came to Yerevan, mostly from the Vaspurakan region (city of Van and surroundings). A significant part of these refugees died of typhus and other diseases.Richard G. Hovannisian, The Republic of Armenia: The first year, 1918–1919, Universito of California, Los Angeles, 1971
From 1921–1936, about 42,000 ethnic Armenians from Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Syria, France, Bulgaria etc. came to Soviet Armenia, with most of them settling in Yerevan. The second wave of repatriation occurred from 1946–1948, when about 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, France, United States etc. came to Soviet Armenia, again most of whom settled in Yerevan. Thus, the ethnic makeup of Yerevan became more monoethnic during the first 3 decades in the Soviet Union. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, the remaining 2,000 Azeris left the city, because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

===Religion===

The Armenian Apostolic Christianity is the dominant religion in Armenia as well as Yerevan. The Armenian Church is represented in the city by the Araratian Patriarchal Diocese, with the Surp Sarkis Cathedral being the seat of the prelacy. Yerevan is home to the largest Armenian church in the world, the Cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, opened in 2001 when the entire Armenian nation had celebrated the 1700th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Church and the adoption of Christianity as a state religion in Armenia.
The tiny community of the Orthodox Russians has its own Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God, located in the Kanaker-Zeytun district of Yerevan. The church was built across the barracks of the Cossack troops which had been deployed in Yerevan since the Russian victory in the Russian-Persian war in 1828. The church was closed in the Soviet times to be used first as a warehouse and later as a regimental club. Divine services were resumed in it only in 1991. In 2004, the reconstructed church re-acquired a cupola and a belfry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mospat.ru/en/2010/03/17/news14638/ |title=Russian Orthodox Church, External Church Relations Official Website:Patriarch Kirill visits a Russian church in Yerevan |publisher=Mospat.ru |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2011[/tpl] The consecration of the new Holy Cross Russian Orthodox church of Yerevan was conducted on 18 March 2010, by Patriarch Kirill I of Moscow. The church is being built on Admiral Isakov Avenue and is set to be completed by the end of 2013.

Old Soviet-era buses have been replaced with new modern ones. Outside the bus lines that cover the city, some buses at the start of the central road train station located in the Nor Kilikia neighborhood serve practically all the cities of Armenia as well as of others abroad, notably Tbilisi in Georgia or Tabriz in Iran.
A new route network has been developed in the city, according to which the number of minibuses will be reduced from the currently existing 2600 to 650 by the end of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/main.php?page_id=174&lang=3|title=Public transportation, minibus |accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl]
The tramway network that operated in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its use had a cost 2.4 times higher than the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shutdown the network,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/js04/040122tram.html|title=Arminfo, "Last Tram Put Out Of Operation in Yerevan"|date=22 January 2004|accessdate=19 May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003.

Yerevan has a single central train station (several train stations of suburbs have not been used since 1990) that is connected to the metro via the Sasuntsi Davit station. The train station is made in Soviet-style architecture with its long point on the building roof, representing the symbols of communism: red star, hammer and sickle. Due to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades of Armenia, there is only one international train that passes by once every two days, with neighboring Georgia being its destination. For example, for a sum of 9 000 to 18 000 dram, it is possible to take the night train to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-81016.html|title=ArmenPress, "Yerevan - Batumi railway communication to resume in Summer", ArmeniaDiaspora.com|date=15 February 2007|accessdate=19 May 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080404095535/http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-81016.html  |archivedate = 4 April 2008[/tpl] This train then continues to its destination of Batumi, on the shores of the Black sea.
The only railway that goes to Iran to the south passes by the closed border of Nakhichevan. For this reason, there are no trains that go south from Yerevan. A construction project on a new railway line connecting Armenia and Iran directly is currently being studied.
