Dactylorhiza (as named by Necker ex Nevski, 1937), commonly called marsh orchid or spotted orchid,[tpl]cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136[/tpl] is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). Dactylorhiza were previously classified under Orchis which has two round tubers.Foley, M (2005) Orchids of the British isles. Griffin press Publishing Ltd., Cherltenham, UK ISBN 0-9541916-1-7

==Etymology==

The name Dactylorhiza is derived from Greek words δάκτυλος "daktylos" (finger) and ρίζα "rhiza" (root), referring to the palmately two- to five-lobed tubers of this genus.

==Habitat and Distribution==

These terrestrial orchids grow in basic soils in wet meadows, bogs, heathland and in areas sparsely populated by trees. They are distributed throughout the subarctic and temperate northern hemisphere: in Europe, from Scandinavia to North Africa; also on Madeira, Iceland, West Asia, North Asia, the Himalayas, North America and Alaska.

==Description==

They are hardy tuberous geophytes. In a thickened underground stem, they can store a large amount of water to survive arid conditions. The tuber is flattened and finger-like. The long leaves are lanceolate and, in most species, also speckled. They grow along a rather long stem which reaches a height of [tpl]convert|70|-|90|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Leaves higher on the stem are shorter than leaves lower on the stem. The inflorescence, compared to the length of the plant, is rather short. It consists of a compact raceme with 25-50 flowers. These develop from axillary buds. The dominant colors are white and all shades of pink to red, sprinkled with darker speckles.

==Species==

Many species in this genus hybridise so readily that species boundaries themselves are vague, with regular name changes and no clear answers.  A few species colonise very well onto fresh industrial wastes such as pulverised fuel ash, where vast hybrid swarms can appear for a decade or more, before ecological succession replaces them.

==Hybrids==

Note : nothosubspecies = a hybrid subspecies; nothovarietas = subvariety.
