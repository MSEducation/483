CATEGORIES: Hindu temples in Vellore district

Sri Chandramouleeswarar Temple is situated atop Hariharan Kundram, near Arungundram village.

==History==

The temples of Sri Chandramouleeswarar atop Hariharan Kundram, which had its heyday once, is now in ruins. The walls and vimana are now in a highly dilapidated state. There are no traces of the parivara devadas, goshta devadas and sannadhi of Parvathi Thirupurasundari. The only part that has survived is the beautiful Chandramouleeswarar lingam. As the villagers made an appeal to the Hariharan Kundram Trust, the renovation of this temple has also been taken in the agenda. There were 108 Siva temples around this village. As the hill is called Hariharan Kundram, it is surmised that there could have been a temple for Hari(Vishnu) on the hill.

==Present==

The Chandramouleeswarar temple has now been renovated and goddess Thipurasundari's sannadhi has been installed. Kumbabishekam was performed on 8 June 2006.

On 1 December 2006, Kumbabishekam was performed for the newly constructed Sannadhi's for Lord Venkateshwara Perumal and Padmavathi Thayar.
