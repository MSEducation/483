When prey comes near, it lashes out with its tentacles. Due to the weakness of its jaws compared to the rest of its body, it prefers to drag ensnared prey back to its lair to be consumed at its own leisure rather than to immediately eat it. The grick's rubbery hide can absorb most blows from an attacker, but the beak, however, is a weak spot, as are the tips of the tentacles.
