Initially released on January 21, 2009,http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2009/01/21/microsoft-web-platform-installer-v1-0-released.aspx Microsoft Web Platform Installer (Web PI) is a simple, free tool that automates the installation of Microsoft's entire Web Platform including:
The 2.0 version of the software, released September 24, 2009, adds the ability to automate installation of certain third-party software, such as:http://www.microsoft.com/web/
Additionally, Web PI 2.0's options are populated dynamically at runtime from Microsoft's servers, allowing installation options to be updated without the need to download newer versions of the Web PI software.http://www.microsoft.com/web/Downloads/platform.aspx
On July 7, 2010, Microsoft announced Web PI 3 which includes WebMatrix Beta, a new set of integrated tools for web development. WebMatrix is available only through Web PI 3. Web PI 3 comes with additional tools for web development including IIS Developer Express, SQL Server Compact and several popular open source web applications like DotNetNuke, Umbraco, WordPress and Joomla.
Supported operating systems include Windows 7, Windows Vista SP1+, Windows XP SP3+, Windows Server 2003 SP2+, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
Supported architectures include both x86 and 64-bit.
The Web PI can be downloaded from the Microsoft Web Platform website at www.microsoft.com/web.

==Offline mode==

Whilst the web platform installer is useful it is not usable in environments where an internet connection is not available such as some back-end servers in deployed in an enterprise scenario.
To overcome this limitation Microsoft have introduced an offline mode where products can be downloaded to a local cache on a machine where internet access is available and then use these cached files on a different machine later.http://www.iis.net/learn/install/web-platform-installer/web-platform-installer-v4-command-line-webpicmdexe-rtw-release
