The REO Speed Wagon (alternatively Reo Speedwagon) was a light motor truck manufactured by REO Motor Car Company. It was an ancestor of the pickup truck.
First introduced in 1915, production continued through at least 1953In 1936 REO abandoned the manufacture of automobiles to concentrate on trucks. and led to REO being one of the better known manufacturers of commercial vehicles prior to World War II. Although the basic design and styling of the chassis remained consistent, the Speed Wagon was manufactured in a variety of configurations (pickup and panel truck, passenger bus) to serve as delivery, tow, dump, and fire trucks as well as hearses and ambulances.

While REO produced some wagons based on its automobile chassis (the Model H) starting in 1908 and had organized a division to produce trucks in 1910 with success, the Speed Wagon's introduction in 1915 was a significant step and a sales success. The company was soon offering a variety of Speed Wagon models with many options and by 1925 had produced 125,000.[tpl]cite journal|last=Senefsky|first=Bill|title=REO Speedwagon - The World's First Pickup|journal=Diesel Power|date=May 2009|url=http://www.dieselpowermag.com/features/0905dp_reo_speedwagon/index.html[/tpl]
After years of roughly equal car and truck emphasis, REO shifted its focus completely to trucks, ending automobile production in 1936. Production for the civilian market was suspended during World War II, resuming in 1946.
The rock and roll band REO Speedwagon took its name from this vehicle, but pronouncing the name with each individual letter instead of as a single word. Founding band member Neal Doughty recalls seeing the name written on the board in his History of Transportation class at the University of Illinois and later suggesting it to his bandmates.[tpl]cite web|title=Review of LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME…|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/5012/|publisher=Film Threat|accessdate=23 March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first1=Allen | last1=Verbrugge | first2= Jody | last2= Sowell|title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Please Welcome…|year=2002[/tpl]
