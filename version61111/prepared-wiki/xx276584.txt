==History and activities==

The International Federation of Women Lawyers (created in 1944) should not be confused with the International Federation of Female Lawyers and Judges (or Fédération internationale des femmes magistrats et avocats) founded in 1928 in Paris. According to the organization's history, 60 années d'histoire de la fédération international des femmes des carrières juridiques (Melun: FIFCJ, 1989), the federation was created by Vera Poska-Grünthal (Estonia), Clara Campoamor (Spain), Marcelle Kraemer-Bach (France), Agathe Dyvrande-Thévenin (France), and Margarete Berent (Germany).[tpl]cite book|last=FIFCJ|title=Fédération internationale des femmes des carrières juridiques. 60 années d'histoire.|year=1989|publisher=FIFCJ|location=Melun[/tpl]  sources say that Spanish politician and feminist lawyer Clara Campoamor and three other lawyers founded an earlier organization called the International Federation of Women Lawyers in Paris in 1928.[ref]

The Federacion Internacional de Abogadas was established in 1944 in Mexico city.
FIDA obtained United Nations Consultative status in 1954.[ref]

FIDA works with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO).
FIDA publishes La Abogada Newsletter four times a year in Spanish and English, for members only.
Every two years FIDA publishes La Abogada Internacional in English, French and Spanish.
In 2011 UNESCO said of the organization: "The quality of the work of the IFWL, a professional organization whose geographical extension is fair and representativeness relatively balanced, is undoubted. Admitted to Category C in 1961, it has co-operated with UNESCO since 1953 in the context of the consultative arrangements. It received a financial contribution from UNESCO for organizing the international congress of lawyers (1989). Its co-operation with UNESCO, which is operational in nature, has slackened in the last few years.  It might consider drawing closer to NGOs that operate in similar fields.
