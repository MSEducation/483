==Domestic career==

Although he was born in Australia, Tietjens grew up in New Zealand and attended school in Palmerston North. He moved south to attend the University of Otago in 2004, and was selected to Otago B sides in 2006 and 2007 but never played for the full Otago provincial squad.[tpl]cite web|last=Meikle |first=Hayden |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/178498/rugby-highlanders-squad-near-full-three-more-signed |title=Rugby: Highlanders squad near full as three more signed | Otago Daily Times Online News : Otago, South Island, New Zealand & International News |publisher=Odt.co.nz |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-09-24[/tpl]
Returning north in 2008, Tietjens cracked the Manawatu squad for the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup. He continues as a solid squad player for the Turbos for the next few seasons, before having a breakout year in the 2011 ITM Cup, scoring 4 tries for a vastly improved side.
Tietjens missed the entire 2012 ITM Cup after suffering a major knee injury while playing Super Rugby. For the 2013 ITM Cup, Tietjens moved to Taranaki and made 8 appearances in his comeback from serious injury.

===Super Rugby===

After his strong season with Manawatu in 2011, Tietjens was signed by the Highlanders for the 2012 Super Rugby season. He made 6 appearances for the club before his season was ended prematurely by a serious knee injury.
