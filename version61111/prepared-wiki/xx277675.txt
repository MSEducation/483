"Airplane" gained generally favorable reviews from various music news sites and critics.

The Performance and Zedd, however regarding the former as being far brighter and more melodic, achieving a level of heart and humanity that latter did not.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/review/2013/08/album-review-fx-pink-tape|title=Review f(x) 'Pink Tape'|date=August 7, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=August 8, 2013[/tpl] A reviewer from another K-Pop news site Seoulbeats praised the song for being a 'cool, house-ish, heavy instrumental piece' on the album, adding "I liked it a lot more than I thought I would... very smooth song and the lyrics are not dense at all, it makes for easy listening."
