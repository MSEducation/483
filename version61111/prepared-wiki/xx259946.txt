Indianapolis Park or Athletic Park (II) is the name of a former baseball ground located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The ground was the Sunday home field of the Indianapolis Hoosiers baseball club of the National League from 1888 to 1889.Indianapolis Hoosiers Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors at baseball-reference.com, URL accessed December 7, 2009.

It was located on a block bounded by New York Street (north); Arsenal Avenue (east); East Ohio Street (south); and Hanna Street (now Oriental Street) (west).
The venue was used for Sunday games, due to blue laws that prevented play at their primary home, Tinker Park. During 1887, the club had used the Bruce Grounds for Sundays, but it was thought to be too far away from the city center to draw well.
The ballpark site is now occupied by a residential neighborhood.
