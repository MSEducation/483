Elrington Ball|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] was an Irish politician, Solicitor-General, and Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). He is mainly remembered for the crushing remark by Daniel O'Connell that McClelland was never an example to the profession either as a barrister or a judge.
He was the son of James McClelland of Millmount, County Down. He attended Dublin University, entered Middle Temple in 1787, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1790. He became the Member of Parliament for Randalstown in 1798, and was appointed as Solicitor-General in 1801, as a reward for his support for the Act of Union 1801. He was raised to the Bench in 1803 as Baron of the Exchequer, (rather against his own wishes, since at 35 he felt he was too young), and served to his retirement in 1830. He married Charlotte Thompson of County Louth in 1797. They are buried at Ballymascanlon, where a memorial  was erected to them.
In 1819 he was accused of  judicial misconduct in ordering soldiers to clear his courtroom: but the House of Commons decided not to pursue the mater, since the allegations, even if true, did not amount to evidence of corruption.Volcansek, Mary L.  Judicial Misconduct- a Cross-National Comparison  University of Florida Press 1996 p.76
Daniel' O'Connell, who despised most of the Irish judges of his time, had a particularly low opinion of McClelland. Although no precise date can be given, historians generally accept as true the story that McClelland saw O'Connell sitting in Court in a case he was not briefed in, in the apparent hope that a younger barrister would ask him to assist. McClelland said that he had never behaved so as a barrister: O'Connell sternly replied that McClelland had never been his model as  a barrister, and he did not propose to take directions from him as a judge.O'Faolain, Sean  King of the Beggars-a life of Daniel O'Connell   1938 Mercier Press Edition p.97
