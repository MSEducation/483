Iceland [tpl]IPAc-en|audio = en-us-Iceland.ogg|ˈ|aɪ|s|l|ə|n|d[/tpl] ([tpl]Lang-is|Ísland[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-is|ˈistlant|[/tpl]), sometimes referred to in full as the Republic of Iceland ([tpl]Lang|is|Lýðveldið Ísland[/tpl]), is a Nordic island country marking the juncture between the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The country has a population of [tpl]Ispop[/tpl] and a total area of [tpl]Convert|103000|km2|abbr = on[/tpl], which makes it the most sparsely populated country in Europe.[tpl]Cite web|authorlink = Statistics Iceland|title = Statistics Iceland|work = Government|publisher = The National Statistical Institute of Iceland|date = 14 September 2008|url = http://www.statice.is#Govt|accessdate = 14 September 2008[/tpl] The capital and largest city is Reykjavík, with the surrounding areas in the southwestern region of the country being home to two-thirds of the country's population. Reykjavík is the most northern capital in the world. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists mainly of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle.
According to Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in AD 874 when the chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent Norse settler on the island. Others had visited the island earlier and stayed over winter. During the following centuries, Norsemen settled Iceland, bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1918, Iceland was part of the Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies. The country became independent in 1918 and a republic was declared in 1944.
Until the 20th century, the Icelanders relied largely on fishing and agriculture, and the country was one of the least developed in the region. Industrialisation of the fisheries and aid through the United States' Marshall Plan following World War II brought prosperity and, by the 1990s, Iceland had developed as one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, Iceland became party to the European Economic Area, which supported diversification of the economy into economic and financial services. In 2008, affected by the worldwide crisis, the nation's entire banking system systemically failed, resulting in substantial political unrest. In the wake of the crisis, Iceland instituted "capital controls" that made it impossible for many foreigners to get their money out of the country, causing a dispute with foreign investors. The economy has since then made a significant recovery.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2013/02/20/icelands-stabilized-economy-is-a-surprising-success-story/ |title=Iceland's Stabilized Economy Is A Surprising Success Story |last1=Greenstein |first1=Tracey |last2= |first2= |date=20 February 2013 |website= |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/financial-recovery-of-iceland-a-case-worth-studying-a-942387.html |title= Out of the Abyss: Looking for Lessons in Iceland's Recovery |last1=Mingels |first1=Guido |last2= |first2= |date=10 January 2014 |website= |publisher=Der Spiegel |accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/iceland-financial-recovery-banking-collapse |title=Iceland rises from the ashes of banking collapse |last1=Bowers |first1=Simon |last2= |first2= |date=6 November 2013 |website= |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=11 April 2014[/tpl]

Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation's Norse heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers. Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old Norse and is closely related to Faroese and some West Norwegian dialects. The country's cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine, poetry, and the medieval Icelanders' sagas. Among NATO members, Iceland has the smallest population and is the only one with no standing army. Its lightly armed Coast Guard is in charge of its defences.

==History==

===Settlement and Commonwealth 874–1262===

According to both Landnámabók and Íslendingabók, Celtic monks known as the Papar lived in Iceland before the Norse settlers arrived, possibly members of a Hiberno-Scottish mission. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in Hafnir on the Reykjanes peninsula. Carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned somewhere between 770 and 880, suggesting that Iceland was populated well before 874. This archaeological find may also indicate that the monks left Iceland before the Norse arrived.New View on the Origin of First Settlers in Iceland, Iceland Review Online, 4 June 2011, accessed 16 June 2011.
Swedish Viking explorer Garðar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island.The History of Viking Iceland, Ancient Worlds, 31 May 2008, accessed 10 November 2013. He stayed over winter and built a house in Húsavík. Garðar departed the following summer but one of his men, Náttfari, decided to stay behind with two slaves. Náttfari settled in what is now known as Náttfaravík and became the first permanent resident of Iceland.Iceland and the history, The Gardarsholm Project, 29 July 2012, accessed 10 November 2013.= 48331 Hvers vegna hefur Náttfara ekki verið hampað sem fyrsta landnámsmanninum?, University of Iceland: The Science Web, 7 July 2008, accessed 10 November 2013.
Ingólfur Arnarson built his homestead in present-day Reykjavík in the year 874. Ingólfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers, largely Norsemen and their thralls, many of whom were Irish or Scottish. By 930, most arable land had been claimed; the Althing, a legislative and judicial assembly, was initiated to regulate the Icelandic Commonwealth. Lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of Greenland starting in 986.Kudeba, N. (2014, April 19). Chapter 5 – Norse Explorers from Erik the Red to Leif Erikson – Canadian Explorers. Retrieved from The History of Canada: http://www.thehistoryofcanadapodcast.com/norse-explorers/ Christianity was adopted around 999–1000, although Norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for years.
The Commonwealth lasted until the 13th century, when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of Icelandic chieftains.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://dannyreviews.com/h/Iceland.html|title = The History of Iceland (Gunnar Karlsson) – book review|publisher = Dannyreviews.com|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl] During the period of these early Celtic and Viking settlements, the climate was significantly warmer, and about 25% of Iceland was covered with forest compared to 1% now.Magnusson, M. (2003) The Vikings. Tempus. ISBN 0752426990. pp. 188–191

===The Middle Ages===

The internal struggles and civil strife of the Sturlung Era led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed to Kalmar Union in 1415, when the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark and Sweden were united. After the break-up of the union in 1523, it technically remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.
In the ensuing centuries, Iceland became one of the poorest countries in Europe. Infertile soil, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The Black Death swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–04 and again in 1494–95.Pulsiano, Phillip and Wolf, Kirsten (1993) = d-XiZO8V4qUC&pg = PA312 Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia.

===Reformation and the Early Modern period===

Around the middle of the 16th century, as part of the Protestant Reformation, King Christian III of Denmark began to impose Lutheranism on all his subjects. Jón Arason, the last Catholic bishop of Hólar, was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons. The country subsequently became officially Lutheran. Lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on Iceland. Natural disasters, including volcanic eruption and disease, severely decimated the population. Pirates from several countries, including the Barbary Coast, raided its coastal settlements. During this period many Europeans were also taken captive by Mediterranean pirates and sometimes sold into slavery in the Arab world.[tpl]Cite book|author = Davis, Robert C.|title = Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|url = http://books.google.com/books?id = 5q9zcB3JS40C&pg = PA7|year = 2003|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|isbn = 978-0-333-71966-4|pages = 7–[/tpl]One slaving expedition is inaccurately termed the Turkish Abductions in Icelandic historiography.

===Independence movement 1814–1918===

In 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel. Iceland remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to get colder, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly to Manitoba in Canada. About 15,000 people emigrated, out of a total population of 70,000.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/05/business/iceland.php|title = For Iceland, an exodus of workers|publisher = New York Times|date = 5 December 2008|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl]
Inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland Europe, a national consciousness arose. An Icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of Jón Sigurðsson, based on the burgeoning Icelandic nationalism inspired by the Fjölnismenn and other Danish-educated Icelandic intellectuals. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule. This was expanded in 1904, and Hannes Hafstein served as the first Minister for Iceland in the Danish cabinet.

===Kingdom of Iceland 1918–1944===

The Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark signed on 1 December 1918 and valid for 25 years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark handle Icelandic foreign policy. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the Kingdom of Iceland.
During World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government should assume the control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by Denmark. A month later, British armed forces invaded and occupied the country, violating Icelandic neutrality. In 1941, the occupation was taken over by the United States, so that Britain could use its troops elsewhere, an arrangement reluctantly agreed to by the Icelandic authorities.

===Independent republic 1944–present===

On 31 December 1943, the Danish–Icelandic Act of Union expired after 25 years. Beginning on 20 May 1944, Icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with Denmark, abolish the monarchy, and establish a republic. The vote was 97% to end the union, and 95% in favour of the new republican constitution.[tpl]Cite video|year = 1944|title = Video: Allies Study Post-War Security Etc. (1944)|url = http://www.archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39024|publisher = Universal Newsreel|accessdate = 21 February 2012[/tpl] Iceland formally became a republic on 17 June 1944, with Sveinn Björnsson as its first president.
In 1946, the Allied occupation force left Iceland. The nation formally became a member of NATO on 30 March 1949, amid domestic controversy and riots. On 5 May 1951, a defence agreement was signed with the United States. American troops returned to Iceland as the Iceland Defence Force, and remained throughout the Cold War. The US withdrew the last of its forces on 30 September 2006.
Iceland had prospered during the war. The immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth, driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the US Marshall Plan programme, through which Icelanders received the most aid per capita of any European country (at USD 209, with the war-ravaged Netherlands a distant second at USD 109).= 3411 Vísindavefurinn: Hversu há var Marshallaðstoðin sem Ísland fékk eftir seinni heimsstyrjöld?.

The 1970s were marked by the Cod Wars — several disputes with the United Kingdom over Iceland's extension of its fishing limits to 200 miles offshore. The economy was greatly diversified and liberalised following Iceland's joining the European Economic Area in 1994.
Iceland hosted a summit in Reykjavík in 1986 between United States President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament. A few years later, Iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as they broke away from the USSR. Throughout the 1990s, the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes. To that end, Iceland provided aid and expertise to various NATO-led interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq.Wilcox and Latif, p. 29

====Rise and fall of Iceland as a financial centre====

In the years 2003–2007, following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of Davíð Oddsson, Iceland moved toward having an economy based on financial services and investment banking. It was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/04/iceland200904?printable = true&currentPage = all|title = Wall Street on the Tundra|first = Michael|last = Lewis|publisher = Vanity Fair|date = April 2009[/tpl] The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009.[tpl]Cite journal|url = http://www.nordregio.se/Global/JoN/JoN%202010/Jon%201%202010/JoN%201_2010.pdf|title = Iceland lost almost 5000 people in 2009|format = PDF|journal = Journal of Nordregio|volume = 10|issue = 1|date = April 2010|page = 18[/tpl] Iceland's economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.vb.is/frettir/81718/|title = Viðskiptablaðið – Hagvöxtur 2012 mun minni en spár gerðu ráð fyrir|publisher = Vb.is|date = 8 March 2013[/tpl] Many Icelanders, however, have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies.

==Geography==

Iceland is located at the juncture of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The main island is entirely south of the Arctic Circle, which passes through the small Icelandic island of Grímsey off the main island's northern coast. The country lies between latitudes 63° and 67° N, and longitudes 25° and 13° W.
Iceland is closer to continental Europe than to mainland North America; thus, the island is generally included in Europe for historical, political, cultural, and practical reasons. Geologically the island includes parts of both continental plates. The closest body of land is Greenland ([tpl]Convert|290|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl]). The closest bodies of land in Europe are the Faroe Islands ([tpl]Convert|420|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl]); Jan Mayen Island ([tpl]Convert|570|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl]); Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, both about [tpl]Convert|740|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl]; and the Scottish mainland and Orkney, both about [tpl]Convert|750|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl]. The mainland of Norway is about [tpl]Convert|970|km|-1|abbr = on[/tpl] away.
Iceland is the world's 18th largest island, and Europe's second largest island after Great Britain. The main island is [tpl]Convert|101826|km²|0|abbr = on[/tpl], but the entire country is [tpl]Convert|103000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr = on[/tpl] in size, of which 62.7% is tundra. There are thirty minor islands in Iceland, including the lightly populated Grímsey and the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. Lakes and glaciers cover 14.3% of its surface; only 23% is vegetated.[tpl]Cite web|title = Iceland in statistics|publisher = statice.is|work = Landmælingar Íslands|url = http://www.lmi.is/english/iceland-in-statistics/|accessdate = 22 April 2010[/tpl] The largest lakes are Þórisvatn (Reservoir): [tpl]Convert|83|–|88|km2|sqmi|1|abbr = on[/tpl] and Þingvallavatn: [tpl]Convert|82|km2|sqmi|1|abbr = on[/tpl]; other important lakes include Lagarfljót and Mývatn.

Geologically, Iceland is part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust. This part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume, causing Iceland to be subaerial (above the surface of the sea). The ridge marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American Plates, and Iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iceland.is/country-and-nature/nature/Geology/|title = Geology of Iceland|publisher = Iceland.is|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl]
Many fjords punctuate Iceland's [tpl]Convert|4970|km|0|abbr = off[/tpl] long coastline, which is also where most settlements are situated. The island's interior, the Highlands of Iceland, is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand, mountains and lava fields. The major towns are the capital city of Reykjavík, along with its outlying towns of Kópavogur, Hafnarfjörður and Garðabær, nearby Reykjanesbær where the international airport is located, and the town of Akureyri in northern Iceland. The island of Grímsey on the Arctic Circle contains the northernmost habitation of Iceland.[tpl]Cite web|authorlink = Central Intelligence Agency|title = Iceland|publisher = CIA – The World Fact book|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ic.html|accessdate = 6 August 2006[/tpl]Iceland has three national parks: Vatnajökull National Park, Snæfellsjökull National Park, and Þingvellir National Park.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://english.ust.is/National-Parks/Protectedareas/Nationalparks/|title = National Parks|year = 2002|work = Umhverfisstofnun|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl] The country is considered a "strong performer" in environmental protection, having been ranked 13th in Yale University's Environmental Performance Index of 2012.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings|title = 2012 EPI :: Rankings | Environmental Performance Index|publisher = Epi.yale.edu[/tpl]

===Geology===

A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the Iceland hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið and Eldfell.Simmonds, Jane (1999). = 4-puvJH_lykC&pg = PA100 Iceland.

Iceland has many geysers, including Geysir, from which the English word is derived, and the famous Strokkur, which erupts every 5–10 minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often.
With the widespread availability of geothermal power, and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity, most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity. The island is composed primarily of basalt, a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in Hawaii. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes within approx. 30 volcanic systems active.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Carmichael, I.S.E.|year = 1964|title = The Petrology of Thingmuli, a Tertiary Volcano in Eastern Iceland|journal = J.

Another large eruption occurred on 21 May 2011. This time it was the Grímsvötn volcano, located under the thick ice of Europe's largest glacier, Vatnajökull. Grímsvötn is one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull activity. The eruption hurled ash and lava [tpl]Convert|20|km|0|abbr = on[/tpl] up into the atmosphere, creating a large cloud that for a while was thought to pose a danger to jet aircraft over a wide area of northern Europe.

===Climate===

The climate of Iceland's coast is subpolar oceanic. The warm North Atlantic Current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world. Regions in the world with similar climate include the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and Tierra del Fuego, although these regions are closer to the equator. Despite its proximity to the Arctic, the island's coasts remain ice-free through the winter. Ice incursions are rare, the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969.Lamb H. (1995) Climate, History and the Modern World, Routledge, ISBN 0415127351.
The climate varies between different parts of the island. Generally speaking, the south coast is warmer, wetter and windier than the north. The Central Highlands are the coldest part of the country. Low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid. Snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south.
The highest air temperature recorded was [tpl]Convert|30.5|°C|°F[/tpl] on 22 June 1939 at Teigarhorn on the southeastern coast. The lowest was [tpl]Convert|−38|°C|°F|1[/tpl] on 22 January 1918 at Grímsstaðir and Möðrudalur in the northeastern hinterland. The temperature records for Reykjavík are [tpl]Convert|26.2|°C|°F[/tpl] on 30 July 2008, and [tpl]Convert|−24.5|°C|°F|1[/tpl] on 21 January 1918.

===Biodiversity===

There are around 1,300 known species of insects in Iceland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The only native land mammal when humans arrived was the Arctic fox,[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html|title = Wildlife|year = 2000|work = Iceland Worldwide|publisher = iww.is|accessdate = 22 April 2010[/tpl] which came to the island at the end of the ice age, walking over the frozen sea. On rare occasions, bats have been carried to the island with the winds, but they are not able to breed there. Polar bears occasionally come over from Greenland, but they are just visitors, and no Icelandic populations exist.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.nat.is/Spendyr/polar_bear.htm|title = Polar bears|publisher = Nat.is|accessdate = 7 November 2010[/tpl] There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.nat.is/Spendyr/wild_mammals.htm|title = Wild Mammals In Iceland|publisher = Nat.is|accessdate = 7 November 2010[/tpl]
Phytogeographically, Iceland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. Approximately three quarters of the island is barren of vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland, which is regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Iceland is the Northern Birch (Betula pubescens), which formerly formed forest over much of Iceland along with Aspen (Populus tremula), Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and Common Juniper (Juniperus communis) and other smaller trees, mainly willows.
When the island was first settled, it was extensively forested. In the late 12th-century Íslendingabók, Ari the Wise described it as "forested from mountain to sea shore".David R. Montgomery, Dirt: The Erosion of Civilisations, University of California Press, 2007, pp. 224–225 Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited species diversity. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber. Deforestation, climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion. Today, many farms have been abandoned. Three-quarters of Iceland's hundred thousand square kilometres are affected by soil erosion, eighteen thousand square kilometres so seriously as to be useless. Only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees, but does not compare to the original forests. Some of the planted forests include introduced species. The tallest tree in Iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in Kirkjubæjarklaustur; it was measured at [tpl]Convert|25.2|m|ft[/tpl] in 2013.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.skogur.is/um-skograekt-rikisins/frettir/nr/1882|title = Fyrsta tréð á Íslandi til að rjúfa 25 metra múrinn|language = Icelandic|trans_title = The first tree in Iceland to break the 25 meter barrier|author = Pure Oskarsson|date = 26 February 2013|publisher = Iceland forest service|accessdate = 25 March 2013[/tpl]
The animals of Iceland include the Icelandic sheep, cattle, chicken, goat, the sturdy Icelandic horse, and the Icelandic Sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans. Wild mammals include the Arctic Fox, mink, mice, rats, rabbits and reindeer. Polar bears occasionally visit the island, travelling on icebergs from Greenland. In June 2008, two polar bears arrived in the same month.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/06/17/second-polar-bear-killed-in-iceland/|title = Second polar bear killed in Iceland|date = 17 June 2008|work = icenews.is|publisher = IceNews|accessdate = 3 April 2010[/tpl] Marine mammals include the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and Harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding Iceland, and the fishing industry is a major part of Iceland's economy, accounting for approximately half of the country's total exports. Birds, especially seabirds, are a very important part of Iceland's animal life. Puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs.Wilcox and Latif, pp. 14–15

==Politics==

Iceland has a left–right multi-party system. Following the 2013 parliamentary election, the biggest parties are the centre-right Independence Party (Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn) and the centrist Progressive Party (Framsóknarflokkurinn). Other political parties with seats in the Althing are the centre-left Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin), Left-Green Movement (Vinstrihreyfingin – grænt framboð), Bright Future (Björt framtíð), and the Pirate Party of Iceland (Píratar). Many other parties exist on the municipal level, most of which run only locally in a single municipality.
Iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women.Wilcox and Latif, p. 34 Known as the Women's List or Women's Alliance (Kvennalistinn), it was founded in 1983 to advance the political, economic, and social needs of women.

===Government===

Iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic. The modern parliament, Alþingi (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799. Consequently, "it is arguably the world's oldest parliamentary democracy."Del Giudice, Marguerite (March 2008) "Power Struggle". National Geographic. p. 85. It currently has 63 members, elected for a maximum period of four years.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/|title = Government & Politics|publisher = Iceland.is|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl] The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/Government/LocalGovernment/|title = Local Government|publisher = Iceland.is|accessdate = 10 February 2010[/tpl]
The president of Iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but can veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The current president is Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. The head of government is the prime minister (currently Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson) who, together with the cabinet, is responsible for executive government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent Sveinn Björnsson, who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government. The regent had, for all practical purposes, the position of a president, and Sveinn would later become the country's first president in 1944.
The governments of Iceland have always been coalition governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became prime minister."Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote" retrieved 30 March 2012

===Administrative divisions===

Iceland is divided into regions, constituencies, counties, and municipalities. There are eight regions which are primarily used for statistical purposes; the district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division. Until 2003, the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions, but by an amendment to the constitution, they were changed to the current six constituencies:
The redistricting change was made in order to balance the weight of different districts of the country, since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the Reykjavík city area. The imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system, but still exists.

Constituencies Iceland.png|Constituencies of Iceland
Sýslur á Íslandi.png|Counties of Iceland

Iceland's 23 counties are, for the most part, historical divisions. Currently, Iceland is split up among 26 magistrates (sýslumenn, singular sýslumaður) who represent government in various capacities. Among their duties are tax collection, administering bankruptcy declarations, and performing civil marriages. After a police reorganisation in 2007, which combined police forces in multiple counties, about half of them are in charge of police forces.
There are 75 municipalities in Iceland which govern local matters like schools, transport and zoning.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl] These are the actual second-level subdivisions of Iceland, as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes. Reykjavík is by far the most populous municipality, about four times more populous than Kópavogur, the second one.

===Foreign relations===

Iceland, which is a member of the UN, NATO, EFTA and OECD, maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with the Nordic countries, Germany, the United States, Canada and the other NATO nations are particularly close. Historically, due to cultural, economic and linguistic similarities, Iceland is a Nordic country, and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the Nordic Council.
Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), which allows the country access to the single market of the European Union (EU). It is not a member of the EU, but in July 2009 the Icelandic parliament, the Althing, voted in favour of application for EU membership[tpl]Cite news|author = Associated Press in Reykjavík|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/16/iceland-parliament-votes-eu-membership|title = Icelandic parliament votes for EU membership | World news|publisher = The Guardian|date = 16 July 2009|accessdate = 10 February 2010|location = London[/tpl] and officially applied on 17 July 2009.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/07/17/iceland.eu.application/index.html?eref = edition_business|work = CNN|title = Iceland applies to join European Union|date = 17 July 2009[/tpl] However in 2013, opinion polls showed that many Icelanders were now against joining the EU; following recent elections the two parties that formed the island's new government – the centrist Progressive Party and the right-wing Independence Party – announced they would hold a referendum on EU membership.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22624110|title = Icelanders to get a referendum on joining the EU|publisher = BBC NEWS|date = 22 May 2013T[/tpl]

===Military===

Iceland has no standing army. The U.S. Air Force maintained four to six interceptor aircraft at the Keflavík base, until they were withdrawn on 30 September 2006. Since May 2008, NATO nations have periodically deployed fighters to patrol Icelandic airspace under the Icelandic Air Policing mission.[tpl]Cite web|title = French Air Force in Iceland|url = http://www.mfa.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4240|publisher = Ministry for Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2 October 2010|date = 5 May 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title = Air Policing|url = http://www.aco.nato.int/page142085426.aspx|publisher = NATO Air Command Operations|accessdate = 2 October 2010[/tpl] Currently, the Italian Air Force is providing military protection with a contingent of six Eurofighter Typhoon fighters stationed at Keflavík base (since June 2013).[tpl]Cite web|url = http://theaviationist.com/tag/italian-air-force/#.UcnK8fkvlZ8|title = Italian Air Force|language = Italian|publisher = The Aviationist[/tpl] Iceland supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq despite much domestic controversy, deploying a Coast Guard EOD team to Iraq{{Cite web|url = http://www.lhg.is/starfsemi/stjornsyslusvid/frettir/nr/618|title = Stjórnsýslusvið Icelanders remain especially proud of their role in hosting the historic 1986 Reagan–Gorbachev summit in Reykjavík, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War.

==Economy==

In 2007, Iceland was the seventh most productive country in the world per capita (US$54,858), and the fifth most productive by GDP at purchasing power parity ($40,112). About 85 percent of total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://askjaenergy.org/iceland-introduction/energy-data/|title = Energy Data|publisher = Askja Energy – The Independent Icelandic Energy Portal[/tpl] Utilization of abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power has made Iceland the world's largest electricity producer per capita.[tpl]Cite web|title = World’s largest Electricity Producer per Capita|url = http://askjaenergy.org/2012/06/04/worlds-largest-electricity-producer-per-capita/|work = Icelandic Energy Portal|publisher = Askja Energy – The Independent Icelandic Energy Portal|accessdate = 4 August 2013|date = 4 June 2012[/tpl] Historically, Iceland's economy depended heavily on fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% of the work force. The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and ferrosilicon. Whaling in Iceland has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.iceland.org/us/the-embassy/trade-economy/|title = Trade and Economy, Embassy of Iceland, Undated.

===Economic contraction===

Iceland had been hit especially hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because of the failure of its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of €14 billion ($19 billion).[tpl]Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7852275.stm|title = Waking up to reality in Iceland|work = BBC News|accessdate = 27 January 2009|date = 26 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/10/creditors_call_time_on_iceland.html|title = BBC NEWS | The Reporters | Robert Peston|publisher = Bbc.co.uk|date = 4 October 2008|accessdate = 8 July 2009[/tpl] In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis.

On 28 October 2008, the Icelandic government raised interest rates to 18% (as of August 2010, it was 7%), a move which was forced in part by the terms of acquiring a loan from International Monetary Fund (IMF). After the rate hike, trading on the Icelandic króna finally resumed on the open market, with valuation at around 250 ISK per Euro, less than one-third the value of the 1:70 exchange rate during most of 2008, and a significant drop from the 1:150 exchange ratio of the week before.

===Education and science===

The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that schools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. However, playschools, primary schools, and lower secondary schools are funded and administered by the municipalities. The government does allow citizens to Home educate their children, however under a very strict set of demands.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://grapevine.is/Author/ReadArticle/Mayor-Does-Not-Feel-School-Should-Be-Mandatory|title = ReadArticle / Mayor Does Not Feel School Should Be Mandatory|language = [tpl]Is icon[/tpl]|publisher = Grapevine.is|date = 25 August 2011|accessdate = 22 September 2012[/tpl] Students must stick to the government mandated curriculum, the parent teaching must acquire a government approved teaching certificate.
Nursery school, or leikskóli, is non-compulsory education for children younger than six years, and is the first step in the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 1994. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education as easy as possible.
Compulsory education, or grunnskóli, comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often is conducted at the same institution. Education is mandatory by law for children aged from 6 to 16 years. The school year lasts nine months, beginning between 21 August and 1 September, ending between 31 May and 10 June. The minimum number of school days was once 170, but after a new teachers' wage contract, it increased to 180. Lessons take place five days a week. All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity, although an exemption may be considered by the Minister of Education.[tpl]Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id = rE0NcgxNaKEC&pg = PA118|author = Fox, Jonathan|title = A World Survey of Religion and the State (Cambridge Studies in Social Theory, Religion and Politics)|publisher = Cambridge University Press|quote = All public schools have mandatory education in Christianity. Formally, only the Minister of Education has the power to exempt students from this but individual schools usually grant informal exemptions.|isbn = 978-0-521-70758-9|year = 2008[/tpl]
Upper secondary education, or framhaldsskóli, follows lower secondary education. These schools are also known as gymnasia in English. Though not compulsory, everyone who has had a compulsory education has the right to upper secondary education. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary School Act of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the University of Iceland, which has its main campus in central Reykjavík. Other schools offering university-level instruction include Reykjavík University, University of Akureyri, Agricultural University of Iceland and Bifröst University.
An OECD assessment found 64% of Icelanders aged 25–64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, which is lower than the OECD average of 73%. Among 25–34 year-olds, only 69% have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, significantly lower than the OECD average of 80%. Nevertheless, Iceland's education system is considered to be of excellent quality: the Programme for International Student Assessment currently ranks it as the 16th best performing, above the OECD average.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf|title = What Students Know and Can Do: Student Performance in Reading, Mathematics and Science 2010|publisher = OECD.org|accessdate = 24 April 2012[/tpl] Students were particularly proficient in reading and math.
According to a 2011 Eurostat report by the European Commission, Iceland spends around 2.75% of its GDP on scientific research and development (R&D), about 1 percentage point higher than the EU average, and the 4th highest of any European country.[tpl]Citation needed|date = November 2012[/tpl] A 2010 UNESCO report found that out of 72 countries that spend the most on R&D (100 million US dollars or more), Iceland ranked 9th by proportion of GDP, tied with Taiwan, Switzerland, and Germany and ahead of France, the UK, and Canada.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001899/189958E.pdf|title = UNESCO science report, 2010: the current status of science around the world; 2010|format = PDF[/tpl]

==Demographics==

The original population of Iceland was of Nordic and Gaelic origin. This is evident from literary evidence dating from the settlement period as well as from later scientific studies such as blood type and genetic analyses. One such genetics study has indicated that the majority of the male settlers were of Nordic origin while the majority of the women were of Gaelic origin.[ref][tpl]Cite journal|last1 = Helgason|first1 = Agnar|year = 2000|title = Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland|pmc = 1287529|journal = American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 67|issue = 3|pages = 697–717|doi = 10.1086/303046|pmid = 10931763|last2 = Sigureth Ardóttir|first2 = S|last3 = Nicholson|first3 = J|last4 = Sykes|first4 = B|last5 = Hill|first5 = EW|last6 = Bradley|first6 = DG|last7 = Bosnes|first7 = V|last8 = Gulcher|first8 = JR|last9 = Ward|first9 = R|displayauthors = 9|last10 = Stefánsson|first10 = Kári[/tpl]

Iceland has extensive genealogical records dating back to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the Age of Settlement. The biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database which attempts to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called Íslendingabók, as a valuable tool for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.
The population of the island is believed to have varied from 40,000–60,000 in the period ranging from initial settlement until the mid-19th century. During that time, cold winters, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, and bubonic plagues adversely affected the population several times.[tpl]Cite book|last = Tomasson|first = Richard F.|title = Iceland, the first new society|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|year = 1980|isbn = 0-8166-0913-6|page = 63[/tpl] According to Bryson (1974), there were 37 famine years in Iceland between 1500 and 1804.Lancaster, Henry Oliver (1990). = T4DLK7zLxYMC&pg = PA399 Expectations of life: a study in the demography, statistics, and history of world mortality.

Improving living conditions have triggered a rapid increase in population since the mid-19th century—from about 60,000 in 1850 to 320,000 in 2008. Iceland has a relatively young population for a developed country, with one out of five people being 14 years-old or younger.

===Language===

Iceland's de facto official written and spoken language is Icelandic, a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse. In grammar and vocabulary, it has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages; Icelandic has preserved more verb and noun inflection, and has to a considerable extent developed new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from other languages. The puristic tendency in the development of Icelandic vocabulary is to a large degree a result of conscious language planning, in addition to centuries of isolation. Icelandic is the only living language to retain the use of the runic letter Þ in Latin script. The closest living relative of the Icelandic language is Faroese.
Icelandic Sign Language was officially recognised as a minority language in 2011. In education, its use for Iceland's deaf community is regulated by the National Curriculum Guide.
English and Danish are compulsory subjects in the school curriculum. Both languages are widely understood and spoken.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.icelandexport.is/english/about_iceland/icelandic_language/|title = Icelandic Language|work = Iceland Trade Directory|publisher = icelandexport.is|accessdate = 22 April 2010[/tpl] Other commonly spoken languages are Swedish, Norwegian, German and French. Danish is mostly spoken in a way largely comprehensible to Swedes and Norwegians—it is often referred to as skandinavíska (i. e. Scandinavian) in Iceland.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.heimur.is/heimur/leit/frettir/Default.asp?ew_1_a_id = 138249|title = Heimur – Útgáfufyrirtækið|publisher = Heimur.is|accessdate = 8 July 2009[/tpl]
Rather than using family names, as is the usual custom in most western nations, Icelanders carry patronymic/matronymic surnames, patronyms being far more commonly practiced. Patronymic last names are based on the first name of the father, while matronymic names are based on the first name of the mother. These follow the person's given name, e.g. Elísabet Jónsdóttir ("Elísabet, Jón's daughter" (Jón, being the father)) or Ólafur Katrínarson ("Ólafur, Katrín's son" (Katrín being the mother)).Surnames – Nordic Names Wiki – Name Origin, Meaning and Statistics.

==Culture==

Icelandic culture has its roots in Norse traditions. Icelandic literature is popular, in particular the sagas and eddas that were written during the High and Late Middle Ages. Centuries of isolation have helped to insulate the country's Nordic culture from external influence; a prominent example is the preservation of the Icelandic language, which remains the closest to Old Norse of all modern Scandinavian languages except Faroese.
In contrast to other Nordic countries, Icelanders place relatively great importance on independence and self-sufficiency; in a public opinion analysis conducted by the European Commission, over 85% of Icelanders found independence to be "very important," compared to 47% of Norwegians, 49% of Danes, and an average of 53% for the EU25.[tpl]Cite book|url = http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|title = Social values, Science and Technology analysis|publisher = European Commission Eurobarometer|date = June 2005|page = 35|format = PDF[/tpl] Icelanders also have a very strong work ethic, working some of the longest hours of any industrialised nation.Wilcox and Latif, pp. 65, 70.
According to a poll conducted by the OECD, 66% of Icelanders were satisfied with their lives, while 70% believed that their lives will be satisfying in the future. Similarly, 83% of people in Iceland reported having more positive experiences in an average day than negative ones, compared to an OECD average of 72%, which makes Iceland one of the happiest countries in the OECD. A more recent 2012 survey found that around three quarters of respondents stated they were satisfied with their lives, compared to a global average of about 53%.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/01/05/iceland-among-the-happiest-nations/|title = Iceland among the happiest nations|publisher = Icenews.is|date = 5 January 2012[/tpl]
Iceland is liberal with regard to LGBT rights issues. In 1996, the Icelandic parliament passed legislation to create registered partnerships for same-sex couples, conferring nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. In 2006, parliament voted unanimously to grant same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual couples in adoption, parenting and assisted insemination treatment. On 11 June 2010, the Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law, making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise same-sex marriage. The law took effect on 27 June 2010.[tpl]Cite web|title = Iceland parliament votes for gay marriage|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/11/iceland-parliament-votes-for-gay-marriage/|publisher = Icenews.is|accessdate = 9 July 2010[/tpl] The amendment to the law also means registered partnerships for same-sex couples are now no longer possible, and marriage is their only option—identical to the existing situation for opposite-sex couples.
Icelanders are known for their deep sense of community: an OECD survey found that 98% believe they know someone they could rely on in a time of need, higher than in any other industrialised country. Similarly, only 6% reported "rarely" or "never" socializing with others. This high level of social cohesion is attributed to the small size and homogeneity of the population, as well as to a long history of harsh survival in an isolated environment, which reinforced the importance of unity and cooperation.Wilcox and Latif, pp. 66–67.
Egalitarianism is highly valued among the people of Iceland, with income inequality being among the lowest in the world. The constitution explicitly prohibits the enactment of noble privileges, titles, and ranks.Wilcox and Latif, pp. 60–61. Everyone is addressed by their first name. As in other Nordic countries, equality between the sexes is very high; Iceland is consistently ranked among the top three countries in the world for women to live in.Best and Worst Countries for Women, from Iceland to the U.S. to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

===Literature===

Iceland's best-known classical works of literature are the Icelanders' sagas, prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include Njáls saga, about an epic blood feud, and Grænlendinga saga and Eiríks saga, describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern Newfoundland). Egils saga, Laxdæla saga, Grettis saga, Gísla saga and Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.
A translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the Passion Hymns of Hallgrímur Pétursson, and rímur, rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, rímur were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, National-Romantic writer Jónas Hallgrímsson. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably Halldór Laxness, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). Steinn Steinarr was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.
Icelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation. Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = (Cultural Achievements) Retrieved 13.5.2012|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012[/tpl] and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.Wilcox and Latif, p. 61.

===Art===

The distinctive rendition of the Icelandic landscape by its painters can be linked to nationalism and the movement for home rule and independence, which was very active in the mid-19th century.
Contemporary Icelandic painting is typically traced to the work of Þórarinn Þorláksson, who, following formal training in art in the 1890s in Copenhagen, returned to Iceland to paint and exhibit works from 1900 to his death in 1924, almost exclusively portraying the Icelandic landscape. Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at that time, including Ásgrímur Jónsson, who together with Þórarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of Þórarinn and Ásgrímur. These included Jóhannes Kjarval and Júlíana Sveinsdóttir. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic volcanic rock that dominates the Icelandic environment. Einar Hákonarson is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.
In the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang = en&|title = Kling & Bang Gallery|publisher = This.is[/tpl] The Living Art Museum, Reykjavík Municipal Art Museum, Reykjavík Art Museum and the National Gallery of Iceland are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.

===Music===

Icelandic music is related to Nordic music, and includes vibrant folk and pop traditions, medieval music group Voces Thules, alternative and indie rock bands The Sugarcubes and Of Monsters and Men, jazz fusion band Mezzoforte, singers Björk and Emilíana Torrini, and post-rock band Sigur Rós. The national anthem of Iceland is Lofsöngur, written by Matthías Jochumsson, with music by Sveinbjörn Sveinbjörnsson.[tpl]Cite web|title = The Icelandic National Anthem|work = musik og saga|accessdate = 11 November 2005|url = http://www.musik.is/Lof/E/lofe.html[/tpl]
Traditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by harmoniums. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually a cappella, which can be traced back to skaldic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) "Iceland". In World Music: The Rough Guide. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp. 168–69. The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.[tpl]Clarify|reason = What is Iðunn?

Icelandic contemporary music consists of a big group of bands, ranging from pop-rock groups such as Bang Gang, Quarashi and Amiina to solo ballad singers like Bubbi Morthens, Megas and Björgvin Halldórsson. Independent music is very strong in Iceland, with bands such as múm, The Sugarcubes, HAM, Of Monsters and Men, Sigur Rós, and Viking metal band Skálmöld, as well as solo artists Emilíana Torrini and Mugison.
Some Icelandic jazz musicians and jazz bands have earned a reputation outside Iceland. Perhaps best known is the jazz fusion band Mezzoforte and Los Angeles-based jazz vocalist Anna Mjöll. Many Icelandic artists and bands have enjoyed international success, most notably Björk and Sigur Rós but also Quarashi, Hera, Ampop, Mínus and múm. The main music festival is arguably Iceland Airwaves, an annual event on the Icelandic music scene, where Icelandic bands along with foreign ones play in the clubs of Reykjavík for a week. Electronic musicians include like Thor and GusGus.

===Media===

In 1992 the Icelandic film industry achieved its greatest recognition hitherto, when Friðrik Þór Friðriksson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for his film, Children of Nature. Actress Guðrún S. Gísladóttir, who is Icelandic, played one of the major roles in Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's 1986 film, The Sacrifice. Anita Briem, known for her performance in Showtime's The Tudors, is also Icelandic. Briem starred in the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth, which shot scenes in Iceland. The 2002 James Bond movie Die Another Day is set for a large-part in Iceland.
On 17 June 2010, the parliament passed the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, a resolution proposing greater protection of free speech rights and the identity of journalists and whistle-blowers, the strongest journalist protection law in the world.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/17/iceland-passes-law-on-press-freedom-and-protection/|title = Iceland passes law on press freedom and protection|publisher = Icenews.is|date = 17 June 2010[/tpl] According to a 2011 report by Freedom House, Iceland is one of the highest ranked countries in press freedom.GLOBAL PRESS FREEDOM RANKINGS.

===Cuisine===

Much of Iceland's cuisine is based on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no utilization of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include skyr, hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and black pudding. Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.
Breakfast usually consists of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch may take the form of a smörgåsbord. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly cod and haddock but also salmon, herring, and halibut. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as hangikjöt) or salt-preserved (saltkjöt). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as slátur, which consists of offal (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach. Additionally, boiled or mashed potatoes, pickled cabbage, green beans, and rye bread are prevalent side dishes.
Coffee is a popular beverage in Iceland, and is drunk at breakfast, after meals, and with a light snack in mid-afternoon. Coca-Cola is also widely consumed, to the extent that the country is said to have one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world.Wilcox and Latif, p. 126 Iceland's signature alcoholic beverage is Brennivín (literally "burnt (i.e. distilled) wine"), which is similar to Scandinavian akvavit. It is a type of vodka made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either caraway seeds or angelica. Its potency has earned it the nickname svarti dauði ("Black Death").

===Sports===

Sport is an important part of Icelandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.Wilcox and Latif, p. 109 The main traditional sport in Iceland is Glíma, a form of wrestling thought to have originated in medieval times.
Popular sports include association football, track and field, handball and basketball. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,Wilcox and Latif, p. 110 and Iceland's team is ranked among the top 12 in the world. Icelandic women excel at football relative to the size of the country, with the national team ranked 15th by FIFA.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender = f/fullranking.html|title = FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking|author = FIFA|date = 2 August 2013|accessdate = 23 September 2013[/tpl]
Iceland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Iceland is also a world-class destination for alpine ski touring and Telemark skiing, with the Troll Peninsula in Northern Iceland being the main centre of activity. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless lots of golf courses throughout the island, and Iceland holds the world record for most golf courses per capita with around 5000 individuals per golf course. Iceland regularly hosts an international tournament known as the Arctic Open.Wilcox and Latif, p. 111 Iceland has also won the most competitions for World's Strongest Man, with eight titles shared evenly between Magnús Ver Magnússon and Jón Páll Sigmarsson.
Swimming is popular in Iceland. Geothermally heated outdoor pools are widespread, and swimming courses are a mandatory part of the national curriculum. Horseback riding, which was historically the most prevalent form of transportation on the island, remains a common pursuit for many Icelanders.
The oldest sport association in Iceland is the Reykjavík Shooting Association, founded in 1867. Rifle shooting became very popular in the 19th century with the encouragement of politicians and nationalists who were pushing for Icelandic independence. To this day, it remains a significant pastime.[tpl]Cite web|title = Skotfélag Reykjavíkur|accessdate = 2 September 2007|url = http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm|archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071013013843/http://sr.is/Stofnun_og_saga_SR.htm|archivedate = 13 October 2007[/tpl]
Iceland has also produced many chess masters and hosted the historic World Chess Championship 1972 in Reykjavík during the height of the Cold War. As of 2008, there have been nine Icelandic chess grandmasters, a considerable number given the small size of the population.Wilcox and Latif, p. 112 Bridge is also popular, with Iceland participating in a number of international tournaments. Iceland won the world bridge championship (the Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, in 1991 and took second place (with Sweden) in Hamilton, Bermuda, in 1950.
