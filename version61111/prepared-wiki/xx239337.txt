==Recent News==

One of her latest films is called Tehran Bedoune Mojavez (Tehran Without Permission).  The 83-minute documentary shows life in Iran's crowded capital city of Tehran, facing international sanctions over its nuclear ambitions and experiencing civil unrest.  It was shot entirely with a Nokia camera phone because of the government restrictions over shooting a film.  The film shows various aspects of city life including following women at the hairdressers talking of the latest fads, young men speaking of drugs, prostitution and other societal problems, and an underground rapper called “Hichkas” who performs discreetly because he is banned by the government from  giving concerts.  The  dialogue is in Persian with English and Arabic subtitles.http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5BF1XY20091216?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true Reuters, Cameria phone documentary offers slice of Iran, Dec 16 2009 In December 2009, Tehran Without Permission was shown at the Dubai International Film Festival.http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/en/films-explorer/?id=4771&filmname=TEHRAN%20BEDOUNE%20MOJAVEZ%20%28TEHRAN%20WITHOUT%20PERMISSION%29 Dubai Film Festival website
