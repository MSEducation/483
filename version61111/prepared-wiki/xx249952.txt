==Critical reception==

Rock 'n' Roll Prophet has gained largely negative reviews, with comments describing the album as "goofy", "novelty" and "crap".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=rw-rnrpp|title=Rick Wakeman: Rock n' Roll Prophet Plus|last=McGlinchey|first=Joe|date=15 March 2003|work=Ground and Sky|publisher=Prog Reviews|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] McGlinchey does, however, recognise that the album was largely produced as a tongue-in-cheek project and that "the humour on the release is intentional".
Due to his association with progressive rock (being the antithesis of punk rock), Wakeman wanted the album to be released under a pseudonym – his suggestion being "KUDOS".  It was, however, released under his own name, which he called "a big mistake". AllMusic described the album as sounding similar to The Buggles, with Wakeman corroborating their influence by stating that the album was an attempted spoof.  Wakeman's vocals are also described as "serviceable but not strong" – with the instrumentals "not up to his highest standards". Ground and Sky likened the album to "someone gleefully pressing the self-destruct button on whatever credibility they previously had managed to accrue as a music artist".
Wakeman, however, has commented that he likes the analogue sounds and production on the album, and that the album was "little ahead of its time and a little off the wall".
