The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is the governing body of association football in Asia. It has 47 member countries, mostly located on the Asian continent. All the transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia are members of UEFA (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey). Israel is also a UEFA member even though it lies entirely in Asia. 
On the other hand, Australia, formerly in the OFC, has been in the AFC since 2006, and the Oceanian island of Guam, a territory of the United States, is also a member of AFC.
One of FIFA's six continental confederations, the AFC was formed officially on 8 May 1954 in Manila, Philippines, on the sidelines of the second Asian Games. The 12 founder members were Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea Republic, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/about-afc |title=About AFC |work=The-AFC.com |publisher=Asian Football Confederation |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2010-06-23[/tpl] The main headquarters is located in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

==Competitions==

The AFC runs the Asian Cup, a competition for the national football teams of Asia held every four years, as well as the Asian World Cup Qualifying Tournament and the AFC Challenge Cup.
It also runs the Asian Olympics qualifying tournament.
The AFC also runs three levels of annual international club competitions. The most prestigious (and oldest of the current AFC club competitions) is the AFC Champions League tournament, based on the UEFA Champions League, formed in 2002/03 with the amalgamation of the Asian Champions Cup and the Asian Cup Winners Cup. (An Asian Super Cup competition between the winners of these two major tournaments ended with the birth of the AFC Champions League.) The other competitions branched off this in 2004 when the 'Vision Asia' blueprint for development was launched. This led to the top fourteen AFC nations, the 'mature nations', sending their best teams to the AFC Champions League. The next 14 nations, the 'developing nations' qualify to send their teams to the AFC Cup.
The rest of the AFC-affiliated countries, the 'emerging nations' send their teams to the AFC President's Cup. The teams which qualify from each country are usually the champions and the cup winners.[tpl]cite web |last=Griffiths | first=Ian | url=http://www.footballasia.com/en/news/index.asp?id=40247&sec=90&ssec=260&mth=7&yr=2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051119163847/http://www.footballasia.com/en/news/index.asp?id=40247&sec=90&ssec=260&mth=7&yr=2005 |archivedate=2005-11-19 |title=Clubs sandwiched |work=FootballAsia.com | accessdate=2005-07-19 [/tpl] Currently there is no promotion and relegation between the different levels of nations.
