It was revealed in 2006 that McLachlan was present at a meeting between John Howard and Peter Costello, arranging a handover of power after one and a half terms if Howard was allowed to become opposition leader without challenge, and then won office from the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Howard later reneged on this deal, leading to controversy and public bickering between Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello.Howard, Costello rift deepens, Jim Middleton, Lateline, ABC TV (10 July 2006)Costello bombshell on PM 'deal', AAP, SMH (10 July 2006)
The revelation was made by McLachlan himself and Howard later said in The Howard Years documentary series that he had decided to handover the Prime Ministership to Costello in 2006 but changed his mind as a result of the revelation of the deal. McLachlan therefore cost Costello his final opportunity to become Prime Minister.
