[tpl]nihongo|Shiwaguchi Station|志和口駅|Shiwaguchi-eki[/tpl] is a JR West Geibi Line station located in Ibara, Shiraki-chō, Asakita-ku, Hiroshima, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. The "Shiwa" in the name derives from the nearby Shiwa-chō, Higashihiroshima, despite there being no shuttle bus or other connection between the two locations. This station should not be confused with other stations of similar-sounding name on the Geibi Line: Shimowachi, Shiomachi, and Shiwachi. Even though Shiwaguchi Station is an express stop station, the Miyoshi Liner does not stop here due to lack of passengers using the station.
