The Planetary Collegium is an international research platform that promotes the integration of art, science, technology, and consciousness research.  It is based in  Plymouth University, with nodes in Kefalonia, Lucerne, Trento, and  Zurich. Its president is Roy Ascott.

==History==

The Planetary Collegium was founded in 1994 at what is now the  University of Wales, Newport as the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts (CAiiA) by Roy Ascott.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 464
Three years later, Ascott established STAR (Science Technology and Art Research) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. CAiiA-STAR constituted a joint research platform, with access to supervisory and technical resources of both universities.
In 2003, Ascott relocated the platform to Plymouth University, renaming it the Planetary Collegium.
Since 1997, the Collegium has given over fifty conferences and symposia in Europe, North and South America, Japan, China and Australia.

==Aims==

The Collegium aims to produce new knowledge in the context of the arts, through transdisciplinary inquiry and critical discourse, with special reference to technoetic research and to advances in science and technology.Roy Ascott Its seeks to reflect the social, technological and spiritual aspirations of an emerging planetary society, while sustaining a critical awareness of the retrograde forces and fields that inhibit social and cultural development. It combines the face-to-face association of individuals with the trans-cultural unity of telematic communities, thereby developing a network of research nodes strategically located across the planet, each with a distinctive cultural ethos. The Collegium seeks outcomes that involve new language, systems, structures, and behaviours, and insights into the nature of mind, matter and human identity. http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/researchcover/rcp.asp?pagetype=g&page=273

==Structure==

The Planetary Collegium consists of artists, theoreticians and scholars working within the context of transdisciplinarity and syncretism so as to develop their research in the practice and theory of new media art with a special interest in telematics and technoetics. Their doctoral research leads to the award of the University of Plymouth PhD. Post-doctoral research is also pursued. It has attracted an impressive number of internationally well-established artists, musicians, performers, designers, architects, theorists and scholars involved in doctoral and post-doctoral research.
The hub of the Collegium, CAiiA-Hub (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts) is situated in the School of Art and Media, Faculty of Arts, Plymouth University. Its Nodes are Z-Node http://www.z-node.net/cms/index.html in Zurich, T-Node http://www.m-node.org/ in Trento,  I-Node https://www.facebook.com/ionionode in Kefalonia, and NGL-Node  in Lucernel http://www.neugalu.ch/phd_programme.html
In addition to doctoral candidates and graduates, supervisors and honorary members, its constituency also includes general members, who share the aims and interests of the Collegium, and are invited to participate in its development https://www.facebook.com/groups/20001464384/.
The Planetary Collegium has geographically dispersed members and frequent research sessions and public conferences in Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe.
