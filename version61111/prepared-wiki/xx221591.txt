San Francisco's Club Deportivo Mexico (SFSFL) won the Open Cup by defeating Philadelphia's United German-Hungarians 5-0 in the final at Kuntz Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
With coach Slavador Lopez and marksman Jose Angulo aboard, CD Mexico had outdueled defending Open Cup holders San Jose Oaks 1-0 in earlier regional stages, then swept through the regional final to a semifinal meeting with the Milwaukee Bavarians. In that semifinal, Angulo's goal kept the game 1-1. With the game in overtime and the San Francisco side down to nine men, Angulo broke through on his own twice to give his beleaguered side a memorable 3-1 win.
