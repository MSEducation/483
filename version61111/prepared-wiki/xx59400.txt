==History==

Called Belveer or Beauverium, the castle was built by the Crusaders around 1168 CE. It is  listed amongst the castles destroyed by al-Adil I in 1191–2 CE.Pringle, 1997,  p.118 In 1883, al-Qastal was described as "a small stone village in a conspicuous position on a rocky hill-top" with springs to the east.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, III:18. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.310
The 1931 census of Palestine counted 14 houses with a population of 55 Muslims and 4 Christians.[tpl]cite book | editor = E. Mills | title = Census of Palestine 1931.

In 1948, al-Qastal was a key position on the Jaffa-Jerusalem road that was used by Arab forces to besiege the Jews of Jerusalem.War for the Jerusalem Road, Time, Apr. 19, 1948. It was occupied  by the Arab Liberation Army led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the Arab Jerusalem Hills sector commander.Morris, 2008, p. 123
The village was assaulted by the Palmach's Harel Brigade during Operation Nachshon, causing almost all the inhabitants to flee.Morris, 2004, pp. 234–235. Palmach troops occupied the village on April 3, but its commander was refused permission to blow up the houses.
Forces under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni recaptured al-Qastal from the Palmach on April 8, 1948. During this operation Al-Husayni himself was killed. Al-Husayni's death is said to have been a factor in the loss of morale among his forces.Morris, 2008, p. 125 Many left their positions to attend al-Husayni's funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday, April 9.  Palmach troops retook the village on the night of April 8-9th; they blew up most of the houses and made the hill a command post.Benveniśtî, 2002, p.111.
Mevaseret Zion is located on the former lands of Al-Qastal.
