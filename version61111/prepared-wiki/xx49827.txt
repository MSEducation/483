The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 ([tpl]lang-ru|Микоян и Гуревич МиГ-23[/tpl]; NATO reporting name: Flogger) is a variable-geometry fighter aircraft, designed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union. It is considered to belong to the Soviet third generation jet fighter category, along with similarly aged Soviet fighters such as the MiG-25 "Foxbat". It was the first attempt by the Soviet Union to design look-down/shoot-down radar and one of the first to be armed with beyond visual range missiles, and the first MiG production fighter aircraft to have intakes at the sides of the fuselage. Production started in 1970 and reached large numbers with over 5,000 aircraft built. Today the MiG-23 remains in limited service with various export customers.
The basic design was also used as the basis for the Mikoyan MiG-27, a dedicated ground-attack variant. Among many minor changes, the MiG-27 replaced the MiG-23's nose-mounted radar system with an optical panel holding a laser designator and a TV camera. Ground-attack variants of the MiG-23 were also produced, and these generally saw better export success, retaining more multi-mission capability.

==Development==

The MiG-23's predecessor, the MiG-21 (NATO reporting name "Fishbed"), was fast and agile, but limited in its operational capabilities by its primitive radar, short range, and limited weapons load (restricted in some aircraft to a pair of short-range R-3/K-13 (AA-2 "Atoll") air-to-air missiles). The MiG-23 was to be a heavier, more powerful machine designed to remedy these deficiencies, and match Western aircraft like the F-4 Phantom. The new fighter was to feature a totally new S-23 sensor and weapon system capable of firing beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles.
A major design consideration was take-off and landing performance. Existing Soviet fast jets required very long runways which, combined with their limited range, restricted their tactical usefulness. The VVS demanded the new aircraft have a much shorter take-off run. Low-level speed and handling was also to be improved over the MiG-21. This led Mikoyan to consider two options: lift jets, to provide an additional lift component, and variable-geometry wings, which had been developed by TsAGI for both "clean-sheet" aircraft designs and adaptations of existing designs.
The first prototype, called "23-01" but also known as the MiG-23PD, was a tailed delta similar to the MiG-21 but with two lift jets in the fuselage. However, it became apparent very early that this configuration was unsatisfactory, as the lift jets became useless dead weight once airborne. The second prototype, known as "23-11", featured variable-geometry wings which could be set to angles of 16, 45 and 72 degrees, and it was clearly more promising. The maiden flight of 23–11 took place on 10 June 1967, and three more prototypes were prepared for further flight and system testing. All featured the Tumansky R-27-300 turbojet engine with a thrust of 7850 kp. The order to start series production of the MiG-23 was given in December 1967.
The General Dynamics F-111 and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II were the main Western influences on the MiG-23. The Soviets, however, wanted a much lighter, single-engined fighter to maximize agility. Both the F-111 and the MiG-23 were designed as fighters, but the heavy weight and inherent stability of the F-111 turned it into a long-range interdictor and kept it out of the fighter role. The MiG-23's designers kept the MiG-23 light and agile enough to dogfight with enemy fighters.

===Armament===

The MiG-23's armament evolved as the type's avionics were upgraded and new variants were deployed. The earliest versions, which were equipped with the MiG-21's fire control system, were limited to firing variants of the R-3/K-13 (AA-2 "Atoll") missile. The R-60 (AA-8 "Aphid") replaced the R-3 during the '70s, and from the MiG-23M onwards the BVR R-23/R-24 (AA-7 "Apex") was carried. The MiG-23MLD is capable of firing the R-73 (AA-11 "Archer"), but this missile was not exported until the MiG-29 was released for export. The helmet-mounted sight associated with the R-73 missile was fitted on the MiG-23MLDG and other experimental MiG-23MLD subvariants that never entered production as had been originally planned. The reason was that these MiG-23MLD subvariants had less priority than the then ongoing MiG-29 program, and the Mikoyan bureau therefore decided to concentrate all their efforts on the MiG-29 program and halted further work on the MiG-23. Nevertheless, a helmet-mounted sight is now offered as part of the MiG-23-98 upgrade. There were reports of the MiG-23MLD being capable of firing the R-27 (AA-10 "Alamo") beyond experimental tests; however, it seems only Angola's MiG-23-98s are capable of doing so. A MiG-23 was used to test and fire the R-27, R-73, and R-77 (AA-12 "Adder") air-to-air missiles during their early flight and firing trials. Ground-attack armament includes 57 mm rocket pods, general purpose bombs up to 500 kg in size, gun pods, and Kh-23 (AS-7 "Kerry") radio-guided missiles. Up to four external fuel tanks could be carried.

===Price===

The MiG-23 had the advantage of being quite cheap in the early 1980s. For example, the MiG-23MS was priced between US$3.6 million and US$6.6 million depending on the customer; on the other hand in 1980, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon was priced at US$14 million, and the Flogger's closest competitor was the Israeli $4.5 million Kfir C2. This allowed the Soviets to mass-produce the MiG-23 in significant numbers in order to gain a significant quantitative advantage over NATO air forces, especially since the Western world was recoiling under the effects of the 1973 Oil Crisis.

==Operational history==

Western and Russian aviation historians usually differ in respect to the MiG-23's combat record, in part due to the bias in favor of their respective national aircraft industries. They also usually accept claims going along with their respective political views since usually many conflicting and contradictory reports are written and accepted by their respective historians.Ilyin 2000, pp. 36-37Hurley, Matthew M.

===Syria===

The first MiG-23s were supplied to Syria on 14 October 1973, when two MiG-23MSs and two MiG-23UBs were shipped in crates, aboard An-12B transports. By the time these planes could be assembled, flight-tested and their crews made combat ready, the war with Israel was over. During 1974 several Syrian MiG-23s were lost in accidents. The process of making the MiG-23 operational was complex and difficult, and only eight were operational by 1974. The first MiG-23s to see combat were export variants with many limitations. For example, the MiG-23MS lacked a radar warning receiver. In addition, compared to the MiG-21, the aircraft was mechanically complex and expensive and also less agile. Early export variants also lacked many "war reserve modes" in their radars, making them vulnerable against electronic countermeasures (ECM), at which the Israelis were especially proficient.
On 13 April 1974, after almost 100 days of artillery exchanges and skirmishes along the Golan Heights, Syrian helicopters delivered commandos to attack the Israeli observation post at Jebel Sheikh. This provoked heavy clashes in the air and on the ground for almost a week.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] On 19 April 1974, Captain al-Masry, flying a MiG-23MS on a weapons test mission, spotted a group of IAF F-4Es and shot two of them down after firing three missiles. He was about to attack another F-4 with cannon fire, but was shot down by friendly fire from a SAM battery.Gordon and Dexter 2005, p. 67 Due to this success, an additional 24 MiG-23MS interceptors, as well as a similar number of MiG-23BN strike variants, were delivered to Syria during the following year. In 1978 deliveries of MiG-23MFs started and two squadrons were equipped with them.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The MiG-23MF, MiG-23MS and MiG-23BN were used in combat by Syria over Lebanon between 1981 and 1985. On 26 April 1981, two Israeli A-4 Skyhawks attacking a camp in Sidon were shot down by two MiG-23MSs. Russian historian Vladimir Ilyin writes that the Syrians lost six MiG-23MFs, four MiG-23MSs and a few MiG-23BNs in June 1982. One more MiG-23 fighter was lost in July. The Israelis also claimed that they shot down two MiG-23s in 1985, which the Syrians deny. According to Ilyin, the deployment of MiG-23MLs by the Syrians in October 1983 shifted the balance of power in their favor, as they were soon able to shoot down three Israeli F-15s and one F-4 without any losses. Overall, 11–13 Syrian MiG-23 fighter variants were lost in air combat from 1982 to 1985. At the same time, according to Ilyin, Syrian MiG-23 pilots shot down 12 enemy aircraft (including at least five F-16s and three F-15s). These are some of the Syrian MiG-23 claims:Babich 1999, pp. 24-25Gordon and Dexter 2005, pp. 67–68
The Syrian air combat claims of 1982 have not been confirmed by Israeli sources,[tpl]cite book |last=Katz |first=Sam |date=July 25, 1985 |title=Armies in Lebanon 1982-84 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-0850456028[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Steve |last2=Dildy |first2=Doug |date=October 23, 2007 |title=F-15 Eagle Engaged: The World's Most Successful Jet Fighter |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=978-1846031694 |pages=146–147[/tpl] which only admit that one F-15A fighter was heavily damaged in aerial combat by a Syrian MiG-21, but managed to land safely.

====Syrian civil war====

A former Syrian Air Force MiG-23MS became iconic of the siege of Abu-Dhahur airbase: on 7 March 2012, Syrian rebels used a 9K115-2 Metis-M anti-tank guided missile to hit the derelict MiG. Later, in March 2013 they entered in the base, showing the worn out and damaged MiG. Finally, in May 2013, the Syrian Air Force bombed it to completely destroy the wreckhttp://spioenkop.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/abu-ad-duhur-airbase-captured-by-fsa-1.html Syrian MiG-23BNs bombed the city of Aleppo on 24 July 2012, which was the first use of a fixed-wing aircraft for bombing in the Syrian civil war.Gardner, Frank. "Syria crisis: clashes and prison mutiny in Aleppo." The Guardian, 24 July 2012.Pannell, Ian. "Aleppo: BBC journalist on Syria warplanes bombing city." BBC news, 24 July 2012.McElroy, Damien and Magdy Samaan. "Syria's regime uses fighter jets for first time as it struggles to contain rebellion." The Telegraph, 24 July 2012.
On 13 August 2012, a Syrian MiG-23BN was reportedly shot down by the rebels of the Free Syrian Army near Deir ez-Zor, although the government claimed that it went down due to technical difficulties."Syria crisis: Fighter jet crashes near Iraq border." BBC News, 13 August 2012.
Since then, Syrian Air Force MiG-23's together with different Syrian Air Force fighter jets were regularly spotted performing attack runs on the Syrian insurgents,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3LdYDyE_1c who claimed different MiGs being shot down or destroyed on the ground in different occasions.
On March 23, 2014, a Syrian MiG-23 reportedly entered into Turkish airspace and was shot down by a Turkish F-16. According to Syrian officials, the plane, accompanied by a second MiG-23, had been pursuing Syrian rebels on the ground near the border between the two nations and it remained within Syrian airspace during the incident. Turkish sources indicate the two Syrian planes repeatedly flew into Turkish airspace. Two F-16's flying on a combat air patrol mission were sent to intercept, and after several radio warnings to the MiGs that they were flying too close to the border, a Turkish F-16 fired a Sidewinder missile that downed the MiG-23 as it flew over Turkey. The Syrian pilot ejected safely from the plummeting plane, which crashed 1.2 km (1300 yards) inside Syria.http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/23/us-syria-crisis-airplane-idUSBREA2M09X20140323http://www.f-16.net/f-16-news-article4844.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5riHD0bGyRc

===Iran–Iraq War===

The MiG-23 took part in the Iran–Iraq War and was used in both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. The reports about performance in air combat are mixed – some authors claim that Iraqi MiG-23s had some victories and several losses against Iranian F-14s and F-4s.
For example it is said that Colonel Mohammed-Hashem All-e-Agha was shot down by an Iraqi MiG-23ML while flying his F-14 on 11 August 1984. Furthermore, Capt. Bahram Ghaneii was shot down by a MiG-23ML on 17 January 1987."Chronological Listing of Iranian Air Force Grumman F-14 Tomcat Losses & Ejections." ejection-history.org.uk. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.Cooper, Tom. "Iraqi Air-to-Air Victories since 1967." ACIG, 25 August 2007. Retrieved: 28 January 2011. According to Iranian sources, four MiG-23BNs were shot down by F-14s on 29 October 1980, but the victory was not confirmed.Cooper and Bishop 2004, pp. 27—34.
According to researcher T. Cooper, Iranian F-14s caused exceptionally heavy losses to the MiG-23s (most of them bombers, model MiG-23BN) early in the war, much to the disappointment of the Iraqi Air Force, which thought that the Soviet fighter would be a match for the Tomcat.Cooper and Bishop 2003, p. 46. During the Iran-Iraq War at least 58 MiG-23s are claimed to be shot down by F-14s (15 of these are confirmed according to Cooper),Cooper and Bishop 2004, pp. 85—88. and 20 MiG-23s are claimed by F-4s (16 confirmed).Cooper and Bishop 2003, pp. 87—88. According to other sources, MiG-23 losses to all combat causes are between 20 and 28.Потери ВВС Ирака

===Cuban intervention in Angola===

Cuban MiG-23MLs and South African Mirage F1 pilots had several encounters during the Cuban intervention in Angola, one of which resulted in severe damage to a Mirage F1.
On 27 September 1987, during Operation Modular, two MiG-23 pilots surprised a pair of Mirages and fired missiles: Alberto Ley Rivas engaged a Mirage flown by Capt Arthur Piercey with a pair of R-23Rs (some sources say a R-60), while the other Cuban pilot fired a single R-60 at a Mirage flown by Captain Carlo Gagiano. Although the missiles homed on the Mirages, only one R-23R exploded close enough to cause damage – to the landing hydraulics of Capt Piercey's Mirage (and, according to some accounts, the aircraft's drag chute). The damage likely contributed to the Mirage veering off the runway on landing, after which the nose gear collapsed. The nose hit the ground so hard that Piercey's ejection seat fired. As a the result of this ground level ejection, Piercey was paralyzed. The aircraft was written off, but a large portion of the airframe and components were used to repair another damaged (accident) Mirage F-1 and return it to service. In total, the Cubans claim 6 air victories MiG-23 (1 destroyed, 1 damaged and 4 were unconfirmed).Cuban Air-to-Air Victories
FAPLA MiG-23s outclassed SAAF Mirage F-1CZ and F-1AZ fighters in terms of power/acceleration, radar/avionics capabilities, and air-to-air weapons. The MiG-23's R-23 and R-60 missiles gave FAPLA pilots the ability to engage SAAF aircraft from most aspects. The SAAF, hobbled by an international arms embargo, was forced to carry an obsolescent version of the French Matra R.550 Magic missile or early-generation V-3 Kukri missiles, which had limited range and performance relative to the AA-8 and AA-7. Despite these limitations, SAAF pilots were able to vector within the firing envelope and fire AAMs at MiG-23s (gun camera shots evidence this).Cooper, Tom. "Angola: Claims & Reality about SAAF Losses." Central, Eastern & Southern Africa Database, 2 September 2003. Retrieved: 19 October 2011. The missiles either missed or exploded ineffectually behind in the tail plume rather than homing on the hot airframe.
UNITA rebels, opposing Cuban/MPLA forces, shot down a number of MiG-23s with American-supplied FIM-92 Stinger MANPAD missiles. South African ground forces shot down a MiG-23, which was prosecuting a raid on the Caleque Dam, by using the Ystervark (porcupine) 20 mm AA gun.Heitman, Helmoed-Romer.

===Soviet war in Afghanistan===

Soviet MiG-23s were used over Afghanistan. Some of them were claimed shot down.
Soviet MiG-23s and Pakistani F-16s clashed a few times during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. One F-16 was shot down in 1987, Pakistan considers it a friendly fire incident, but the Soviet-backed Afghan government of the time claimed that Soviet aircraft downed the Pakistani F-16 – a claim that The New York Times and the Washington Post also reported.Weintaub, Richard M. "Afghanistan Says It Downed F16 Fighter From Pakistan: U.S. Officials Say Soviet Pilots Involved." Washington Post, 2 May 1987. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.Weisman, Steven R. "Afghans down a Pakistani F-16, saying fighter jet crossed border." The New York Times, 2 May 1987. Retrieved: 28 January 2011. According to a Russian version of the event, the F-16 was shot down when Pakistani F-16s encountered Soviet MiG-23MLDs. Soviet MiG-23MLD pilots, while on a bombing raid along the Pakistani-Afghan border, reported being attacked by F-16s and then seeing one F-16 explode. It could have been downed by gunfire from a MiG whose pilot did not report the kill, because Soviet pilots were not allowed to attack Pakistani aircraft without permission.Markovskiy 1997, p. 28
A year later, Soviet MiG-23MLDs using R-23s (NATO: AA-7 "Apex") downed two Iranian AH-1J Cobras that had intruded into Afghan airspace. In a similar incident a decade earlier, on 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire.

===Libya===

Libya received a total of 54 MiG-23MS and MiG-23Us between 1974 and 1976, followed by a similar number of MiG-23BNs. Many of these were immediately put into storage, but at least 20 MiG-23MSs and MiG-23UBs entered service with the 1023rd Squadron and 1124th Squadron.
One Libyan MiG-23MS was shot down by an Egyptian MiG-21 fighter during and immediately after the Libyan–Egyptian War in 1977 while supporting a strike on the airfield at Mersa-Matruh, forcing the remainder Migs to abort the mission. In one skirmish in 1979, two LARAF MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MF which had been upgraded to carry Western air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9P3 Sidewinder. The Libyan pilots made the mistake of trying to outmaneuver the more nimble Egyptian MiG-21s, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by Maj. Sal Mohammad with an AIM-9P3 Sidewinder missile, while the other used its superior speed to escape.Cooper, Tom. "Libya & Egypt, 1971–1979." Western & Northern Africa Database, 13 November 2003. Retrieved: 28 January 2011. Two Libyan MiG-23MS fighters were shot down by U.S. Navy F-14s in the Second Gulf of Sidra incident in 1989. On 18 July 1980, the wreckage of an LARAF MiG-23MS was found on the northern side of Mount Sila, in the middle of the Italian province of Calabria. The pilot's body was found still strapped to his ejection seat, and on his helmet, was the name, Ezedin Koal.
In the 2011 Libyan civil war, Libyan Air Force MiG-23s were used to bomb rebel positions.Aneja, Atul. "Air strikes deter advance on Tripoli." The Hindu News, via thehindu.com, 1 March 2011. On 15 March 2011, a rebel website reported that opposition forces started using a captured MiG-23 and a helicopter to sink 2 loyalist ships and bomb some tank positions.Karam, Souhail et al. "Libyan website reports rebels sink Gaddafi ships." reuters.com, 15 March 2011. Retrieved: 20 March 2011.
On 19 March 2011, a MiG-23BN of the Free Libyan Air Force was shot down over Benghazi by its own air defenses, who mistook it for a loyalist aircraft.Pannell, Ian. "Fighter jet 'shot down' over Benghazi." BBC, 19 March 2011. The pilot was killed after he ejected too late."Benghazi 'bombarded by pro-Gaddafi forces'." BBC News, 20 March 2011.
On 26 March 2011, five MiG-23s together with two Mi-35 helicopters were destroyed by the French Air Force while parked at Misrata airport, early reports misidentified the fixed wing aircraft as G-2 Galebs."Update 1-French forces destroy seven Libyan aircraft on ground." Reuters, 26 March 2011.
On 9 April, another rebel MiG-23 was intercepted over Benghazi by NATO aircraft and escorted back to its base for violating the UN no-fly zone.Leyne, Jon. "Libya: Fierce battle for second day in Ajdabiya." BBC, 10 April 2011. Retrieved: 12 April 2011.

===Egypt===

Egypt became one of the first export customers when in 1974 bought eight MiG-23MS interceptors, eight MiG-23BN strikers and four MIG-23U trainers, concentrating them into a single regiment based at Mersa Matruh. By 1975 all Egyptian MiG-23s had been withdrawn from active duty and placed in storage.
In 1978 China purchased two MiG-23MS interceptors, two MiG-23BNs, two MiG-23Us, ten MiG-21MFs, and ten AS-5 Kelt air-to-surface missiles (ASMs) in exchange for spare parts and technical support for the Egyptian fleet of Soviet-supplied MiG-17 Frescos and MiG-21s. The Chinese used the aircraft as the basis for their J-9 project, which never ventured beyond the research phase.
Some time later the remaining six MiG-23MS examples and six MiG-23BNs, as well as 16 MiG-21MFs, two Sukhoi Su-20 Fitters, two MiG-21Us, two Mil Mi-8 Hips and ten AS-5 ASMs were purchased for the Foreign Technology Division, a special department of the USAF, responsible for evaluating 'enemy' technologies. These were exchanged for weapons and spares support, including AIM-9J/P Sidewinder missiles, which were installed on remaining Egyptian MiG-21s.

===Gulf War===

During the Gulf War, the United States Air Force reported downing eight Iraqi MiG-23s with F-15s, six of them were confirmed.Coalition Air-to-Air Victories in Desert Storm  Iraqi MiG-23s were reported to have shot down one to two F-16Cs, one Tornado and damaged two F-111s, which later were written off.

===Soviet and Warsaw Pact service===

Because of its distinctive appearance with large air intakes on both sides of the fuselage the aircraft was nicknamed "Cheburashka" by some Soviet pilots after a popular Russian cartoon character representing a fictional animal with big ears. The nickname did not stick and was later firmly assigned to Antonov An-72/74, although to this day it is sometimes applied to different aircraft with similar exterior features, including the USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II.
The aircraft was not used in large numbers by the non-Soviet air forces of the Warsaw Pact as originally envisioned. When the MiG-23s were initially deployed, they were considered the elites of the Eastern Bloc air forces. However, very quickly the disadvantages became evident and the MiG-23 did not replace the MiG-21 as initially intended. The aircraft had some deficiencies that limited its operational serviceability and its hourly operating cost was thus higher than the MiG-21s. The Eastern Bloc air forces used their MiG-23s to replace MiG-17s and MiG-19s still in service.
By 1990, over 1,500 MiG-23s of different models were in service with the VVS and the V-PVO. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the new Russian Air Force began to cut back its fighter force, and it was decided the single-engined MiG-23s and MiG-27s were to be retired to operational storage. The last model to serve was the MiG-23P, which was retired in 1998.
When East and West Germany unified, no MiG-23s were transferred to the West German Air Force, but twelve former East German MiG-23s were supplied to the U.S. When Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Czechs received all the MiG-23s, which were retired in 1998. Hungary retired their MiG-23s in 1996, Poland in 1999, Romania in 2000, and Bulgaria in 2004.
The MiG-23 was the Soviet Air Force's "Top Gun"-equivalent aggressor aircraft from the late 1970s to the late 1980s. It proved a difficult opponent for early MiG-29 variants flown by inexperienced pilots. Exercises showed when well-flown, a MiG-23MLD could achieve favorable kill ratios against the MiG-29 in mock combat by using hit-and-run tactics and not engaging the MiG-29s in dogfights. Usually the aggressor MiG-23MLDs had a shark mouth painted on the nose just aft of the radome, and many were piloted by Soviet-Afghan War veterans. In the late 1980s, these aggressor MiG-23s were replaced by MiG-29s, also featuring shark mouths.Pazynich, Sergey. (Translation: From the history of Soviet 'Aggression')" (in Russian). airforce.ru. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.

===Performance tests===

Many potential enemies of the USSR and its client states have had opportunities to evaluate the MiG-23’s performance. In the 1970s, after a political realignment by the Egyptian government, Egypt gave MiG-23MSs to the United States and the People's Republic of China in exchange for military hardware. In the US, these MiG-23MSs, and other variants acquired later from Germany, were used as part of a Soviet military hardware evaluation program. Dutch pilot Leon Van Maurer, who had more than 1,200 hours flying F-16s, flew against MiG-23MLs from air bases in Germany and the U.S. as part of NATO's aerial mock combat training with Soviet equipment. He concluded the MiG-23ML was superior in the vertical to early F-16 variants, just slightly inferior to the F-16A in the horizontal, and had superior BVR capability."МиГ-23 в Анголе (Translation: MiG-23 in Angola)" (in Russian). airwar.ru. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.
The Israelis tested a MiG-23MLD flown to them by a Syrian defector, and found it had better acceleration than the F-16 and F/A-18.
U.S. and Israeli reports also found that the MiG-23's Head-Up Display (HUD) doubles as a radarscope, allowing the pilot to keep his eyes focused at infinity while operating his radar. This allowed the Soviets to omit the separate radarscope from the MiG-23. This feature was carried over into the MiG-29, though in that aircraft, a cathode ray tube (CRT) is carried on the upper right corner to double as a radarscope. Western opinions about this "head-up radarscope" are mixed. The Israelis were impressed, but an American F-16 pilot criticized it as "sticking a transparent map in front of the HUD" and not providing a three-dimensional presentation that would accurately cue a pilot's eyes to look for a fighter as it appears in a particular direction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
Additionally, a Cuban pilot flew a MiG-23BN to the U.S. in 1991, and a Libyan MiG-23 pilot also defected to Greece in 1981. In both cases, the aircraft were later repatriated."Family explains Cuban defection." Gainesville Sun, 18 July 1994. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.
The early MiG-23M series was also used to test the American Northrop F-5s captured by the North Vietnamese and sent to the former USSR for evaluation. The Russians acknowledged the F-5 was a very agile aircraft, and at some speeds and altitudes better than the MiG-23M, one of the main reasons the MiG-23MLD and MiG-29 developments were started. These tests allowed the Russians to make modifications to several of their fourth-generation aircraft. The MiG-23, however, was not designed to combat F-5s, a weakness reflected by early MiG-23 variants.Kondaurov, V. N. "ИСПЫТАНИЯ НА ВОЛЖСКИХ БЕРЕГАХ (Translation: Testing on the Volga shores" (in Russian). testpilot.ru. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.
Early Western reports claimed that the aircraft had poor dogfighting capability, due to being designed to outaccelerate the F-111.Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 91. Later analysis showed the MiG-23 to be equivalent to the F-4, surpassed only by newer fourth-generation fighters, such as the F-15 and F-16. (The MiG-23 is considered a third-generation jet fighter.) The Soviet combat manual for MiG-23MLD pilots claims the MiG-23MLD to have a slight superiority over the F-4 and Kfir, but is no match for the F-15 and F-16 in most combat parameters. This manual also recommends tactics to be used against these fighters."МиГ-23М (Translation: MiG-23M)" (in Russian). airwar.ru. Retrieved: 28 January 2011.

==Specifications (MiG-23MLD Flogger-K)==

According to the MiG-23ML manual, the MiG-23ML has a maximum sustained turn rate of 14.1 deg/sec and a maximum instantaneous turn rate of 16.7 deg/sec.
The MiG-23ML accelerates from 600 km/h (373 mph) to 900 km/h (559 mph) in just 12 seconds at the altitude of 1000 meters. The MiG-23 accelerates at the altitude of 1 km from the speed of 630 km/h (391 mph) to 1300 km/h (808 mph) in just 30 seconds and at the altitude of 10–12 km will accelerate from Mach 1 to Mach 2 in just 160 seconds.

==Cultural references==

The MiG-23 appeared in the computer game Command & Conquer: Red Alert as an advanced Soviet late-war aircraft.
In the air-combat simulator Heatseeker, the MiG-23 is a hostile plane that can be obtained and used in arcade mode by the player.  It has two varieties and three weapon packs for each variant.  It should be noted that the game does not make a distinction between the MiG-23 and MiG-27.
