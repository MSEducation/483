Charmander, known as [tpl]nihongo|Hitokage|ヒトカゲ|[/tpl] in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Charmander first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The end of a Charmander's tail is alight with a flame, and the flame's size reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual.
Charmander is a starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue, and their remakes, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. In the anime, Ash acquires a Charmander early in the series, and it became one of his most used Pokémon. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. Since it appeared in the Pokémon series, Charmander has received generally positive reception.
Charmander evolves into Charmeleon, and then into Charizard.

==Design and characteristics==

Charmander was one of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Originally called "Hitokage" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html |archivedate=2008-09-13[/tpl] As a result, the species was renamed "Charmander", a combination of "char", meaning burnt, and "salamander".[tpl]cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/12045/charmander.html |title=Pokemon Strategy Guide - IGNguides |publisher=Guides.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01[/tpl]

The idea to feature Charmander and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in Pokémon X and Y came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to find on of these Pokémon in order to see their Mega Evolved form.[tpl]cite web |title=Pokemon X/Y: WHY?!

==Appearances==

===In the video games===

Charmander is a starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue, and their remakes, Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Charmander and the other starters from Red and Blue are replaced by Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow, the only starter available in it. Instead, they are each obtained from certain NPCs. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as a reward from Professor Oak after defeating the final boss, Red, the player can choose from Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. In Pokémon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.co.uk/news/2013-09-04/pokemon-x-and-y-gets-classic-starter-pokemon-3ds-xl-variants |title=Pokémon X & Y Get Classic Starter Pokémon, 3DS XL Variants - News - Anime News Network:UK |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04[/tpl] Outside of the main series, Charmander has appeared in Hey You, Pikachu!, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon Puzzle League, the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pokémon Ranger games, and PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. A Pokémon stage in Super Smash Bros. called "Saffron City" features an area where various Pokémon pop out to attack players; one such Pokémon is a Charmander that sometimes uses Flamethrower.

===In anime===

In the anime, Ash acquires a Charmander early in the series. Ash's Charmander originally belonged to a trainer named Damien, who believed it was weak and cruelly abandoned it, telling it to stay in one spot until he "returned." The Pokémon was very loyal to its trainer and risked its life sitting in the rain, waiting for a trainer who'd never come back to it. Ash, Brock, and Misty had to rush it to a Pokémon Center to keep it alive. Upon seeing Damien's true colors, Charmander joined Ash.[tpl]cite episode |title=Charmander – The Stray Pokémon |series=Pokémon |credits=Junki Takegami (writer) |network=Various |airdate=September 22, 1998 |season=Indigo League |number=11[/tpl] It was immediately one of Ash's most used Pokémon, defeating such opponents as Koga's Golbat, Erika's Weepinbell, and helped capture Ash's Primeape. Charmander evolved into Charmeleon during a battle against an army of Exeggutor. His personality temporarily changed, disobeying Ash and fighting only when and how he pleased.[tpl]cite episode |title=The March of the Exeggutor Squad |series=Pokémon |credits=Hideki Sonoda (writer) |network=Various |airdate=October 30, 1998 |season=Indigo League |number=43[/tpl]
In an anime adaption of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, a Charmander and a female Chikorita work alongside a young boy who transformed into a Squirtle in helping fellow Pokémon.

===In other media===

In the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, the circumstances in which Ash captures a Charmander appear to be different. While Damian appears, he was separated from his Charmander because he was injured, not because he abandoned it. At the end of the chapter, the two reunite. Despite this difference, Ash is still seen owning a Charmander, whose capture is not shown. Later in the manga, Ash's Charmander reappears as a Charizard. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak. Blue tried using it against Mew but failed and withdrew his Pokémon. It is later shown to have evolved into a Charmeleon. In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga series, Isamu Akai's rival Kai Midorikawa, chose Charmander as his starter Pokémon. Kai's Charmander is mischievous and has a rivalry with Isamu Akai's Clefairy.
