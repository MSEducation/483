==Background==

Ben had always wanted to make his second album as a concept album and he had previously abandoned an attempt to make a hip hop follow up to his debut Who Needs Actions When You Got Words.[tpl]cite web|last=Lamb |first=Bill |url=http://top40.about.com/od/p/a/Plan-B-Aka-Ben-Drew-Interview.htm |title=Plan B, aka Ben Drew, Interview – Interview With Plan B, aka Ben Drew |work=Top40.about.com |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] After learning more about the technical aspects of singing[tpl]cite web|last=Gregory |first=Jason |url=http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?id=55386&page_no=1 |title=Plan B – Strictland Business |work=Gigwise |publisher=Giant Digital |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] and having written some soul songs such as "Love Goes Down", which was written whilst supporting The Roots on tour in 2006, Plan B came up with the concept of a story about a soul singer who gets sent to prison.[tpl]cite web|last=Green |first=Thomas H |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=1310:qa-special-musician-ben-drew-aka-plan-b&Itemid=30 |title=Q&A Special: Musician Ben Drew, aka Plan B | New music |publisher=The Arts Desk |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] He commenced recording of the album in which half the songs were hip hop tracks narrated by Plan B and the other half were soul songs told through the eyes of the fictional character Strickland Banks, however this idea was scrapped because the two genres did not work well together and the label 679 Artists thought the idea was too confusing. Hence the album was split into two records and it was agreed that the soul record would be released as Plan B's second studio album.[tpl]cite web|last=Florino |first=Rick |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/plan-b-talks-the-defamation-of-strickland-banks-favorite-books-and-telling-stories/8442165 |title=Plan B Talks 'The Defamation of Strickland Banks,' Favorite Books, and Telling Stories – ARTISTdirect News |work=Artistdirect.com |publisher=Rogue Digital |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl] The sound of the album was influenced by Paul Epworth who produced the demo version of "Writing's on the Wall", although the majority of the album was recorded with producers David McEwan and Eric Appapoulay at The Sanctuary, London. Production took more than two years due to the simultaneous work on the hip hop and soul albums.[tpl]cite web|last=Inglis |first=Sam |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul10/articles/planb.htm |title=Plan B |work=Sound on Sound |date=July 2010 |accessdate=12 January 2012[/tpl]

==Concept==

The album tells the story from the first-hand perspective of Strickland Banks, a fictional character played by Plan B. The album's opening tracks, "Love Goes Down" and "Writing's on the Wall", are love songs sung by Strickland Banks at a concert. "Stay Too Long" follows him and his entourage as they celebrate the success of his concert with a night out which culminates in him having a one-night stand with a woman. In "She Said", we learn that this woman is obsessed with his music and believes herself to be in love with him. He rejects her so she alleges that he raped her. The subsequent trial results in his incarceration, and in "Welcome to Hell" he is sent to prison, and much of the rest of the album is about his experience inside. Throughout the course of the songs "Hard Times" and "The Recluse" we see Strickland get more isolated and insecure throughout as he struggles to cope with prison life. This results in his abuse at the hands of other prisoners, resulting in him purchasing a shiv on the prison black market throughout the course of "Traded in My Cigarettes". In "Prayin'" he is confronted by another prisoner who attacks him. With the help of another inmate Strickland kills the attacker in self-defence, with the other inmate taking the blame, and is burdened with this guilt during "Darkest Place". The next two tracks, "Free" and "I Know a Song" detail initially his anger, then his acceptance of his life inside prison. In the last track, "What You Gonna Do", Strickland is in court again as new evidence has been brought up on his case. The album finishes with the listener not sure of whether he is sent back to prison or released, leaving it open to interpretation.

Metacritic. Retrieved 23 July 2010. The critics tended to compare this work with Plan B's previous album, Who Needs Actions When You Got Words, from four years earlier. The change from "spectacularly violent soliloquies" on his debut to crooning soul on his second effort caught some reviewers by surprise, though not all unhappily. Ian Wade of the BBC gave the album and Plan B great praise, calling it "tremendous work", admiring its range, as for example "on 'Welcome to Hell' he trills like a scared-to-pick-up-the-soap-in-the-prison-shower Smokey Robinson, while 'Hard Times' and 'Love Goes Down' are just lovely – anyone operating in the greasy world of pop would give a limb for such songs."Wade, Ian (12 April 2010).

The Guardian[tpl]'[/tpl]s Alexis Petridis gave it 3 out of 5 stars. Though dissatisfied with the its concept and "gaping holes in the album's plot", he said, "Drew's reinvention suits him. The strength of his voice was understandably overlooked on his debut, but it comes into its own here: a high, aching croon that adds an appealing touch of self-doubt to the hardest-hitting lyrics. Rather than simply drafting in Mark Ronson to add a retro-soul veneer, he's clearly studied the source material: the result is a string of uniformly well-done Smokey Robinson pastiches. In a neat touch, the bleaker Strickland Banks's story becomes, the lovelier the melodies.".Petridis, Alexis (8 April 2010). "Plan B: The Defamation of Strickland Banks". guardian.co.uk.

At The Telegraph, Thomas H Green gave it 4 out of 5 stars, calling it "accessible, polished and brimming with verve". He closed his review saying, "The rapping hasn't been completely abandoned, either, but the emphasis here is on his sweet soul voice and a thumping Motown groove, an intriguing change of direction that's both passionate and populist."Green, Thomas H.
