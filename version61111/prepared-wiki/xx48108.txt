[[Proopiomelanocortin]]

CATEGORIES: Neuropeptides, Neuroendocrinology

Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is a precursor polypeptide with 241 amino acid residues. POMC is synthesized from the 285-amino-acid-long polypeptide precursor pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC), by the removal of a 44-amino-acid-long signal peptide sequence during  translation.

==Function==

POMC is cleaved to give rise to multiple peptide hormones. Each of these peptides is packaged in large dense-core vesicles that are released from the cells by exocytosis in response to appropriate stimulation:

==Synthesis==

The POMC gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3. The POMC gene is expressed in both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene encodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like enzymes known as prohormone convertases. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, where four cleavage sites are used; adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), essential for normal steroidogenesis and the maintenance of normal adrenal weight, and β-lipotropin are the major end-products. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the polypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg, or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides include prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), carboxypeptidase E (CPE), peptidyl α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), N-acetyltransferase (N-AT), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP).
The processing of POMC involves glycosylations, acetylations, and extensive proteolytic cleavage at sites shown to contain regions of basic protein sequences. However, the proteases that recognize these cleavage sites are tissue-specific. In some tissues, including the hypothalamus, placenta, and epithelium, all cleavage sites may be used, giving rise to peptides with roles in pain and energy homeostasis, melanocyte stimulation, and immune modulation. These include several distinct melanotropins, lipotropins, and endorphins that are contained within the adrenocorticotrophin and β-lipotropin peptides.
It is synthesized by:

==Derivatives==

The large molecule of POMC is the source of several important biologically active substances. POMC can be cleaved enzymatically into the following peptides:
Although the N-terminal 5 amino acids of β-endorphin are identical to the sequence of  Metenkephalin, it is not generally thought that β-endorphin is converted into Metenkephalin.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2013[/tpl] Instead, Metenkephalin is produced from its own precursor, proenkephalin A.
The production of β-MSH occurs in humans but not in mice or rats due to the absence of the enzymatic processing site in the rodent POMC.

==Clinical significance==

Mutations in this gene have been associated with early onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation.  Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been described.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: POMC proopiomelanocortin (adrenocorticotropin/ beta-lipotropin/ alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone/ beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone/ beta-endorphin)| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5443| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Kuehnen P, Mischke M, Wiegand S, Sers C, Horsthemke B, Lau S, Keil T, Lee YA, Grueters A, Krude H | title = An Alu element-associated hypermethylation variant of the POMC gene is associated with childhood obesity | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = e1002543 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22438814 | pmc = 3305357 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002543 | editor1-last = Yeo | editor1-first = Giles S.
