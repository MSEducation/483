==History==

The Alaska State Defense Force is the successor of the Alaska Territorial Guard founded during World War II. After the war ended and Alaska became a state in 1959, the Territorial Guard was disbanded but was replaced by a state militia established by state statute. In 1984, the Alaska State Guard was formed; it was renamed in 1987 as the Alaska State Defense Force. In 2004, the name 49th Military Police Brigade (49th MP BDE) was also adopted for it. A later realignment of the command's structure has utilized the new designation of 49th Readiness Brigade (Separate), but the unit is still mainly known as the Alaska State Defense Force.  
The ASDF structure was primarily composed of military police units. The units operated with mostly state certified constables under the Alaska Police Standards Council. By statute, the Alaska State Defense Force must be made up of no less than 75 percent former military personnel.
Following the September 11 attacks, the ASDF was tasked with guarding critical oil infrastructure against attack.[tpl]cite web |url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/articles/03winter/tulak.pdf |title=State Defense Forces and Homeland Security |last1=Tulak |first1=Arthur N. |last2=Kraft |first2=Robert W. |last3=Silbaugh |first3=Don |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=25 December 2013[/tpl]
