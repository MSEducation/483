Colin McMillan (born 12 February 1966) is an English retired professional boxer. In a professional career spanning from 1988 to 1997, McMillan fought his way to the British Featherweight title in 1991 with a win over Gary De Roux. After successfully defending his British title, he added the Commonwealth title in 1992 before beating Maurizio Stecca for the WBO Featherweight belt that same year. Known in fighting circles as Sweet C, McMillan lost his WBO belt on his first defence, when he was unable to continue against Rubén Darío Palacios due to a dislocated shoulder.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-interview-colin-mcmillan-sweet-c-turns-deal-maker-1122464.html | title=The interview Colin McMillan: Sweet C turns deal maker|author=Hubbard, Alan | work=The Independent | date=26 September 1999 | accessdate=24 February 2012[/tpl]
