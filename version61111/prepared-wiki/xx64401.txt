Two Years Before the Mast is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana, Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946.

==Background==

While an undergraduate at Harvard College, Dana had an attack of the measles which affected his vision.  Thinking it might help his sight, Dana left Harvard to enlist as a common sailor on a voyage around Cape Horn on the brig Pilgrim.  He returned to Massachusetts two years later aboard the Alert (which left California sooner than the Pilgrim).
He kept a diary throughout the voyage, and, after returning, he wrote a recognized American classic, Two Years Before the Mast, published in 1840.

==A sailor's story==

The term "before the mast" refers to the quarters of the common sailors — in the forecastle, in the front of the ship. His writing evidences his later sympathy with the lower classes; he later became a prominent anti-slavery activist and helped found the Free Soil Party.
Dana did not set out to write Two Years Before the Mast as a sea adventure, but to highlight how poorly common sailors were treated on ships. It quickly became a best seller.

==The journey==

===Outbound===

In the book, which takes place between 1834 and 1836, Dana gives a vivid account of "the life of a common sailor at sea as it really is". He sails from Boston to South America and around Cape Horn to California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://brophyworld.com/election-boycotts-in-chile-and-the-brigantine-pilgrim/ |title=Election Boycotts in Chile and the Brigantine Pilgrim |publisher=Brophy World |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] Dana's ship was on a voyage to trade goods from the United States for the Mexican colonial Californian California missions' and ranchos' cow hides. They traded at the ports in San Diego Bay, San Pedro Bay, Santa Barbara Channel, Monterey Bay, and San Francisco Bay.

===California===

Dana arrived in Alta California when it was a remote province of independent Mexico, and no longer Spanish colonial Las Californias.  He gives descriptions of landing at each of the ports up and down the California coast as they existed then. The ports served (south to north) the Mission San Diego de Alcalá, Mission San Juan Capistrano, Pueblo de Los Angeles (and Mission San Gabriel Arcángel), Mission Santa Barbara (and Presidio of Santa Barbara), Presidio of Monterey, and Presidio of San Francisco with their very small settlements and surrounding large Mexican land grant Ranchos. He also describes the coastal Indigenous peoples, the Mexican Californios'  culture, and the immigrants and traders influences from other locales.
The headland bluffs near Mission San Juan Capistrano presented an obstacle to taking the cow hides to the beach for subsequent loading onto the ship. So Dana, along with others of the Pilgrim's crew, tossed the hides from the bluffs, while spinning them like a frisbee. Some hides got stuck part way down the cliff and Dana was lowered with ropes to retrieve them. The  headlands, along with the adjacent present day city, took on Dana's name as Dana Point.
Being an intelligent and educated person, he learned Spanish from the Californian Mexicans and became an interpreter for his ship.  He befriended Kanakan (native people of the Sandwich Islands—Hawaiian Islands) sailors in the ports, one of whose life Dana would save when his captain would as soon see him die.  He spent a season on the San Diego shore preparing hides for shipment to Boston, and his journey home. Dana also makes a tellingly accurate prediction of San Francisco's future growth and significance.

===Homebound===

Of the return trip around Cape Horn, on his new ship the Alert, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, Dana gives the classic account. He describes terrifying storms and incredible beauty, giving vivid descriptions of icebergs, which he calls incomparable.  The most incredible part perhaps is the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and storms—all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails.  At one point he has an infected tooth, and his face swells up so that he is unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands.  After the Horn has been rounded he describes the scurvy that afflicts members of the crew.  In White-Jacket, Herman Melville wrote, "But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana's unmatchable Two Years Before the Mast. But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle."[tpl]citation|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=44863&pageno=73 |last=Melville|first=Herman|title=White Jacket; Or, The World on a Man-of-War|publisher=Project Gutenberg|origyear=1850|year=2004|page=73|accessdate=2014-02-09[/tpl]

===Afterwards===

In 1869, Dana published a new edition which removed some content from the original and added an appendix entitled "Twenty-Four Years After".  This appendix recounts his visit to California in 1859, after the Gold Rush, by which time the state had been totally transformed. During this trip, he revisited some of the sites mentioned in the book as well as seeing old friends, including some that had been mentioned in the book, and others he did not like, such as the company agent he had worked with, Alfred Robinson, who by this time was himself an author of a book on California. Dana expressed gratitude to Robinson for being polite to him, despite Dana not being kind to him in his book. He visited the Fremont mining operations in Mariposa County. Along with Jessie Fremont and her party, he went to Yosemite Valley. Stopping along the way at Clark's Station in Wawona, he described Galen Clark as a gracious host.
A final note records the fate of his ship, the Alert.  In 1862 during the Civil War, it was captured by the Confederate commerce raider Alabama, the crew were forced into the boats, and the ship was destroyed.

==Publication history==

Dana's father first approached Harper and Brothers, as they were his publishers, though the Danas rejected the original offer for 10 percent in royalties after the first 1,000 sold.Madison, Charles A. Irving to Irving: Author-Publisher Rleations 1800–1974. New York: R. R. Bowker Company, 1974: 26. ISBN 0-8352-0772-2. The manuscript, originally titled Journal, was rejected by four publishing houses after that offer from Harpers in 1839. Two Years Before the Mast was finally published in September 1840 in two versions,Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 254. ISBN 0-86576-008-X without credit to  Dana on the title page.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/FrameBase?content=/en/imagegallery/imagegallery.shtml?images=http://pictures.abebooks.com/EVELEIGHBOOKS/4313177732.jpg |title=Abebooks |publisher=Abebooks |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl]  Dana had asked for assistance from the poet William Cullen Bryant, whose poem "Thanatopsis" was praised by Dana's father. Bryant again brought the manuscript to Harper's, hoping they would pay $500 to its author, though they ultimately paid Dana only $250 along with 24 complimentary copies.Sullivan, Wilson. New England Men of Letters. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1972: 106–107. ISBN 0-02-788680-8 Though the book sold 10,000 copies during its first year, Dana did not receive any royalties from sales of this edition of the book.
In 1911, Dana's son, Richard Henry Dana III, added an introduction detailing the "subsequent story and fate of the vessels, and of some of the persons with whom the reader is made acquainted."

==Two Years Before the Mast as literature==

Two Years Before the Mast was "conceived as a protest and written to improve the lot of the common sailor".Morris, Wright. 1964. Afterword in Two Years Before the Mast. Signet Classic, Penguin Books, Ltd. Middlesex, England. p. 382 The literary style provides a concrete description of a seaman’s life to serve as a practical guide, and not as an adventure novel.Morris, 1964, p. 377 His unpolished, laconic style achieved a literary quality, however, that influenced novelist Herman Melville, according to American essayist Wright Morris.Morris, 1964, p. 377, p. 381 
In the following excerpt from Dana’s diary, the entry expresses not only chronological information, but how a seaman “apprehends time”.Morris, 1964, p. 379

This next passage, describing Dana's first sighting of an iceberg off Cape Horn, “reminds us of Melville” and “other passages seem to anticipate him”. (Melville, born in 1819, was exactly four years Dana’s junior, and returned from his first tour as a seaman when Two Years Before the Mast was first published in 1840).:Morris, 1964, p. 376
The following description of the English sailor, Bill Jackson, has literary similarities to Melville’s Billy Budd Morris, 1964, p. 382
Writes Morris, "Dana is something more of a poet than either he or his contemporaries were aware; and that his ignorance of this gift was a loss to him as well as to us." Morris, 1964, p. 380

==Legacy==

With the onset of the 1849 California Gold Rush, Dana's book was one of the few books in existence that described California, adding greatly to the book's readership as well as Dana's renown and legacy.  When he returned to San Francisco in 1859 he was treated as a minor celebrity. To this day the book is regarded as a valuable historical resource describing 1830s California.
The geographic headland he wrote of, and the adjacent city, are named Dana Point for him.
There are schools named for him in Southern California, including:
A film adaptation was released in 1946.
