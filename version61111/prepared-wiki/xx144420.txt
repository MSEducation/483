Camp Roger is a Christian youth camp located in Belding, Michigan. It was founded in 1913 as a boys choir camp for Saint Mark's Episcopal church in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Originally it was named Camp Anderson after the wealthy donor, William Anderson, purchased the land. In 1911 his son Roger died of tuberculosis and the camp's name was changed in memory of his son. St. Mark's Church operated Camp Roger for many years until the Great Depression, when interest and funding for the camp diminished.
In 1940 a group of Christian Reformed people organized the Christian Youth Camp Association, a non-profit corporation whose purpose was to minister to boys and girls through a Christian summer camp experience. They were able to purchase Camp Roger in 1941 from St. Mark's Church for $9,000. The first summer camp program was offered in 1941, staffed largely by parents and volunteers. The officers of the first board of directors were: Rev. George Goris, President; Mr. Richard "Uncle Dick" Postma, Vice President; Mr. Jelle Hekman, Treasurer; Dr. Anthony Hoekema, Secretary; and Mr. E.R. Post, Camp Director.
Since 1941, generations of men and women have participated in the ministry of Camp Roger as campers, parents, staff, and board members. The Camp Directors are Mr. E.R. Post (1941–49), Mr. John Beukema (1950–52), Mr. Phil Lucasse (1953–58), Mr. Harvey Ribbens (1959–62), Mr. Orin Gelderloos (1963–66), Mr. K. Patrick Rode (1967), Mr. Ronald Zoet (1968), Mr. Robert Heetderks (1969–90), Mr. Jim "Winger" Van Wingerden (1991–2002), and Mr. Doug Vanderwell (2002–present).
Camp Roger's mission is to reveal and celebrate God's love for God's children through experiences in God's world. Camp Roger's program includes a weekly overnight summer camp experience for young people. Camp Roger's year-round program is also very active, serving about 10,000 participants in the fall, winter, and spring.
