Brasstown Bald is the highest natural point in the state of Georgia, USA, with a summit elevation of 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above mean sea level.
The mountain is known to the native Cherokee people as Enotah.  It is named for the former Cherokee village of Brasstown, Georgia, located along the upper Brasstown Creek.  Across the North Carolina state line, immediately to its north, is Brasstown, North Carolina, in the Brasstown township of Clay County, North Carolina.
Brasstown Bald is partly in Towns and partly in Union counties, the peak being divided by the county line.  The mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains (part of the Appalachian Mountains), and within the borders of the Blue Ridge Ranger District of the Chattahoochee National Forest.  The mountain is mostly made up of soapstone and dunite.
On a clear day, it is possible to see the tall buildings of Atlanta from the summit. The U.S. Forest Service has webcams atop the observation tower, and a RAWS weather station further down the mountain.  The public can drive to the top via Georgia state route 180 Spur.

==History==

thumb|left|250px|Brasstown Bald Historical Marker #2 According to the two Georgia historical markers, the area surrounding Brasstown Bald was settled by the Cherokee people.  White settlers derived the word Brasstown from a translation error of a Cherokee word.  Sounding very similar to another Cherokee word, settlers confused the word "Itse'yĭ" (New Green Place or Place of Fresh Green) with "Ûňtsaiyĭ" (Brass).  Itse'yĭ, New Green Place, is a Cherokee locative name given to several distinct areas in the Cherokee world, including an area to the North of Brasstown Bald in North Georgia.
Cherokee legend tells of a great flood that swept over the land.  Everyone that inhabited the land died except a few Cherokee families that sought refuge in a giant canoe.  The canoe ran aground at the summit of the mountain.  Having no wild game to hunt and no place to plant vegetation, the Great Spirit killed all of the trees on the top of the mountain so the surviving people could plant their crops.  They continued planting until the water subsided.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
While the Cherokee legend tells of a treeless mountain top, the term "bald" is common mountain terminology describing mountaintops that have 360-degree unobstructed views.  The official name that includes the word Bald in this case was not intended to suggest a once-treeless mountaintop, the way the term is used for most other. The reason for the lack of trees, according to the Cherokee, was the legend of Owen, a brave who defeated the evil warrior Tibbits, who was working for the witchdoctor Rachel.

Other names given to Brasstown Bald by the Cherokee:  Echia, Echoee, Etchowee & Enotah.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

==Broadcasting==

NOAA Weather Radio station KXI22 transmits from atop the mountain, simulcasting with KXI75 from Blue Ridge, Georgia.  The programming originates from NWSFO Peachtree City.
Georgia Public Broadcasting had or has construction permits from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for two low-power broadcast translator stations at the summit.  The digital TV station on channel 12 (W12DK-D, licensed December 2009) is the direct replacement for analog TV station W04BJ in nearby Young Harris, and also covers for W50AB in nearby Hiawassee (both to the north).  New station WBTB FM 90.3 will transmit at just 97 watts, equivalent to several hundred watts because of the height above average terrain of over 700 meters, or more than 2300 feet.  Both stations will have Young Harris as the city of license.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
