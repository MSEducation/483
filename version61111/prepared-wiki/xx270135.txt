CATEGORIES: Slovene dialects

The Rižana subdialect (rižanski govor)Smole, Vera. 1998. "Slovenska narečja." Enciklopedija Slovenije vol. 12, pp. 1–5. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 2. is a Slovene subdialect of the Istrian dialect in the Littoral dialect group. It is spoken in Italy in most of the municipalities of San Dorligo della Valle and Muggia ([tpl]lang|sl|Milje[/tpl]) south of Trieste, as well as in some southern suburbs of Trieste (especially Servola); in Slovenia, it is spoken in the northern part of the Slovenian Istria, in the Rižana Valley east and north of Koper, including the settlements of Bertoki, Dekani, Osp, Črni Kal, Presnica, Podgorje, and Zazid.Toporišič, Jože. 1992.

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==

Like the Šavrini Hills subdialect, the Rižana subdialect is based on characteristics of the Lower Carniolan and Littoral dialect groups. Accented vowels do not have a length contrast. Secondary palatalization of the velars k g h has arisen before front vowels.Logar, Tine. 1996. Dialektološke in jezikovnozgodovinske razprave. Ljubljana: SAZU, p. 8. Verbal conjugation lacks the dual. The two subdialects share many lexical features, with many loanwords from Romance languages.
