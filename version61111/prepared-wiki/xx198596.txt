[[June Revolution]]

CATEGORIES: History of Albania, 20th-century rebellions, 20th-century revolutions

Albania in June 1924, Noli's supporters blamed the Rustemi murder on Zogu's Mati clansmen, who continued to practice blood vengeance. After the walkout, discontent mounted, and in June 1924 a peasant-backed insurgency had won control of Tirana. Noli became prime minister, and Zogu fled to Yugoslavia.

==Zogu Government (1922-1924)==

Interwar Albanian governments appeared and disappeared in rapid succession. Between July and December 1921 alone, the premiership changed hands five times.
The Popular Party's head, Xhafer Ypi, formed a government in December 1921 with Fan S. Noli as foreign minister and Ahmed Bey Zogu as internal affairs minister, but Noli resigned soon after Zogu resorted to repression in an attempt to disarm the lowland Albanians despite the fact that bearing arms was a traditional custom.
When the government's enemies attacked Tirana in early 1922, Zogu stayed in the capital and, with the support of the British ambassador, repulsed the assault. He took over the premiership later in the year and turned his back on the Popular Party by announcing his engagement to the daughter of the Progressive Party leader, Shefqet Verlaci.
Zogu's protégés organized themselves into the Government Party. Noli and other Western-oriented leaders formed the Opposition Party of Democrats, which attracted all of Zogu's many personal enemies, ideological opponents, and people left unrewarded by his political machine. Ideologically, the Democrats included a broad sweep of people who advocated everything from conservative Islam to Noli's dreams of rapid modernization.
Opposition to Zogu was formidable [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]. Orthodox peasants in Albania's southern lowlands loathed Zogu[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] because he supported the Muslim landowners' efforts to block land reform; Shkodër's citizens felt shortchanged because their city did not become Albania's capital, and nationalists were dissatisfied because Zogu's government did not press Albania's claims to Kosovo or speak up more energetically for the rights of the ethnic Albanian minorities in present-day Yugoslavia and Greece.
Zogu's party handily won elections for a National Assembly in early 1924[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]. Zogu soon stepped aside, however, handing over the premiership to Verlaci in the wake of a financial scandal[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] and an assassination attempt by a young radical that left Zogu wounded. The opposition withdrew from the assembly after the leader of a radical youth organization, Avni Rustemi, was murdered in the street outside the parliament building.[tpl]cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical dictionary of Albania|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6inIiCF_930C&pg=PA105|accessdate=13 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|pages=105–106[/tpl]

==Noli Revolution (1924)==

Noli's supporters blamed the Rustemi murder on Zogu's Mati clansmen, who continued to practice blood vengeance. After the walkout, discontent mounted, and in June 1924 a peasant-backed insurgency had won control of Tirana. Noli became prime minister, and Zogu fled to Yugoslavia.
Fan Noli, an idealist, rejected demands for new elections on the grounds that Albania needed a "paternal" government. In a manifesto describing his government's program, Noli called for abolishing feudalism, resisting Italian domination, and establishing a Western-style constitutional government. Scaling back the bureaucracy, strengthening local government, assisting peasants, throwing Albania open to foreign investment, and improving the country's bleak transportation, public health, and education facilities filled out the Noli government's overly ambitious agenda. Noli encountered resistance to his program from people who had helped him oust Zogu, and he never attracted the foreign aid necessary to carry out his reform plans. Noli criticized the League of Nations for failing to settle the threat facing Albania on its land borders.
Under Fan Noli, the government set up a special tribunal that passed death sentences, in absentia, on Zogu, Verlaci, and others and confiscated their property. In Yugoslavia Zogu recruited a mercenary army, and Belgrade furnished the Albanian leader with weapons, about 1,000 Yugoslav army regulars, and Russian White Emigres to mount an invasion that the Serbs hoped would bring them disputed areas along the border. After Noli's regime decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, a bitter enemy of the Serbian ruling family, Belgrade began making wild allegations that the Albanian regime was about to embrace Bolshevism. On December 13, 1924, Zogu's Yugoslav-backed army crossed into Albanian territory. From the other side, Myfid Libohova with the support of the Greek government launched an offensive and entered Kakavija.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mwi137osWhMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Founding+a+Balkan+State:+Albania%27s+Experiment+with+Democracy,+1920-1925&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LQcBU_SDCuXm0wGGjYGIAQ&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=greece&f=false| page=147|author=Robert Clegg Austin| title=Founding a Balkan State: Albania's Experiment with Democracy, 1920-1925| year=2012| publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division| isbn=978-1442644359| quote=Myfid Libohova launched an offensive from Greece toward the frontier of Kakavia[/tpl] By Christmas Eve, Zogu had reclaimed the capital, and Noli and his government had fled to Italy.
But his government lasted just 6 months, and Ahmet Zogu returned with another coup d'état and regained the control, changing the political situation and abolishing principality.

==After the revolution==

In late 1924 Ahmed Bey Zogu,  regained power from an internal political power struggle against Prime Minister Fan Noli using Yugoslav military assistance.
After defeating Fan Noli`s government, Ahmet Zogu recalled the parliament, in order to find a solution for the uncrowned principality of Albania. The parliament quickly adopted a new constitution, proclaimed Albania a republic, and granted Zogu dictatorial powers that allowed him to appoint and dismiss ministers, veto legislation, and name all major administrative personnel and a third of the Senate.
The Constitution provided for a parliamentary republic with a powerful president serving as head of state and government. Ahmet Zogu was elected president for a term of seven years by the National Assembly, prior to his proclamation King of Albanians.
On January 31, Zogu was elected president for a seven-year term. Opposition parties and civil liberties disappeared; opponents of the regime were murdered; and the press suffered strict censorship. Zogu ruled Albania using four military governors responsible to him alone. He appointed clan chieftains as reserve army officers who were kept on call to protect the regime against domestic or foreign threats.
