The Hungary national rugby union team represents Hungary at rugby union. They are governed by the Magyar Rögbi Szövetség (MRgSz), and have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup, although they have entered qualifiers for all the tournaments from the 1995 edition onwards. They compete annually in the European Nations Cup, currently in Division 2C.
As of 27 December 2010, they were ranked 74th in the world, but were one of 57 teams who moved up a place in the rankings following the disbandment of the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union.Fifty-seven nations on rise in rankings

==History==

They played their first official match against East Germany in Érd in 1990, losing 3–7, but they played a number of unofficial matches prior to this, mainly against a likewise unofficial Austrian team, including a match in Győr on 1 May 1983.Team photo vs Austria in 1983 Included in the photo are current MRgSz Honorary President Lajos Vida-Szűcs and current national team manager and president of Esztergomi Vitézek András Neuzer. 
They first entered the qualifiers for the 1995 World Cup back in 1993, being at the wrong end of a 8–67 scoreline against Israel.
Things went better in the 1999 qualifying rounds, where they beat Lithuania and Luxembourg, but lost to Andorra and Sweden.
In the 2003 qualifiers, they won against Andorra and Bulgaria, but lost to Bosnia, Yugoslavia (as Serbia was then still known), and Switzerland.
The next time (2007) was their worst performance to date, losing all four matches played, including a 9–63 thumping by Spain.

==Strip==

The badge on the shirt derives from the Csodaszarvas, a mythological stag that led the ancient Hungarian people to the Pannonian Basin.
In the Austria match of 1983, they played in presumably white jerseys with either a black or dark green hoop, black shorts, and either black or dark green socks with white tops. After the MRgSz was established, the team reverted to the flag colors of red, white, and green, with the current strip consisting of red shirts and shorts and green socks.

==Grounds==

Hungary play at various football stadiums, since there are currently no rugby-specific venues in the country. Venues that have been used include the Széktói Stadion, Kecskemét and Dunaferr Arena, Dunaújváros.
