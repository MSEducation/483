Cartoon from Punch magazine Vol. 152, June 27, 1917, noting the UK Royal Family's change of name to Windsor]]
The Mountbatten surname derives from the German town of  Battenberg, in Hesse. Prince Louis of Battenberg changed his surname to Mountbatten (its literal English translation) during the First World War at the request of King George V. When then-Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg (the royal house of Denmark and Norway and the deposed royal house of Greece) took British citizenship, he used this surname since he descends from the Battenberg family through his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg.
The name Windsor was adopted by the British branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1917.

==Users of the surname==

The following people make use of, in current practice, or have made use of, the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.[tpl]citation needed|reason=most likely a different cite is needed for each person below|date=September 2012[/tpl] They are listed in the order of succession to the Crown.
None of the above actually officially hold the surname as part of their legal name, owing to the styles that are used for members of the Royal Family, and to the ambiguous wording[tpl]clarify|how is the wording ambiguous?|date=September 2012[/tpl] of the proclamation. For example, when the Duke of York was in the Navy, he was referred to as Lieutenant His Royal Highness, The Prince Andrew before he became The Duke of York, and Lieutenant His Royal Highness, The Duke of York afterwards - but not Lieutenant Mountbatten-Windsor. While Mountbatten-Windsor was entered into the marriage register for Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, the Prince of Wales was entered as simply "The Prince Charles Philip Arthur George".
It has been reported in the American press that as a practical day-to-day matter in their active Royal Navy service, both Charles and Andrew were referred to as "Lieutenant Windsor".
Both Princes William and Harry have used "Wales" as a last name during their schooling.  Both were known as Officer Cadet Wales at the Sandhurst Military Academy. They wrote the name "Wales" on their socks and underwear for laundering. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie of York both similarly use "York" as a last name.
The Earl of Wessex has styled himself "Edward Wessex" for his television series Crown and Country since acquiring that title upon his marriage.  Prior thereto, the show's credits listed him as "Edward Windsor."
All the above persons, as holders of Royal styles and titles (see above), use Mountbatten-Windsor unofficially.  Seemingly, the only people who would officially hold the hyphenated surname under the Order in Council would be any male-line great-grandchildren of the Queen in cadet branches; i.e., the children of any sons of the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex (currently only Lord Severn). Similarly, in the event that any male-line granddaughter of the Queen were to have a child whilst unwed, such a child might have the surname of Mountbatten-Windsor.
During the court case over the 2012 topless photos scandal, William was referred to as "Monsieur William Arthur Philip Louis Mountbatten-Windsor" by the courts of the French Republic.[tpl]cite news|last=Gripper|first=Ann|title=Kate Middleton Closer topless pictures - reaction as royals start court fight|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/live-kate-middleton-closer-topless-1329383|accessdate=2012-09-21|newspaper=Mirror|date=2012-09-18[/tpl]
