The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) was formed in September 1972 by Donald Dell, Jack Kramer, and Cliff Drysdale to protect the interests of male professional tennis players. Drysdale became the first President. Since 1990, the association has organized the worldwide tennis tour for men and linked the title of the tour with the organization's name. In 1990 the organization was called the ATP Tour, which was renamed in 2001 as just ATP and the tour being called ATP Tour. In 2009 the name was changed again and is now known as the ATP World Tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/columns/story?columnist=kamakshi_tandon&id=3686016|title=Posing 10 ATP questions for 2009[/tpl] It is an evolution of the tour competitions previously known as Grand Prix tennis tournaments and World Championship Tennis (WCT). The ATP's Executive Offices are in London, United Kingdom. ATP Americas is based in Ponte Vedra Beach, United States; ATP Europe is headquartered in Monaco; and ATP International, which covers Africa, Asia and Australasia, is based in Sydney, Australia.
The counterpart organization in the women's professional game is the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).

==History==

Started in 1972 by Jack Kramer, Donald Dell, and Cliff Drysdale, it was first managed by Jack Kramer, as Executive Director, and Cliff Drysdale, as President.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Corporate/History.aspx |title=How it all began |publisher=ATP | accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl]  Jack Kramer created the professional players' rankings system, which started the following year and continues to this day. From 1974 to 1989, the men's circuit was administered by a sub-committee called the Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC).  It was made up of representatives of  the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the ATP, and tournament directors from around the world.
The ATP requested and got the MIPTC to introduce a drug testing rule, making tennis the first professional sport to institute a drug-testing program.
But the tour was still run by the tournament directors and the ITF. The lack of player representation and influence within the MIPTC as well as dissatisfaction with the way the sport was managed and marketed culminated in a player mutiny in 1988 that changed the entire structure of the tour. CEO Hamilton Jordan is credited with the Parking Lot Press Conference on 30 August 1988 during which the ATP announced their withdrawal from the MIPTC (then called the MTC) and the creation of their own ATP Tour from 1990 onwards.[tpl]cite web|title=The Tour Born in a Parking Lot - Part I|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2013/08/35/Heritage-1988-Parking-Lot-Press-Conference-Part-I.aspx|publisher=ATP|author=James Buddell|date=August 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-dwyre27 |title=Hamliton Jordan made Tennis better |publisher=LA Times |date=2008-05-28 | accessdate=2009-06-07 | first=Bill | last=Dwyre[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.inside-tennis.net/tennis-stories_10_The-Formation-of-the-Womans-Tennis-Association.html |title=The Formation of the Woman's Tennis Association |publisher=Inside Tennis |author=Frank Riley |date=2004-03-22 | accessdate=2009-06-07[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  This re-organisation also ended a lawsuit with Volvo and Donald Dell.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/839/839.F2d.69.87-7784.87-7778.87-7776.html |title=Volvo v.

By 1991, the men had their first television package to broadcast 19 tournaments to the world.  Coming on-line with their first website in 1995, was quickly followed by a multi-year agreement with Mercedes-Benz.
Lawsuits in 2008, around virtually the same issues, resulted in a restructured tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/features/general/features.aspx?id=140358 |title=Court in Session: Hamburg, ATP go to trial |date=2008-07-23 |publisher=Tennis.com[/tpl]

==ATP World Tour==

The ATP World Tour comprises ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP World Tour 500 series, ATP World Tour 250 series and ATP Challenger Tour. The ATP tour also oversees the ATP Champions Tour for seniors. Grand Slams (as well as the Olympic Tennis Tournament) do not fall under the auspices of the ATP. In these events, however, ranking points are awarded.
Players and doubles teams with most ranking points (collected during the calendar year) play in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals, which, from 2000-2008, was run jointly with the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The week-long introductory level Futures tournaments are ITF events and they count towards ATP Entry Ranking. The four-week ITF Satellite tournaments were discontinued in 2007. Grand Slam tournaments are overseen by the ITF and they count towards the players' ATP rankings. The details of the professional tennis tour are:

==2009 changes==

In 2009 ATP introduced a new tour structure called ATP World Tour consisting of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP World Tour 500, and ATP World Tour 250 tier tournaments.[tpl]cite web|title=ATP Unveils New Top Tier Of Events for 2009|url=http://www.tenniswire.org/archives/2007/aug/pr_923.html|publisher=Tenniswire.com|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=31 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=ATP Unveils 2009, 2010 & 2011 Tour Calenders|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2008/08/calendars.aspx|publisher=ATP|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=30 August 2008[/tpl] Broadly speaking the Tennis Masters Series tournaments became the new Masters 1000 level and ATP International Series Gold and ATP International Series events became ATP 500 level and 250 level events respectively.
The Masters 1000 tournaments are Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Madrid, Toronto/Montreal, Cincinnati, Shanghai and Paris. The end-of-year event, the World Tour Finals, moved from Shanghai to London. Hamburg has been displaced by the new clay court event at Madrid, which is a new combined men's and women's tournament. From 2011, Rome and Cincinnati will also be combined tournaments. Severe sanctions will be placed on top players skipping the Masters 1000 series events, unless medical proof is presented. Plans to eliminate Monte Carlo and Hamburg as Masters Series events led to controversy and protests from players as well as organisers. Hamburg and Monte Carlo filed lawsuits against the ATP,[tpl]cite web|title=ATP Violates Antitrust Laws, Lawsuit Alleges|url=http://montecarlo.masters-series.com/3/en/news/2007/lawsuit.asp|date=9 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|url=http://montecarlo.masters-series.com/3/en/news/2007/lawsuit.asp|date=September 2011[/tpl] and as a concession it was decided that Monte Carlo remains a Masters 1000 level event, with more prize money and 1000 ranking points, but it would no longer be a compulsory tournament for top-ranked players. Monte Carlo later dropped its suit. Hamburg was "reserved" to become a 500 level event in the summer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3048762|title=Hamburg listed among second-tier events for 2009 season[/tpl] Hamburg did not accept this concession, but later lost its suit.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7515523.stm | work=BBC News | title=ATP wins crucial anti-trust case | date=2008-08-06 | accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
The 500 level includes tournaments at Rotterdam, Dubai, Acapulco, Memphis, Barcelona, Hamburg, Washington, Beijing, Tokyo, Basel and Valencia.
The ATP & ITF have declared that 2009 Davis Cup World Group and World Group Playoffs  award a total of up to 500 points. Players accumulate points over the 4 rounds and the playoffs and these are counted as one of a player's four best results from the 500 level events. An additional 125 points are given to a player who wins all 8 live rubbers and wins the Davis Cup.

==Rankings==

ATP publishes weekly rankings of professional players: Emirates ATP Rankings (commonly known as the ‘world rankings’), a 52-week rolling ranking, and the Emirates ATP Rankings  Race to London, a year to date ranking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-FAQ.aspx|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=ATP World Tour[/tpl]
The Emirates ATP Rankings is used for determining qualification for entry and seeding in all tournaments for both singles and doubles. Within the Emirates ATP Rankings period consisting of the past 52 weeks, points are accumulated, with the exception of those for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, whose points are dropped following the last ATP event of the year. The player with the most points by season's end is the World Number 1 of the year.
The Emirates ATP Rankings Race To London is a calendar-year indicator of what the Emirates ATP Rankings will be on the Monday after the end of the regular season. Players finishing in the Top 8 of the Emirates ATP Rankings following the BNP Paribas Masters will qualify for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.
At the start of the 2009 season, all accumulated ranking points have been doubled to bring them in line with the new tournament ranking system.
