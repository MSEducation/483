Alan Shearer OBE, DL ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɪər|ər[/tpl]; born 13 August 1970) is an English retired footballer. He played as a striker in the top level of English league football for Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United and for the England national team. He is widely regarded as one of England's best strikers, being both Newcastle's and the Premier League's record goalscorer. After retiring as a player in 2006, Shearer worked as a television pundit for the BBC. In 2009, he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United's manager in the last eight games of their 2008–09 season, in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation.
A native of Newcastle upon Tyne, Shearer made his professional debut with English top-flight club Southampton in 1988, scoring a hat-trick in the process. During several years on the south coast, he became known for his classic style of play, strength and goalscoring ability; he soon received an international call-up along with a transfer to Blackburn Rovers in 1992. Shearer established himself as a player at the Lancashire club; he became a regular in the England squad, and his 34-goal tally helped Blackburn secure the Premier League title in 1994–95. He was named Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 1994 and won the PFA Player of the Year award in 1995. The 1995–96 season saw Shearer make his first Champions League appearances and finish as the top scorer in the Premier League with 31 goals. He was also top scorer at UEFA Euro 1996 with England, scoring five goals, and in the 1996–97 Premier League, with 25 goals. In 1996, he was third in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. Shearer scored 283 league goals in his career, including a record 260 in the Premier League (of which 58 were penalties) with a record 11 Premier League hat-tricks, and a total of 422 in all competitions including international at all levels.http://www.blurtit.com/q244886.html Shearer has amassed a goals to game ratio of 0.667 throughout his career at every level.
A  world record £15 million transfer to his boyhood heroes, Newcastle United, followed the Euro '96 tournament, and Shearer spent the remainder of his career with the club. Shearer helped his team to runners-up finishes in the Premier League and FA Cup with Newcastle, and won a second PFA Player of the Year award. After being named England's captain in 1996 and Newcastle's captain in 1999, he retired from international football following UEFA Euro 2000, having amassed 63 appearances and 30 goals for his country. In 2004 he was named as one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA's 100th anniversary celebration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3533891.stm |title=Pele's list of the greatest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 March 2004 |accessdate=25 November 2013 [/tpl] As well as his media work, he has raised substantial amounts of money for various national and local charities, both within and outside of sports. Shearer is an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities.

==Early years==

Shearer was born in Gosforth, Newcastle in 1970 to working-class parents Alan and Anne Shearer. His father, a sheet-metal worker, encouraged a keen Shearer to play football in his youth, and the young player continued with the sport as he progressed through school. He was educated at Gosforth Central Middle School and Gosforth High School. Growing up playing on the streets of his hometown, he originally played in midfield because "it meant he could get more involved in the games."[tpl]cite book |title=My Illustrated Career |last=Shearer |first=Alan |year=2007 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |pages= 18–50 |isbn=1-84403-586-7[/tpl] Shearer captained his school team and helped a Newcastle City Schools team win a seven-a-side tournament at St James' Park, before joining the amateur Wallsend Boys Club as a teenager. It was while playing for the Wallsend club that he was spotted by Southampton's scout, Jack Hixon, which resulted in Shearer spending his summers training with the club's youth team, a time he would later refer to as "the making of me". Shearer had successful trials for First Division clubs West Bromwich Albion, Manchester City and Newcastle United, before being offered a youth contract with Southampton in April 1986.

==Club career==

===Southampton (1986–1992)===

Shearer was promoted to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad. He made his professional debut for Southampton on 26 March 1988, coming on as a substitute in a First Division fixture at Chelsea,[tpl]cite book | author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk | title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC  | publisher=Hagiology | year=2003|pages=199–200 | isbn=0-9534474-3-X[/tpl] before prompting national headlines in his full debut at The Dell two weeks later. He scored a hat-trick, helping the team to a 4–2 victory against Arsenal, thus becoming the youngest player – at 17 years, 240 days – to score a hat-trick in the top division, breaking Jimmy Greaves' 30-year–old record. Shearer ended the 1987–88 season with three goals in five games, and was rewarded with his first professional contract.
Despite this auspicious start to his career, Shearer was only eased into the first team gradually and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sportinglife.com/football/nationwide1/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/02/17/SOCCER_Southampton_Nightlead.html|title=Lundekvam Relishing Shearer Battle|accessdate=15 August 2008|publisher=Sporting Life[/tpl] which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for team mates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season,[tpl]cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=577 | isbn= [/tpl] and in the next, four goals in 36 games. His performances in the centre of the Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991. His partnership with fellow striker Matt Le Tissier would eventually pave the way to international success.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n13966011|title=Chance for Le Tissier to repay Venables |work=The Independent  |date=15 February 1995|accessdate=10 December 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
In the summer of 1991, Shearer was a member of the England national under-21 football squad in the Toulon Tournament in Toulon, France. Shearer was the star of the tournament where he scored seven goals in four games. It was during the 1991–92 season that Shearer rose to national prominence. 13 goals in 41 appearances for the Saints led to an England call-up;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0,,10278~5962,00.html  |title=Profile – Alan Shearer|accessdate=24 July 2008|publisher=Newcastle United F.C |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080206025703/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Profiles/0,,10278~5962,00.html |archivedate = 6 February 2008[/tpl] he scored on his debut,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/799370.stm|title=Sad Farewell for Shearer |accessdate=15 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 June 2000[/tpl] and was strongly linked in the press with a summer move to Manchester United. A possible move for Shearer was being mentioned in the media during late autumn of 1991, but he rejected talk of a transfer (Leeds United were also linked to Shearer)http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ERFZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QpADAAAAIBAJ&pg=1422,3302022&dq=alan+shearer+southampton&hl=en and vowed to see out the season with Southampton, resisting the temptation of a possible transfer to the two clubs who headed the title race for most of the season. Speculation of a transfer to Liverpool, who finished the season as FA Cup winners, also came to nothing.
During the summer of 1992, Southampton's manager, Ian Branfoot, became "the most popular manager in English football", as he took telephone calls from clubs "trying to bargain with players they don't want plus cash". Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that "whatever happens, we are in the driving seat".Quoted in [tpl]cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=224 | isbn= [/tpl] In July 1992, Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £3.6 million, with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal. Despite Branfoot's claim to be "in the driving seat", Saints failed to include a "sell-on clause" in the contract. Shearer, less than a month off his 22nd birthday, was the most expensive player in British football.[tpl]cite book | author=Holley & Chalk | title=In That Number | year=2003|page=224 | isbn= [/tpl] In his four years in the Southampton first team, Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions, scoring 43 goals.

===Blackburn Rovers (1992–1996)===

Despite making just one goalless appearance as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages that summer,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/England_AtoZ_S.htm|title=S is for Shearer|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Football Association|date=18 July 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081210194724/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/England_AtoZ_S.htm|archivedate=10 December 2008[/tpl] Shearer was soon subject to a British transfer record-breaking £3.6million bid from Blackburn Rovers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1390656.stm|title=Shearer the Geordie gem|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 June 2001[/tpl] Although there was also interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker's millions were enough to prise the striker from the Saints, and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park in the summer of 1992.[tpl]cite book|title=My Illustrated Career|last=Shearer|first=Alan|year=2007 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |pages= 56–70|isbn=978-1-84403-586-1[/tpl]
His first season with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after snapping his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss some games due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.
Returning to fitness for the 1993–94 season, he scored 31 goals from 40 games as Blackburn finished runners-up in the Premier League. His performances for the club led to him being named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for that season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.footballwriters.co.uk/awards/footballer-of-the-year/|title=FWA FOOTBALLER OF THE YEAR AWARD|accessdate=25 July 2008|publisher=Football Writers' Association[/tpl] On the international scene, England had failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632224.stm|title=USA 1994|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2002[/tpl] but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date.
The arrival of Chris Sutton for the 1994–95 season established a strong attacking partnership at Blackburn. Shearer's league-record 34 goals,[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070921/ai_n20524754|title=today's top 20: most Premier League goals in a season (1992–2007)|accessdate=26 July 2008|work=The Independent |date=21 September 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0,,12306,00.html|title=A History of the Premier League|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=Premier League[/tpl] coupled with Sutton's 15, helped the Lancashire club take the Premier League title from holders Manchester United on the final day of the season,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/1994/95Season/0,,12306~1076334,00.html|title=1994/95|accessdate=2 August 2008|publisher=Premier League[/tpl] and the duo gained the nickname "the SAS" (Shearer And Sutton). After being asked by the press how he planned to celebrate winning the title, Shearer replied, by "creosoting the fence".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/columnists/simon_barnes/article707644.ece|title=A modest end befits Shearer, the extra-ordinary man who painted a masterpiece from creosote|accessdate=10 March 2009|date=21 April 2006|work=The Times  | location=London | first=Simon | last=Barnes[/tpl] Shearer also had his first taste of European football in the UEFA Cup that season, and scored in the second leg as Blackburn went out in the first round, losing to Trelleborgs FF of Sweden.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/history/season=1994/round=651/index.html|title=UEFA Cup First round|accessdate=2 August 2008|publisher=UEFA[/tpl] His efforts for the club led to Shearer being awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year for 1995.
Although the club could not retain the title the following year, Shearer again ended the (now 38-game) season as Premier League top scorer, with 31 goals in 35 games,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/1995/96Season|title=Season 1995/96|accessdate=22 July 2008|publisher=Premier League[/tpl] as Blackburn finished seventh in the league. The previous season's first-place finish also saw the club enter the Champions League. Shearer's only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4–1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture and Blackburn finished third in their group, failing to progress to the next stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1995/round=70/group=12.html|title=UEFA Champions League Group B|accessdate=7 August 2008|publisher=UEFA[/tpl]
He passed the 100-goal milestone for Blackburn in all competitions on 23 September 1995, scoring a hat-trick in their 5–1 home win over Coventry City in the Premier League. On 30 December, he scored his 100th Premier League goal for the club in a 2–1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. His final tally for the club was 112 goals in the Premier League and 130 in all competitions. His final goals for the club came on 17 April 1996, when he scored twice in a 3–2 home league win over Wimbledon.http://www.shearer9.com/statsrovers9596.shtml
Shearer's international strike rate had also dried up, with no goals in the twelve matches leading up to Euro 96. He missed the final three games of the season for his club due to injury, but recovered in time to play in England's UEFA European Championship campaign.

===Newcastle United (1996–2006)===

After Euro 96, Manchester United again sought to sign Shearer, and entered the battle for his signature. Shearer stated he came close to signing for the club after extended talks with manager Alex Ferguson. Eventually both Manchester United and Newcastle United agreed fees with Blackburn Rovers and Shearer was all set to move to Manchester United but then at the last second Kevin Keegan requested one last audience with Shearer and persuaded him that his future lay at St. James' Park.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
On 30 July 1996, for a world transfer record-breaking £15 million Shearer joined his hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan.[ref]
 [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newcastle-online.com/nufcplayers/alanshearer.shtml|title=Alan Shearer Profile (NUFC Player Profiles)|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=Newcastle Online[/tpl] and maintained his form during the rest of the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25 goals in 31 Premier League games,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/1994/95Season|title=Season 1994/95|accessdate=22 July 2008|publisher=Premier League[/tpl] as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade, despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. Perhaps his best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~483922,00.html when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3–1 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to win them the game 4–3 by scoring a late hat-trick.http://www.footballfancast.com/2011/06/premiership/newcastle-united/the-top-ten-premier-league-games-of-all-time
However, the league title still eluded the club, who finished second in the league for a consecutive year, with Keegan resigning mid-way through the season.
Another injury problem; this time an ankle ligament injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just two goals in 17 games in the 1997–98 season. His injury was reflected in the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal.
An incident during a game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/88739.stm|title=Shearer charged with misconduct|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 1998[/tpl] with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=337283&root=extratime&cc=5739|title=10 of the worst...Fouls|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=27 July 2005[/tpl] The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/91721.stm|title=Shearer cleared in boot row|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=12 May 1998[/tpl] Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/441003.stm|title=Shearer hits out at Kelly |accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 September 1999[/tpl]
An almost injury-free season helped Shearer improve on his previous year's tally in 1998–99, the striker converting 14 goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/aug/16/newsstory.sport7|title=Shearer factor is Ruud of all evil|date=17 August 1999|accessdate=14 March 2014|work=The Guardian[/tpl] but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish just after the season got underway.
He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but they once again lost; this time 2–0 to treble-chasing Manchester United.
On the opening day of the 1999–2000 season, Shearer received the first red card of his career in his 100th appearance for Newcastle.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/aug/07/match.sport8|title=Shearer sent off in 100th match|date=8 August 1999|work=14 March 2014|work=The Guardian[/tpl] After dropping Shearer to the bench in a Tyne-Wear derby loss against Sunderland,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united/10405971/Newcastle-Uniteds-Ruud-Gullit-axed-Alan-Shearer-before-Sunderland-defeat-and-paid-with-his-job.html|title=Newcastle United's Ruud Gullit axed Alan Shearer before Sunderland defeat and paid with his job|date=25 October 2013|accessdate=14 March 2014|work=The Telegraph[/tpl] the unpopular Gullit resigned to be replaced by the 66-year-old Bobby Robson. Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain's armband, reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife, Gullit's decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season. The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter, who reported telling the striker that he was "...the most overrated player I have ever seen."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/how-a-toon-totem-lived-the-dream-475291.html|title=How a Toon totem lived the dream|date=23 April 2006|work=The Independent |accessdate=27 December 2008 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Turnbull[/tpl] Ironically, Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997, making a bid of £20million which would have seen Shearer break the world's transfer fee record for the second time in 12 months.

Shearer missed only one league game and notched up 23 goals.

After this, Newcastle would have one more chance to progress in the Champions League in early 2003, but Shearer was one of those who failed to score as the team were eliminated in a penalty shootout by Partizan Belgrade in the third qualifying round. United progressed well in that season's UEFA Cup and Shearer's six goals helped the club reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille.

Announcing that this would be his final season before retirement, Shearer's form in 2004–05 was patchy; alongside new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only seven goals in his 28 games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club fared better in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.
The summer of 2005 saw Shearer reverse his decision to retire after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/01/15/sfnsou15.xml |title=Souness tries to talk Shearer round |accessdate=21 July 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 January 2005 |location=London |first=Rob |last=Stewart[/tpl] He decided to continue playing in a player-coach capacity until the end of the following season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/04/02/sfnnew02.xml |title= Newcastle say Shearer is manager in waiting |accessdate=21 July 2008 |author=Rob Stewart |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 April 2005 |location=London[/tpl] and he returned for one more season in 2005–06.

===Tribute and testimonial===

In tribute to Shearer's contribution to Newcastle United over more than ten years, the club erected a large banner of Shearer on the outside of the cantilever superstructure of the Gallowgate End of St James' Park. The banner measured [tpl]convert|25|m|ft[/tpl] high by [tpl]convert|32|m|ft[/tpl] wide, covering almost half of the Gallowgate End, aptly placed above the club bar, Shearers bar, opened in his honour in 2005. The banner depicted Shearer as the "Gallowgate Giant", with one arm aloft in his signature goal celebration, with the message "Thanks for 10 great years", and was featured in the media coverage reflecting on his career at the club,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2006/01/17/shear_magic_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC News|title=Shearer Special|accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/photo_galleries/4763579.stm|title=Shearer testimonial photos|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 May 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/how-a-toon-totem-lived-the-dream-475291.html|title=How a Toon totem lived the dream|work=The Independent |date=23 April 2006|accessdate=30 January 2009 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Turnbull[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060423/ai_n16213234|publisher=The Mirror|title=Football: THE SHO IS OVER|date=23 April 2006 | first=Brian | last=McNally[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] with the banner being displayed from 19 April 2006 until 11 May 2006, the day of his testimonial match. The banner could be seen across the city and as far away as Gateshead across the River Tyne, standing taller than the iconic local landmark, the Angel of the North.
Shearer was awarded a testimonial match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable to play in the whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.

==International career==

Shearer's international career began in 1990 when he was handed a callup to the England under-21 squad under Dave Sexton. During his time with the squad, he scored 13 times in 11 games; a record return which is still unbeaten. The striker's goals at this level, coupled with his club form, meant he was soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor. Marking his debut in the 2–0 win against France in February 1992 with a goal, he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later. Due to replace Gary Lineker, who retired from international action after UEFA Euro 1992, in the England attack,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/07/EnglandLegends_AlanShearer.htm|title=Shear Class|accessdate=15 August 2008|publisher=Football Association|date=15 July 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080821215951/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/07/EnglandLegends_AlanShearer.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008[/tpl] Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals.
UEFA Euro 1996 was a more positive experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far; five goals in 23 games.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_international.asp?HeroID=37617
However, he found the net in the 22nd minute of the first game, against Switzerland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/euro2004/History/Postings/2003/01/36689.htm|title=1996 European Championship|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Football Association|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704194447/http://www.thefa.com/Euro2004/History/Postings/2003/01/36689.htm |archivedate=4 July 2008[/tpl] Scoring once in the following game against Scotland and twice in a 4–1 win over the Netherlands, Shearer helped England to progress to the next stage in front of their own fans in Wembley.
In the quarter-finals, England were outplayed by Spain but got through to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer scored the first England penalty, while the Spaniards failed to score from two of theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly equalised and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his team-mate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer's five goals made him the competition's top scorer, and together with team mates David Seaman and Steve McManaman, was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament.
The new England manager Glenn Hoddle appointed Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and the player held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and twice in the following game against Poland. He scored a total of five goals in England's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally. Shearer was sidelined for much of the 1997–98 season, but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches. England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2–2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1900000/1900830.stm|title=England v Argentina revisited|accessdate=15 August 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 March 2002[/tpl] This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.
In September 1999, Shearer scored his only England hat-trick in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Luxembourg.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990905/ai_n14492589|title=Hat-trick Al ready to roll over Poles|accessdate=23 July 2008|author=Danny Fulbrook|publisher=Sunday Mirror|date=5 September 1999[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] This helped England reach a play-off against Scotland; England won the game over two legs and in doing so qualified for the European Championships. By now, Shearer was approaching his 30th birthday, and he announced that he intended to retire from international football after the Euro 2000 tournament.
Shearer did not score in England's opening 3–2 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England defeated Germany 1–0 in Charleroi,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/euro2004/History/Postings/2003/01/36675.htm|title=2000 European Championships|accessdate=15 August 2008|publisher=Football Association|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612090414/http://www.thefa.com/Euro2004/History/Postings/2003/01/36675.htm |archivedate=12 June 2008[/tpl] ensuring that England beat their European neighbours for the first time since the 1966 World Cup Final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2–1 up, but Romania ultimately won 3–2. England's tournament was over, and so was Shearer's international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored thirty goals;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Archive/?pf=p&i=4559&ap=p&searchname=Shearer|title=Alan Shearer profile|accessdate=7 August 2008|publisher=The Football Association|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080804031947/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Archive/?pf=p&i=4559&ap=p&searchname=Shearer |archivedate=4 August 2008[/tpl] joint-fifth in the England all-time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/05/England_Legends.htm|title=England legends|accessdate=24 July 2008|publisher=The Football Association|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080723192049/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2007/05/England_Legends.htm |archivedate=23 July 2008[/tpl] Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup – a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/internationals/shearer-rules-out-playing-again-for-england-600804.html|title=Shearer rules out playing again for England|work=The Independent |date=17 March 2003|accessdate=22 March 2009 | location=London | first=Glenn | last=Moore[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/the-year-in-sport-enter-gazza-amp-shearer-exit-oleary-amp-sven-621467.html|title=This year in sport: Enter Gazza & Shearer, exit O'Leary & Sven|date=30 December 2001|accessdate=22 March 2009|work=The Independent  | location=London | first=Peter | last=Corrigan|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081205174347/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/the-year-in-sport-enter-gazza-amp-shearer-exit-oleary-amp-sven-621467.html|archivedate=5 December 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5108822.stm|title=Shearer keeps England option open|date=25 June 2002|accessdate=22 March 2009|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]

==Style of play==

As a player, Shearer was often styled as a classic English centre-forward, owing to his strength, physical stature, heading ability and strong shot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,18891727-29437,00.html|title=Game loses 'classic' centre-forward|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Fox Sports (Australia)|date=22 April 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2370164/Shearer-given-due-encouragement-to-stay-on.html|title=Shearer given due encouragement to stay on|accessdate=6 August 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 December 2005 | location=London | first=Rob | last=Stewart[/tpl] Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ShearerGoalsRecord/0,,10278~757307,00.html|title=The Shearer Era – Facts And Figures|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Newcastle United F.C[/tpl] Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role; his age meant that he lost much of the pace which served him on the south coast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/alanshearer.htm|title=Football Hall of Fame – Alan Shearer|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=National Football Museum|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080804140236/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/alanshearer.htm |archivedate=4 August 2008[/tpl] Able to hold the ball up well, he also functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1999/apr/12/newsstory.sport4|title=Campbell's calamitous handiwork sees Shearer cash in to great effect|accessdate=6 August 2008|work=The Guardian |date=12 April 1999 | location=London | first=Michael | last=Walker[/tpl] Although his strength allowed him to hold on to the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2003/04/14/story697558662.asp|title=Shearer gets elbow from Ferguson|accessdate=6 August 2008|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=14 April 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2367434/FA-need-to-add-more-power-to-their-elbow.html|title=FA need to add more power to their elbow|accessdate=6 August 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2005 | location=London | first=Roy | last=Collins[/tpl]
As well as the two red cards, Shearer received 59 yellow cards during his career.
Shearer was noted as a proficient penalty taker for both club and country,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15726948_ITM|title=Eureka!

He also scored five goals from free-kicks for the north-east club.

==Coaching and management career==

===Coaching===

On his retirement as a player Shearer responded to speculation of an immediate move into coaching that he would take some personal time off to "enjoy life" for the next couple of years. He was also quoted as saying that he would eventually like to move into management,[tpl]Cite news| title = Shearer coy about England vacancy|publisher=BBC Sport| accessdate =24 November 2007| date = 24 November 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/7110846.stm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071126121049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/7110846.stm| archivedate= 26 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] "when the time was right" however as of March 2009 he was yet to start the UEFA Pro Licence course,. which is required to be permitted to manage a team in the Premier League and European competition.

Shearer took a brief role in the dugout for his final three games under Glenn Roeder. Shearer had rejected offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=683213.html |title=Shearer turns down Magpies coaching role |date=2 February 2008 |publisher=FIFA.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090405234023/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=683213.html|archivedate=5 April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7756326.stm |title=Shearer 'rejects Newcastle role' |date=29 November 2008 |publisher=BBC [/tpl] Shearer had previously had talks about, but never been offered, a full-time manager's role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009.

===Manager – Newcastle United===

In a surprise move, late on 1 April 2009, it was announced that Shearer would become the manager of his former club Newcastle United for the remaining eight games of the season, taking over from head coach Chris Hughton who was in temporary charge while the permanent manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery, having taken ill on 7 February. Shearer stated "It's a club I love and I don't want them to go down. I'll do everything I can to stop that."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7975700.stm|title=Shearer confirmed as Magpies boss |accessdate=2 April 2009|date=1 April 2009|publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090402012857/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7975700.stm| archivedate= 2 April 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20090401/nufc-statement-alan-shearer_2281670_1609447|title=NUFC Statement – Alan Shearer |accessdate=22 January 2011|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Newcastle United F.C[/tpl]
Shearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_5134564,00.html |title=Shearer – Toon job massive |format=(embedded video) direct link |date=2 April 2009 |publisher=Sky Sport[/tpl] In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager in the summer. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that "the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/newcastle/3477892/Alan-Shearer-unlikely-to-take-Newcastle-managers-position-while-Dennis-Wise-still-at-St-James-Park-Football.html |title=Alan Shearer unlikely to take Newcastle job while Dennis Wise is still at St James' Park |date=18 November 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Rob | last=Stewart | accessdate=22 January 2011[/tpl] Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters.

On the eve of the final day of the season on 24 May, where all fixtures are played simultaneously, Newcastle faced the prospect of being relegated to the Championship, along with Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, which would end their 16-year unbroken spell in the Premier League. After losing 1–0 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal, Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough, joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks, while Sunderland and Hull City survived. Shearer's eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty-four.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/05/24/premier.newcastle.relegation/|title=Newcastle relegated after final day defeat |accessdate=24 May 2009 |date=24 May 2009|publisher=CNN.com/world sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090527125655/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/05/24/premier.newcastle.relegation/| archivedate= 27 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Shearer did not get the manager's job on permanent basis. Chris Hughton stepped up from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League, which was achieved at the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in 2009–10.
Despite Newcastle looking like good bets for survival with the halfway point of the 2010–11 Premier League campaign looming, Hughton was sacked on 6 December 2010 and this sparked speculation that Shearer would be re-appointed as manager of the club. However, Newcastle's directors said that they were looking for a manager with more top flight experience and Shearer had ruled himself out of the running. Alan Pardew eventually took over the role.[tpl]cite news|title=Shearer rejects Toon talk|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6560647,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=22 January 2011|date=7 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Rob Lee reckons there is little chance of Alan Shearer returning as Newcastle boss.|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3264310/Rob-Lee-doubts-Alan-Shearer-will-boss-Newcastle-again.html|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=22 January 2011|date=7 December 2010|location=London[/tpl]

==Career outside football==

===Television career and commercial roles===

After his retirement and following guest appearances, Shearer became a regular pundit for the BBC's Match of the Day. He also formed part of the team which covered the 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup, and Euro 2012 for the BBC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/blackburn/2302774/Alan-Shearer-keen-on-Blackburn-Rovers-post.html|title=Alan Shearer keen on Blackburn Rovers post|accessdate=22 July 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 June 2008 | location=London | first1=Charlie | last1=Caroe | first2=David | last2=Edbrooke[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

However in September 2008 it was reported that Shearer was sacked from this largely honorary position by the club's owner Mike Ashley despite protests from players such as Steven Taylor and Damien Duff, due to Shearer's criticism of the way in which the club was being run in the wake of the departure of Kevin Keegan.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1055797/Alan-Shearer-kicked-Mike-Ashley-reveals-Newcastles-cash-crisis.html|title=Alan Shearer is kicked out as Mike Ashley reveals details of Newcastle's cash crisis|work=Daily Mail |date=15 September 2008 | location=London | first=Colin | last=Young[/tpl] These reports were denied by the club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7616394.stm|title=Magpies dismiss Shearer sack talk|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=10 March 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/1091-alan-shearer|title=Alan Shearer's Charity work|publisher=Look to the stars|accessdate=8 April 2009[/tpl]

===Charitable causes===

During his playing days, Shearer had been involved with the children's charity the NSPCC, taking part in the organisation's Full Stop campaign in 1999. Since retiring from football Shearer has also done work for several charities both nationally and in the Newcastle area.
In his testimonial match, he raised £1.64m benefiting fourteen good causes including £400,000 for the NSPCC and £320,000 for completion of the "Alan Shearer Centre", a respite care facility based in West Denton, Newcastle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/tm_headline=shearer-s-gift-is-a-new-way-to-care&method=full&objectid=18597445&siteid=50081-name_page.html|title=Shearer's gift is a new way to care|accessdate=24 July 2008|author=Paul James|publisher=Journal Live|date=9 February 2007[/tpl] In October 2006 he became an ambassador for the NSPCC, describing it as "the kick-off to my most important role yet".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/whatwedo/celebritysupporters/ambassadors/alanshearer/ambassadoralanshearer_wda39678.html|title=NSPCC Ambassador Alan Shearer OBE|accessdate=24 July 2008|publisher=NSPCC[/tpl] He has also worked with the charity the Dream Foundation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1378995/Charity-leaders-held-over-%27missing-funds%27.html|title=Charity leaders held over 'missing funds'|accessdate=24 July 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 July 2001 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Stokes[/tpl] In 2006, Shearer founded the Alan Shearer Academy Scholarship to aid the development of promising young players in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/sport/?jp=cweyeyidmhql|title=Shearer donates testimonial proceeds to charity|accessdate=24 July 2008|publisher=Ireland Online|date=28 March 2006[/tpl]
In 2008, he raised over £300,000 for Sport Relief in a bike ride with fellow Match of the Day presenter Adrian Chiles, the idea for which emerged in an off the cuff question from cycling fan Chiles to Shearer as to how he kept fit since retirement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7297029.stm|title=Football duo finish charity ride|accessdate=24 July 2008|publisher=BBC News|date=14 March 2008[/tpl] Shearer also played and scored twice in Soccer Aid, a game involving celebrities and former players at Wembley Stadium in September 2008, to raise money for UNICEF.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org.uk/youthvoice/socceraid.asp|title=Stars take to the pitch for Soccer Aid |accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=UNICEF[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]
On 26 July 2009, Shearer played and scored in the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, a charity match held at St James' Park in tribute of Sir Bobby Robson and in aid of his cancer charity the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. It proved to be Sir Bobby's last public appearance, as he died five days later. On 15 October 2009 Shearer became the new patron of Sir Bobby's Foundation.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Shearer is married to Lainya, whom he met whilst a Southampton player. The couple lived locally with her parents during Shearer's second year at the south coast club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St. James' Church in the city. In contrast to the portrayal of some WAGs (wives and girlfriends) of later players by the media, Lainya is described by Shearer as a quiet and reserved person, not comfortable in the spotlight her husband's fame sometimes brought. The couple have three children. Shearer cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career, having had the chance to move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn. Shearer's family accompanied him onto the pitch following the striker's testimonial in May 2006 as he performed a lap of honour at St. James' Park.[tpl]cite book|title=My Illustrated Career |last=Shearer |first=Alan |year=2007 |publisher=Cassell Illustrated |location=London |pages= 162–222 |isbn=1-84403-586-7[/tpl]

===Personal honours===

On 6 December 2000, Shearer was given Honorary Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, with the citation "in recognition of his role as Captain of Newcastle United Football Club and as former Captain of England which have enhanced the reputation of the City".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/2425752/Newcastle-quick-to-reap-rewards.html|title=Newcastle quick to reap rewards|accessdate=5 August 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 November 2003 | location=London | first=Rob | last=Wildman[/tpl]
Shearer was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours.
On 4 December 2006, Shearer was created a Doctor of Civil Law by Northumbria University, at a ceremony at Newcastle City Hall, where the University vice-chancellor declared that "Throughout his career Alan Shearer has been hard-working, committed, disciplined and focused in his endeavours, fighting back from career-threatening injuries with great determination and courage".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/6207010.stm|title=Football legend receives degree|accessdate=5 August 2008|publisher=BBC News|date=4 December 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kCawJYWD|archivedate=1 October 2009[/tpl]
On 1 October 2009, Shearer was commissioned as Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, having been nominated by the Duchess of Northumberland in her capacity as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, and approved for the position by the Queen. In this role, Shearer, along with 21 other deputies, is the stand-in for the Duchess when she cannot fulfill her role as The Queen's official representative in the region at official engagements. Deputies must live within 7 miles of the county boundaries, and retain their appointment until age 75. The Duchess said of the appointment that "You could not find a more iconic person than Alan, not just for what he has done in football but for all the extra work he tirelessly does for charity and communities. I am delighted he has accepted the role of Deputy Lieutenant because he is a real role model. I have promised him he is not going to have to do too much, but even if it is just one occasion a year he is the perfect choice"
On 7 December 2009 Shearer was made a Doctor of Civil Law by Newcastle University.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/item/newcastle-university-s-new-chancellor-honours-his-personal-heroes |title=Newcastle University's new chancellor honours his personal heroes |publisher=Newcastle University |accessdate=7 December 2009 |date=7 December 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lqkNNMuI |archivedate=7 December 2009[/tpl] Chancellor Sir Liam Donaldson stated "Newcastle United are my team. Alan Shearer is more than just a local legend, he's probably one of the greatest footballers of all time".
