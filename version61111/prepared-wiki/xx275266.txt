==Plot==

Father Cyprian is a Catholic priest whose parishioners include five women. These five form a circle of friendship. Among them is a child, Felicitas Maria Taylor, a serious-minded girl with no use for boys, dating, or fun. Rather, she dreams of the day she can become a great writer like Jane Austen. Felicitas develops as a composite of the older women.
