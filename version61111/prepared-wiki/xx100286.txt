[[Splenic flexure syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: GI tract disorders

Splenic flexure syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe bloating, muscle spasms of the colon, and upper abdominal discomfort thought to be caused by trapped gas at the splenic (as opposed to hepatic) flexure in the colon; the pain caused can be excruciating and debilitating, and may mimic that of a heart attack (because of the proximity of the splenic flexure to the diaphragm and referred pain from irritation to the diaphragmatic sensory nerves).
Some physicians classify splenic flexure syndrome as a type of IBS; others consider it a separate condition.
