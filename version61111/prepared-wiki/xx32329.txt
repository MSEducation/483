==Early history==

On April 20, 1999, it was reported that Mozilla, at the time the open-source arm of AOL's Netscape Communications division, had announced the commencement of "an instant messaging and chat project with the stated goal of supporting a wide variety of chat protocols, including the venerable Internet Relay Chat." Other companies were also developing chat systems. "'We recognize that there's a lot of interest in the instant messaging space,' said AOL spokesperson Catherine Corre, referring to the Mozilla project. 'This is a recognition of the interest in that area.'"[tpl]cite web |date=April 20, 1999 |title=Mozilla develops chat/messaging software |first=Paul |last=Festa|publisher=CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-224715.html[/tpl]  At the time, the new chat client proposal was reported as being "competition" to AOL's own AOL Instant Messenger chat client, and on April 21, 1999, the announcement was rescinded "pending further review by Netscape."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/chat/ |title=Instant Messaging and Chat in Mozilla |publisher=Mozilla.org |date=April 21, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|date=April 21, 1999| title=Mozilla yanks chat proposal |first=Paul |last=Festa | publisher=CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-224779.html[/tpl] Independently, programmer Robert Ginda developed an IRC client and submitted it to the Mozilla project, which as of September 1999 planned to introduce it with the planned release of Mozilla browser.[tpl]cite web |date=September 9, 1999 |title=Mozilla's messenger may compete with AIM, others|first=Paul |last=Festa|publisher= CNET News |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-278288.html[/tpl]

==Reception==

Reviews of ChatZilla have varied from enthusiastic, in the case of users familiar with IRC, to  unimpressed, for reviewers more accustomed to other chat client user interfaces.  A 2003 review in Computers for Doctors of Mozilla 1.0, referred to IRC client applications as "not very user-friendly, and the same goes for ChatZilla. You won't find any pop-up icons, or happy little noises telling you somebody wants to chat."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sq6nEWezMeMC&pg=PA164#v=onepage&f=false |title=Computers for Doctors |editor=Thacker, Naveen |publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers |year=2003 |location =India |isbn=978-81-8061-176-6[/tpl] 
In 2004, Jennifer Golbeck, writing in IRC Hacks, pointed out its cross-platform consistency, and found it "quick and easy to start using", and has "great support for changing the appearance of chat windows with motifs...(CSS files)."
In a 2008 overview of extensions for Firefox in Linux Journal, Dan Sawyer described ChatZilla as an "oldie-but-goodie", "venerable," "with all the trimmings," "handsomely organizes chat channels, logs, has an extensive built-in list of available channels, supports DCC chats and file transfers, and has its own plugin and theming architecture." The application "implements all the standards very well, and for those who prefer to keep desktop clutter to a minimum but still enjoy fighting with random strangers on IRC, ChatZilla is a must-have."[tpl]cite journal|title=Must-Have Firefox Extensions |issue=170|date=May 1, 2008 |first=Dan|last=Sawyer |publisher=LinuxJournal.com |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/must-have-firefox-extensions?page=0,1 |issn=1075-3583 [/tpl]
