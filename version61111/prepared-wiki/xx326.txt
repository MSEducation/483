[[Geography of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Canada

The geography of Canada describes the geographic features of Canada, the world's second largest country in total area.
Situated in northern North America (constituting 41% of the continent's area), Canada spans a vast, diverse territory between the North Pacific Ocean to the west and the North Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Arctic Ocean to the north (hence the country's motto "From sea to sea"), with the United States to the south (contiguous United States) and northwest (Alaska).  Greenland is to the northeast; off the southern coast of Newfoundland lies Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas collectivity of France. Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60°W and 141°W longitude to the North Pole; however, this claim is contested.[tpl]cite web| url= http://atlas.gc.ca/site/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1927/1 | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Canada territorial evolution |date=April 2004| accessdate=2007-03-01[/tpl]  While the magnetic North Pole lies within the Canadian Arctic territorial claim as of 2011, recent measurements indicate it is moving towards Siberia.[tpl]cite web| url= http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/nmp/long_mvt_nmp_e.php | author= Geological Survey of Canada | title= Longterm movement of the magnetic north pole | publisher= Government of Canada | accessdate= 2009-03-20[/tpl]
Covering [tpl]convert|9984670|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl] (land: [tpl]convert|9093507|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]; water: [tpl]convert|891163|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]), Canada is slightly less than three-fifths as large as Russia and slightly larger than Europe. In total area, Canada is slightly larger than both the U.S. and China; however, Canada ranks fourth in land area (i.e., total area minus the area of lakes and rivers)—China is [tpl]convert|9326410|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and the U.S. is [tpl]convert|9161923|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/factbook/countrycompare/area/3d.html;_ylt=As1XMsN8kgSx746VWazy_s7PecYF| title = World Factbook: Area Country Comparison Table| publisher = Yahoo Education| accessdate = 2008-06-17[/tpl]
The population of Canada, some 34,980,000 as of November 2012, is concentrated in the south in proximity to its border with the contiguous U.S.; with a population density of 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1/sq mi), it is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The northernmost settlement in Canada—and in the world—is Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Alert (just north of Alert, Nunavut) on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island at 82°30′N 62°19′W, just [tpl]convert|834|km|mi[/tpl] from the North Pole.

==Climate==

Canada has a diverse climate. The climate varies from temperate on the west coast of British Columbia[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VICTORIA&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 | title= Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000 | publisher= Environment Canada | accessdate=19 March 2013[/tpl] to a subarctic climate in the north. Extreme northern Canada can have snow for most of the year with a Polar climate.[ref]
