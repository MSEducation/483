On the 14th of November in 2012 NEDA organised an anti-austerity protest outside the Ministry of Finance in Nicosia together with the Alliance Against the Memorandum. In the protest NEDA gave out leaflets, which expressed the view that "the EU is trying to burden the workers with the debts from the collapse of the bankers" and that "if this happens, the Cypriot economy and the future of the new generations will then be mortgaged to local and foreign profiteers and usurious bankers".http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/Eidiseis-Kypros/22/122786/ekdilosi-diamartyrias-kata-ttis-troikas-exo-apo-to-ypoik, http://www.kathimerini.com.cy/index.php?pageaction=kat&modid=1&artid=112585&show=Y,
