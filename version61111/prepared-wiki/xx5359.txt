===National Security Advisor===

On December 1, 2008 then-President-elect Obama announced Jones as his selection for National Security Advisor.[tpl]cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Obama names Clinton to top role in his team |date=1 December 2008 |work=Politics |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27983003/|accessdate=2008-12-01[/tpl]  The National Security Advisor is appointed by the President without confirmation by the United States Senate.
The pick surprised people because, as Michael Crowley reported "The two men didn't meet until Obama's foreign policy aide, Mark Lippert, arranged a 2005 sit-down, and, as of this October, Jones had only spoken to Obama twice".[tpl]cite news|last=Crowley|first=Michael| title=Man in the Mirror|publisher=The New Republic|date=December 31, 2008|url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=739be2da-4d50-49ee-b1c1-60eb865a69c6|accessdate=January 12, 2008[/tpl] Crowley speculated that Jones' record suggests he is "someone who, unencumbered by strong ideological leanings, can evaluate ideas dispassionately whether they come from left or right", and, "This is probably why Obama picked him". Jones was also picked because he is well respected and likely to possess the skills to navigate the other prestigious and powerful cabinet members.
Though he doesn't know Gates especially well, both men share long experience in the national security establishment (Gates was in the Air Force and previously headed the CIA). Jones and Clinton have a more direct connection, having bonded — as Hillary did with many military officials — during her tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The two are said to have particularly clicked at a 2005 conference on security policy in Munich. Jones hosted a small private dinner that included Clinton and South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, among others; at the end of the convivial evening, according to one person present, Jones followed Clinton out to her car to visit in private.
Jones assumed the post when Obama was sworn into office on January 20, 2009. He announced his resignation as National Security Advisor on October 8, 2010, and was succeeded by Thomas E. Donilon.[tpl]cite web|last=Feller|first=Ben|title=AP sources: Jones stepping down as Obama's national security adviser; Donilon to replace him|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gD-6wdjYRjpr-4VV4vZb_eFtjbjg?docId=4777657|publisher=Canadian Press|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=Oct 8, 2010[/tpl]

===Advocate for Iranian dissidents===

In March 2013 Jones was quoted comparing the conditions for Iranians in a US camp in Iraq with the conditions of detention for captives held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps.[tpl]cite news|url= http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/03/12/jim_jones_camp_liberty_is_worse_than_guantanamo|title=Jim Jones: Camp Liberty is worse than Guantanamo|publisher=Foreign Policy|author=Josh Rogin|date=2013-03-12|archivedate=2013-03-13|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthecable.foreignpolicy.com%2Fposts%2F2013%2F03%2F12%2Fjim_jones_camp_liberty_is_worse_than_guantanamo&date=2013-03-13|deadurl=No|quote=[/tpl]
While addressing the Iranian American Cultural Society of Michigan, Jones said Guantanamo captives "are treated far better" than the Iranian internees.  Jones criticized other aspects of the Obama administration's policy on Iran.  Foreign Policy magazine noted that Jones had not volunteered whether he had been paid for this speaking engagement.

==Personal life and style==

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who hired Jones as his military assistant, is quoted as saying Jones has a placid demeanor and a "methodical approach to problems — he’s able to view issues at both the strategic and tactical level".
While Commandant of the Marine Corps, Jones often signed emails as "Rifleman", as he served as an infantry officer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
