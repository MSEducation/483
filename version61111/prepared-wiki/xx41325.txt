Monetary policy concerns the actions of a central bank or other regulatory authorities that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply. 
In the United States, the Federal Reserve is in charge of monetary policy, and implements it primarily by performing operations that influence short term interest rates.

==Money supply==

The money supply has different components, generally broken down into "narrow" and "broad" money, reflecting the different degrees of liquidity ('spendability') of each different type, as broader forms of money can be converted into narrow forms of money (or may be readily accepted as money by others, such as personal checks).http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/great-depression-blogging/ Paul Krugman, "Great Depression Blogging," January 17, 2008: "Monetary base only gets created or destroyed through Fed actions. 
For example, demand deposits are technically promises to pay on demand, while savings deposits are promises to pay subject to some withdrawal restrictions, and Certificates of Deposit are promises to pay only at certain specified dates; each can be converted into money, but "narrow" forms of money can be converted more readily. The Federal Reserve directly controls only the most narrow form of money, physical cash outstanding along with the reserves of banks throughout the country (known as M0 or the monetary base); the Federal Reserve indirectly influences the supply of other types of money. 
Broad money includes money held in deposit balances in banks and other forms created in the financial system. Basic economics also teaches that the money supply shrinks when loans are repaid;[ref]

Other than loans, investment activities of commercial banks and the Federal Reserve also increase and decrease the money supply.  Discussion of "money" often confuses the different measures and may lead to misguided commentary on monetary policy and misunderstandings of policy discussions.http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2007/10/long-live-debt.html Willem Buiter, Professor, London School of Economics, "Long Live Debt", Financial Times "Maverecon Blog", October 13, 2007.
