Cratylus ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|r|ə|ˈ|t|aɪ|l|ə|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|Κρατύλος[/tpl], Kratylos) is the name of a dialogue by Plato.  Most modern scholars agree that it was written mostly during Plato's so-called middle period.pp. 6, 13-14, David Sedley, Plato's Cratylus, Cambridge U Press 2003.  In the dialogue, Socrates is asked by two men, Cratylus and Hermogenes, to tell them whether names are "conventional" or "natural", that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify.

==Summary==

When discussing how a word would relate to its subject, Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist.Cratylus 390d-e.  An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting. In much the same way, the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject.  There is a letter that is best for soft things, one for liquid things, and so on.Cratylus 431d. He comments, "the best possible way to speak consists in using names all (or most) of which are like the things they name (that is, are appropriate to them), while the worst is to use the opposite kind of names."Cratylus 435c.
One countering position, held by Hermogenes, is that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them.Cratylus 383a-b.
The line between the two perspectives is often blurred.[tpl]clarification|date=December 2011[/tpl] During more than half of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes' request as to where names and words have come from.  These include the names of the Olympian gods, personified deities, and many words that describe abstract concepts. He examines whether, for example, giving names of "streams" to Cronus and Rhea (Ροή – flow or space) are purely accidental.Cratylus 402b Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. Those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word. He states, "names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue."Cratylus 421d
The final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus, a disciple of Heraclitus, who believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct.  Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify.  From this point, Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language, believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.

==Appropriate sounds==

Although these are clear examples of onomatopoeia, Socrates's statement that words are not musical imitations of the nature suggests that Plato didn't believe that language itself generates from sound words.Claramonte, Manuel Breva (1983).

==Platonic Theory of Forms==

Plato's theory of forms also makes an appearance, when, for example, no matter what, say, a hammer, is made out of, it is still called a "hammer", and thus is the Form of a hammer:
 Socrates: So mustn't a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing? And if he is to be an authentic giver of names, mustn't he, in making and giving each name, look to what a name itself is? And if different rule-setters do not make each name out of the same syllables, we mustn't forget that different blacksmiths, who are making the same tool for the same type of work, don't all make it out of the same iron. But as long as they give it the same form--even if that form is embodied in different iron--the tool will be correct, whether it is made in Greece or abroad. Isn't that so?Cratylus 389d-390a1. 
Plato's theory of forms again appears at 439c, when Cratylus concedes the existence of "a beautiful itself, and a good itself, and the same for each one of the things that are".Cratylus 439c-d.
