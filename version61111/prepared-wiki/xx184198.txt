CATEGORIES: Former local government areas of Victoria (Australia)

The City of Camberwell was a local government area about [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0[/tpl] east of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia. The city covered an area of [tpl]convert|36.01|km2|sqmi|2[/tpl], and existed from 1914 until 1994.

==History==

Camberwell was first incorporated as the Boroondara Road District on 11 July 1864, which became the Shire of Boroondara on 17 November 1871. At this point, Camberwell consisted of two small settlements; one near the Camberwell Inn and the other to the east, at Hartwell. Much of the shire's area was under cultivation, with a few sites for fine residences at the northern end.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/camberwell.html|title=Australian Places - Camberwell|author=Monash University|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031003042818/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/camberwell.html|archivedate=2003-10-03[/tpl]
The shire was renamed to the Shire of Camberwell and Boroondara on 16 May 1905. It became a borough on 28 April 1905, a town on 15 May 1906 and a city, by proclamation, on 20 April 1914.[tpl]cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=327â€“328[/tpl] Accessed at State Library of Victoria, La Trobe Reading Room.
The council's pathway to amalgamation was a little different to most; following a redevelopment deal for land behind the Burke Road shops, which was rejected by most residents, the council reneged on the deal and had damages awarded against it. On 22 June 1993, the council was suspended, and replaced with a commissioner. At the same time, a major reform of local government in Victoria was taking place, and the decision was made to merge Camberwell with the Cities of Hawthorn and Kew into the newly created City of Boroondara, which took effect on 22 June 1994.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/free.nsf/0/76E601D6DB55E88ACA25722500049195/$File/12570_1994-95.pdf|title=Victorian local government amalgamations 1994-1995: Changes to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=1 August 1995|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|page=4|isbn=0-642-23117-6|accessdate=2007-12-16[/tpl]
