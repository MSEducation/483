In 1986 Lantratov was awarded the title "Honored Artist of Russia," and in 1997, Russian president Boris Yeltsin named Lantratov “People’s Artist of Russia,”[tpl]cite news |title=Борьба с кощунами |url=http://www.vmdaily.ru/article/9513.html |work=Vechernyaya Moskva |date=31 March 2005 |accessdate=9 March 2011 [/tpl] the Russian Federation's highest artistic honor.
In 1991, he was one of eight soloists in Rudolf Nureyev's "Farewell Tour" of the United Kingdom.

This same year, Lantratov formed the Russian National Ballet Foundation, a Moscow-based charitable organization with the purpose of promoting the traditional art of the Russian classical ballet and providing aesthetic education. Its creation was supported by the Moscow Actors’ Charitable Foundation under the guidance of Galina Ulanova and the Stanislavsky and Nemorovich-Danchenko Moscow Musical Theater.
Lantratov has appeared in the United States as a guest artist with the Portland Ballet[tpl]cite news |title=Portland Ballet delivers electrifying 'Nutcracker' |work=Maine Sunday Telegram |date=3 December 1995 |page=10E [/tpl] and Boston Ballet and was a guest instructor with the Boston Ballet.  From 2000-2003 Lantratov directed one of two touring companies for SMI, Inc's Moscow Ballet and danced the rôle of Drosselmeier in the company's "Great Russian Nutcracker" production.[tpl]cite news |title=Elephants and Bears but No Sugar Plum Fairy |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E2D8123CF936A15751C1A9649C8B63 |work=The New York Times |date=25 December 2002 |accessdate=9 March 2011 [/tpl]  "Valery Lantratov's Drosselmeier is young, vibrant and full of explosive energy," wrote reviewer Nancy Johnson. "The mischief in his eyes reaches the back of the house."  In 2004, however, he publicly split with Moscow Ballet's U.S.-based production company.
In 2004, Lantratov premiered the rôle of Czar Nicholas II in the ballet Rasputin staged by the New Imperial Russian Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia, with the production being taken to Moscow in 2005.  The ballet, which featured Farouk Ruzimatov in the rôle of Rasputin, drew protests from Orthodox fundamentalists.  Nicholas II was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000.  The protestors objected to the depiction of a saint in ballet and especially to the concept of Nicholas II costumed in tights.  Lantratov arranged a photoshoot with his costume to show that he would not wear tights in the production.[tpl]cite news |title=А вот кому балет про "рашн секс-машин": С царем куролесит сам Rasputin! |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23487.4/38389/ |work=Komsomolskaya Pravda |date=31 March 2005 |accessdate=9 March 2011 [/tpl]
