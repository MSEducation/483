CATEGORIES: 2nd-century Romans

Marcus Petronius Mamertinus, possibly known as Sextus Petronius Mamertinus (died c. 156) was an African Roman politician who lived in the 2nd century in the Roman Empire.
Petronius originally came from a wealthy family of Equestrian order, possibly from Egypt. He became a prominent politician during the reign of Roman Emperors Hadrian (117-138) and Antoninus Pius (138-161). From 133-137, he served as Prefect of Egypt and in 139-143 served as Praetorian prefect in Rome. 
Due to his outstanding service, Antoninus Pius promoted him to Senatorial rank. Antoninus Pius awarded Petronius the suffect consulship of 150. Petronius married an unnamed African Roman noblewoman and they had three children: a son Marcus Petronius Sura Mamertinus who served as consul in 182 who married Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor (one of the daughters of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius), Marcus Petronius Sura Septimianus who served as consul in 190 and a daughter who had married the illustrious Roman Senator Marcus Antoninus Antius Lupus.
