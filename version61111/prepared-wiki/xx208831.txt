==Early career==

Identifying himself as "Hal from North Bergen", Turner became notable in American conservative circles as a frequent caller to and supporter of WABC radio talk show hosts Bob Grant and Sean Hannity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/blumenthal|author=Max Blumenthal|date=2005-06-03|publisher=The Nation|title=Hannity's Soul-Mate of Hate[/tpl] Turner parlayed this fame into a role as the northern New Jersey coordinator for Patrick J. Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign. 
Turner claims he established a friendship with Sean Hannity, on whose radio program he had once been a frequent presence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050620/blumenthal/2|author=Max Blumenthal|date=2005-06-03|publisher=The Nation|title=Hannity's Soul-Mate of Hate (page 2)[/tpl] In 2008, while Hannity and Malik Zulu Shabazz of the New Black Panther Party were debating Barack Obama's association with Jeremiah Wright, Shabazz asked Hannity if he should "be judged by (his) promotion and association with Hal Turner". Hannity began to say that he didn't know Turner, but then said he was someone he had banned from his radio program ten years before. Turner subsequently gave an account of their association on his website, in which he said of Hannity's response: "I was quite disappointed when Sean Hannity at first tried to say he didn't know me. In fact, Sean does know me and we were quite friendly a few years ago."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/bffhannity|author=Hal Turner|date=2008-03-23|title=About Sean Hannity and Me|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/23/sean-hannity-confronted-o_n_92961.html|author=Jason Linkins|date=2008-03-23|title=Sean Hannity Confronted Over His Relationship With Neo-Nazi Hal Turner|publisher=The Huffington Post[/tpl] Phil Boyce, Program Director of WABC, disputed the account, which described a friendship developing between Turner and Hannity in 1993, three years before Hannity was actually hired at WABC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newshounds.us/2008/03/23/neo_naziwhite_supremacist_hal_turner_confirms_friendship_and_kinship_with_sean_hannity.php|author=Ellen|date=2008-03-23|title=Neo Nazi/White Supremacist Hal Turner Confirms Friendship And Kinship With Sean Hannity|publisher=News Hounds[/tpl]

Turner left the program in 2002, citing artistic differences. In 2002, Turner became a solo host, purchasing a time slot on shortwave radio station WBCQ, over which he broadcast for approximately four years. On WBCQ on March 22, 2004 he left the show "after harshly criticizing his supporters, listeners, and WBCQ."[tpl]cite news | url=http://schedule.wbcq.com/main.php?fn=show_program&id=50 | title=Annotated WBCQ Program Guide | publisher=WBCQ | year= 2004 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-07-15[/tpl] The show lacked financial support,Stopped broadcasting on March 22, 2004 from WBCQ the owner of the station Allan Weiner was Jewish, and Turner had health problemsTurner was in the hospital a number of times in 2003 and 2004 http://www.frn.net/vines/Forum1/HTML/000877.html[tpl]Verify credibility|date=August 2009[/tpl].

Fitzgerald made the following comment:
 "For years, Turner has engaged in a campaign of intimidation against public officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner’s arrest in this case failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation against a key witness in the government’s case against him. All the while, Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his innumerable victims – that is, except when he is the victim of a perceived threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in witness intimidation, lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret whatsoever."
