R Aquarii (R Aqr) is a variable star in the constellation Aquarius.
R Aquarii is a symbiotic star believed to contain a white dwarf and a Mira-type variable in a binary system. The orbital period is approximately 44 years.By its gravitational pull, the white dwarf draws in material from the red giant and occasionally ejects some of the surplus in weird loops to form the nebula seen in the linked image.[tpl]cite web | url = http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=23+43+49.4616-15+17+04.202&ident=V*+R+Aqr&submit=Aladin+previewer | title = Aladin previewer | publisher = CDS[/tpl] The whole system appears reddened because it is situated in a very dusty region of space, and its blue light is absorbed before reaching us. 
The nebula around R Aquarii is also known as Cederblad 211. According to Tom Polakis,[ref]
