The Yazoo lands were the sparsely populated central and western areas of the U.S. state of Georgia, when its western border stretched back to the Mississippi River.[tpl]cite book|last=Pickett|first=Albert James|title=History of Alabama and incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the earliest period|year=1851|publisher=Walker and James|location=Charleston|pages=408-428[/tpl]   It was named for the Native American Yazoo tribe that lived on the lower course of the Yazoo River in what is now Mississippi.
These lands later would become large portions of the states of Alabama and Mississippi, with the exclusion of Spanish West Florida, which became the lower third of each state, and a narrow northern strip of land claimed by South Carolina in the Treaty of Beaufort that also stretched westward to the river, which became the two states' border counties with Tennessee.
In the 1790s, the Yazoo lands were the subject of a major political scandal in the state of Georgia, called the Yazoo land scandal. It led to Georgia's cession of the land to the U.S. government in the Compact of 1802.[tpl]cite web|title=The Pine Barrens Speculation and Yazoo Land Fraud|url=http://www.aboutnorthgeorgia.com/ang/The_Pine_Barrens_Speculation_and_Yazoo_Land_Fraud|publisher=About North Georgia|accessdate=July 27, 2013[/tpl]
