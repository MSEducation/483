Another source of crown income was represented by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and he was free to tax them at will.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=344[/tpl] By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=344–5[/tpl] Their usury business[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]a practice forbidden to Christians[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]had made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=86[/tpl] In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions;[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=322[/tpl] in 1279, in the context of a crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=170–1[/tpl] In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=226[/tpl] The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=226–8[/tpl] This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=345[/tpl]; [tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=513[/tpl] The expulsion, which was not reversed until 1656,[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=346[/tpl] followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=226[/tpl]
Among the main achievements of the reign of Edward I were the reforms of the institution of the English Parliament and its transformation into a source for generating revenues. Edward held Parliament on a reasonably regular basis throughout his reign.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=342[/tpl] In 1295, however, a significant change occurred. For this Parliament, in addition to the secular and ecclesiastical lords, two knights from each county and two representatives from each borough were summoned.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=185[/tpl] The representation of commons in Parliament was nothing new; what was new was the authority under which these representatives were summoned. Whereas previously the commons had been expected simply to assent to decisions already made by the magnates, it was now proclaimed that they should meet with the full authority (plena potestas) of their communities, to give assent to decisions made in Parliament.[tpl]Harvnb|Harriss|1975|pp=41–2[/tpl] The king now had full backing for collecting lay subsidies from the entire population. Lay subsidies were taxes collected at a certain fraction of the moveable property of all laymen.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1989|pp=70–1[/tpl] Whereas Henry III had only collected four of these in his reign, Edward I collected nine.[tpl]Harvnb|Brown|1989|p=71[/tpl] This format eventually became the standard for later Parliaments, and historians have named the assembly the "Model Parliament".The term was first introduced by William Stubbs; [tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=283–4[/tpl]

===Constitutional crisis===

The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great financial demand on Edward's subjects. Whereas the king had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted in the years 1294–97, raising over £200,000.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=179[/tpl] Along with this came the burden of prises (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt.[tpl]Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=57[/tpl] The fiscal demands on the king's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the king responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=403–4[/tpl] At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration.Winchelsey's consecration was held up by the protracted papal election of 1292–94; [tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=671[/tpl] Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=674[/tpl] When the clergy, with reference to the bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=675[/tpl] Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the king and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=417[/tpl] By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=430[/tpl]
[tpl]Quote box|Edward By God, Sir Earl, either go or hang Roger Bigod By that same oath, O king, I shall neither go nor hang|Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough[tpl]cite book|title=The chronicle of Walter of Guisborough|editor=Harry Rothwell|publisher=Camden Society|location=London|year=1957|volume=89|pages=289–90[/tpl] Quoted in [tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=416[/tpl]|align=left[/tpl]
Opposition from the laity took longer to surface. This resistance focused on two things: the king's right to demand military service, and his right to levy taxes. At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, in his capacity as Marshal of England, objected to a royal summons of military service. Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the king; if the king intended to sail to Flanders, he could not send his subjects to Gascony.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1972|p=251[/tpl] In July, Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Constable of England, drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances, in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced.[tpl]Harvnb|Harriss|1975|p=61[/tpl]. Undeterred, Edward requested another lay subsidy. This one was particularly provocative, because the king had sought consent only from a small group of magnates, rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=422[/tpl] While Edward was in Winchelsea, preparing for the campaign in Flanders, Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=682[/tpl] As the king left the country with a greatly reduced force, the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=425[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=683[/tpl] What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=427[/tpl] Edward signed the Confirmatio cartarum[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]a confirmation of Magna Carta and its accompanying Charter of the Forest[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]and the nobility agreed to serve with the king on a campaign in Scotland.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=170[/tpl]
Edward's problems with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, in particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest.A full text of the charter, with additional information, can be found at: [tpl]cite web|url=http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/Carta.htm|title=The Charter of the Forest of King Henry III|last=Jones|first=Graham|publisher=St John's College, Oxford|accessdate=17 July 2009[/tpl] In the parliament of 1301, the king was forced to order an assessment of the royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=525–6, 547–8[/tpl] Ultimately, it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against Edward I. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=697[/tpl] As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the king that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=537–8[/tpl] Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the king, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=175[/tpl]

===Final years: return to Scotland===

The situation in Scotland had seemed resolved when Edward left the country in 1296, but resistance soon emerged under the leadership of the strategically gifted and charismatic William Wallace. On 11 September 1297, a large English force under the leadership of John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, and Hugh de Cressingham was routed by a much smaller Scottish army led by Wallace and Andrew Moray at Stirling Bridge.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=123–6[/tpl] The defeat sent shockwaves into England, and preparations for a retaliatory campaign started immediately. Soon after Edward returned from Flanders, he headed north.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=688–9[/tpl] On 22 July 1298, in the only major battle he had fought since Evesham in 1265, Edward defeated Wallace's forces at the Battle of Falkirk.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=479[/tpl] Edward, however, was not able to take advantage of the momentum, and the next year the Scots managed to recapture Stirling Castle.[tpl]Harvnb|Watson|1998|pp=92–3[/tpl] Even though Edward campaigned in Scotland both in 1300, when he successfully besieged  Caerlaverock Castle  and in 1301, the Scots refused to engage in open battle again, preferring instead to raid the English countryside in smaller groups.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=233[/tpl] Furthermore the defeated Scots, secretly urged on by the French, appealed to the pope to assert a claim of overlordship to Scotland in place of the English. His papal bull addressed to King Edward in these terms was firmly rejected on Edward's behalf by the Barons' Letter of 1301. The English managed to subdue the country by other means, however. In 1303, a peace agreement was reached between England and France, effectively breaking up the Franco-Scottish alliance.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=497[/tpl] Robert the Bruce, the grandson of the claimant to the crown in 1291, had sided with the English in the winter of 1301–02.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=496[/tpl] By 1304, most of the other nobles of the country had also pledged their allegiance to Edward, and this year the English also managed to re-take Stirling Castle.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=709–11[/tpl] A great propaganda victory was achieved in 1305 when Wallace was betrayed by Sir John de Menteith and turned over to the English, who had him taken to London where he was publicly executed.[tpl]Harvnb|Watson|1998|pp=211–[/tpl] With Scotland largely under English control, Edward installed Englishmen and collaborating Scots to govern the country.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|pp=711–3[/tpl]
The situation changed again on 10 February 1306, when Robert the Bruce murdered his rival John Comyn and a few weeks later, on 25 March, had himself crowned king of Scotland by Isobel, sister of the Earl of Buchan.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|pp=206–7, 212–3[/tpl] Bruce now embarked on a campaign to restore Scottish independence, and this campaign took the English by surprise.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=506[/tpl] Edward was suffering ill health by this time, and instead of leading an expedition himself, he gave different military commands to Aymer de Valence and Henry Percy, while the main royal army was led by the Prince of Wales.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=506–7[/tpl] The English initially met with success; on 19 June, Aymer de Valence routed Bruce at the Battle of Methven.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=216[/tpl] Bruce was forced into hiding, while the English forces recaptured their lost territory and castles.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=507–8[/tpl] Edward responded with severe brutality against Bruce's allies; it was clear that he now regarded the struggle not as a war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=508–9[/tpl] This brutality, though, rather than helping to subdue the Scots, had the opposite effect, and rallied growing support for Bruce.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=239[/tpl] In February 1307, Bruce reappeared and started gathering men, and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Loudoun Hill.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=244[/tpl] Edward, who had rallied somewhat, now moved north himself. On the way, however, he developed dysentery, and his condition deteriorated. On 6 July he encamped at Burgh by Sands, just south of the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he could eat, he died in their arms.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=556–7[/tpl]
Various stories emerged about Edward’s deathbed wishes; according to one tradition, he requested that his heart be carried to the Holy Land, along with an army to fight the infidels. A more dubious story tells of how he wished for his bones to be carried along on future expeditions against the Scots. Another account of his deathbed scene is more credible; according to one chronicle, Edward gathered around him the earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Aymer de Valence, and Robert Clifford, and charged them with looking after his son Edward. In particular they should make sure that Piers Gaveston was not allowed to return to the country.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=557[/tpl] This wish, however, the son ignored, and had his favourite recalled from exile almost immediately.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|p=377[/tpl] Edward I's body was brought south, and after a lengthy vigil he was buried in Westminster Abbey on 27 October. The new king, Edward II, remained in the north until August, but then abandoned the campaign and headed south.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=246[/tpl] He was crowned king on 25 February 1308.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=179[/tpl]

==Character and assessment==

Physically, Edward was an imposing man; at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) he towered over most of his contemporaries, and hence perhaps his epithet "Longshanks". Edward I by Michael Prestwich states his "Long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman. In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it turned white. features were marred by a drooping left eyelid. His speech, despite a lisp, was said to be persuasive." He also had a reputation for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the king's presence.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=177[/tpl] When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the king erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=552[/tpl] Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=24[/tpl] Despite these frightening character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries considered him an able, even an ideal, king.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=559[/tpl] Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1980|p=41[/tpl] He met contemporary expectations of kingship in his role as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1980|p=37[/tpl] In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.
Modern historians have been more divided in their view of Edward I. Bishop William Stubbs, working in the Whig tradition of historical writing, praised Edward as a king deliberately working towards the goal of a constitutional government. "...the self-regulating action of the body politic", according to Stubbs "was very much the work of Edward."[tpl]Harvnb|Stubbs|1880|p=111[/tpl] Stubbs' student T. F. Tout departed from this view. In Tout's opinion, "Even the parliamentary system grew up in obedience to the royal will. It was no yielding to a people crying for liberty, but the shrewd device of an autocrat, anxious to use the mass of the people as a check upon his hereditary foes among the greater baronage."[tpl]cite book|last=Tout|first=T.F.|authorlink=Thomas Frederick Tout|title=Chapters in the Administrative History of Mediaeval England: The Wardrobe, the Chamber and the Small Seals|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|year=1920|volume=ii|pages=190[/tpl] F. M. Powicke offered a more positive perspective in his extensive work on Edward I in King Henry III and the Lord Edward (1947) and The Thirteenth Century (1953). K. B. McFarlane, on the other hand, criticised Edward's restrictive policy towards his earls, and concluded that "...he belonged less to the future than to the past."[tpl]cite book|first=K.B.|last=McFarlane|authorlink=K. B. McFarlane|title=The Nobility of Later Medieval England|publisher=Hambledon|location=London|year=1981|page=267|isbn=0-9506882-5-8[/tpl]
In 1988, Michael Prestwich released what has been called "...the first scholarly study devoted exclusively to the political career of Edward I."[tpl]cite journal|last=Denton|first=J.H.|year=1989|title=Review: Edward I, by Michael Prestwich|journal=English Historical Review|volume=xcix|pages=981–4|jstor=572793|doi=10.1093/ehr/CIV.413.981|issue=413[/tpl] Prestwich's work, which is considered authoritative,[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=566[/tpl] tries to assess Edward by the standards of his own age, and concludes that his reign was a great one.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=567[/tpl] His contributions to the development of the law, Parliament and a functioning system of taxation, as well as his military exploits, stand out in particular.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=558–65[/tpl] At the same time, he left a legacy of financial difficulties, political distrust and an unresolved situation in Scotland. The roots of the disasters of the reign of Edward II can be found in the reign of Edward I.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=565–6[/tpl] Other contemporary writers have been more willing to criticise Edward for his failings, particularly his severe treatment of the Jews. There is also a great difference between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom.[tpl]Harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=44[/tpl] This view of Edward is reflected in the popular perception of the king, as can be seen in the 1995 movie Braveheart's portrayal of the king as a hard-hearted tyrant.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/30/3|title=Braveheart: dancing peasants, gleaming teeth and a cameo from Fabio|last=Tunzelmann|first=Alex von|date=31 July 2008|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl]

==Name and epithets==

Edward, being an Anglo-Saxon name, was not a common name among the aristocracy of England after the Norman Conquest. Henry III was devoted to the veneration of Edward the Confessor, and for this reason decided to name his firstborn son after the saint. Other Anglo-Saxon kings had included Edward the Elder and Edward the Martyr. Regnal numbers were not commonly used in Edward's time; as the first post-Conquest king to carry that name,[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=xv–xvi[/tpl] he
was referred to simply as "King Edward", "King Edward, son of King Henry", or "King Edward, the first by that name after the Conquest". It was only after the succession of first his son and then his grandson — both of whom bore the same name — that "Edward I" came into common usage.[tpl]cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=David|authorlink=David Carpenter (historian)|year=2007|title=King Henry III and Saint Edward the Confessor: the origins of the cult|journal=English Historical Review|volume=cxxii|pages=865–91|doi=10.1093/ehr/cem214|issue=498[/tpl]
The epithet under which Edward I is best known is probably "Longshanks"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]meaning "long legs" or "long shins"[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]in reference to his tall stature. On 2 May 1774, the Society of Antiquaries opened Edward's tomb in Westminster Abbey. They reported that his body had been well preserved over the preceding 467 years, and measured the king's body to be 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm).[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=566–7[/tpl]. The original report can be found in [tpl]cite journal|last=Ayloffe|first=J.|year=1786|title=An Account of the Body of King Edward the First, as it appeared on opening his Tomb in the year 1774|journal=Archeologia|volume=iii|pages=386, 398–412[/tpl] At this length, he would tower over most of his common contemporaries.[tpl]Harvnb|Carpenter|2003|p=467[/tpl] Another epithet applied to Edward I is "Hammer of the Scots". This comes from the Latin inscription on his tomb, which reads Edwardus Primus Scottorum Malleus hic est, 1308. Pactum Serva ("Here is Edward I, Hammer of the Scots, 1308. Keep the Vow").[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2009|p=378[/tpl] referring to the vow to avenge the rebellion of Robert Bruce This inscription, however, referring to his incessant campaigns against the Scots in the later years of his reign, is from a later date, probably the sixteenth century.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|p=566[/tpl] The seventeenth-century lawyer Edward Coke called Edward the "English Justinian". This was a way of highlighting the king's legislative accomplishments, by comparing him to the renowned Byzantine law-maker Justinian I. Unlike Justinian, Edward did not codify the law, but as William Stubbs pointed out, "if it be meant to denote the importance and permanence of his legislation and the dignity of his position in legal history", the comparison is still a valid one.[tpl]Harvnb|Stubbs|1880|p=114[/tpl]

==Issue==

Eleanor of Castile died on 28 November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other. Moreover, like his father, Edward was very devoted to his wife and was faithful to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night.[tpl]Harvnb|Morris|2008|pp=230–1[/tpl] As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret. The marriage took place in 1299.[tpl]Harvnb|Prestwich|1997|pp=395–6[/tpl]
Edward and Eleanor had at least fourteen children, perhaps as many as sixteen. Of these, five daughters survived into adulthood, but only one boy outlived Edward: the future King Edward II. Edward I was reportedly concerned with his son's failure to live up to the expectations of an heir to the crown, and at one point decided to exile the prince's favourite Piers Gaveston.[tpl]Harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=719[/tpl] 
By Margaret, Edward had two sons, both of whom lived into adulthood, and a daughter who died as a child.The information on Edward's children with Eleanor is based on [tpl]cite journal|last=Parsons|first=John Carmi|year=1984|title=The Year of Eleanor of Castile's Birth and her Children by Edward I|journal=Medieval Studies|volume=XLVI|pages=245–65[/tpl] The Hailes Abbey chronicle indicates that John Botetourt may have been Edward's illegitimate son; however, the claim is unsubstantiated.[tpl]harvnb|Gorski|2004[/tpl]
