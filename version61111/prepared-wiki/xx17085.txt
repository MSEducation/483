CATEGORIES: 1080s BC

The 1080s BC witnessed the early years of the Iron Age. Many of the great powers of the High Bronze Age in the Western Mediterranean had either collapsed or been severely weakened. It was during this time that previously minor powers, those being the Assyrian empire based in Mesopotamia and the Israelites and Phoenicians based in the Levant, began to emerge.
