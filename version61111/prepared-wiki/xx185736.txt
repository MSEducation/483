On October 29, 2007, the tour bus for Decapitated was involved in an accident with a truck carrying wood in Gomel, on the Russia/Belarus border. Both Witold Kieltyka (also known as Vitek) and Adrian Kowanek were seriously injured. While it was initially believed that they were taken to Moscow to be treated after treatment at a local hospital, it was later confirmed that they were only taken to be treated in Novozybkov, where they have remained for the time being. On November 2, 2007, Vitek died from his injuries from the accident. He was 23 years old. Covan has since shown slow but progressive signs of improvement.Decapitated Drummer Dead at 23 - News @ metalunderground.com Covan's family released a short update in October 2008 concerning his improving condition.Decapitated - Singer Recovering: News @ metalstorm.ee
