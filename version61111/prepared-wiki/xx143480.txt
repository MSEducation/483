[[Optical black hole]]

CATEGORIES: Black holes

An optical black hole is a phenomenon in which slow light is passed through a Bose–Einstein condensate that is itself spinning faster than the local speed of light within to create a vortex capable of trapping the light behind an event horizon just as a gravitational black hole would.[tpl]cite web|last=Saswato|first=Das|title=Physicists Make Artificial Black Hole Using Optical Fiber|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/astrophysics/physicists-make-artificial-black-hole-using-optical-fiber|work=Aerospace|accessdate=5/4/12[/tpl]
Unlike other black hole analogs such as a sonic black hole in a Bose–Einstein condensate, a slow light black hole analog is not expected to mimic the quantum effects of a black hole, and thus not emit Hawking radiation. It does, however, mimic the classical properties of a gravitational black hole, making it potentially useful in studying other properties of black holes.W.G. Unruh and R. Schützhold, "On Slow Light as a Black Hole Analogue", Phys. Rev. D 68, 024008 arXiv:gr-qc/0303028v2 (2003). More recently, some physicists have developed a fiber optic based system which they believe will emit Hawking radiation.T. G. Philbin et al., Science 319, 1367 arXiv:0711.4796v2 gr-qc (2008)
