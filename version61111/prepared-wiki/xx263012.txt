==The Jan Jansen name==

Due to Jan’s heavy Danish accent, there have been found to be many misspellings of his name in public records.  Some of these include: Jan H. Jansen, John Johnson, Jan Johnson, and Yon Yonson.
Jan eventually “Americanized” the pronunciation of his name, replacing the heavily Danish accented “Y” sounding “J” (i.e. Yon Yonson) with the typical American “J” sound in Jan Jansen.
