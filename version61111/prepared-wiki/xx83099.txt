[[Communist League (Canada)]]

CATEGORIES: Political parties established in 1977, Communist parties in Canada

The Communist League  in Canada was founded as the "Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire" (RWL) in 1977 as the result of a merger of the League for Socialist Action (LSA), the Revolutionary Marxist Group (RMG) and the Groupe Marxiste Revolutionaire.http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.secondwave/announceccl.html
Originally a Trotskyist party, the RWL was the Canadian section of the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI). The group followed the US Socialist Workers Party's (SWP) trajectory away from Trotskyism in favour of a view of Fidel Castro's Cuba as the vanguard of world revolution[tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2011[/tpl]. The RWL purged members who did not support the new orientation [tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2011[/tpl], many of whom went on to form Socialist Challenge and Gauche Socialiste.
In the late 1980s, the RWL left the USFI to become part of the new Pathfinder tendency based around the SWP. It changed its name to the Communist League in 1990. The new group ceased publication of the English Socialist Voice in favour of selling The Militant, published in New York City by the SWP.
Michel Prairie is the group's general secretary and primary spokesperson.
In early 2004, two former activists in the group left the CL over a dispute regarding protests against the US invasion of Iraq, and started Socialist Voice, taking the name of the RWL's old newspaper.
The CL operates a Pathfinder Bookstore in Montreal.http://www.themilitant.com/direct.shtml#3
The Communist League should not be confused with the Young Communist League which is youth wing of the Communist Party of Canada and is Marxist-Leninist.
