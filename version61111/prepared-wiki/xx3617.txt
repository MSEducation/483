[[Demographics of Haiti]]

CATEGORIES: Demographics of Haiti

Although Haiti averages approximately 255 people per square kilometer (650 per sq. mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. The nation is multi-ethnic, home to peoples of different races and ethnic groups. About 70-75% of Haitians are of predominantly African  descent.CIA - The World Factbook -- Haiti[tpl]failed verification|date=March 2011[/tpl] The remainder of the population is primarily mulattoes, Europeans, Asians and Arabs. Hispanic residents in Haiti are mostly Cuban and Dominican.  About two thirds of the Haitian population live in rural areas.
Although there was a national census taken in Haiti in 2003, much of that data has not been released to the public. Several demographic studies, including those by social work researcher Athena Kolbe, have shed light on the current status of urban residents. In 2006, households averaged 4.5 members. The median age was 25 years with a mean average age of 27 years. People aged 15 and younger counted for roughly a third of the population. Overall, 52.7 percent of the population was female.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kolbe|first=Athena R.|coauthors=Royce A.

==Vital statistics==

Registration of vital events is in Haiti not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.

Disasters often cause human populations to increase long term, rather than decrease, by way of increased fertility exceeding the deaths caused by the initial disaster, as shell-shocked mothers replace every lost child with more than needed.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] In Haiti's case, the fertility rate nearly tripled after the quake, and is likely to remain elevated (above pre-quake levels) for long after.http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20101022/news/news1.html

==Languages==

Taíno was the major pre-Columbian language in the region now known as Haiti. One of the country's official languages is Haitian Creole, a French-based creole with African influences, as well as minor Spanish and Taíno influences. French is the other official language. Spanish, though not official, is spoken by a growing amount of the population, and is spoken more frequently near the border with the Dominican Republic. English is increasingly spoken among the young and in the business sector.

==Religion==

The state religion is Roman Catholicism which 80-85% of the population professes. 15-20% of Haitians practice Protestantism. A percentage of the population practice Vodou. A small population also practice Islam.

==Education==

Although public education is free, private and parochial schools provide around 75% of educational programs offered. Less than 65% of children of primary school age are actually enrolled. At the secondary level, the figure drops to 55%. Of those enrolled in primary school, 63% will complete it. On average, it takes 16 years to produce a single graduate of the 6-year cycle.[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2009[/tpl] Though Haitians place a high value on education,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] few can afford to send their children to secondary school.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl] Remittances sent by Haitians living abroad are important in paying educational costs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
In the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, home to 2.21 million of Haiti's 8.5 million people,  23 percent of adults have completed secondary school with 16 percent passing the state graduation exam. More than half (53.5 percent) of children aged 5–17 do not attend school.

==Labor==

In 2004, 300,000 children were restavecs, which are somewhat like indentured service for minors. This was done by their parents in order that the children would be fed.[tpl]cite web | last = Cohen | first = Gigi | date = 2004-03-24 | title = Haiti's Dark secret:The Restavecs | publisher = National Public Radio | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1779562 [/tpl]

==Emigration==

Large-scale emigration, principally to the United States, and Canada (predominantly to Quebec, with other areas of the country) - but also to Cuba, other areas of Europe and the Americas (like Argentina) such as France (with French Guiana), Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Ireland; and Venezuela, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other Caribbean neighbors - has created what Haitians refer to as the Eleventh Department or the Diaspora. About one of every six Haitians live abroad.
