==Biography==

Kayira was born in Mpale, a village in Nyasaland (now Malawi); the precise date was not recorded. Soon after his birth, his mother threw him into the Didimu River as she could not afford to feed him. He was rescued and acquired the name "Didimu". He himself added the English-sounding name "Legson" when he was in school. At the age of sixteen, he decided that the only away to achieve a college degree was to go to the US, and he set out on foot to do so. When he reached Kampala in Uganda he saw the name of Skagit Valley College, Washington State, in a US Information service directory, so he applied and was awarded a place and a scholarship."Destination: Skagit Valley", Time Magazine, 19 December 1960, p. 60. Kayira then embarked on a journey of over 3000 kilometres and walked to Khartoum, where he obtained a visa, and people from Skagit Valley raised the money to bring him over to Washington. He arrived at Skagit Valley two years after setting out. He went on to become a graduate student at Cambridge University, and subsequently a probation officer and the author of several novels."Legson Kayira", themodernnovel.com
His autobiography, I Will Try, was on the New York Times bestseller list for 16 weeks after its publication in 1965.Carol Forsloff, "Great Loss to Africa, Remembering Legson Kayira of Malawi", Digital Journal, 28 March 2009.
