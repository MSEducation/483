Steve Georgallis (born 17 June 1968) is an Australian professional rugby league football coach and former player. Appointed as the Penrith Panthers head coach part-way through the 2011 NRL season, he played during the 1990s in Sydney for the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, Western Suburbs Magpies and Wests Tigers, as well as in England for Carlisle, Wakefield Trinity, and Warrington Wolves. Georgallis played 264 first grade games in total.

==Playing career==

Georgallis made his debut with the Roosters in 1989 playing halfback.[tpl]cite web |title=Steve Georgallis at RLP |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/Steve_Georgallis/summary.html|accessdate=19 January 2010 | publisher=Rugby League Project[/tpl] Over the 4 seasons with the club he had spells playing at five-eighth, fullback and centre without being able to cement a position, making only 38 appearances.
Joining the Magpies in 1993, he proved just as adaptable, and was a cornerstone of the team for 7 seasons, playing in 148 games. During this time he also spent an off-season in England playing for Wakefield Trinity. By 1999, Georgallis had started making appearances at lock, and was captaining the struggling Magpies. He played a season mostly from the bench for the Wests Tigers after the merger with Balmain. He was cheered from the field at the completion of his last Australian game.[tpl]cite news|publisher=This is Cheshire|title=WOLVES HOOK INTO GEORGALLIS |author= Mike Parsons |url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2000/11/20/216899.html|accessdate=19 January 2010|date=20 November 2000[/tpl]
In 2001, Georgallis joined the Warrington Wolves for a season. Wolves' coach Darryl Van de Velde said at the time, "He knows what Rugby League's all about. He is very strong, has good hands and is always busy on the field." Unfortunately, Georgallis only lasted 6 games before the end of his professional career, though he did make later appearances as captain of Greece.

==Coaching==

In 2008 Georgallis was the coach of the Penrith Panthers' National Youth Competition under-20s team.[tpl]cite news|author=Christian Nicolussi, Dean Ritchie and Josh Massoud|publisher=The Herald Sun|title=Pritchard's threat to quit |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sport/nrl/story/0,21985,24247300-14823,00.html |accessdate=2008-08-31|date=2008-08-27[/tpl] He has also coached the Greece national rugby league team.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Greek City|title=Malta and Greece Name Starting 17 |url=http://www.greekcity.com.au/content/content.cfm?id=1543 |accessdate=2008-08-31[/tpl]  Georgallis coached Greece in the 2009 Australian Mediterranean Shield.

On 20 June 2011, it was announced Georgallis would take over as interim Penrith Panthers coach following the resignation of Matt Elliott. He had success immediately with the Panthers winning 30-20 Against the North Queensland Cowboys.
