Mercer served five years in the United States Army, which included two tours of Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

==Early life==

Mercer was born and raised by a single mother in Cleveland, Ohio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.georgiawrestlinghistory.com/articles/0002.html|title=Tommy Mercer Aims for the Pinnacle|last=Goodman|first=Larry|date=2010-06-09|work=Georgia Wrestling History|accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl] He attended North Ridgeville High School, where he played football and basketball, but wasn't able to continue to pursue a career in either of them without an athletic scholarship. After graduation Mercer joined the United States Army in order to fund his college studies. He ended up serving for five years, which included two tours of Iraq in the 101st Airborne Division as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

==Professional wrestling career==

During his second tour of Iraq, Mercer decided to pursue a career in professional wrestling and upon his return to the United States, entered the NWA Main Event wrestling school in Clarksville, Tennessee, where he was trained by Jeff Daniels. He would make his professional wrestling debut in 2007, working for independent promotions in Nashville, Tennessee. He would eventually make his debut also for NWA Main Event, starting a storyline rivalry with his trainer Jeff Daniels. On June 3, 2010, Mercer won his first professional wrestling championship, when he defeated Matt Boyce for the NWA Mid-American Television Championship.
On October 10, 2009, Mercer wrestled in a six–way pre-show match at a Ring of Honor (ROH) event in Indianapolis, Indiana.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/store.php?sec=prod&prod=238|title=Survival of the Fittest 2009- Indianapolis, IN 10/10/09 (DVD)|work=Ring of Honor|accessdate=2011-01-01[/tpl]

This led to Mercer's second match in USWO, a tag team match on August 7, where Daniels and The Convict defeated Mercer and Scott Hayes, following interference from Dominique. Mercer's rivalry with Daniels culminated in two singles matches in September, which were both won by Mercer. On November 6, Mercer defeated Chris Michaels to win the ATL Southern Championship. On November 20, Mercer wrestled SAW International Champion Kid Kash in a title vs. title match, which ended in a disqualification; as a result, both men kept their respective titles.
