</ref> Davies reveals in his non-fiction book ''[[Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale]]'' that Martha was also intended to appear in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' series two finale ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]'' in December 2008, but the character had to be replaced with classic series character [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] ([[Nicholas Courtney]]) "at the last minute" due to Agyeman's role in ''Law & Order: UK'';<ref name="medium is not enough"/> had Martha appeared, the character would have appeared in all three programmes in the franchise.

==Analyses==

Academic analyses of the character typically focus on the character's ethnicity, her social class (middle), and her status as a role model to young viewers. Martha has been described in newspaper reports as the "first ethnic-minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who" or the Doctor's "first black assistant" (Agyeman herself was born to Ghanaian and Iranian parents.) Martha's status as "first black companion" is "thrown into dispute" by consideration of Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and his companion role in the 2006 series.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title="Sociopathetic Abscess" or "Yawning Chasm"? The Absent Postcolonial Transition in Doctor Who|last=Orthia|first=Lindy A.|year=2010|volume=45|issue=2|pages=207–225[/tpl] In her introduction, Martha is represented as being 'normal' in ways previous Doctor Who companions were not. For example, she becomes the first character to use (light) swear words when she exclaims "We're on the bloody moon!" Davies felt that this level of swearing was both normal and appropriate, citing a Harry Potter film in which the young audience reacted with laughter rather than shock when a young character cursed  "Bloody hell".[ref]Carr, Jennifer; Whitelegg, Elizabeth; Holliman, Richard; Scanlon, Eileen and Hodgson, Barbara (2009).

engineering and mathematics." UKRC, Bradford, UK. http://oro.open.ac.uk/12008/1/Research_Report_9_Invisible_Witnesses.pdf[/ref] In some instances, Martha's status as a middle-class woman distinguish her from earlier black companion Mickey Smith, who is male and, like Rose Tyler, working-class. Articles which focus on Martha's race normally attempt to make distinctions between Martha's social status and that of Mickey, and to what extent race or class do or do not play a part.

===Racial issues===

In contrast to Rose and Mickey, Martha is middle-class and university-educated; for Michael and Margaret Rustin of the University of East London, Mickey's constant struggle for respect and recognition from the Doctor in the first two series was a "subtle exploration ... of the dynamics of multi-ethnic life in contemporary Britain". The Rustins argue that in introducing Martha the series "catches hold" of the fact "that black women have in general been more successful educationally and professionally than black men in contemporary Britain."[tpl]cite book|last1=Rustin|last2=Rustin|first1=Michael|first2=Margaret|chapterurl=http://dspace.uel.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/10552%20/311/1/Rustin,M.%282008%29Childrens%20Literature%20Annual%202%20142-159.pdf|chapter=The Regeneration of Doctor Who|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hertfordshire|work=Children’s Literature Annual No 2 The Story and the Self: Some Psychoanalytic Perspectives|editor=Plastow, J|title=Children’s Literature Annual No 2 The Story and the Self: Some Psychoanalytic Perspectives|isbn=978-1-905313-52-5|year=2008|pages=142–159[/tpl] As a black time traveller, the series' writers have used the character's presence as a means of injecting social commentary, tackling social issues such as racism in both bygone eras as well as the present day.
As a black time traveller, the character of Martha allows Doctor Who to explore historical issues concerning race. In the episode "The Shakespeare Code", Martha wonders if she is safe in an era before emancipation, but the Doctor is blasé. The Doctor points out to Martha (also the audience surrogate) that England in 1599 is "not so different from your time"; black women are seen walking amongst the crowd at home and safe, and Martha identifies several cross-dressing actors. Martha soon reacts with surprise and possible offence to William Shakespeare's use of Elizabethan terms for black people such as "blackamoor" and "ethiop". For a moment, she thinks these terms could be racist (the Doctor quips that it is "political correctness gone mad"), but realises Shakespeare is actually enamoured of her. At the end of the episode, he calls her his "Dark Lady", the name given to the woman the real Shakespeare referred to in a number of Shakespeare's sonnets;Sonnets CXXVII-CLIV by implication, Martha is the Dark Lady.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/665968__909654527.pdf|title="Author! Author!": Shakespeare and biography|accessdate=2 July 2010|journal=Shakespeare|volume=5|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1080/17450910902764454|year=2009|last=Holderness|first=Graham|publisher=Routledge[/tpl] Lindy A. Orthia opines that such Tenth Doctor era representations of "Earth’s past as a place of happy and benign diversity" may be anti-racist in intention, but ultimately trivialise the racism that has infested Western society for centuries. Such representations include visions of "Depression-era New York containing mixed-race shanty towns led by a black man ("Daleks in Manhattan"), while black women populate the streets and royal courts of Victorian England and Enlightenment France".
Other episodes such as "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", set in 1913, depict the racism of an earlier era (Edwardian era). For Orthia, the few Doctor Who serials that explicitly depict racism "are remarkable by their presence: they carry rhetorical power because they are so rare in Doctor Who." In "Human Nature", in addition to the racist jibes of private school boys, "we bear witness to how things have changed, when a white nurse refuses to believe that Martha is a medical student in the future, saying, "Women might train to be doctors, but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour."" When the TARDIS crew are nationally branded as terrorists in "The Sound of Drums", the Master (Simm) says that the Doctor's current companions "tick every demographic box" – referring to Martha's gender and ethnicity and Jack's sexual orientation. He later refers to Jack (Barrowman) and Martha as "the girlie and the freak", adding to the insult by claiming he is not sure which is which. Episodes set in the future, Orthia notes, are more often than not inclusive and "cosmopolitan" projections of societies which are as multi-racial (though not multi-ethnic) and sexually liberal as the present, if not more so. In 2009, Martha was listed among the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons by Entertainment Weekly.[tpl]cite web|first=Mark|last=Bernardin|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20253166,00.html#20567780|title=20 Black Sci-Fi Icons: Martha Jones|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=18 March 2012[/tpl]

===Female role model===

As a young medical professional, Martha has into the focus of studies which discuss young girls' perceptions of "gendered representations of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)". Through questionnaires, researchers for The UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering Technology asked Key Stage 3, KS4 and KS5-age students to "identify three of their favourite television programmes and to try and recall, and describe, a television programme they had watched that was about science or included a scientist." The researchers narrowed down these selections to just two programmes which "feature within the favourite programmes for both boys and girls... The Simpsons (Channel 4) and Doctor Who (BBC)." The research was further analysed "the representation of STEM-related topics" through the programme's two prominent, respective, female characters: Lisa Simpson (Yeardley Smith) and Martha Jones; these characters were selected in light of Steinke. et al.'s suggestion that "presenting positive televised images of women scientists may be a particularly effective strategy for providing role models to promote girls’ interest in science, particularly when direct interaction with human role models is not possible". The article points out that Martha and Lisa are quite different: primarily, "Lisa is represented as
being different from many of her peers... a ‘child genius’... considered to be
‘extraordinary’", whereas Martha "is represented as being a comparatively ‘normal’ young woman", who unlike Lisa invites self-identification. Martha's attempts to diagnose a patient in her debut episode is criticised as faulty; it is her "responses to the extraordinary situations that she later finds herself in, rather than her everyday life" which distinguish Martha. Her "normal" status is also highlighted when she becomes the first character "to be heard swearing" in Doctor Who. In spite of their differences, however, many commonalities were brought to light by the research.
Importantly, Lisa and Martha are both represented as characters who, rather than lack social skills, play "a central role within their families’ relationships" (David X. Cohen describes Lisa as "the heart of the family", Davies describes Martha as a "sort of peace-maker within her family"); "Martha’s family," the article says, "and her relationships with them, are part of the narrative that runs throughout the series", who are her constant despite the time travel aspect of the series. "However fantastic and ‘unreal’ the experiences of Martha and Lisa might be, their characters are always situated within a set of family relationships that most viewers would recognise as being fairly commonplace." Whereas in The Simpsons, Lisa is the character most identified with knowledge and worldliness, in Doctor Who that character is the Doctor. The power relationship this affords the Doctor and Martha is challenged, in Martha's favour, for the first time in "42", when an alien possession leaves the Doctor "scared"; according to Agyeman, Martha "has to take control". This independence is continued in "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", of which Davies says "Martha is left facing the monsters alone. The whole story wouldn’t work if the Doctor didn’t trust Martha". Martha also is asked to save the world singlehandedly in "The Sound of Drums"/"Last of the Time Lords". When Martha next appears in Torchwood, as a UNIT officer and qualified M.D., "the audience has been able to follow Martha’s
career and watch her gain in both expertise and confidence." In their summary, the researchers concluded: "In discussing our analysis of Simpson and Martha Jones we have highlighted ways in which they could be viewed both as characters with which young people can identify, but also as characters that provide positive role models in terms of their relationship to STEM.
