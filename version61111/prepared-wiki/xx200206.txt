He is a Melbourne Cup winning trainer who relocated to Singapore from Melbourne in 1999. Meagher trained What A Nuisance to a win in the 1985 Melbourne Cup. Ridden by Pat Hyland and owned by Lloyd Williams the win was particularly memorable for the attendance of Prince Charles and Lady Diana who presented the winning connections with the famous trophy. It was also the first Melbourne Cup to offer $1,000,000 in prize money.
