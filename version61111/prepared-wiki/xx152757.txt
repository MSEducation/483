[[Racecourse-class minesweeper]]

CATEGORIES: Racecourse-class minesweepers, Mine warfare vessel classes

The Racecourse class minesweepers were 32 ships delivered to the Royal Navy during the First World War. They were built to two related designs as paddlewheel coastal minesweeping sloops under the Emergency War Programme. The vessels were reasonable sea-boats, but lost speed badly in a seaway when the paddle boxes tended to become choked with water. The class is also widely referred to as the ''Ascot'' class and Improved ''Ascot'' class.

==Initial design==

The original design was by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company. The ships were completed between April and October 1916. Launch dates are shown below.
On this type the foremast is stepped before the fore bridges and have derricks abeam of the second funnel.

==Improved Racecourse type==

These paddle minesweepers were designed by the Admiralty, adapted from the Ailsa Company design for the first type. They were completed between January and June 1918. All were built under the Emergency War Programme.
The foremast on this type is stepped through the chart house, there are two high ventilators abaft fore funnel and no derricks abeam of the second funnel.
