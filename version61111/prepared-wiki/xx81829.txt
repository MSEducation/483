====New Zealand====

The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, which will come into force on 19 August 2013, will allow same-sex marriage and permit married same-sex couples to jointly adopt children. Previously, an LGBT individual was able to adopt children, but same-sex couples could not adopt jointly.[tpl]cite news |first=Isaac |last=Davidson |title=Marriage bill leaves a few inequalities to sort out |date=20 April 2013 |newspaper=New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10878614 |accessdate=20 April 2013[/tpl]
In New Zealand, preliminary New Zealand Law Commission reports and white papers had previously raised the issue, while Metiria Turei, a Green Party List MP raised the issue in late May 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] In February 2005, the Greens suggested that an adoption law reform clause should be added to the Relationships (Statutory References) Act 2005, which equalized heterosexual, lesbian and gay spousal status in New Zealand law and regulatory policy except for adoption. However, this was ultimately rendered irrelevant by the advent of same-sex marriage in New Zealand on 17 April 2013. As a consequence of this legislation, married same-sex couples will also be able to become adoptive parents. An additional Adoption Reform Bill seeks to extend such rights to civil unions in New Zealand and de facto couples.

In Argentina, Brazil, French Guiana, and Uruguay same-sex couples can jointly adopt. A government-sponspored adoption law in Uruguay allowing LGBT adoption was approved by the lower house on 28 August 2009, and by the Senate on 9 September 2009. In October 2009, the law was signed by President and took effect. According to Equipos Mori Poll's, 53% of Uruguayans are opposed to same sex adoption against 39% that support it. Interconsult's Poll made in 2008 says that 49% are opposed to same sex adoption against 35% that support it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25992606-5005961,00.html|title=Uruguay votes to allow gay adoptions|date=28 August 2009|publisher=Melbourne Herald Sun|accessdate=27 August 2009[/tpl]
