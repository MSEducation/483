[[Mam Midrina Lalo Midir]]

CATEGORIES: Amhara Region, Districts of Ethiopia

Mam Midrina Lalo Midir (Amharic "Mam-land and Lalo-land") was one of the 105 woredas in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. It was named in part after the central and southern districts of the former province of Menz, Mama Meder and Lalo Meder. Located at the eastern edge of the Ethiopian highlands in the Semien Shewa Zone, Mam Midrina Lalo Midir was bordered on the south by Termaber, on the west and north by Gera Midirna Keya Gebriel, on the northeast by Efratana Gidim, and on the east by Kewet. The administrative center of this woreda was Molale; other towns in Mam Midrina Lalo Midir include Midwegere. Mam Midrina Lalo Midir was divided for Menz Mam Midir and Menz Lalo Midir woredas.

==Overview==

The topography of this woreda has been described as consisting of 40% plains, 50% undulating hills, and 10% steep hills and cliffs. Although it has six primary schools, they were not built to minimum standards or quality. The woreda has perennial springs with the potential for human, animal and small-scale agricultural use; however, these springs are not protected which make human beings and animals liable to water borne diseases. Lastly, a lack of roads and bridges hinder the movement of the local inhabitants."Operational Areas" (Agri-Service Ethiopia)
This woreda was selected as one of the three areas for Agri-Service Ethiopia to implement an Integrated Rural Development Program. This Program operates in 10 kebeles, which cover 30% of the woreda's area. The Program's goals include improving agricultural practices by addressing the degraded crop lands, improving rural water sources, and improving the health and sanitation status of the inhabitants as well as reducing child mortality by 25% by the end of 2002 in the targeted kebeles. Improvements to the local infrastructure were made, most notably by the construction of two light bridges in June 2002."ASE News" (Agri-Service Ethiopia)
