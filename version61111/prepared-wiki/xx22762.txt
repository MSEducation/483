[[1930 FIFA World Cup]]

CATEGORIES: 1930 FIFA World Cup, FIFA World Cup tournaments, International football (soccer) competitions hosted by Uruguay, 1930 in South American football, 1930 in Uruguayan football

The 1930 FIFA World Cup was the inaugural FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national association football teams. It took place in Uruguay from 13 July to 30 July 1930. FIFA, football's international governing body, selected Uruguay as host nation, as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its first constitution, and the Uruguay national football team had successfully retained their football title at the 1928 Summer Olympics. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.
Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate because of the difficulty of travelling to South America. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0, respectively. Lucien Laurent of France scored the first goal in World Cup history, while American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas posted the first official "clean sheet" in the tournament.
Argentina, Uruguay, United States and Yugoslavia each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 93,000 people, and became the first nation to win the World Cup.

==Host selection==

Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain and Uruguay all lodged applications to host the event.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa4.html |title=History of FIFA – The first FIFA World Cup |work=FIFA |accessdate=1 December 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/history/newsid_1632000/1632201.stm |title=World Cup History – Uruguay 1930 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=11 April 2002 |accessdate=14 June 2009 [/tpl] Uruguay's bid became the clear favourite for a number of reasons. Uruguay were reigning Olympic champions, and thus de facto world champions, the bid included plans to build a new stadium as a centrepiece, and the Uruguayan authorities also offered to refund the expenses of all participants.Crouch, pp. 2–3 The other nations withdrew their bids,[tpl]cite book |last=Freddi |first=Cris |title=Complete Book of the World Cup 2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-722916-X |page=1 [/tpl] and Uruguay was chosen to host the tournament at a FIFA congress at Barcelona in 1929.Goldblatt (2008), p. 248 A golden trophy known as "The Goddess of Victory" was commissioned from French sculptor Abel Lafleur.

==Participants==

The first World Cup was the only one without qualification. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the United States all entered. A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players, very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[tpl]cite book |last=Hunt |first=Chris |title=World Cup Stories: The History of the FIFA World Cup |publisher=Interact |year=2006 |location=Ware |isbn=978-0-9549819-2-1 |page=10 [/tpl] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to the Football Association, even though the Home Nations were not members of FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BigRead/0,,11442~1034860,00.html |title=Uruguay 1930 |work=Fourfourtwo magazine |accessdate=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070819173027/http://www.fourfourtwo.premiumtv.co.uk/page/BigRead/0,,11442~1034860,00.html |archivedate=20 June 2009 [/tpl] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060426212450/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/1930.html |archivedate=26 April 2006 |title=FIFA World Cup – Classic Moments from FIFA World Cup History |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2009 [/tpl]
FIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.Seddon, pp. 8–9 The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.  The Belgians participated at the instigation of FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.Goldblatt (2008), p. 249

The Romanians boarded the [tpl]SS|Conte Verde[/tpl] at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/overview.html |title=1930 FIFA World Cup Uruguay |work=FIFA |accessdate=15 June 2009 [/tpl] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[tpl]cite news |url=http://archivo.marca.com/mundial2006/historia/1930.html |title=Uruguay, allí nació la historia |work=Marca.com Archive |publisher=Marca.com |language=Spanish |accessdate=14 June 2009 |last=Lara |first=Miguel A |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hbsQrAJo |archivedate=17 June 2009 |deadurl=no [/tpl] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.
In Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I didn't want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). 
Therefore the Yugoslavia team was made only exclusively of Serbian players; and with two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanović "Moša" and Aleksandar Tirnanić "Tirke" (both from BSK), they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia on the world cup. 
The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the world cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname "The Ich-es" or "Ichachos" (in spa.) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the "-ić" or "-vić" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. In the end of the world cup, they achieved the biggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian football history, by earning the third place (according to their sources).http://montevideoproject.com/srpski/?page_id=192[ref]http://montevideoproject.com/srpski/?p=220

==Venues==

All matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[tpl]cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8 |page=248 [/tpl] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a "temple of football".[tpl]cite book |last1=Dunning |first1=Eric |last2=Malcolm |first2=Dominic |title=Sport |page=46 |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-415-26292-7 [/tpl] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles. The stadium hosted 10 of the 18 matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.Glanville, p. 16 Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Peñarol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.

==Match officials==

Fifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans – a Frenchman, a Romanian (Constantin Rădulescu being the Romanian coach),[tpl]cite web |url=http://es.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mencompwc/01/17/75/48/s25factsyouneedtoknowaboutthefifaworldcup_10-00556_104_en_es.pdf |title=25 datos sobre la Copa Mundial de la FIFA |format=PDF | accessdate=20 August 2011 [/tpl] two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus) and eleven from the Americas – among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting in which to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[tpl]wayback |df=yes|url=http://www.elfutbolmundial.com.ar/uruguay30.html |title=I Campeonato "Uruguay 1930" |date=20071123060848 [/tpl]
Of all the refereeing appointments the two that attracted most attention was that of Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew up six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6–3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia, awarded three penalties.
The following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only used as linesmen during the tournament.

==Format==

The thirteen teams were drawn into four groups, with group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing only three.  Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw.  If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would have been used to decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra-time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.

==Draw==

Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil and the USA were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[tpl]cite book |last=Glanville |first=Brian |title=The Story of the World Cup |page=17 |publisher=Faber |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-571-22944-4 [/tpl] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_10e_fwcdraw-history_8842.pdf |title=History of the World Cup draw |work=FIFA |accessdate=14 June 2009 [/tpl]
Since there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4–1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3–0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[tpl]cite news |title=Lucien Laurent: The World Cup's First Goal Scorer |work=CBC Sports |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/history/events/laurent_lucien.html |accessdate=7 May 2007 |last=Molinaro |first=John F [/tpl]

==Tournament summary==

===Group 1===

The first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Thépot had to leave the field after 20 minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[tpl]cite book |last=Freddi |first=Cris |title=Complete Book of the World Cup 2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=0-00-722916-X |page=3 [/tpl] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rêgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.Glanville, p. 18 Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.Crouch, p. 6
France's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the tournament and World Cup history. The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alexis 'Alex' Thépot of France on 19 July 1930, at the 30th minute of the match against Chile’s Carlos Vidal.
===Group 2===

The second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2–1 to Yugoslavia.Glanville, p. 19 Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling "Viva Uruguay" as the team lined up. Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle. Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.Freddi, p. 5 Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1–0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.Freddi, p. 6 Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.

===Group 3===

Hosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plácido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3–1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.Freddi, p. 7
Because of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrés Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.Freddi, p. 8 One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0.Almeida, p. 125 Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[tpl]cite web | author=Jaime Pulgar-Vidal Otálora | title= Peru en El Mundial del 30| publisher= Jaimepulgarvidal.blogspot.com | url=http://jaimepulgarvidal.blogspot.com/2007/02/peru-en-el-mundial-del-30.html | date=24 February 2007| accessdate=21 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HkG7EIve|archivedate=2013-06-29|deadurl=no[/tpl] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru. Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.

===Group 4===

The United States dominated the fourth group. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed "the shot-putters" by an unnamed source in the French contingent. They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3–0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that "the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts".[tpl]cite book |last=Almeida |first=Rony J. |title=Where It All Began |page=91 |publisher=Lulu |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4116-7906-1 [/tpl] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside. The group's second match, played in windy conditions,Freddi, p. 9 witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stábile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid=107499.html |title=American Bert Patenaude credited with first hat trick in FIFA World Cup history |work=FIFA |accessdate=19 June 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30f-hattrick.html |title=The first World Cup hat trick |work=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |accessdate=3 December 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091104223953/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30f-hattrick.html| archivedate= 4 November 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1–0 margin.

===Semi-finals===

The four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch.  The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent. A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1–0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6–1 to Argentina.
In the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinović. Uruguay then took a 2–1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision. The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6–1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.

===Third and fourth place===

The now-traditional third place playoff was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3–1 by Yugoslavia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30full.html |title=World Cup 1930 finals |work=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) |accessdate=14 June 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090602224814/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30full.html| archivedate= 2 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.Jawad, Hyder (2009); Four Weeks In Montevideo: The Story of World Cup 1930, (Seventeen Media & Publishing), p. 105
At the end of the championship, the captains of the team USA (Tom Florie)Florie medal - Where the Legend Began and Yugoslavia (Blagoje Marjanović)Marjanović medal - Sačuvana medalja Moše Marjanovića have both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth,[tpl]cite book |chapter=Permanent Table |chapterurl=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/technicaldevp/50/09/00/fwc%5fmexico%5f1986%5fen%5fpart4%5f279.pdf#page=45 |title=FIFA World Cup México '86 – Technical Report |author=FIFA technical committee |year=1986 |page=230 |accessdate=11 July 2010 [/tpl] a practice since continued by FIFA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/awards/index.html |title=Final Tournament Standings |publisher=FIFA |work=1930 FIFA World Cup Uruguay |accessdate=11 October 2009 [/tpl] In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Sport/sportske-price/Medalja-iz-doma-Hadzijevih-svedochi-da-smo-bili-treci-na-Mundijalu.sr.html |language=Serbian |title=Медаља из дома Хаџијевих сведочи да смо били трећи на Мундијалу |publisher=Politika |accessdate=1 May 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100503051629/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Sport/sportske-price/Medalja-iz-doma-Hadzijevih-svedochi-da-smo-bili-treci-na-Mundijalu.sr.html| archivedate= 3 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/194796/Jos-uvek-sjaji-bronza-iz-Montevidea |language=Serbian |title=Još uvek sjaji bronza iz Montevidea |publisher=Blic |accessdate=25 May 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100623154744/http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Reportaza/194796/Jos-uvek-sjaji-bronza-iz-Montevidea| archivedate= 23 June 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Final===

The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2–1 after a replay.
The final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.Goldblatt, p. 250 At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.Freddi, p. 11 The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf |title=FIFA World Cup Origin |format=PDF |work=FIFA |accessdate=17 November 2009 [/tpl] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.Crouch, p. 11. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.Glanville, p. 20 One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.Goldblatt, p. 251
The hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.Freddi, p. 12. Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised. Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stábile gave Argentina a 2–1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stábile was offside, but to no avail. In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3–1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser. Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4–2 to seal the win. Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Raúl Jude.Freddi, p. 13. The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.Glanville, p. 21 Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ole.com.ar/boca-juniors/gol-luto_0_326367514.html |title=El gol está de luto |newspaper=Olé |language=Spanish |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2010 [/tpl]

Uruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.
