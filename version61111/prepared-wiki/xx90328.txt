The Yellow and Black Attack is the first release from the Christian metal band Stryper. No singles were released from this six-song EP, and fewer than 20,000 copies were pressed, as their label, Enigma Records, was unsure of the potential market for Christian metal. CCM Magazine was slightly critical, citing production quality and the short length of the release, but commented that "Stryper has the promise of a major success story."
After Stryper achieved major success with their debut full-length album, Soldiers Under Command, The Yellow and Black Attack EP was reissued. Re-released on August 10, 1986 with two additional songs, "Reason for the Season" (which was originally released on a 1985 Christmas-themed 12" single with "Winter Wonderland") and a new, mellowed-down version of "My Love I'll Always Show", which dates from their Roxx Regime days. The version recorded for The Yellow and Black Attack featured less obvious Christian lyrics than the one to feature on The Roxx Regime Demos.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
