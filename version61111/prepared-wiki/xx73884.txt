Joanna ignored them. Soon after, she went into labour and died two days after giving birth. The king was very upset with the death of Joanna. Her heart was buried in the convent of the Cordeliers Convent and her entrails in the royal necropolis of the Couvent des Célestins in Paris. The rest of her remains were then placed in the Basilique Saint-Denis.
