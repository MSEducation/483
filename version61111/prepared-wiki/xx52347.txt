The World Wide Association Of Specialty Programs and Schools (WWASPS or WWASP) is an organization based in Utah, in the United States. WWASPS was founded by Robert Lichfield and was incorporated in 1998. WWASPS states that it is an umbrella organization of independent institutions for education and treatment of troubled teenagers, all operating in accordance with WWASP guidelines. Many outside observers believe, however, that the WWASPS-affiliated institutions are actually owned (through limited partnerships, many of which have used the same street address) by WWASPS or its principal officials or their close relatives.See Investigation shows troubled school may be buying interest with lawmakers (Associated Press, September 20, 2004), Utah-based school owner banned (Deseret News, July 6, 2003), and Former student alleges months of abuse (John Sullivan, Columbia Daily Tribune, April 15, 2005.)[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]Maia Szalavitz, The Trouble with Troubled Teen Programs, Reason, January 2007 WWASPS is connected to several affiliated for-profit companies.

==Facilities==

WWASPS operates, formerly operated, or is associated with, several facilities in the United States and in other countries. In 2003 there were 2,300 students enrolled in its facilities and programs.Parents Divided Over Jamaica Disciplinary Academy by Tim Weiner, The New York Times, June 17, 2003 At one time, WWASPS facilities had tuition income of more than $90 million per year.
In July 2007 World Wide's president, Ken Kay, told the Salt Lake Tribune that only two schools remained in the WWASPS network, including Majestic Ranch Academy in Utah, which he said was likely to sever its ties with the organization.Loophole in state law has allowed some in teen-help industry to go unlicensed, The Salt Lake Tribune, July 16, 2007 In a December 2010 newspaper article, Kay was reported to have said that the organization was no longer in business, but because of ongoing litigation, it had not been dissolved.
Schools and programs currently or formerly associated with the organization include the following:

Some personnel formerly associated with WWASP schools and programs have gone on to establish or work at other similar institutions.
In 2005 Robert Lichfield and the Utah-based holding company, Golden Pond Investments Ltd., made an offer to buy the campus of the Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, to open a new school for adolescents needing help with discipline, responsibility and leadership skills. It was announced that the school would be directed by former WWASP staff member Randall Hinton and his brother Russell Hinton. The Hintons told Boonville officials that the proposed school would not be a part of WWASP.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://columbiamissourian.com/news/story.php?ID=13217|title=Boonville to discuss Kemper proposal: A company involved in the plan has faced abuse allegations|work=Columbia Missourian|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/2005/Apr/20050405News002.asp|title=Kemper suitors plan new military school|last=Sullivan|first=John|work=Columbia Daily Tribune|date=April 5, 2005|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] The Boonville City Council rejected the proposal.Amy Joi Bryson, Utah-based group under fire, Deseret Morning News, April 21, 2005

==Controversy==

WWASPS and its associated institutions have been the target of criticism over their treatment methods, including allegations of severe abuse and torture by staff at programs supported by WWASPS.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2006-06-22/news/feature_full.html |title=Rough Love: Kids from South Florida and beyond are sent to Jamaica to straighten up. Or else.|work=Miami New Times|last=Green|first=Joanne|date=June 22, 2006|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] The programs have been the subject of legal investigations by several U.S. states. In 2003, a reporter for The New York Times interviewed 60 current and former program participants and parents; some gave positive reports of their experiences, while other participants and parents said that WWASPS programs were abusive.
Numerous former students or their parents have filed lawsuits against WWASPS, its personnel, or individual schools. Most have been settled out of court or dismissed for procedural reasons. For example, a 2005 lawsuit filed in California on behalf of more than 20 plaintiffs was dismissed because the judge found that California lacked jurisdiction. In June 2007, Utah attorney Thomas M. Burton told a reporter that six suits he had filed against WWASPS on behalf of his clients had been dismissed on procedural grounds. WWASPS president Ken Kay told an interviewer that lawsuits against WWASPS are ploys to get money, brought by people who "are never going to be happy." A lawsuit filed in 2007 against WWASPS and its founder, Robert Lichfield, on behalf of 133 plaintiffs alleging physical and sexual abuse and fraudulent concealment of abuse brought negative publicity to Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, because Lichfield was one of six co-chairs of the Utah state fundraising committee for Romney's campaign.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lawsuits-hit-a-romney-money-man-2007-06-20.html |title=Lawsuits hit a Romney money man|work=The Hill|first=Alexander|last=Bolton|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/121088.html|title=Romney, Torture, and Teens: The former governor's connections to abusive "tough love" camps|work=Reason Magazine|last=Szalavitz|first=Maia|date=June 27, 2007|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl]
On several occasions, WWASPS and its principals have responded to criticism by suing their critics. Robert Lichfield sued two individuals associated with the International Survivors Action Committee (ISAC) for defamation, invasion of his privacy, and causing "intentional interference with 'prospective economic advantage'." That suit was pending as of April 2005. In May 2005 a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed (on jurisdictional grounds) a defamation lawsuit brought by WWASPS against a United Press International reporter who had done research for a news story about alleged abuse at several WWASPS schools. The reporter was accused of having made defamatory statements about WWASPS to "potential students, former students, parents of potential and former students, an employee of a state agency responsible for licensing a member school, and a Utah attorney who had filed numerous suits against WWASPS."

On August 31, 2007, Randall Hinton was convicted of one count each of third degree assault and false imprisonment, for mistreating students at the WWASP-affiliated Royal Gorge Academy, of which he was manager and co-founder. However, the jury returned verdicts of "not guilty" on four other counts of third-degree assault and one other count of false imprisonment.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/default.aspx?tabid=71&pDesc=1017,1,1|title=Hinton guilty on two counts: Jury finds Royal Gorge Academy official guilty of assault, false imprisonment|work=Cañon City Daily Record|date=9/1/2007|page=A8|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl] Hinton was sentenced to jail followed by probation.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://wwasp.blogspot.com/2007/11/randall-hinton-sentenced-to-jail-for.html |title=Randall Hinton Sentenced to Jail for Bloody Assault on Child|date=November 20, 2007|first=Tracy |last=Harmon|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/default.aspx?tabid=71&pDesc=2181,1,1 |title=Top 10 stories of 2007|work=Cañon City Daily Record|date=2007-12-31|page=A1|accessdate=21 August 2012[/tpl]
