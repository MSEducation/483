The Selection Box hosted an open audition in the RDS in 2001 in a search for a new TV presenter. A selection of these would-be presenters would then be sent on to a judging panel who would then bring them on to bootcamp.
2001 saw a wide range of reality TV shows in production. This was RTÉ's second talent search show having produced Popstars one year earlier. It had had success with its other reality task based TV show Treasure Island.
