Matthew Wilkening from AOL Radio Blog said that the song "combines an infectious mid-tempo dance beat with Latin horns and percussion, as Daddy Yankee bids farewell — but seemingly refuses to give up a lover who is moving away from him, despite his friends' best advice". It received and award for "Urban Song of the Year" at the 2012 ASCAP Awards, which are awarded annually by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in the United States.
