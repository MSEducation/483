Locris (Greek, Modern: [tpl]lang|el|Λοκρίδα[/tpl], Lokrida, Ancient: [tpl]lang|grc|Λοκρίς[/tpl], Lokris) was a region of ancient Greece, the homeland of the Locrians, made up of three distinct districts.

==Locrian tribe==

The city of Locri in Calabria (Italy), also known in antiquity as "Epizephyrian Locris", was a colony founded by the Locrians in Magna Graecia. There is some disagreement over whether it was those from Opuntian Locris or from Ozolian Locris who were responsible.

==Ancient Locris==

The territory of the Locrians was divided into three by Doris and Phocis, perhaps due to an early invasion of a contiguous Locrian state. This fact, combined with the region's infertility, meant that the Locrians tended to be dominated by their neighbours, and played little part in Greek history. 
To the south-west of Phocis was Ozolian Locris, situated on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, between Naupactus and Crisa. The main cities of Ozolian Locris were Amphissa and Naupactus which was its seaport. To the north east of Phocis was Opuntian Locris, named after its main city, Opus. Finally, to the north of Phocis was Epicnemidian Locris, situated near the pass of Thermopylae.[tpl]fact|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Ozolian Locris===

The main towns of Ozolian Locris were Amphissa and Naupactus. Today, the area is part of Aetolia-Acarnania and Phocis.

===Opuntian Locris===

Opuntian Locris is part of modern Phthiotis.

==Province==

The province of Locris ([tpl]lang-el|Επαρχία Λοκρίδας[/tpl]) was one of the provinces of the Phthiotis Prefecture. Its capital was the town Atalanti. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Amfikleia-Elateia, Lokroi, and Molos-Agios Konstantinos.[tpl]PDFlink|Detailed census results 1991|39 MB[/tpl] [tpl]el icon[/tpl] [tpl]fr icon[/tpl] It was abolished in 2006.
