==Life==

Marcelle studied art at the University for Applied Arts in Vienna, Austria in the 1990s and is primarily known for her works in painting and video. Her works reflects much on the thematic subject of human meetings and encounters, their variety, interaction and influential effects of the social surrounding, to which they are subjected. Pauline Marcelle is primarily known for her strong expressive paintings, in which she connects the intensity of modern art with the expressivity and figuration of her Caribbean origin. She lives and works in Dominica and Vienna, Austria.
