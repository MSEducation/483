Colin Luther Powell ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|ɨ|n[/tpl]; born April 5, 1937) is an American statesman and a retired four-star general in the United States Army.Preferred pronunciation rhymes with "bowel", not "bowl" (as in Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater) – see Alexander Chancellor, "You Say Tomato," New Yorker. August 9, 1993, p. 27. He was the 65th United States Secretary of State, serving under U.S. President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005, the first African American to serve in that position.The first African American secretary of state, Colin Powell, The African American Registry.Biographies – Colin Powell: United States Secretary of State, African American History Month, US Department of Defense.Colin Powell, Britannica Online Encyclopedia.Profile: Colin Powell, BBC News. During his military career, Powell also served as National Security Advisor (1987–1989), as Commander of the U.S. Army Forces Command (1989) and as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989–1993), holding the latter position during the Persian Gulf War. He was the first, and so far the only, African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was the first of two consecutive African American office-holders to hold the key Administration position of U.S. Secretary of State.

==Military career==

Powell was a professional soldier for 35 years, holding a variety of command and staff positions and rising to the rank of General.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9445708&page=print |accessdate=May 31, 2007|title= Colin (Luther) Powell Biography (1937 – )|work=The Biography Channel|publisher=A&E Television Networks[/tpl]

===Training===

Powell described joining the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college as one of the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had "found himself." According to Powell:  “It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on.”Biography and Video Interview of Colin Powell at Academy of Achievement.  Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.
Upon graduation, he received a commission as an Army second lieutenant.[tpl]cite web |title = Secretary of State Colin L.

===Vietnam War===

In his autobiography, Powell said he is haunted by the nightmare of the Vietnam War and felt that the leadership was very ineffective.
Captain Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) advisor from 1962 to 1963. While on patrol in a Viet Cong-held area, he was wounded by stepping on a punji stake.[tpl]Cite book|authorlink=Cresson Kearny|author=Kearny, Cresson H.|title=Jungle Snafus...And Remedies|publisher=Oregon Institute of Science & Medicine |location=Cave Junction, OR|year=1996 |isbn=978-1-884067-10-5 |oclc=41447083|page= 179[/tpl] The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour.
He returned to Vietnam as a major in 1968, serving in the Americal Division (23rd Infantry Division), then as assistant chief of staff of operations for the Americal Division. During the second tour in Vietnam he was decorated for bravery after he survived a helicopter crash, single-handedly rescuing three others, including division commander Major General Charles Martin Gettys, from the burning wreckage.[tpl]cite book |last=Finlayson |first=Reggie |authorlink= |title=Colin Powell |series=Biography (A & E) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zaYOC27mmhAC&lpg=PA54&ots=fszjUWFKdy&dq=Charles%20M.%20Gettys%20colin%20powell&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q=Charles%20M.%20Gettys%20colin%20powell&f=false |accessdate=7 December 2012 |year=2003 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=9780822549666 |page=55 [/tpl] He was charged with investigating a detailed letter by Tom Glen (a soldier from the 11th Light Infantry Brigade), which backed up rumored allegations of the My Lai Massacre. Powell wrote: "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." Later, Powell's assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to television and radio host Larry King, "I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored."[tpl]cite web  |title = Interview on CNN's Larry King Live  |publisher=U.S. Department of State |location=New York, New York  |date=May 4, 2004  |url = http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/32160.htm  |accessdate =February 3, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110175317/http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/32160.htm  |archivedate = January 10, 2007[/tpl]

===After the Vietnam War===

Powell served a White House fellowship, a highly selective and prestigious position, under President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1973.
In his autobiography, My American Journey, Powell named several officers he served under who inspired and mentored him. As a lieutenant colonel serving in South Korea, Powell was very close to General Henry "Gunfighter" Emerson. Powell said he regarded Emerson as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson insisted his troops train at night to fight a possible North Korean attack, and made them repeatedly watch the television film Brian's Song to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart, was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare. After a race riot occurred, where African American soldiers almost killed a Caucasian officer, Powell was charged by Emerson to crackdown on black militants; Powell's efforts led to the discharge of one soldier, and other efforts to reduce racial tensions.

===A "political general"===

In the early 1980s, Powell served at Fort Carson, Colorado. After he left Fort Carson, Powell became senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, whom he assisted during the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 airstrike on Libya.
In 1986, Powell took over the command of V Corps in Frankfurt, Germany, from Robert Lewis "Sam" Wetzel.
Following the Iran Contra scandal, Powell became, at the age of 49, Ronald Reagan's National Security Advisor, serving from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a lieutenant general.
In April 1989, after his tenure with the National Security Council, Powell was promoted to four-star general under President George H. W. Bush and briefly served as the Commander in Chief, Forces Command (FORSCOM), headquartered at Fort McPherson, Georgia, overseeing all Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard units in the Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. He became only the third general since World War II, joining Dwight D. Eisenhower and Alexander Haig, to reach four-star rank without ever serving as a division commander.
Later that year, President George H. W. Bush selected him as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/inauguration/transition/powell.html |title=Online NewsHour: Colin Powell |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl]

===Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===

Powell's last military assignment, from October 1, 1989, to September 30, 1993, was as the 12th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the Department of Defense. At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first Afro-Caribbean American, to serve in this position. Powell was also the first JCS Chair who received his commission through ROTC.[tpl]Cite news  | title = The 14 Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  | agency=American Forces Press Service|publisher=Joint History Office, U.S. Department of Defense  | date = August 10, 1999  | url = http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=43048  |accessdate=April 24, 2008[/tpl]
During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove General Manuel Noriega from power and Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During these events, Powell earned his nickname, "the reluctant warrior." He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an international crisis, and instead usually prescribed diplomacy and containment.
As a military strategist, Powell advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the "Powell Doctrine". Powell continued as chairman of the JCS into the Clinton presidency but as a dedicated "realist" he considered himself a bad fit for an administration largely made up of liberal internationalists.[tpl]cite book| title = Colin Powell: A Political Biography | last = O'Sullivan |first = Christopher | authorlink = Christopher D O'Sullivan |publisher = Rowman & Littlefield Publishers | year =  2010|page=100 |isbn = 978-0-7425-5187-9 | oclc = |location = Lanham, MD[/tpl] He clashed with then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright over the Bosnian crisis, as he opposed any military interventions that didn't involve US interests."Reluctant warrior", The Observer, September 30, 2001.
During his chairmanship of the JCS, there was discussion of awarding Powell a fifth star, granting him the rank of General of the Army. But even in the wake of public and Congressional pressure[tpl]cite journal |date=March 1991 |author1=Company, Johnson Publishing  |title=U.S. Sen.

In 1997 Powell founded America's Promise with the objective of helping children from all socioeconomic sectors. That same year saw the establishment of The Colin L. Powell Center for Leadership and Service.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential election Powell campaigned for Senator John McCain and later Texas Governor George W. Bush after the latter secured the Republican nomination.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Bush eventually won, and Powell was appointed Secretary of State.

==Secretary of State==

As Secretary of State in the Bush administration, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years.

On September 11, 2001, Powell was in Lima, Peru, meeting with President Alejandro Toledo and US Ambassador John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the OAS General Assembly that subsequently adopted the Inter-American Democratic Charter. After the September 11 attacks, Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the War on Terrorism.
Powell came under fire for his role in building the case for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In a press statement on February 24, 2001, he had said that sanctions against Iraq had prevented the development of any weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein. As was the case in the days leading up to the Persian Gulf War, Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar Richard Clarke in front of the 9/11 Commission. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a unilateral approach. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.
Powell's chief role was to garner international support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that "there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." Powell also stated that there was "no doubt in my mind" that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.[tpl]cite web  |title = Remarks to the United Nations Security Council  |publisher=U.S. Department of State  |first=Secretary Colin L. |last=Powell  |location=New York City  |date=February 5, 2003  |url = http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17300.htm  |accessdate =February 3, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109235502/http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/17300.htm  |archivedate = January 9, 2007[/tpl]
Most observers praised Powell's oratorical skills. However, Britain's Channel 4 News reported soon afterwards that a UK intelligence dossier that Powell had referred to as a "fine paper" during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by American graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/529|title=U.S. Scholar Uncredited in Iraq Report|last=Lawless|first=Jill|date=February 7, 2003|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 26, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/02/07/sprj.irq.uk.dossier/index.html|publisher=CNN|title= UK accused of lifting dossier text|date=February 7, 2003[/tpl]
A 2004 report by the Iraq Survey Group concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was inaccurate.
In an interview with Charlie Rose, Powell contended that prior to his UN presentation, he had merely four days to review the data concerning WMD in Iraq.Charlie Rose. charlierose.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.
A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery.[tpl]Cite news  |last = Miller  |first = Greg  |title = Flaws Cited in Powell's U.N.

Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points." Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too."[tpl]Cite news  |last = DeYoung  |first = Karen  |title = Falling on His Sword: Colin Powell's most significant moment turned out to be his lowest  |work=Washington Post  |date = October 1, 2006  |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700106.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]
In September 2005, Powell was asked about the speech during an interview with Barbara Walters and responded that it was a "blot" on his record. He went on to say, "It will always be a part of my record. It was painful. It's painful now."[tpl]Cite news  |title = Colin Powell on Iraq, Race, and Hurricane Relief  |work=20/20  |publisher=ABC News  |date = September 8, 2005  |url = http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Politics/story?id=1105979&page=1  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]
Wilkerson said that he inadvertently participated in a hoax on the American people in preparing Powell's erroneous testimony before the United Nations Security Council.[tpl]Cite news  |last = Brancaccio  |first = David  |title = Iraq Pre-War Intelligence  |work=NOW  |publisher=PBS  |date = February 3, 2006  |url = http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/wilkerson.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]
Because Powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding Iran and North Korea.
After Saddam Hussein had been deposed, Powell's new role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq. On September 13, 2004, Powell testified before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,[tpl]Cite news  |last = Pincus  |first = Walter  |title = Support for Intelligence Plan  |work=Washington Post  |date = February 14, 2004  |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18890-2004Sep13.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl] acknowledging that the sources who provided much of the information in his February 2003 UN presentation were "wrong" and that it was "unlikely" that any stockpiles of WMDs would be found. Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that "what one person knew, everyone else knew."
Additionally, Powell has been critical of other instances of U.S. foreign policy in the past, such as its support for the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event "I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the democracies in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/news/2003/02/dos022003.html |title=Remarks at the 2003 Groundhog Job Shadow Day Program, Secretary Colin L.

Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on November 15, 2004. According to The Washington Post, he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, Andrew Card. Powell announced that he would stay on until the end of Bush's first term or until his replacement's confirmation by Congress. The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice as Powell's successor. News of Powell's leaving the Administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world — some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the Bush administration, but others hoping for Powell's successor to wield more influence within the cabinet.
In mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that Iran was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system.[tpl]Cite news  |last = Sciolino  |first = Elaine  |title = Exiles Add to Claims on Iran Nuclear Arms  |work=New York Times  |date = November 18, 2004  |url = http://www.nci.org/04nci/11/pbs/ExilesAdd.htm  |accessdate=February 8, 2007[/tpl] The accusation came at the same time as the settlement of an agreement between Iran, the IAEA, and the European Union.
On December 31, 2004, Powell rang in the New Year by pressing a button in Times Square with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to initiate the ball drop and 60 second countdown, ushering in the year 2005. He appeared on the networks that were broadcasting New Year's Eve specials and talked about this honor, as well as being a native of New York City.[tpl]Cite news  |last = Anderson  |first = Cooper  |title = Transcripts: New Year's Eve Special  |publisher=CNN  |date = December 31, 2004  |url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/31/se.01.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]

==Life after diplomatic service==

After retiring from the role of Secretary of State, Powell returned to private life. In April 2005, he was privately telephoned by Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and Chuck Hagel,[tpl]Cite news|author=VandeHei, Jim and Robin Wright|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7420-2005Apr21.html|title=Powell Playing Quiet Role in Bolton Battle|work=Washington Post|date=April 22, 2005[/tpl] at which time Powell expressed reservations and mixed reviews about the nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations, but refrained from advising the senators to oppose Bolton (Powell had clashed with Bolton during Bush's first term).[tpl]Cite news  |last = Borger  |first = Julian  |title = Powell's remarks harm Bolton's chances of UN job  |work=The Guardian |location=London |location=UK  |date = April 23, 2005  |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1468438,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl] The decision was viewed as potentially dealing significant damage to Bolton's chances of confirmation. Bolton was put into the position via a recess appointment because of the strong opposition in the Senate.
On April 28, 2005, an opinion piece in The Guardian by Sidney Blumenthal (a former top aide to President Bill Clinton) claimed that Powell was in fact "conducting a campaign" against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and Libya after complaints about Bolton's involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that "The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the National Security Agency. Staff members on the committee believe that Bolton was probably spying on Powell, his senior advisors and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that Bolton opposed."[tpl]Cite news  |last = Blumenthal  |first = Sidney  |title = The good soldier's revenge  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date = April 28, 2005  |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1471879,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]
In July 2005, Powell joined Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, a well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm, with the title of "strategic limited partner."
In September 2005, Powell criticized the response to Hurricane Katrina.[tpl]Cite news  |title = Powell criticises storm response  |publisher=BBC News  |date = September 9, 2005  |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4229238.stm  [/tpl] Powell said that thousands of people were not properly protected, but because they were poor rather than because they were black.
On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush's terrorism bill. He backed Senators John Warner, John McCain and Lindsey Graham in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism. Powell stated that "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of America's fight against terrorism."[tpl]Cite news  |title = Senators defy Bush on tribunals  |publisher=BBC News  |date = September 15, 2006  |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5347564.stm  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl]
Also in 2006, Powell began appearing as a speaker at a series of motivational events called Get Motivated, along with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In his speeches for the tour, he openly criticized the Bush Administration on a number of issues. Powell has been the recipient of mild criticism for his role with Get Motivated which has been called a "get-rich-quick-without-much-effort, feel-good schemology."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americansatellite.org/2008/08/down-rabbit-hole.html|accessdate=October 10, 2008|title=Down the Rabbit Hole |author=Wilken, Dennis|date=September 7, 2008|work=American Satellite Magazine[/tpl]

==Political views==

A liberal Republican, Powell is well known for his willingness to support liberal or centrist causes.Colin Powell's biography from 'On The Issues'. He is pro-choice regarding abortion, and in favor of "reasonable" gun control.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2011[/tpl] He stated in his autobiography that he supports affirmative action that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues. Powell was also instrumental in the 1993 implementation of the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, though he later supported its repeal as proposed by Robert Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen in January 2010, saying "circumstances had changed".[tpl]cite news |title=Colin Powell shifts stance on 'don't ask, don't tell' policy |author=DeYoung, Karen |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/03/AR2010020302292.html[/tpl]
The Vietnam War had a profound effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography My American Journey. The Powell Doctrine, as the views became known, was a central component of US policy in the Gulf War (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and U.S. invasion of Afghanistan (the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.
Powell was the subject of controversy in 2004 when, in a conversation with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, he reportedly referred to neoconservatives within the Bush administration as "fucking crazies."[tpl]Cite news  |last = Blumenthal  |first = Sidney  |title = Colin and the crazies  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date = November 18, 2004  |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1353796,00.html  |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl] In addition to being reported in the press (though generally, the expletive was censored in the U.S. press), the quote was used by James Naughtie in his book, The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency, and by Chris Patten in his book, Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain, and Europe in a New Century.
In a September 2006 letter to Sen. John McCain, General Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for military tribunals of those formerly and currently classified as enemy combatants. Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to "redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention." He also asserted: "The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.""Sen. McCain Releases Letter from Gen. Colin Powell," Washington Post (September 14, 2006). http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/09/14/GR2006091400728.html
Powell endorsed President Obama in 2008 and again in 2012.  When asked why he is still a Republican on Meet the Press he said, “I’m still a Republican. And I think the Republican Party needs me more than the Democratic Party needs me. And you can be a Republican and still feel strongly about issues such as immigration, and improving our education system, and doing something about some of the social problems that exist in our society and our country. I don’t think there’s anything inconsistent with this.”

===Views on the Iraq War===

While Powell was wary of a military solution, he supported the decision to invade Iraq after the Bush administration concluded that diplomatic efforts had failed. After his departure from the State Department, Powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for American involvement in the Iraq War.
At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado,See Official website: Aspen Ideas Festival  Powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: "I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aifestival.org/library/transcript/Powell-Lehrer_transcript.pdf|title=Conversation with Colin Powell|publisher=Aspen Ideas Festival|format=PDF|date=July 2007|accessdate=February 22, 2008[/tpl]
In a 2008 interview on CNN, Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to invade Iraq in the context of his endorsement of Barack Obama, stating: "My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president Bush agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war.""Powell: Support for Obama doesn't mean Iraq war wrong," CNN (October 19, 2008). http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/powell.transcript/
Powell's position on the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 has been less clear. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the U.S. military had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: "I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work."James M. Klatell, "Powell: We Are Losing In Iraq," CBS (December 17, 2006). http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/17/ftn/main2274583.shtml Following his endorsement of Barack Obama in October 2008, however, Powell praised General David Petraeus and U.S. troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that "it's starting to turn around." By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of U.S. forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003."Powell says Iraq surge should have come earlier," Seattle Times (July 5, 2009). http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2009420450_apuspowell.html Throughout this period, Powell consistently argued that Iraqi political progress was essential, not just military force.

===Role in presidential election of 2008===

Powell donated the maximum allowable amount to John McCain's campaign in the summer of 2007[tpl]Cite news  |last = Henry  |first = Ed |title = Powell donates to McCain  |publisher=CNN  |date = August 9, 2007  |url = http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/08/09/powell-donates-to-mccain/  |accessdate=August 9, 2007[/tpl] and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities," in addition to his "style and substance." He additionally referred to Obama as a "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that despite the fact that she is admired, "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was "troubled" by the "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." Powell stated that "Obama is a Christian — he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." Powell then referenced Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower ... I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me."[tpl]Cite news  |title = Powell endorses Obama for president; Republican ex-Secretary of State calls Democrat 'transformational figure'  |work=Meet the Press  |publisher=MSNBC and NBC News  |date = October 19, 2008  |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27265369/  |accessdate=October 19, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news  |title =Meet the Press' transcript for October 19, 2008  |publisher=MSNBC  |date = October 19, 2008  |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27266223/  |accessdate =October 19, 2008[/tpl] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen.
