Pink Bubbles Go Ape is the fourth studio album by German power metal band Helloween, released in 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Helloween/Pink_Bubbles_Go_Ape/697/ |title=Pink Bubbles Go Ape |publisher=Encyclopaedia Metallum |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Helloween-Pink-Bubbles-Go-Ape/master/90595 |title=Helloween â€“ Pink Bubbles Go Ape (tracklist and versions) |publisher=Discogs |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11[/tpl] It marked the departure of guitarist Kai Hansen, with Roland Grapow replacing him. Musically it was written with a softer, less epic, and sometimes humorous approach, which would be later fully implemented in the band's following album Chameleon (1993).
The album contains two singles, which are "Kids of the Century" and "Number One". "Kids of the Century" reached #56 in the United Kingdom. There were some tunes recorded for this album, which were either not featured on it (Windmill)http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/showinterview.php?id=1910&lang=en or have never been finished (City Cries).http://www.creatorx.com/temp/helloween/interviewweiki.htm  On the other hand, the track "Heavy Metal Hamsters" (supposedly written about the band's former record company) was, according to Michael Weikath, never intended to be on the album, but rather on a B-side of a single.
