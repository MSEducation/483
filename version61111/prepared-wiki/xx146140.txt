"I Wanna Be the Only One" is a single by Eternal. It was the third single released from their album Before the Rain. In May 1997, the group joined forces with US singer BeBe Winans and scored their first - and only - UK chart-topper with this song. The girl group had previously scored #1 hits in Japan with "Stay", "Power Of A Woman", "Who Are You" and "Finally".
"I Wanna Be the Only One" became Eternal's biggest hit to date: it was the third most played song on British radio and the most played song on European radio by a UK act in 1997.  It earned Eternal a MOBO Award and Capital FM Award for Best Single. It was also nominated for Best Single at the BRIT Awards; although the gong went to All Saints, unofficial reports suggest that winner Never Ever was closely challenged by both Eternal and the Spice Girls.
