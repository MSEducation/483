==Poverty==

Haiti is the poorest country in Latin America. Poverty has been a constant burden for Haiti government despite several measures taken to curb this social problem. Poverty can be traced back due to the lack of education among the people. Hence to solve the problem, addressing the education system will be vital. Indeed, Hope for Haiti has been instrumental in alleviating poverty through their extensive education program.

===Education===

Despite the Haitian Constitution in 1987The Haitian Constitution of 1987, article 32-3, states that “Primary education is compulsory under penalty of sanctions to be determined by the law. School supplies and teaching aids will be provided by the government for pupils at the primary school level” enforcing compulsory education, it was never executed successfully. As such, many parents who could not afford costly private school fees were unable to send their children for education. With the problem of poverty being so rampant in Haiti, education is seen as the most viable solution for both short and long term. From sponsoring a few children for their education, the education program by Hope for Haiti has evolved into support 40 schools and 400 teachers, thus enabling accessibility to education for more than 10,000 boys and girls each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hopeforhaiti.com/education.php|title=Education Program|author= |date= |work=Hope for Haiti official website |publisher=Hope for Haiti|accessdate=5 October 2011[/tpl]

==Solution==

Due to lack of government financial support, private schools can only raise funds through school fees payments by parents. This cost burden is thus being transferred from the government to the parents. However, not every parents will be able to sustain such expensive educational costs, thus resulting in around 500,000 children aged 6 to 11 not attending school at all.Henriette Lunde, Youth and Education in Haiti : Disincentives, vulnerabilities and constraints, Haiti Youth Project Subsidizing teachers' salaries was thus deemed to be the most effective and ultimately the best way in order to ensure all enrolled children are able to receive quality education. With this financial assistance from Hope for Haiti, more parents will be able to send their children to schools for education, thus an opportunity to break out the vicious cycle of poverty.
