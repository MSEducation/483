[[Jacob Sardini]]

CATEGORIES: Judge Dredd characters

Jacob Sardini is a fictional character from the Judge Dredd comic strip in the British comics 2000 AD and Judge Dredd Megazine.
Sardini was a human taxidermist who "stuffed" dead human bodies. Among those he stuffed were the Yess family. In 2109 he had an encounter with Judge Dredd when he was forced to stuff the bodies of some gangsters who had been shot in a mob war, and then had to secretly dispose of the bodies when his client was killed by the Judges.
Several years later, he represented Mega-City One in the 2116 Nepal Olympics, where he won the gold medal in the taxidermy event. He is one of the very, very few criminals in the comic strip to escape detection by Judge Dredd. He died of a heart attack after being robbed in 2120.
