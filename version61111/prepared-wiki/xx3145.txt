One of its disadvantages is that it cannot determine a planet's true mass, but can only set a lower limit on that mass. However, if the radial velocity of the planet itself can be distinguished from the radial velocity of the star, then the true mass can be determined.

===Space telescopes===

Most confirmed extrasolar planets have been found using ground-based telescopes. However, many of the methods can work more effectively with space-based telescopes that avoid atmospheric haze and turbulence. COROT and Kepler were space missions dedicated to searching for extrasolar planets. Hubble Space Telescope and MOST have also found or confirmed a few planets. The Gaia mission, launched in December 2013,Gaia Science Homepage will use astrometry to determine the true masses of 1000 nearby exoplanets.[tpl]cite web |author=Staff |title=Announcement of Opportunity for the Gaia Data Processing Archive Access Co-Ordination Unit |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=51116 |date=19 November 2012 |publisher=ESA |accessdate=17 March 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Staff |title=DPAC Newsletter no. 15 |url=http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA/GAIA/docs/DPAC/web/DPAC_NL_015.pdf |format=PDF |date=30 January 2012|publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=16 March 2013[/tpl]

==Definition==

===IAU===

The official definition of "planet" used by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) only covers the Solar System and thus does not apply to exoplanets. As of April 2011, the only definitional statement issued by the IAU that pertains to exoplanets is a working definition issued in 2001 and modified in 2003.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][/ref]
That definition contains the following criteria:

===Alternatives===

However, the IAU's working definition is not universally accepted. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from brown dwarfs on the basis of formation. It is widely believed that giant planets form through core accretion, and that process may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold;[tpl]cite arXiv|eprint=0710.5667|class=astro-ph|title=Giant Planet Formation by Core Accretion|version=v1|author=Mordasini, C. et al.|year=2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|arxiv=0802.1810|title=Structure and evolution of super-Earth to super-Jupiter exoplanets.

Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff.

==Nomenclature==

===Multiple-star standard===

The convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the one used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple-star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union.[tpl]cite arXiv |title=On the naming convention used for multiple star systems and extrasolar planets |year=2010 |last1=Hessman |first1=F. V. |coauthor=et al. |eprint=1012.0707 |class=astro-ph.SR [/tpl]
The brightest member of a star system receives the letter "A". Distinct components not contained within "A" are labeled "B", "C", etc. Subcomponents are designated by one or more suffixes with the primary label, starting with lowercase letters for the 2nd hierarchical level and then numbers for the 3rd.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/wmc/wmc_post191.html | title=Addressing confusion in double star nomenclature: The Washington Multiplicity Catalog | author=William I. Hartkopf & Brian D. Mason | publisher=United States Naval Observatory | accessdate=2008-09-12 [/tpl] For example, if there is a triple star system in which two stars orbit each other closely with a third star in a more distant orbit, the two closely orbiting stars would be named Aa and Ab, whereas the distant star would named B. For historical reasons, this standard is not always followed: for example Alpha Centauri A, B and C are not labelled Alpha Centauri Aa, Ab and B.

===Extrasolar planet standard===

Following an extension of the above standard, an exoplanet's name is normally formed by taking the name of its parent star and adding a lowercase letter. The first planet discovered in a system is given the designation "b" and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size.
For instance, in the 55 Cancri system the first planet – 55 Cancri b – was discovered in 1996; two additional farther planets were simultaneously discovered in 2002 with the nearest to the star being named 55 Cancri c and the other 55 Cancri d; a fourth planet was claimed (its existence was later disputed) in 2004 and named 55 Cancri e despite lying closer to the star than 55 Cancri b; and the most recently discovered planet, in 2007, was named 55 Cancri f despite lying between 55 Cancri c and 55 Cancri d.[tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=55+Cnc |title=Notes for star 55 Cnc |author=Jean Schneider |year=2011 |publisher=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] As of April 2012 the highest letter in use is "j", for the unconfirmed planet HD 10180 j, and with "h" being the highest letter for a confirmed planet, belonging to the same host star).
If a planet orbits one member of a binary star system, then an uppercase letter for the star will be followed by a lowercase letter for the planet. Examples are 16 Cygni Bb[tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+41004+A&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet 16 Cyg B b |author=Jean Schneider |year=2011 |publisher=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] and HD 178911 Bb.[tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+178911+B&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet HD 178911 B b |author=Jean Schneider |year=2011 |publisher=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] Planets orbiting the primary or "A" star should have 'Ab' after the name of the system, as in HD 41004 Ab.[tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=HD+41004+A&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet HD 41004 A b |author=Jean Schneider |year=2011 |publisher=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] However, the "A" is sometimes omitted; for example the first planet discovered around the primary star of the Tau Boötis binary system is usually called simply Tau Boötis b.[tpl]cite web |url=http://exoplanet.eu/planet.php?p1=tau+Boo&p2=b |title=Notes for Planet Tau Boo b |author=Jean Schneider |year=2011 |publisher=Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia |accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl]
If the parent star is a single star, then it may still be regarded as having an "A" designation, though the "A" is not normally written. The first exoplanet found to be orbiting such a star could then be regarded as a secondary subcomponent that should be given the suffix "Ab". For example, 51 Peg Aa is the host star in the system 51 Peg; and the first exoplanet is then 51 Peg Ab. Because most exoplanets are in single-star systems, the implicit "A" designation was simply dropped, leaving the exoplanet name with the lower-case letter only: 51 Peg b.
A few exoplanets have been given names that do not conform to the above standard. For example, the planets that orbit the pulsar PSR 1257 are often referred to with capital rather than lowercase letters. Also, the underlying name of the star system itself can follow several different systems. In fact, some stars (such as Kepler-11) have only received their names due to their inclusion in planet-search programs, previously only being referred to by their celestial coordinates.

===Circumbinary planets and 2010 proposal===

Hessman et al. state that the implicit system for exoplanet names utterly failed with the discovery of circumbinary planets. They note that the discoverers of the two planets around HW Virginis tried to circumvent the naming problem by calling them "HW Vir 3" and "HW Vir 4", i.e. the latter is the 4th object – stellar or planetary – discovered in the system. They also note that the discoverers of the two planets around NN Serpentis were confronted with multiple suggestions from various official sources and finally chose to use the designations "NN Ser c" and "NN Ser d".
The proposal of Hessman et al. starts with the following two rules:
They note that under these two proposed rules all of the present names for 99% of the planets around single stars are preserved as informal forms of the IAU sanctioned provisional standard. They would rename Tau Boötis b formally as Tau Boötis Ab, retaining the prior form as an informal usage (using Rule 2, above).
To deal with the difficulties relating to circumbinary planets, the proposal contains two further rules:
They submit that the new form using parentheses is the best for known circumbinary planets and has the desirable effect of giving these planets identical sublevel hierarchical labels and stellar component names that conform to the usage for binary stars. They say that it requires the complete renaming of only two exoplanetary systems: The planets around HW Virginis would be renamed HW Vir (AB) b & (AB) c, whereas those around NN Serpentis would be renamed NN Ser (AB) b & (AB) c. In addition the previously known single circumbinary planets around PSR B1620-26 and DP Leonis) can almost retain their names (PSR B1620-26 b and DP Leonis b) as unofficial informal forms of the "(AB)b" designation where the "(AB)" is left out.
The discoverers of the circumbinary planet around Kepler-16 followed the naming scheme proposed by Hessman et al. when naming the body Kepler-16 (AB)-b, or simply Kepler-16b when there is no ambiguity.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1210923 |title=Kepler-16: A Transiting Circumbinary Planet |year=2011 |last1=Doyle |first1=L.

===Other naming systems===

Another nomenclature, often seen in science fiction, uses Roman numerals in the order of planets' positions from the star. (This was inspired by an old system for naming moons of the outer planets, such as "Jupiter IV" for Callisto.) But such a system is impractical for scientific use, because new planets may be found closer to the star, changing all numerals.
Several planets have received unofficial "real" names: notably Osiris (HD 209458 b), Bellerophon (51 Pegasi b), Zarmina (Gliese 581 g) and Methuselah (PSR B1620-26 b). W. Lyra of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy has suggested names mostly drawn from Roman-Greek mythology for the 403 extrasolar planet candidates known as of October 2009.[tpl]cite arXiv |title=Naming the extrasolar planets |year=2009 |last1=Lyra |first1=W. |eprint=0910.3989v3 |class=astro-ph.EP[/tpl] In 2009 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) stated that it had no plans to assign names of this sort to extrasolar planets, considering it impractical.
However, in August 2013 the IAU changed its stance, inviting members of the public to suggest names for extrasolar planets.

==Formation and evolution==

==Planet-hosting stars==

===Proportion of stars with planets===

Planet-search programs have discovered planets orbiting a substantial fraction of the stars they have looked at. However, the overall proportion of stars with planets is uncertain because not all planets can yet be detected. The radial-velocity method and the transit method (which between them are responsible for the vast majority of detections) are most sensitive to large planets in small orbits. Thus many known exoplanets are "hot Jupiters": planets of Jovian mass or larger in very small orbits with periods of only a few days. A 2005 survey of radial-velocity-detected planets found that about 1.2% of Sun-like stars have a hot jupiter, where "Sun-like star" refers to any main-sequence star of spectral classes late-F, G, or early-K without a close stellar companion. This 1.2% is more than double the frequency of hot jupiters detected by the Kepler spacecraft, which may be because the Kepler field of view covers a different region of the Milky Way where the metallicity of stars is different.The Frequency of Hot Jupiters Orbiting Nearby Solar-Type Stars, J. T. Wright, G. W. Marcy, A. W. Howard, John Asher Johnson, T. Morton, D. A. Fischer, (Submitted on 10 May 2012)
It is further estimated that 3% to 4.5% of Sun-like stars possess a giant planet with an orbital period of 100 days or less, where "giant planet" means a planet of at least 30 Earth masses.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Andrew Cumming|year=2008|title=The Keck Planet Search: Detectability and the Minimum Mass and Orbital Period Distribution of Extrasolar Planets|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume=120| issue=867|pages=531–554| arxiv=0803.3357|doi=10.1086/588487| bibcode=2008PASP..120..531C| author2=R. Paul Butler| author3=Geoffrey W. Marcy et al.| last4=Vogt| first4=Steven S.| last5=Wright| first5=Jason T.| last6=Fischer| first6=Debra A.| authorlink3=Debra Fischer | display-authors=3[/tpl]
It is known that small planets (of roughly Earth-like mass or somewhat larger) are more common than giant planets.Planet Occurrence within 0.25 AU of Solar-type Stars from Kepler, Andrew W. Howard et al. (Submitted on 13 Mar 2011) It also appears that there are more planets in large orbits than in small orbits. Based on this, it is estimated that perhaps 20% of Sun-like stars have at least one giant planet whereas at least 40% may have planets of lower mass.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8314581.stm|work=BBC News|title=Scientists announce planet bounty|date=19 October 2009|accessdate=2010-03-31|first=Jonathan|last=Amos[/tpl]
A 2012 study of gravitational microlensing data collected between 2002 and 2007 concludes the proportion of stars with planets is much higher and estimates an average of 1.6 planets orbiting between 0.5–10 AU per star in the Milky Way, the authors of this study conclude that "stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception".
In November 2013 it was announced that 22±8% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone.
Whatever the proportion of stars with planets, the total number of exoplanets must be very large. Because the Milky Way has at least 200 billion stars, it must also contain tens or hundreds of billions of planets.

===Spectral classification===

Most known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the Sun, that is, main-sequence stars of spectral categories F, G, or K. One reason is that planet search programs have tended to concentrate on such stars. But in addition, statistical analysis indicates that lower-mass stars (red dwarfs, of spectral category M) are less likely to have planets massive enough to detect. Stars of spectral category A typically rotate very quickly, which makes it very difficult to measure the small Doppler shifts induced by orbiting planets because the spectral lines are very broad. However, this type of massive star eventually evolves into a cooler red giant that rotates more slowly and thus can be measured using the radial-velocity method. As of early 2011 about 30 Jupiter-class planets had been found around K-giants, including Pollux, Gamma Cephei, and Iota Draconis. Doppler surveys around a wide variety of stars indicate about 1 in 6 stars having twice the mass of the Sun are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, vs. 1 in 16 for Sun-like stars and only 1 in 50 for red dwarfs. On the other hand, microlensing surveys indicate that long-period Neptune-mass planets are found around 1 in 3 red dwarfs.

Observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope indicate that extremely massive stars of spectral category O, which are much hotter than the Sun, produce a photo-evaporation effect that inhibits planetary formation.
When the O-type star goes supernova any planets that had formed would become free floating due to the loss of stellar mass unless the natal kick of the resulting remnant pushes it in the same direction as an escaping planet.Limits on Planets Orbiting Massive Stars from Radio Pulsar Timing, Thorsett, S.E. Dewey, R.J. 16-Sep-1993

===Metallicity===

Ordinary stars are composed mainly of the light elements hydrogen and helium. They also contain a small proportion of heavier elements, and this fraction is referred to as a star's metallicity (even if the elements are not metals in the traditional sense), denoted m/H and expressed on a logarithmic scale where zero is the Sun's metallicity.
A 2012 study of the Kepler spacecraft data found that the smaller planets with radii smaller than that of Neptune were found around stars with metallicities in the range −0.6 0.5 ≈ 3) whereas the larger planets were found mostly around stars with metallicity at the higher end of this range (at solar metallicity and above) In this study small planets occurred about three times as frequently as large planets around stars of metallicity greater than that of the Sun, but they occurred around six times as frequently for stars of metallicity less than that of the Sun. The lack of gas giants around low-metallicity stars could be because the metallicty of protoplanetary disks affects how quickly planetary cores can form and whether they accrete a gaseous envelope before the gas dissipates. However, Kepler can only observe planets very close to their star and the detected gas giants probably migrated from further out, so a decreased efficiency of migration in low-metallicity disks could also partly explain these findings.
It has also been shown that stars with planets are more likely to be deficient in lithium.

===Multiple stars===

Most known planets orbit single stars, but some orbit one member of a binary star system,BINARY CATALOGUE OF EXOPLANETS, Maintained by Richard Schwarz], retrieved 28 Sept 2013 and several circumbinary planets have been discovered which orbit around both members of binary star. A few planets in triple star systems are knownhttp://www.univie.ac.at/adg/schwarz/multi.html and one in the quadruple system Kepler 64. The Kepler results indicate circumbinary planetary systems are relatively common (as of October 2013 the spacecraft had found seven planets out of roughly 1000 eclipsing binaries searched). One puzzling finding is none of the close binary stars surveyed appear to have eclipsing planets. Half of the stars have an orbital period of 2.7 days or less, but none of the binaries with planets have a period less than 7.4 days. Another surprising Kepler finding is circumbinary planets tend to orbit their stars close to the critical instability radius (theoretical calculations indicate the minimum stable separation is roughly two to three times the size of the stars' separation).

===Open clusters===

Most stars form in open clusters, but very few planets have been found in open clusters and this led to the hypothesis that the open-cluster environment hinders planet formation. However, a 2011 study concluded that there have been an insufficient number of surveys of clusters to make such a hypothesis.Ensemble analysis of open cluster transit surveys: upper limits on the frequency of short-period planets consistent with the field, Jennifer L. van Saders, B. Scott Gaudi, (Submitted on 15 Sep 2010)
The lack of surveys was because there are relatively few suitable open clusters in the Milky Way.

===Captured planets===

Free-floating planets in open clusters have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system. Some planet–host metallicity correlation may still exist due to the common origin of the stars from the same cluster. Planets would be unlikely to be captured around neutron stars because these are likely to be ejected from the cluster by a pulsar kick when they form. Planets could even be captured around other planets to form free-floating planet binaries. After the cluster has dispersed some of the captured planets with orbits larger than 106 AU would be slowly disrupted by the galactic tide and likely become free floating again through encounters with other field stars or giant molecular clouds.On the origin of planets at very wide orbits from the re-capture of free floating planets, Hagai B.

===Galactic distribution of planets===

The Milky Way is 100,000 light-years across, but most confirmed exoplanets are within a few hundred light years of Earth within range of current telescopes. The Kepler spacecraft has detected many planet candidates further away than this but most of the Kepler candidates have not been confirmed. One method that can detect planets much further away is microlensing. The WFIRST spacecraft could use microlensing to measure the relative frequency of planets in the galactic bulge vs. galactic disk.SAG 11: Preparing for the WFIRST Microlensing Survey, Jennifer Yee So far, the indications are that planets are more common in the disk than the bulge.Toward a New Era in Planetary Microlensing, Andy Gould, September 21, 2010 Estimates of the distance of microlensing events is difficult: the first planet considered with high probability of being in the bulge is MOA-2011-BLG-293Lb at a distance of 7.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 light years).MOA-2011-BLG-293Lb: First Microlensing Planet possibly in the Habitable Zone, V.

Population I, or metal-rich stars, are those young stars whose metallicity is highest. The high metallicity of population I stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than older populations, because planets form by the accretion of metals. The Sun is an example of a metal-rich star. These are common in the spiral arms of the Milky Way. Generally, the youngest stars, the extreme population I, are found farther in and intermediate population I stars are farther out, etc. The Sun is considered an intermediate population I star. Population I stars have regular elliptical orbits around the Galactic Center, with a low relative velocity.[tpl]cite journal| title=An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect|author=Charles H.

Population II, or metal-poor stars, are those with relatively low metallicity which can have hundreds (e.g. BD +17° 3248) or thousands (e.g. Sneden's Star) times less metallicty than the Sun. These objects formed during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate population II stars are common in the bulge near the center of the Milky Way, whereas Population II stars found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters also contain high numbers of population II stars.[tpl]cite journal | author=T.

Different types of galaxies have different histories of star formation and hence planet formation. Planet formation is affected by the ages, metallicites, and orbits of stellar populations within a galaxy and vary between the different types of galaxies. The distribution of the different types of galaxies in the universe depends on their location within galaxy clusters.Habitable Zones in the Universe, G.

==Orbital parameters==

Most known extrasolar planet candidates have been discovered using indirect methods and therefore only some of their physical and orbital parameters can be determined. For example, out of the six independent parameters that define an orbit, the radial-velocity method can determine four: semi-major axis, eccentricity, longitude of periastron, and time of periastron. Two parameters remain unknown: inclination and longitude of the ascending node.
