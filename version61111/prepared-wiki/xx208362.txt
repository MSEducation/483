Cartoon Network is a cable satellite channel that mainly shows animated kids cartoons and was launched on March 30, 1998 which is one year before Disney Channel Turkey was released and three years after Nickelodeon Turkey was launched.

==History==

The channel originally started off on March 30, 1998 with the Checkerboard era. The channel originally ran from 8am to 5pm. Meanwhile from 8pm to 5am in order to fill up the time slot the Sky Comedy Channel (formerly known as Menetary at the time) would takeover. On October 15, 1999 Cartoon Network Turkey along with other countries in Europe split from
the Pan-European version. After the pan-European split, Cartoon Network UK revamped that same day and Turkey revamped not much later on February 21, 2000 with the launch of a theme which had shapes and tiles with lines and footage of characters from various shows shown on Cartoon Network. This lasted until late-2001 in the UK but lasted until 2006 in Turkey and was used throughout Europe.
On August 29, 2000 both Cartoon Network Turkey and Menetary changed to full 24 hour satellite channels and Cartoon Network was moved to channel 501.
On April 23, 2001 Boomerang came to Turkey and much like Cartoon Network it was a 24 hour channel.
On October 7, 2005 the city theme was released on Cartoon Network Turkey along with the rest of Europe which replaced the one used since 1999. The logo for Cartoon Network which had been in used for over 7 years got upgraded to the one used in the US.
On May 24, 2007 Cartoon Network UK once again got rebranded to a similar theme to the one used in 1999. The theme came to Cartoon Network Turkey on December 7, 2007.
The CHECK it theme was introduced on Cartoon Network Turkey on April 4, 2011.
