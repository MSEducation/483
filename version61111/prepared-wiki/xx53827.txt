[tpl]As of|2014|February[/tpl], Lake is working with director Abby Epstein on a documentary about the dangers of hormonal birth control, titled Sweetening the Pill.

The film will explore the flurry of lawsuits related to these methods, as well as alternative options such as Natural Family Planning. Lake and Epstein said, "now birth control is making women sick and so our goal with this film is to wake women up to the unexposed side effects of these powerful medications and the unforeseen consequences of repressing women’s natural cycles."[tpl]cite news|title=Ricki Lake, Abby Epstein Push ‘Sweetening The Pill’ Birth Control Doc |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/ricki-lake-abby-epstein-push-sweetening-the-pill-birth-control-doc/ |first=Jen |last=Yamato |date=February 12, 2014 |accessdate=March 10, 2014[/tpl]
