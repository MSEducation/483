[[George P贸lya Prize]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematics awards, Awards established in 1969

The George P贸lya Prize is a prize in mathematics, awarded by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. First given in 1969, the prize is named after Hungarian mathematician George P贸lya.  It is now awarded in evenly numbered years. Starting in 1969 the prize money was provided by Frank Harary, who donated the profits from his Graph Theory book. At some point[tpl]when|date=October 2012[/tpl] SIAM took it over.
The prize is given every two years, alternately in two categories: (1) for a notable application of combinatorial theory; (2) for a notable contribution in another area of interest to George P贸lya such as approximation theory, complex analysis, number theory, orthogonal polynomials, probability theory, or mathematical discovery and learning.
The prize is broadly intended to recognize specific recent work. Prize committees may occasionally consider an award for cumulative work, but such awards should be rare.
