[[TMC6]]

Transmembrane channel-like protein 6 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TMC6 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ramoz N, Rueda LA, Bouadjar B, Montoya LS, Orth G, Favre M | title = Mutations in two adjacent novel genes are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 579–81 |date=Nov 2002 | pmid = 12426567 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/ng1044 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: TMC6 transmembrane channel-like 6| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=11322| accessdate = [/tpl] In vivo, TMC6 and its homolog TMC8, interact and form a complex with the zinc transporter 1 (SLC30A1) and localize mostly to the endoplasmic reticulum, but also to the nuclear membrane and Golgi apparatus.[tpl]cite journal|title=Regulation of cellular zinc balance as a potential mechanism of EVER-mediated protection against pathogenesis by cutaneous oncogenic human papillomaviruses|journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=2008-01-21|first=M|last=Lazarczyk|coauthors=C Pons, JA Mendoza, P Cassonnet, Y Jacob, M Favre|volume=205|issue=1|pages=35–42|pmid=18158319 |url=|format=|accessdate=2008-09-19|doi=10.1084/jem.20071311|pmc=2234378 [/tpl]
Inactivating mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 have been implicated as the genetic cause of the rare skin disorder epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is characterized by abnormal susceptibility to human papillomaviruses (HPVs) of the skin resulting in the growth of scaly macules and papules, particularly on the hands and feet.
