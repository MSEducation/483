==History==

===Formation in World War II===

The Squadron was equipped with Mitchells at RAF West Raynham. It then flew its first raid from RAF Foulsham and suffered heavy losses including the aircraft of the squadron commander. After supporting the breakout from the Normandy beachhead in June 1944, the squadron re-located to Melsbroek, Belgium. It supported the allied advance across Europe and from April 1945 it operated from Achmer, Germany.

===Post war===

The Mitchell aircraft were replaced with Mosquitos in September 1945 and the squadron moved to Wahn. It was disbanded upon re-numbering as No. 69 Squadron RAF on 31 March 1946.
