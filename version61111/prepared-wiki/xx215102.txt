The Headboys were a Scottish power pop band, formed in 1977 in Edinburgh, Scotland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=25059238 |title=Myspace |publisher=Profile.myspace.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30[/tpl] They are best known for their 1979 single, "The Shape of Things to Come".
They released an album in 1979 on Robert Stigwood's RSO label, which was produced by Peter Ker (who also worked with The Motors, and Bram Tchaikovsky).
The lack of any other UK chart hit left them labelled as one-hit wonders.
