Boodle Boodle Boodle is a 12" EP by New Zealand band The Clean. Released by Flying Nun Records in 1981, it is one of the more important releases in the Dunedin Sound genre. The EP reached number four in the New Zealand music charts, despite being listed in the singles chart (New Zealand has never had a separate EP chart), and stayed in the top 20 for nearly six months. 
As Flying Nun's first major success, it was largely responsible for the label's continued survival and the start of its growth into New Zealand's most important independent label.Dix, J.

Several of the songs on the EP became very popular parts of The Clean's repertoire, with "Anything Could Happen" in particular becoming one of their trademark songs.
Chris Knox drew the EP's cover, which was based on a promotional photo of the three band members in a bathtub.
