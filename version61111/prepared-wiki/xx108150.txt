Timocleidas was a tyrant of the ancient Greek city-state of Sicyon in the 3rd century BC.  He ruled jointly with Euthydemus, but the two were deposed by the citizens of Sicyon.  They replaced Timocleidas and Euthydemus with Cleinias, although the historian Plutarch believed that Timocleidas ruled jointly with Cleinias.  Timocleidas died during Cleinias's reign.
