Non Thai ([tpl]lang-th|โนนไทย[/tpl]) is a district (amphoe) of Nakhon Ratchasima Province, northeastern Thailand.

==History==

Originally, the area was Khwaeng San Thia (แขวงสันเทียะ). San Thia is Khmer language, meaning a place to fulfill salt. The name refers to the tradition of salt manufacturing in that area.
In 1900, Khwaeng San Thia was changed to an Amphoe and renamed to Non Lao. However already in the following year it was named back to San Thia. In 1919, the district name was changed to be Non Lao again.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=34|issue=0 ก|pages=40–68|title=ประกาศกระทรวงมหาดไทย เรื่อง เปลี่ยนชื่ออำเภอ|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2460/A/40.PDF|date=1917-04-29|language=Thai[/tpl] Finally in the phase of Thai nationalism under Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the district name was changed to be Non Thai in 1939[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=56|issue=0 ก|pages=877–882|title=พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนนามอำเภอ กิ่งอำเภอและตำบลบางแห่ง พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๒|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2482/A/877.PDF|date=1939-09-25|language=Thai[/tpl] to remove the reference to the Lao population in the name.
