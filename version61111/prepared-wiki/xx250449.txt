==Distribution==

P. esculentus appears to be endemic to Australian waters, being found in warm waters from central New South Wales (near Sydney) to Shark Bay, Western Australia,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/areas/systems-research/wild-fisheries/outputs/2008/972/status_short/Brown-Tiger-Prawn.pdf |title=Brown Tiger Prawn (Penaeus esculentus) |publisher=New South Wales Department of Primary Industries |format=PDF |year=2008[/tpl] chiefly at depths of [tpl]convert|16|-|22|m[/tpl]. There is little population structure in the species, with only slight differentiation between regions east and west of the Pleistocene land bridge between Australia and New Guinea.[tpl]cite journal |author=Robert D.

==Fisheries and aquaculture==

Around [tpl]convert|500|t[/tpl] of brown tiger prawns are caught each year. Fisheries in the Torres Strait are worth around A$24 million per year.[tpl]cite book |title=Stock assessment of the Torres Strait Tiger Prawn Fishery (Penaeus esculentus) |author=Michael F. O'Neill  & Clive T. Turnbull |year=2006 |pages=83 |url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Fisheries_SustainableFishing/StockAssessment-TSTigerPrawn-2006-Complete.pdf |publisher=Queensland Department of Primary Industries[/tpl] It is closely related to Penaeus monodon, with which it can hybridise.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Aquaculture |volume=133 |issue=2 |year=1995 |pages=103–111 |doi=10.1016/0044-8486(95)00013-R |title=Interspecific hybridization of the tiger prawns Penaeus monodon and Penaeus esculentus |author=J. A. H. Benzie, M. Kenway, E. Ballment, S. Frusher & L. Trott[/tpl] It has the potential to be used in aquaculture (shrimp farming) since, although it grows less rapidly than P. monodon, it commands higher prices.[tpl]cite journal |title=Commercial grow-out performance and cost-benefit analysis for farm production of the brown tiger shrimp Penaeus esculentus |author=Sandy J.

==Taxonomic history==

William Aitcheson Haswell arrived in Australia in 1878, and began working in a marine zoology laboratory at Watsons Bay. In 1879, he described Penaeus esculentus in a paper in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales, basing his description on material in the Macleay Museum which had come from Port Jackson and Port Darwin, and noting that P. esculentus is "the common edible prawn of Sydney, and Newcastle, etc.".[tpl]Cite journal |author=William Aitcheson Haswell |year=1879 |title=On the Australian species of Penaeus, in the Macleay Museum, Sydney |journal=Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales |volume=4 |series=1 |pages=38–44 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/30154#54[/tpl]
