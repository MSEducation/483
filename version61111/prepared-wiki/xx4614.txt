At age 14 Krush won the 1998 U.S. Women's Chess Championship to become the youngest U.S. Women's Champion ever. She has won the U.S. Championship on four other occasions, in 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uschesschamps.com/bio/krush|title=Irina Krush Bio|publisher=Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis|accessdate=28 May 2012[/tpl]
Krush became widely known for her series of chess training videos, the "Krushing Attacks" series.
Krush gained an additional measure of fame both inside and outside chess circles during the well-publicized "Kasparov versus the World" chess competition in 1999.  Garry Kasparov played the white pieces and the Internet public, via a Microsoft host website, voted on moves for the black pieces, guided by the recommendations of Krush and three of her contemporaries, Étienne Bacrot, Elisabeth Pähtz and Florin Felecan.  On the tenth move, Krush suggested a novelty, for which the World Team voted.  Kasparov said later that he lost control of the game at that point, and wasn't sure whether he was winning or losing.
