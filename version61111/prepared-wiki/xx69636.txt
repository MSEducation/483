[[Roman Catholic Diocese of London, Ontario]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic bishops by diocese, Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Toronto, Organizations based in London, Ontario

The Roman Catholic Diocese of London ([tpl]lang-la|Dioecesis Londonensis[/tpl]) was created out of the Diocese of Toronto, along with the Diocese of Hamilton, Ontario, by Pope Pius IX on February 21, 1856. Pierre-Adolphe Pinsoneault was named the first Bishop of London on May 18 of that year. In 1859, Bishop Pinsoneault moved the seat of the diocese to Sandwich, on the Detroit River; the diocese was transferred back to London in November 1869, under Bishop John Walsh.
The present Cathedral of the Diocese, St. Peter's, was built in a French Gothic Revival style from 1880 to 1885. It was raised to the status of a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII in December, 1961.
The Diocese also runs St. Peter's Seminary, which is now affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. The Diocese covers the counties of Middlesex, Elgin, Norfolk, Oxford, Perth, Huron, Lambton, Kent, and Essex.
