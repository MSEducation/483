Yugh people (pronounced [tpl]IPA-xx|ÉŸuk|[/tpl]; often written Yug) were part of an indigenous group believed to be survivors of an ancient people who originally lived throughout central Siberia. The Yugh people lived along the Yenisei River from Yeniseisk to the mouth of the Dupches River.

==Recent history==

Previously the Yughs were considered part of the northern group of Ket people, but in the 1960s the Yugh were distinguished from the Ket, having their own distinct, although related Yugh language and customs. By the late 1980s the Yugh people, along with their language, had disappeared as a separate ethnic group. By the early 1990s  the Yugh language was considered extinct, as only two or three non-fluent Yugh language speakers remained. The Yugh people and their extinct relatives are referred to as Yeniseians by linguists and ethnographers.
In 1991 the ethnic population consisted of 10 to 15 individuals in the Turukhan Region of the Krasnoyarsk Krai at the Vorogovo settlement.
The 2002 Census recorded 19 ethnic Yugh in all of Russia.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] In the 2010 census, only one ethnic Yugh was counted.2010 Russian census data
