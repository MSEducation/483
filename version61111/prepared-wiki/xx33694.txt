[[Seven twenty-seven]]

CATEGORIES: Stud poker, Blackjack

Seven Twenty-Seven is a vying game similar in some respects
to poker, and often played as a "dealer's choice" variant at
home poker games.
It uses the same equipment and betting system, but the value of
hands does not use traditional poker hand rankings, either high or low.
Rather, only the sum of the cards is used to calculate the worth of a hand.
The game is something of a cross between blackjack hands and poker bluffing.
The game play proceeds like this:
Numbered cards are scored at face value; face cards count for one-half
a point.
Aces count for one and eleven, so a hand with a five and two aces
scores 7 and 27 at the same time.
On showdown, the pot is split in half, with the hand(s) valued closest
to 7 and the hand(s) valued closest to 27 each winning one half of the pot.
If there is a tie where two players are off by the same amount, but in different directions (6 to 8), the lower hand wins. 
If there is an exact tie, that half-pot is split again among the tied players.
Ties are common.
The same player may contest for both high and low, usually because of aces.  A player with a five and two aces can win the whole pot.
There are a few variations in rules that complicate things somewhat:
first, the rule about ties in different directions varies; also, some
players play with a declaration, while others
play cards speak. Still others require players to not go over 7 or 27 to win the respective halves of the pot; in this variant, if everyone is over 7, the player closest to 27 without going over wins the whole pot. Still other players play with other pairs of target numbers (usually 20 points apart, such as 13 and 33, or 16 and 36).
