Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u is the extreme eastern end of the Island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu in the Hawaiian Islands, comprising the remnant of a ridge that rises 647 feet (197 m) above the sea. The cliff at Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u Point forms the eastern tip and is the site of a prominent lighthouse.  The place name of this area, meaning "bulging eye" in Hawaiian, is thought to derive from the name of an image said to have been located in a cave here called Keanaokeakuapōloli. The entire area is quite scenic and a panoramic view is presented at the lookout on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) where the roadway surmounts the cliff just before turning south towards leeward O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and Honolulu.
The Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u area is reached approximately [tpl]convert|2|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] east of Waimānalo Beach on Kalanianaole Highway (State Rte. 72) or from the Honolulu side (south shore; Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Kai) travelling east along the same highway beyond Sandy Beach. The Makapu[tpl]okina[/tpl]u Point State Wayside Park, a [tpl]convert|38|acre|adj=on[/tpl] roadside park, is about midway up the draw on the right-hand side coming from Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Kai.
