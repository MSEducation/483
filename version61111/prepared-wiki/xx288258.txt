[[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968]]

CATEGORIES: Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1968, Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest, 1968 in Spain

Spain participated in and won the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 with the song "La, la, la" by Massiel. The song was written by the members of Dúo Dinámico. 

==Internal selection controversy==

Originally, the artist chosen to perform "La, la, la" at Eurovision was singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat. However, he intended to sing the song in Catalan. The Franco dictatorship would not allow this – and insisted that the entry should be performed in Spanish, official language for all the territories of Spain, although Serrat wanted to claim for the other regional languages of this country, repressed under the Franco dictatorship.
On 29 March 1968, one week before the contest, Massiel was asked to replace Joan Manuel Serrat as Spain's representative at the Eurovision Song Contest.

Massiel performed 15th in the night of the contest, following Ireland and preceding Germany. At the close of voting Massiel had received 29 points, winning the contest for Spain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1968

===Vote rigging allegations===

In May 2008, a documentary by Spanish film-maker Montse Fernández Villa, 1968. Yo viví el mayo español, centred on the effects of May 1968 in Francoist Spain,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/077345/massiel/si/madelman/no/asi/mayo/68/espana|title=Massiel sí, Madelman no: así fue el Mayo del 68 en España|date=3 May 2008|publisher=Público |language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl] and alleged that the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest was rigged by the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who would have sent state television officials across Europe offering cash and promising to buy television series and contract unknown artists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/375057/tongo/eurovision/massiel/|title=TVE 'compró' los votos para que Massiel ganará Eurovisión|date=5 May 2008|publisher=20 minutos|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl] The allegation was based on a testimony by journalist José María Íñigo, a TVE employee at the time, who claimed the rigging was common knowledge and suggested that Spanish record label representatives offered to release albums by Bulgarian and Czech artists (neither Bulgaria nor Czechoslovakia were members of the European Broadcasting Union at the time).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/375709/massiel/eurovision/franco/|title=Vea el vídeo donde José Maríá Iñigo 'descubre' a Massiel|date=5 May 2008|publisher=20 minutos|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl]
The documentary claimed that the contest should in fact have been won by the United Kingdom's entry – "Congratulations" performed by Cliff Richard – which finished second by one vote.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/1926993/How-General-Franco-cheated-Cliff-Richard-out-of-Eurovision-title.html|title=How Franco cheated Cliff out of Eurovision title|last=Govan|first=Fiona|date=4 May 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl] Massiel, the performer of the winning entry, was outraged by the allegations, and claimed that if there had been fixes, "other singers, who were more keen on Franco's regime, would have benefited". José María Iñigo, author of the statement in the documentary, personally apologized to Massiel and claimed that he had repeated a widespread rumour and that his words had been taken out of context. Both Massiel and Iñigo accused television channel La Sexta, broadcaster of the documentary, of manufacturing the scandal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/05/05/television/1210021065.html|title=Massiel e Iñigo acusan a La Sexta de "urdir todo para favorecer a Chiquilicuatre"|date=6 May 2008|publisher=El Mundo|language=Spanish|accessdate=3 December 2009[/tpl]
