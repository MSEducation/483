Negroland or Nigritia,African-Institute - Sudan was a term invented and used by Europeans in colonial times, for an inland region in West African an area described as populated with "Negro people."

The term is probably a direct translation of the Arabic term Bilad Al Sudan meaning "Land of the blacks", corresponding to about the same area. Some of the greatest states of those considered part of Negroland was the Bornu Empire and the Sokoto Caliphate.
After about the 1960s, however, when civil rights started improving for people of African ancestry, the term "Negro" has been widely considered an ethnic slur in English-speaking countries.The Name "Negro": Its Origin and Evil Use
