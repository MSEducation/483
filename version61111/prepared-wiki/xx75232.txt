==Early life==

Noble was born in Cramlington, Northumberland.birth Reg'd Newcastle upon Tyne Apr/May/June 1976 vol2 p0757 Both of his parents were teachers.
He currently lives with his family on the outskirts of Newcastle upon Tyne, after returning to the UK in 2010 from St Andrews,  Melbourne, Australia.

==Stand-up performance==

Noble's stand-up routine is a largely improvised and surreal performance with a stream of consciousness delivery. He is often referred to as a randomist. Often, a large percentage of his set becomes based around heckles and conversations with members of the audience. Although he does often have a few set topics which he performs throughout a tour, he describes the planning for the entire show as "about four words on a piece of scrap paper".Ross Noble interview, Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 on 2006-11-06
Noble often mimes actions on-stage to help the audience visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is ("just a stick with a pointy bit on it") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of 24 in which Jack Bauer escapes a cell using a greasy goose.[tpl]cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Garrick Theatre, London | date =  2004-10-11[/tpl]
Noble's style is recognized as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal conversation. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask a member of the audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded at the end of his shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later.[tpl]cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = The City Hall, Newcastle-upon-Tyne | date =  2006-11-06[/tpl] This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind "Tends to wander off point slightly," and later added that "he can open up too many tangents at onceâ€¦ it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." At which point, he forgot what he was talking about.[tpl]cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Open-Air Theatre, Regents Park, London | date =  2004-10-11[/tpl]

==Career==

===Early years===

Noble is originally from Cramlington, Northumberland, England. "The ultimate place to live" helped him with his career - he found little to do in his hometown so he became particularly imaginative.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/theatre/2003/11/ross_noble_interview.shtml | title = The Noble art of stand-up | accessdate = 2006-09-27 | publisher = BBC[/tpl] At the age of 11, it was discovered that he was dyslexic. Because of this, Noble decided to work within a career which did not rely on academic skills. He had a brief stint as a street juggler with a friend, and aspired to join a circus. He joined a clown troupe and sold balloons as a stilt-walker, before deciding to become a comedian after winning tickets to a comedy show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/A-noble-comic/2005/03/18/1110913752482.html|title=Here's one I didn't prepare earlier|publisher=The Age|author=Luke Benedictus|date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2007-01-03[/tpl] As a teenager, Ross was a member of the youth theatre at the People's Theatre in Heaton. He was also a backing singer for the Kane Gang. In 1997, he was doing warm-ups at the BBC for Friday Night Armistice.
Noble has been performing stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and appeared in his local comedy club at the age of 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen. Noble studied performing arts at Newcastle College, after he told his careers adviser at school he wanted to be a comedian. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught is not important in being a good performer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/stage/2003/01/ross_noble2.shtml | title = BBC - South Yorkshire Stage - Ross Noble interview | accessdate = 2006-12-01 | publisher = BBC[/tpl]

===Stand-up career===

Since starting as a stand-up comedian, Noble has won many awards, including a Time Out award winner in 2000 for his Edinburgh Festival Fringe show Chickenmaster, and a Perrier Award nomination in 1999 for another Edinburgh show Laser Boy. He has since achieved great popularity in both the UK and Australia, where he has toured extensively every year since 2001. Noble's 2003 show Unrealtime was the best-selling show at the Edinburgh Fringe,[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3179241.stm | title = Fringe passes million tickets mark | accessdate = 2006-11-06 |date= 2003-08-25 | publisher = BBC News[/tpl] before transferring to London's West End for a month long season at the Garrick Theatre where it played to packed houses. A recording of this tour was shown on BBC Two in 2004, and a double DVD set was released later that year.
During 2004, Noble performed at the Edinburgh Fringe and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and other venues with his show Noodlemeister. His 2005 UK tour, Randomist, ran from September to December, of which he continued in Australia during 2006. In April 2006, Noble was involved in a motorbike accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his arm in a sling.[tpl]cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist, Australia Tour | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Australia | date =  2006-11-06[/tpl] During his 'Things' tour, in Bristol on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his Stephen Hawking impression.
Whilst performing in Edinburgh in September 2006 for his Fizzy Logic tour, a fight broke out during the gig, caused by a drunken member of the audience arguing with another. Also, in his Edinburgh gig, some one gave him a basket of mini-muffins with faces printed on them; this is related to a sketch from Noble's DVD 'Sonic Waffle', in which he mentions his hobby of finding faces in muffins.Ross Noble interview, Nemone on BBC 6 Music (2006-09-27) At another gig, he found someone filming the show on their mobile phone and confiscated the phone. He then recorded a video on it himself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uKzeCaMpAY |title=Ross Noble |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-09-04 |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] After finding that several people recorded his finale skit, "The falling owl stunt", Noble encouraged the entire audience to record the stunt simultaneously and post them on YouTube, in an attempt to achieve, "The largest number of videos showing exactly the same thing."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlqJy6XMSjI |title=Ross Noble World Record Attempt |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] He then took his tour to Australia in February 2007, during which he filmed a documentary about his travels around the country.[tpl]cite web|author=StuntBaby |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVcs0eLwcyY |title=Ross Noble IN |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl]
In 2007 Noble finished his Nobleism tour in the UK[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] with a show in Liverpool on 21 October 2007 which was screened live to 43 Vue cinemas. If the event had sold out, he would have played to over 10,000 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/08/09/5634/nobles_big-screen_gig|title=Noble's big-screen gig |publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=2007-08-09|accessdate=2007-08-10[/tpl] Upon walking offstage, Noble enquired if the broadcast had succeeded and was informed by a technician that "it worked perfectly... but we lost Aberdeen". To this day, Noble maintains that this is the "coolest thing anyone has ever said" to him.Ross Noble, post-show conversation, Nonsensory Overload, Aberdeen, 16 October 2010
Noble likes to have spontaneous material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble's 2005 Randomist tour, a member of the audience put his feet up on the stage, and later removed his shoes and put them on the stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.Fizzy Logic Tour, Edinburgh 2006-09-09, Nobleism Tour, Edinburgh 2007-09-08
Noble performed at the 2008 Latitude Festival and rounded off his set by leading everyone in the tent in a huge conga line (which quickly turned into a stampede) to a vegan food stand so they could all ask for pies and sausage rolls.[tpl]cite web|author=Tim Clark |url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/festivals/latitude/2008/latitude-2008-ross-noble.html |title=Ross Noble runs riot at Latitude with 3,000 strong conga to vegan stall |publisher=Such Small Portions |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=120&p=4097&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title=The latest music blogs, free MP3s, best new bands, music videos, movie trailers and news analysis |publisher=Nme.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl]
The DVD of his show Nobleism was released in November 2009, after a legal battle with his previous manager prevented a release in 2008 as originally planned.

====Hosted series====

Besides making various guest appearances, Noble has been the host of an Australian radio show, and the subject of two BBC radio series. Noble's worldwide travels as a stand-up were the subject of his own BBC Radio 4 series Ross Noble Goes Global, produced by Danny Wallace. This series, recorded between April and May 2001, saw him recording his observations as he travelled around various countries. In January 2005, Noble joined Australian comedienne Terri Psiakis in co-hosting Ross and Terri, the weekday lunch shift on national radio station Triple J. Following on from Ross Noble Goes Global, Radio 4 broadcast a new series called Ross Noble Onâ€¦ during January to February 2007. The 4-episode series followed his 2006 UK tour, featuring performances in Brighton, York, Manchester and Newcastle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/rossnoble.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 - Ross Noble |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15[/tpl] All of the Radio 4 programmes have since been released as BBC audio CDs.
Noble once again teamed up with Terri Psiakis on Triple J for two weeks of Ross and Terri in January 2006. This second period on Triple J also saw Ross and Terri founding "Pants Across Australia", during which, 4 pairs of trousers were sent to the north, south, east and west extremities of Australia and then back to Melbourne.[tpl]cite web | title = Ross and Terri Homepage | publisher = Triple J | url = http://www.triplej.net.au/rossandterri/ | accessdate = 2007-07-23[/tpl] Ross and Terri did not return to this slot in 2007, however Terri Psiakis and Amy Blackmur (the pair's producer from their 2006 show) did present a limited run of shows during a similar time frame earlier in the year, under the working title "T 'n' A" ("Terri and Amy"). As well as this, Terri and Amy decided to continue in the evening slot of 6pm - 10pm.
In 2007, Stunt Baby Productions filmed a documentary about Ross Noble's 95-day Fizzy Logic tour of Australia. Ross Noble travels by motorbike when touring, which for this tour travelled on a BMW R1150GS Adventure (as mentioned during the encore of one of his Canberra gigs), covering a distance of approximately 26,000Â km around Australia clockwise from Brisbane. The show was broadcast as "Ross Noble's Australian Trip" on UK TV channel Five from Monday 28 September 2009 at 10pm for 6 weeks, repeating at the same time on Fiver on the following Thursdays. The show aired in Australia on Channel 10 on Mondays at 10:00pm.
Noble hosts his own show on Dave titled Freewheeling. The show is described as an anti-travelogue around Britain, Noble takes the freestyle philosophy he embraces in his live shows and utilizes his trademark audience participation gimmick and transfers it to television as he rides around the UK on his motorbike taking live requests on Twitter instructing him on where he should go next, making the road trip entirely unpredictable. It airs on October 29.

==Personal life==

Following the 2009 Victorian bushfires, Noble has used the event in his act and donates profits from the sale of the show's programme/poster (or "postergram" as it is called) to a charitable fund to help those similarly affected.
Noble supports British charity Riders for Health and donated money earned from limited edition signed posters together with bucket collections after each gig from his Nonsensory Overload tour to Riders for Health. This raised Â£42,000 for Riders. He has attended their fundraising event Day of Champions on a number of occasions, most recently at Silverstone in 2010. He also voiced the Riders for Health BBC Radio 4 appeal aired just before Christmas 2010.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
In May 2011, to celebrate his 20th anniversary of stand up, Noble teamed up with Triumph Motorcycles which were also celebrating a milestone, having just produced their 500,000th bikes (since the company was relaunched 20 years earlier) and did the "Sit Down" tour. Using only Twitter as a guide, Noble travelled around the UK on the unique Triumph Speed Triple guided by his Twitter followers and accompanied by a film crew. The Triumph Speed Triple was auctioned by Bonhams at the Goodwood festival of speed on 1 July 2011, with all the proceeds (Â£8,000) going to Noble's charity of choice, Riders for Health.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===DVD releases===

Several recorded performances of Noble are available on DVD, notable for the large amount of extras that appear on them.[ref]
Play.com - Ross Noble: Fizzy Logic[/ref] Noble's recorded shows are mostly dominated by Noble with just a few moments of audience participation. Throughout the rest of his tour Noble is more relaxed, with the audience joining in. However the audience can sometimes dominate a show, as seen on the extra "Live in Birmingham" gig on the Randomist DVD.[tpl]cite web | last = Noble | first = Ross | title = Ross Noble Merchandise, Audio and Video | publisher = Ross Noble.co.uk | url = http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/store/merch_av.asp | accessdate = 2007-10-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194054/http://rossnoble.co.uk/store/merch_av.asp  |archivedate = 11 October 2007[/tpl] Although on the official website it states that all of Ross' DVDs are region free, with the exception of Unrealtime.,[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] his latest two DVD's have only been released in Region 2 format so far.

Noble uploaded his weekly free clip, entitled "Toucan Bastards", to his official YouTube channel, at the end of which he announced his new DVD. Upon its release it was confirmed to be the never before seen 2008 tour. The DVD is slightly different from Ross' previous releases due to the fact that rather than one continuous main show it is split into six pieces spreading over two discs approximately 45 to 50 minutes each. The DVD also includes a third disc containing bonus material including a commentary on only one of the six shows, unseen bits taken from the show and Ross' Sit Down Tour.
