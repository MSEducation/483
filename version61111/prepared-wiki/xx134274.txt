TasTAFE is an Australian tertiary body of the Australian state-based Technical and Further Education system run by the Tasmanian State Government. 

==Previous structures==

It was originally known as TAFE Tasmania and included two institutes, the Institute of TAFE Tasmania and the Drysdale Institute.
The Institute of TAFE Tasmania (including the Drysdale Institute) were wound up in 2008 and a new legal authority—the Tasmanian Polytechnic and Skills Institute—began operating as a state-wide training organisation on 1 January 2009.

===Tasmanian Polytechnic===

The Tasmanian Polytechnic was created from the merger of Tasmanian Colleges and TAFE Tasmania,http://search.archives.tas.gov.au/default.aspx?detail=1&type=A&id=TA01532 following the Tasmanian State Government's reform of post-year-10 education in 2009. This significant restructure envisaged taking place over a three-year period with the expectation of all colleges making the transition by 2011.http://www.yourchoice.tas.gov.au/ TAFE Tasmania had been created by combining the Institutes of TAFE in Hobart (formerly Hobart Technical College, which operated from 1888 to 1994),http://search.archives.tas.gov.au/default.aspx?detail=1&type=A&id=TA01214 Launceston, North West and Drysdale (Tasmania's provider of training in hospitality and tourism), with other institutions.http://search.archives.tas.gov.au/default.aspx?detail=1&type=A&id=TA01532
One of three new organisations created through the Tasmania Tomorrow reforms, the Tasmanian Polytechnic focuses on providing practical and hands-on learning for students of all ages. It co-operates with the Tasmanian Academy and with the Tasmanian Skills Institute to deliver more positive outcomes for students, for the local economy and for Tasmania.
In the second semester of 2013, the Polytechnic was dissolved and a reformed TAFE Tasmania began operating as TasTAFE.http://www.tastafe.tas.edu.au/about_us/Pages/General-information.aspx
