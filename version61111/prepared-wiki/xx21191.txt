Taipei, officially known as Taipei City ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|t|aɪ|ˈ|p|eɪ[/tpl]; [tpl]zh|t=臺北市 or 台北市|p=Táiběi Shì|poj=Tâi-pak Chhī[/tpl]), is the capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Situated at the northern tip of Taiwan, Taipei is located on the Tamsui River; it is about [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Keelung, a port city on the Pacific Ocean. It lies in the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed bounded by the two relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city's western border.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?categid=36&recordid=9152|title=Taipei City Government: Home – I.

Taipei is the political, economic, and cultural center of Taiwan. Considered to be a global city,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2008t.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2008|accessdate=2010-01-25[/tpl] Taipei is part of a major industrial area. Railways, high-speed rail, highways, airports, and bus lines connect Taipei with all parts of the island. The city is served by two airports – Taipei Songshan and Taiwan Taoyuan.

==History==

Taipei was founded in the early 18th century under the Qing Dynasty rule and became an important center for overseas trade in the 19th century. The Qing Dynasty made Taipei the provincial capital of Taiwan in 1886 when Taiwan was separated from Fujian Province to be its own province of the dynasty.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580809/Taipei/231554/History |title=Taipei (Taiwan) :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-07-04[/tpl]
Japan acquired Taiwan in 1895 from Qing Dynasty under the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the First Sino-Japanese War. Taiwan became a colony of Imperial Japan with Taipei as its capital, in which Taipei was administered under the Taihoku Prefecture. Taiwan's Japanese rulers embarked on an extensive program of advanced urban planning that featured extensive railroad links. A number of Taipei landmarks and cultural institutions date from this period.
The Republic of China took over Taiwan in 1945 following Japanese surrender. After losing Mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) relocated the ROC government to Taiwan and declared Taipei the provisional capital of the Republic of China in December 1949. In 1990 Taipei provided the backdrop for the Wild Lily student rallies that moved Taiwanese society from one-party rule to multi-party democracy. The city is today home to Taiwan's democratically elected national government.

===First settlements===

The region known as the Taipei Basin was home to Ketagalan tribes before the eighteenth century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?recordid=109|title=History|publisher=Taipei City Government|date=2004-03-29|accessdate=2009-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050507005944/http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?recordid=109 |archivedate = May 7, 2005[/tpl] Han Chinese mainly from Fujian Province of Qing Dynasty began to settle in the Taipei Basin in 1709.[tpl]cite book|last=Kelly|first=Robert|title=Taiwan|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2007|page=46|isbn=1-74104-548-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yKUQE-xdQhsC&pg=PA46|accessdate=2009-07-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?recordid=108|title=History of Taipei|publisher=Taipei City Government|accessdate=2009-08-11[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] In the late 19th century, the Taipei area, where the major Han Chinese settlements in northern Taiwan and one of the designated overseas trade ports, Tamsui, were located, gained economic importance due to the booming overseas trade, especially that of tea exportation. In 1875, the northern part of Taiwan was separated from Taiwan Prefecture ([tpl]zh|c=臺灣府[/tpl]) and incorporated into the new Taipei Prefecture as a new administrative entity of the Qing Dynasty.[tpl]cite book|last=Marsh|first=Robert|title=The Great Transformation|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|year=1996|page=84|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2p15NToHH2oC&pg=PA85|isbn=1-56324-788-7|accessdate=2009-07-27[/tpl] Having been established adjoining the flourishing townships of Bangka, Dalongdong, and Twatutia, the new prefectural capital was known as Chengnei ([tpl]zh|c=城內[/tpl]), "the inner city", and government buildings were erected there. From 1875 (during the Qing Dynasty) until the beginning of Japanese rule in 1895, Taipei was part of Tamsui County of the Taipei Prefecture and the prefectural capital. In 1886, when Taiwan was proclaimed a province of Qing Dynasty, Taipei city was made the provincial capital. Taipei remained a temporary provincial capital before it officially became the capital of Taiwan in 1894. All that remains from the old Qing Dynasty city is the north gate. The west gate and city walls were demolished by the Japanese while the south gate, little south gate, and east gate were extensively modified by the Kuomintang (KMT) and have lost much of their original character.

===Japanese rule===

As settlement for losing the First Sino-Japanese War, China ceded the island of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan in 1895 as part of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. After the Japanese take-over, Taipei, called Taihoku in Japanese, was retained as the capital and emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government. During that time the city acquired the characteristics of an administrative center, including many new public buildings and housing for civil servants. Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the period of Japanese rule, including the Presidential Building which was the Office of the Taiwan Governor-General ([tpl]lang-ja|台湾総督府〔臺灣總督府〕[/tpl]).
During Japanese rule, Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of Taihoku Prefecture ([tpl]lang-ja|台北州〔臺北州〕[/tpl]). It included Bangka (艋舺), Twatutia (大稻埕), and Jōnai (城內) among other small settlements. The eastern village Matsuyama (松山庄) was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938. Upon the Japanese defeat in the Pacific War and its consequent surrender in August 1945, the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) assumed control of Taiwan. Subsequently, a temporary Office of the Taiwan Province Administrative Governor was established in Taipei City.[tpl]cite book|last=Marsh|first=Robert|title=The Great Transformation|publisher=M. E.

===Martial law and modern democracy===

In 1947 the KMT government under Chiang Kai-shek declared island-wide martial law in Taiwan as a result of the 2-28 Incident, which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang. Two years later, on December 7, 1949, Chiang and the Kuomintang were forced to flee mainland China by the Communists at the Chinese Civil War. The refugees declared Taipei to be the provisional capital of a continuing Republic of China, with the official capital at Nanjing (Nanking) even though that city was under Communist control.[tpl]cite book|last=Ng|first=Franklin|title=The Taiwanese Americans|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|page=10|isbn=0-313-29762-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lPzsB_wJQW0C&pg=PA10|accessdate=2009-07-27[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/asia_pacific/2000/taiwan_elections2000/1949_1955.stm|title=Taiwan Timeline – Retreat to Taiwan|year=2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-07-13[/tpl] Taipei has never been declared the official capital but Kuomintang loyalists today generally regard it as such. In 2004 elementary textbook references stating "Nanjing is the capital of the Republic of China" were replaced with "Taipei is the location of the central government of the Republic of China."
Taipei expanded greatly in the decades after 1949, and as approved on December 30, 1966 by the Executive Yuan, Taipei was declared a special centrally administered municipality on July 1, 1967 and given the administrative status of a province. In the following year, Taipei City expanded again by annexing Shilin, Beitou, Neihu, Nangang, Jingmei, and Muzha. At that time, the city's total area increased fourfold through absorbing several outlying towns and villages and the population increased to 1.56 million people.
The city's population, which had reached one million in the early 1960s, also expanded rapidly after 1967, exceeding two million by the mid-1970s. Although growth within the city itself gradually slowed thereafter — its population had become relatively stable by the mid-1990s — Taipei remained one of the world's most densely populated urban areas, and the population continued to increase in the region surrounding the city, notably along the corridor between Taipei and Keelung.
In 1990 Taipei's 16 districts were consolidated into the current 12 districts.[tpl]cite book|title=Republic of China Yearbook|publisher=Kwang Hwa Publishing Co.|year=2002|page=120|isbn=957-9227-35-7[/tpl] Mass democracy rallies that year in the plaza around Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall led to an island-wide transition to multi-party democracy, where legislators are chosen via regularly scheduled popular elections, during the presidency of Lee Teng-Hui.

==Culture==

===Tourism===

====Commemorative sites and museums====

The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is a famous monument, landmark and tourist attraction that was erected in memory of General Chiang Kai-shek, former President of the Republic of China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cksmh.gov.tw/eng/index.php|title=National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] The structure stands at the east end of Memorial Hall Square, site of the National Concert Hall and National Theater and their adjacent parks as well as the memorial. The landmarks of Liberty Square stand within sight of Taiwan's Presidential Building in Taipei's Zhongzheng District.
The National Taiwan Museum sits nearby in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park and has worn its present name since 1999. The museum is Taiwan's oldest, founded on October 24, 1908 by Taiwan's Japanese colonial government (1895-1945) as the Taiwan Governor's Museum. It was launched with a collection of 10,000 items to celebrate the opening of the island's North-South Railway.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntm.gov.tw/en/about/1a.aspx|title=National Taiwan Museum: History|publisher=National Taiwan Museum|accessdate=2009-08-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080422025208/http://www.ntm.gov.tw/en/about/1a.aspx |archivedate = April 22, 2008[/tpl] In 1915 a new museum building opened its doors in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park. This structure and the adjacent Governor's residence (now Presidential Office Building, served as the two most recognizable public buildings in Taiwan during its period of Japanese rule.
The National Palace Museum is a vast art gallery and museum built around a permanent collection centered on ancient Chinese artifacts. It should not be confused with the Palace Museum in Beijing (which it is named after); both institutions trace their origins to the same institution. The collections were divided in the 1940s as a result of the Chinese Civil War.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/newshour/news/story/2007/02/070208_taipei_museum.shtml |title= Taipei's National Palace Museum |accessdate= 2008-06-04 |publisher=BBC[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/03/AR2007060300069_pf.html|title=Ancient China's treasures go digital|publisher=Washington Post|date=2007-06-03|accessdate=2009-08-09 | first=Dan | last=Nystedt[/tpl] The National Palace Museum in Taipei now boasts a truly international collection while housing one of the world's largest collections of artifacts from ancient China.
The strikingly designed Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines stands just 200 metres across the road from the National Palace Museum. The museum offers magnificent displays of art and historical items by Taiwanese aborigines along with a range of multimedia displays.
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum was established in 1983 as the first museum in Taiwan dedicated to modern art. The museum is housed in a building designed for the purpose that takes inspiration from Japanese designs. Most art in the collection is by Taiwanese artists since 1940. Over 3,000 art works are organized into 13 groups.
The National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near Taipei 101 in Xinyi District is named in honor of a founding father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. The hall, completed on May 16, 1972.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yatsen.gov.tw/english/briefintro.htm?PHPSESSID=fccc2846014d126b531db8a98c3694b0|title=History and Introduction of the Hall|accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] originally featured exhibits that depicted revolutionary events in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Today it functions as multi-purpose social, educational, concert and cultural center for Taiwan's citizens.
In 2001 a new museum opened as MoCA Taipei or Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei (台北當代藝術館). The museum is housed in a building that formerly housed Taipei City government offices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mocataipei.org.tw/_english/1_about/0_overview.asp|title=From History to Contemporary|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei|accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl]

===Festivals and events===

Many yearly festivals are held in Taipei. In recent years some festivals, such as the Double Ten Day fireworks and concerts, are increasingly hosted on a rotating basis by a number of cities around Taiwan.
When New Year's Eve arrives on the solar calendar, thousands of people converge on Taipei's Xinyi District for parades, outdoor concerts by popular artists, street shows, round-the clock nightlife. The high point is of course the countdown to midnight, when Taipei 101 assumes the role of the world's largest fireworks platform.
The Taipei Lantern Festival concludes the Lunar New Year holiday. The timing of the city's lantern exhibit coincides with the national festival in Pingxi, when thousands of fire lanterns are released into the sky.[tpl]cite web | title=CHAPTER 19 Tourism | work=Republic of China Yearbook 2008 | publisher=ROC Government Information Office| url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ch19.html | accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl] The city's lantern exhibit rotates among different downtown locales from year to year, including Liberty Square, Taipei 101, and Zhongshan Hall in Ximending.
On Double Ten Day, patriotic celebrations are held in front of the Presidential Building. Other annual festivals include Ancestors Day (Tomb-Sweeping Day), the Dragon Boat Festival, the Ghost Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival (Moon Festival).

==Romanization==

The spelling "Taipei" derives from the Wade-Giles romanization T'ai-pei.[tpl]cite book|last=Skinner|first=G.

==Geography==

Taipei City is located in the Taipei Basin in northern Taiwan.[ref]
[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.taipeitravel.net/user/Article.aspx?Lang=2&SNo=04000078 | title=About Taipei – Taipei Profile | publisher= Department of Information and Tourism, Taipei City Government | accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl][/ref] It is bordered by the Xindian River on the south and the Tamsui River on the west. The generally low-lying terrain of the central areas on the western side of the municipality slopes upward to the south and east and especially to the north, where it reaches [tpl]convert|1120|m|ft|0[/tpl] at Cising Mountain, the highest (inactive) volcano in Taiwan in Yangmingshan National Park. The northern districts of Shilin and Beitou extend north of the Keelung River and are bordered by Yangmingshan National Park. The Taipei city limits cover an area ranked sixteenth of twenty-five among all counties and cities in Taiwan.
Two peaks, Cising Mountain and Mt. Datun, rise to the northeast of the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?recordid=116|title=Geography/Population|publisher=Taipei City Government|date=2004-03-29|accessdate=2009-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050127015838/http://english.taipei.gov.tw/TCG/index.jsp?recordid=116 |archivedate = January 27, 2005[/tpl] Cising Mountain is located on the Tatun Volcano Group and the tallest mountain at the rim of the Taipei Basin, with its main peak at [tpl]convert|1120|m|ft[/tpl]. Mt. Datun's main peak is [tpl]convert|1092|m|ft[/tpl]. These former volcanoes make up the western section of Yangmingshan National Park, extending from Mt. Datun northward to Mt. Caigongkeng (菜公坑山). Located on a broad saddle between two mountains, the area also contains the marshy Datun Pond.
To the southeast of the city lie the Songshan Hills and the Qingshui Ravine, which form a barrier of lush woods.

===Climate===

Taipei has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climateTaipei City - Academia SinicaLiving in Taipei - Mandarin Training Center, a subsidiary of National Taiwan Normal UniversityTaipei, Taiwan; the sister city of Los Angeles - Los Angeles City Council (Köppen: Cfa). Summers are long, hot and humid, accompanied by occasional heavy rainstorms and typhoons, while winters are short, generally mild and generally very foggy due to the northeasterly winds from the vast Siberian High being intensified by the pooling of this cooler air in the Taipei Basin. Due to Taiwan's location in the Pacific Ocean, it is affected by the Pacific typhoon season, which occurs between June and October.

===Air quality===

Motor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of air pollution in Taipei. The levels of fine particulate matter, including PAHs, are consistently more serious in the mornings as there is less air movement; sunlight helps clear up some pollutants, which tend to be trapped close to the ground.[tpl]cite news|last=Oung |first=Angelica |url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/04/2003359365|title= Taipei air pollution alarming: scientists|publisher=The Taipei Times |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2009-07-27[/tpl] When compared to other Asian cities, however, Taipei has "excellent" capabilities for managing air quality in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/13786.html|title=Pollution is a major threat for Asian cities, says new report|publisher=EarthTimes|date=2006-12-14|accessdate=2010-07-22[/tpl] Occasionally, dust storms from Mainland China can temporarily bring poor air quality to the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2008/03/01/145206/Poor-air.htm|title=Poor air quality forecast due to Chinese sandstorm|publisher=The China Post|date=2008-03-01|accessdate=2010-07-22[/tpl]

==Economy==

As the center of Taiwan's largest conurbation, Taipei has been at the center of rapid economic development in the country and has now become one of the global cities in the production of high technology and its components.[tpl]cite book|last=Kwok|first=R. Yin-Wang|title=Globalizing Taipei: the political economy of spatial development|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=163|isbn=0-415-35451-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wovltKk7JUkC&pg=RA1-PA1636|accessdate=2010-01-26[/tpl] This is part of the so-called Taiwan Miracle which has seen dramatic growth in the city following foreign direct investment in the 1960s. Taiwan is now a creditor economy, holding one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves of over US$403 billion as of December 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eng.stat.gov.tw/point.asp?index=5|title=National Statistics, Republic of China – Latest Indicators|publisher=Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics|accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl]
Despite the Asian financial crisis, the economy continues to expand at about 5% per year, with virtually full employment and low inflation. [tpl]as of|2007[/tpl], the nominal GDP of the core city of Taipei has accrued to nearly US$160 billion, while the metro region of Taipei has a GDP (nominal) of around US$260 billion, a record that would rank it 13th among world cities by GDP. The GDP per capita of Taipei is US$48,400, and the second highest in Asia behind Tokyo, which has a GDP per capita of US$65,453.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cens.com.tw/cens/html/en/news/news_inner_26710.html | title=Taipei City Has Second-highest Per Capita GDP in Asia: TIER | publisher= China Economic News Service | date=2009-03-19 | accessdate=2009-07-13 [/tpl]

==Government==

Taipei City is a special municipality which is directly under the Executive Yuan (Central Government) of ROC. The mayor of Taipei City had been an appointed position since Taipei's conversion to a centrally administered municipality in 1967 until the first public election was held in 1994.[tpl]cite book|last=Kwok|first=R. Yin-Wang|title=Globalizing Taipei|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=201|isbn=0-415-35451-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wovltKk7JUkC&pg=RA1-PA201|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] The position has a four-year term and is elected by direct popular vote.  The first elected mayor was Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Ma Ying-jeou took office in 1998 for two terms, before handing it over to Hau Lung-pin who won the 2006 mayoral election on December 9, 2006.[tpl]cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E0DE1431F933A25751C1A9609C8B63 | title=Taiwan Leader's Party Wins in Mayoral Vote, but Recount Is Sought | publisher= The New York Times | date=2006-12-10 | accessdate=2009-07-14 | first=Keith | last=Bradsher[/tpl] Both Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-Jeou went on to become President of the Republic of China.
Based on the outcomes of previous elections in the past decade, the vote of the overall constituency of Taipei City shows a slight inclination towards the pro-KMT camp (the Pan-Blue Coalition);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/12/10/2003339853|title=Elections 2006: Election results a headache for Ma|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2006-12-10|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] however, the pro-DPP camp (the Pan-Green Coalition) also has considerable support.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/01/13/2003397019|title=KMT wins two-thirds majority|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2008-01-13|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]
Ketagalan Boulevard, where the Presidential Office Building and other government structures are situated, is often the site of mass gatherings such as inauguration and national holiday parades, receptions for visiting dignitaries, political demonstrations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/09/11/2003327070|title=Rain dampens enthusiasm for protest|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2006-09-11|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/08/30/2003421826|title=Pro-localization groups stage rally on Ma's 100th day|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2008-08-30|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] and public festivals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/09/06/2003326391|title=Clear Ketagalan ahead of Double Ten, Wang urges|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2006-09-06|accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]

===Garbage recycling===

Taipei City is also famous for its effort in garbage recycling, which has become such a good international precedent that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=93434&ctNode=1337&mp=1|title=Recycling: Taiwan’s Way of Life|publisher=Taiwan Review|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-08-31[/tpl] This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the Shanghai World Expo 2010.

===Administrative divisions===

Taipei City is divided up into 12 administrative districts (區 qu).[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/np.asp?ctNode=27185&mp=100002|title=Administrative Districts|publisher=Taipei City Government|accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl] Each district is further divided up into villages (里), which are further sub-divided up into neighborhoods (鄰).

===City planning===

The city is characterized by straight roads and public buildings of grand Western architectural styles.[tpl]cite book|last=Jones|first=Ian|title=City Museums and City Development|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2008|page=102|isbn=0-7591-1180-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sCqPiH5-5-wC&pg=PA101|accessdate=2009-08-14[/tpl] The city is built on a square grid configuration, however these blocks are huge by international standards ([tpl]convert|500|m|2|abbr=on[/tpl] sides). However there is little uniformed planning within these blocks; therefore lanes (perpendicular to streets) and alleys (parallel with street, or conceptually, perpendicular to the lane) spill out from the main throughways. These minor roads are not always perpendicular and sometimes cut through the block diagonally.
Although development began in the western districts of the city from trade, the eastern districts of the city have become the downtown. Many of the western districts, already in decline, have become targets of new urban renewal projects.

==Transportation==

Public transport accounts for a substantial portion of different modes of transport in Taiwan, with Taipei residents having the highest utilization rate at 34.1%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20100206-197064.html|title=Only 13% using Taiwan's public transport|publisher=The China Post/Asia News Network|date=2010-02-06|accessdate=2010-02-08[/tpl] Private transport consists of motor scooters, private cars, and bicycles. Motor-scooters often weave between cars and occasionally through oncoming traffic. Respect for traffic laws, once scant, has improved with deployment of traffic cameras and increasing numbers of police roadblocks checking riders for alcohol consumption and other offenses.
Taipei Station serves as the comprehensive hub for the subway, bus, conventional rail, and high-speed rail. A contactless smartcard, known as EasyCard, can be used for all modes of public transit as well as several retail outlets. It contains credits that are deducted each time a ride is taken.[tpl]cite web | title=Metro Tickets | publisher=Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation| url=http://www.trtc.com.tw/e/service.asp?catid=%E4%B9%98%E8%BB%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97&small=%E8%BB%8A%E7%A5%A8%E7%A8%AE%E9%A1%9E | accessdate=2009-07-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822071721/http://www.trtc.com.tw/e/service.asp?catid=%E4%B9%98%E8%BB%8A%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97&small=%E8%BB%8A%E7%A5%A8%E7%A8%AE%E9%A1%9E |archivedate = August 22, 2008[/tpl] The EasyCard is read via proximity sensory panels on buses and in MRT stations, and it does not need to be removed from one's wallet or purse.

===Metro===

Taipei's public transport system, the Taipei Metro (commonly referred to as the MRT), incorporates a metro and light rail system based on advanced VAL and Bombardier technology. In addition to the rapid transit system itself, the Taipei Metro also includes several public facilities such as the Maokong Gondola, underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares. Modifications to existing railway lines to integrate them into the metro system are underway, as well as a rapid transit line to connect the city with Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taoyuan County.

===Rail===

Beginning in 1983, surface rail lines in the city were moved underground as part of the Taipei Railway Underground Project.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rrb.gov.tw/04100.aspx?id=1&lan=en |title=Taipei Main Station Project |publisher=Railway Reconstruction Bureau, Ministry of Transportation and Communications |accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl] The Taiwan High Speed Rail system opened in 2007. The bullet trains connect Taipei with the west coast cities of Banciao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan before terminating at Zuoying (Kaohsiung) at speeds that cut travel times by 60% or more from what they normally are on a bus or conventional train.[tpl]cite web | title=CHAPTER 13 Transportation and Telecommunications | work=Republic of China Yearbook 2008 | publisher=ROC Government Information Office| url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook/ch13.html | accessdate=2009-07-14[/tpl] The Taiwan Railway Administration also runs passenger and freight services throughout the entire island.

===Bus===

An extensive city bus system serves metropolitan areas not covered by the metro, with exclusive bus lanes to facilitate transportation. Riders of the city metro system are able to use the EasyCard for discounted fares on buses, and vice versa. Several major intercity bus terminals are located throughout the city, including the Taipei Bus Station and Taipei City Hall Bus Station.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2010/05/24/2003473719/print|title=Traffic chaos expected in Xinyi|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2010-05-24|accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl]

===Airports===

Most scheduled international flights are served by Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in nearby Taoyuan County. Songshan Airport at the heart of the city in the Songshan District serves domestic flights and scheduled flights to Tokyo International Airport (also known as Haneda Airport), Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, and about 15 destinations in the People's Republic of China. Songshan Airport is accessible by the Taipei Metro Neihu Line; Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is not yet accessible by rail but a line is under construction.

==Demographics==

Taipei City is home to 2,607,428 people, while the metropolitan area has a population of 6,776,264 people. The population of the city proper has been decreasing in recent years while the population of the adjacent New Taipei has been increasing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1084529&ctNode=29491&mp=100002|title=Demographical Overview|publisher=Taipei City Government|accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl] Due to Taipei's geography and location in the Taipei Basin as well as differing times of economic development of its districts, Taipei's population is not evenly distributed. The districts of Daan, Songshan, and Datong are the most densely populated.
In 2008, the crude birth rate stood at 7.88% while the mortality rate stood at 5.94%. A decreasing and rapidly aging population is an important issue for the city. By the end of 2009, one in ten people in Taipei was over 65 years of age.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1163105&lang=eng_news|title=Taiwan's elderly population reaches one in 10: interior ministry|publisher=Central News Agency|date=2010-01-23|accessdate=2010-07-11[/tpl] Residents who had obtained a college education or higher accounted for 43.48% of the population, and the literacy rate stood at 99.18%.
Like the rest of Taiwan, Taipei is composed of four major ethnic groups: Hoklos, Mainlanders, Hakkas, and aborigines. Although Hoklos and Mainlanders form the majority of the population of the city, in recent decades many Hakkas have moved into the city. The aboriginal population in the city stands at 12,862 (
==Education==

19 universities have campuses located in Taipei:
National Taiwan University (NTU) was established in 1928 during the period of Japanese colonial rule. NTU has produced many political and social leaders in Taiwan. Both pan-blue and pan-green movements in Taiwan are rooted on the NTU campus. The university has six campuses in the greater Taipei region (including New Taipei) and two additional campuses in Nantou County. The University governs farms, forests, and hospitals for educational and research purposes. The main campus is in Taipei's Da-An district, where most department buildings and all the administrative buildings are located. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are located near the Presidential Building. The National Taiwan University Hospital is a leading international center of medical research.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about+ntu/location/ntumap.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070806071735/http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/about+ntu/location/ntumap.htm |archivedate=2007-08-06 |title=National Taiwan University – About NTU |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2009-07-27[/tpl]
National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU or Shida) likewise traces its origins to the Japanese colonial period. Originally a teacher training institution, NTNU has developed into a comprehensive international university with demanding entrance requirements. The university boasts especially strong programs in the humanities and international education. Worldwide it is perhaps best known as home of the Mandarin Training Center, a program that offers Mandarin language training each year to over a thousand students from dozens of countries throughout the world. The main campus in Taipei's Da-An district, near MRT Guting Station,  is known for its historic architecture and giving its name to the Shida Night Market, one of the most popular among the numerous night markets in Taipei.

==Sports==

Due to Taiwan being under American and Japanese influence over the years, the sports of baseball in particular and basketball have become popular in the city. Taipei, like the rest of the country, has featured most prominently in baseball and has often been the venue for the Asian Baseball Championship since the 1960s.

===Major sporting events===

Below is a list of recent sporting events hosted by the city:
Taipei will also host the 2017 Summer Universiade
The Taipei Arena it's located at the site of the former Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium (demolished in 2000), with a capacity of over 15,000. Designed by Archasia, the arena was opened on December 1, 2005. Since opening in 2005, the arena has held more art and cultural activities (such as live concerts) than sporting events, which it was originally designed and built for. The main arena has an adjustable floor space: its minimum floor space is [tpl]convert|60|x|30|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl], and can be extended to [tpl]convert|80|x|40|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl]. The Chinese Taipei Ice Hockey League (CIHL) plays out of the auxiliary arena, which is a [tpl]convert|60|x|30|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out[/tpl] ice skating rink.
The Tianmu Baseball Stadium is the major basebal venue in Taipei.
Taipei has the only football-specific stadium in Taiwan, Zhongshan Soccer Stadium, which hosts the national football team. It hosts qualifiers for the FIFA World and AFC regional cups, and finals of school football tournaments. Since there are no professional football leagues in Taiwan, no other sporting events are held there, since 2009, the Taipei Stadium hosts the Soccer and Athletic events.

===Youth baseball===

In 2010, a Taipei baseball team — Chung-Ching Junior Little League — won the Junior League World Series, after winning the Asia-Pacific Region, then defeating the Mexico Region and Latin America Region champions to become the International champion, and finally defeating the U.S. champion (Southwest Region), Rose Capital East LL (Tyler, Texas), 9-1.
