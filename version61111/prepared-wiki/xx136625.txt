Arnulfo Duenes Trejo (August 15, 1922 – July 5, 2002) was a writer and Professor of Library Science at the University of Arizona.  He was a leader in the movement to increase library collections of Latino literature and Spanish-language materials in the United States. He was also instrumental in efforts to train more Latino and Spanish-speaking people as professional librarians.

==Biography==

Trejo was born in Villa Vicente Guerrero, Durango, Mexico. He moved to the United States at the age of three, gaining American citizenship in 1944 during his service with the U.S. Army. He earned a B.A. in Education, University of Arizona, 1949; M.A. in Spanish Language and Literature, University of the Americas[tpl]dn|date=May 2013[/tpl], 1951; M.A. in Library Science, Kent State University, 1953; Litt.D. (with honors), National University of Mexico, 1959.
When he started his position as a Professor of Library Science at the University of Arizona in 1965, Trejo was one of only five Hispanic librarians in the nation.Yamashita, Briana: "Arnulfo D. Trejo, Founder of REFORMA, Dies at 79," Criticas http://www.libraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=article&display=criticas&articleid=CA244635&pubdate=10/1/02
In 1971 he founded REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-speaking, which is today a prominent organization for Latino librarians as well as for librarians serving Latino communities. Trejo was inspired to start REFORMA after a screening of the film I Am Joaquin, based on the epic poem of the same title, by Corky Gonzalez and exploring the struggles and exploitation of Mexican Americans.Güereña, Sal: "A Tribute to Arnulfo D. Trejo," http://www.reforma.org/Trejo/guerenatribute.htm  He served as president of the organization from 1971 to 1974. In recognition of his importance to  the organization, REFORMA's Librarian of the Year Award is now named after Dr. Trejo.
In 1975 he founded the Graduate Library Institute for Spanish-speaking Americans (GLISA), an American Library Association-accredited Masters degree program for training librarians.  During the institute's four-year existence Trejo was directly involved in recruiting Latino students into the program and contributed to their education.  GLISA's graduates include many Latina and Latino librarians who are present-day leaders in the field.
In 1980 Trejo cofounded Hispanic Books Distributors, a Spanish language book seller aimed at increasing the availability of Spanish-language materials to libraries in the United States. 

==Trejo Foster Foundation for Hispanic Library Education==

In 1992, Trejo, his sister Luisa Duenes Trejo, and his second wife, Annette M. Foster Trejo, created the Trejo Foster Foundation for Hispanic Library Education (TFF) which has sponsored national institutes for library education to serve the information needs of Latinos. The TFF was formed as a “think-tank” to address issues concerning library and information science education. Under the aegis of the TFF Institutes on Hispanic Library Education have engaged the faculties of library and information studies throughout the nation in planning, preparation and implementation. Dr. Trejo’s astute recognition that he must ignite passion for service to the Spanish-speaking in all regions of the United States through the Institutes resulted in the first five Institutes.
Dr. Trejo’s message inviting librarians to the 5th TFF Institute in Wisconsin in 2001 was a clear and strong reminder that the work is far from done:

==Legacy, Honors and Death==

Dr. Trejo won many awards, including: the Simón Bolivar Award, Colegio de Bibliotecónomos of Venezuela, 1970; El Tiradito Awards, El Tiradito Foundation, 1973 and 1975; annual award from League of Mexican-American Women, 1973; Rosenzweig Award, Arizona State Library Association, 1976; Distinguished Alumni Award, Kent State University School of Library Science. In 2001, the American Library Association (ALA) granted Trejo Honorary Membership, an honor conferred on a living citizen of any country whose contribution to librarianship or a closely related field is so outstanding that it is of lasting importance to the advancement of the whole field of library service. It is intended to reflect honor upon the ALA as well as upon the individual.
Arnulfo Trejo died in his home in Tucson, Arizona in 2002, at the age of 79.  He was survived by his wife, Ninfa, and daughters, Rachel, Rebecca and Ruth."Memorial Program from Funeral" http://www.reforma.org/Trejo/TrejoMem.pdf
