In 1896 they built lamp start oil engines. By 1912 they had developed a new internal combustion engine that ran on vaporising oil and was fired by a spark.  It did not need a hot bulb like most engines of the time. By 1919 they had mounted a 25Â hp 3 cylinder version in a crawler tractor, which they built till 1925.
By 1929 they were building diesel engines for the Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) group. Richard Garrett & Sons assembled some of these tractors. They were similar to an International 15/30.
AGE collapsed in 1932.

R A Lister & Company was taken over by the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1965 and, in a later re-organisation, Lister became Lister Petter and Blackstone became Mirrlees Blackstone.

The Stockport factory has been partly demolished and replaced with a new office and warehouse facility which still serves the aftermarket for spares and servicing of Lister Blackstone engines under the MAN Diesel & Turbo tagline.
