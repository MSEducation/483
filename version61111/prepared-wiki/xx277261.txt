2013 Kerala solar panel scam involved a fraudulent solar energy company, Team Solar, in Kerala, India, which used two women to create political contacts with links even to the Chief Minister's office, duped several influential people to the tune of 70 million Rupees, by offering to make them business partners, or by offering to install solar power units for them, and receiving advance payments for the same.

==Incident==

The Team Solar Energy Company (Team Solar), floated by the main accused Biju Radhakrishnan and Saritha Nair, directors of the company, allegedly collected advance amounts from large number of people and investors by offering to make them business partners, or in the guise of installing alternate sources of energy and failed to deliver the goods. The company awarded a "Virgin Earth Golden Feather Environment Award" to several prominent people of Kerala to gain media coverage and credibility.[tpl]cite news|title=Solar panel scam: Saritha makes statement in court|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/solar-panel-scam-saritha-makes-statement-in-court/article4935243.ece|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 July 2013[/tpl] The scam came to light when one of the customers who had paid for the installation filed a case against the company.
