Farm to Market Road 523 is a state highway the U.S. state of Texas.

==Route description==

Farm to Market Road 523 is a route in Brazoria County which loops to the east of Lake Jackson and Angleton, travelling through mainly rural areas. Beginning at SH 288 in Freeport, FM 523 follows an eastern path as Gulf Boulevard for around one mile (1.6 km). Then, traveling north on Velasco Boulevard, FM 523 leaves the residential sections of Freeport and passes various chemical plants until intersecting SH 332 just shy of the Oyster Creek city limit. FM 523 is Oyster Creek's main artery, traveling through the heart of the city and crossing Oyster Creek. Then passing by the Brazoria Wildlife Refuge and the Seabreeze Landfill, FM 523 then intersects at FM 2004, four miles (6 km) northeast of Richwood. FM 523 then turns from a pavement to a newer concrete surface (see Old FM 523), forming a partial loop around Angleton, with an overpass over the Union Pacific Railroad and Brazoria County Road 171, a route from Angleton to Danbury and Liverpool,  intersecting with SH 35 near Angleton. Then making a north to west curve, the route intersects Business State Highway 288, and intersects SH 288 a half-mile later, crossing over the freeway. Continuing on a west, southwestward route, FM 523 intersects FM 521, four miles (6 km) southeast of Holiday Lakes.

==Old FM 523==

Farm to Market Road 523 once followed a path northwestward from FM 2004 to Angleton, making a north curve into the city, intersecting at SH 35 a mile northeast from the business district. The proposed "bypass" was built and the old route was given to the county and city of Angleton for maintenance, respectively. The part of FM 523 from State Highway 35 to State Highway 288 was meant to be a Highway 35 bypass around Angleton but the highway was quickly changed back to its original alignment through Angleton.
