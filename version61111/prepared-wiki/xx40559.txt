Arena rock (sometimes stadium rock, anthem rock,G. Donaldson, The Making of Modern America: the Nation from 1945 to the Present (Rowman and Littlefield, 2009), ISBN 0-7425-4820-1, p. 248. or corporate rockL. M. Scrivani-Tidd, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History: From Arenas to the Underground, 1974-1980 (Greenwood Press, 2006), ISBN 0-313-32937-0, p. 74.) is rock music that uses large arena venues, particularly sports venues, for concerts or series of concerts linked in tours. Historically, arena rock bands have often come from the hard rock, heavy metal and progressive rock genres, using a more commercially oriented and radio-friendly sound, with highly-produced music that includes both hard rock numbers and power ballads, both often employing anthemic choruses.“Arena rock”, Allmusic, retrieved 20 January 2011.

==History==

The origins of arena rock were in the 1960s, sometimes dated to when The Beatles played Shea Stadium in New York in 1965. Also important was the success of the large pop and rock festivals  like Monterey (1967) and Woodstock (1969)E. Weisbard, This is Pop: in Search of the Elusive at Experience Music Project (Harvard University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-674-01321-2, p. 62. and the use of large stadiums for American tours by bands including The Rolling Stones, Grand Funk Railroad and Led Zeppelin. The tendency developed in the mid-1970s as the increased power of amplification and sound systems allowed the use of larger and larger venues. Smoke, fireworks and sophisticated lighting shows became staples of arena rock performances.R. Shuker, Popular Music: the Key Concepts (London: Routledge, 2nd., edn., 2002), 0415284252, p. 158. It has been argued that the rise of arena rock marked the end of the idealism of 1960s, particularly in the disillusionment that followed the Altamont Free Concert of 1969, for a more commercial form of rock.S. Waksman, This Ain't the Summer of Love: Conflict and Crossover in Heavy Metal and Punk (University of California Press, 2009), ISBN 0-520-25310-8, pp. 21-31.

The use of commercial sponsorship for the large-scale tours and concerts of this era began to lead to the music being branded, usually pejoratively, as corporate rock.W. M. Reynolds and J. A. Webber, Expanding Curriculum Theory: Dis/positions and Lines of Flight (London: Routledge, 2004), ISBN 0-8058-4664-6, p. 24. The commercialism, and "overblown" spectacle of stadium rock has been seen as promoting a number of reactions, including the pub rockA. Bennett, “Even better than the real thing? Understanding the tribute band phenomenon”, S. Homan, ed., Access All Eras: Tribute Bands and Global Pop Culture, (Hill International, 2006), ISBN 0-335-21690-0, p. 26. and punk rock movements in the 1970s.P. Browne and R. B. Browne, The Guide to United States popular culture, (Popular Press, 2001), ISBN 0-87972-821-3, p. 31. In the 1980s arena rock became dominated by glam metal bands, following the lead of AerosmithD. L. Joyner, American Popular Music (McGraw-Hill, 3rd edn., 2008), ISBN 0-07-352657-6, p. 261. and including Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P. and Ratt. Their popularity was challenged by the alternative rock bands who began to breakthrough to the mainstream, particularly after the success of Nirvana, from the early 1990s."Hair metal", Allmusic.
