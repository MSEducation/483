The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s.[tpl]cite web |url= http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/catprofile.do?id=5010 |title=Cat Breed Profile: American Bobtail |date= |work=Animal.Discovery.com |publisher=Discovery Communications |accessdate=November 5, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061005202146/http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/catprofile.do?id=5010 |archivedate=October 5, 2006[/tpl] It is  most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat. The breed is not related to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical typeâ€”the breeding programs are entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail's tail is dominant, whereas the Japanese Bobtail tail mutation is recessive.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
American Bobtails are a very sturdy breed, with both short- and long-haired coats. Their coat is shaggy rather than dense or fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat, with a strong emphasis on the "wild" tabby appearance in show animals.

==History==

Urban legend says that Bobtails are the result of a crossbreeding between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat.  The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and may be related to the Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.
This cat's original appearance genetics were modified in the breed to form a new and improved strain which comes in essentially all colors and coat types.  It is still permitted[tpl]clarify|date=March 2013|reason=In what registry/registries?[/tpl] to outcross the American Bobtail with other domestic stock, so long as the currently small gene pool is kept healthy.  Manx and Japanese Bobtails are not used in the integrated Most looks like Tigers and some look like they are mixed with different breeds of cats. https://www.google.com/search?q=american+bobtail&rlz=1CALEAA_enUS552US552&espv=2&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=AqFUU8z1Cc_82gWWwYDABw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1200&bih=640&safe=active&ssui=on  matrix.
The breed was first recognized, by The International Cat Association (TICA, US-based), in 1989.  [tpl]As of|March 2013[/tpl], the breed is accepted for championship competition in TICA, the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA, also US-based)[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cfainc.org/Portals/0/documents/breeds/standards/american-bobtail.pdf |title=American Bobtail Show Standard |author= |date=April 28, 2013 |format=PDF |publisher=Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) |location= Alliance, Ohio, US |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EtvvAO8H [/tpl] and the American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.acfacat.com/Breed%20Standards/AM%20BOBTAIL%20LH.pdf |title= American Bobtail Longhair |author= |date=May 2007 |work=ACFACat.org |publisher=American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) |location=Nixa, Missouri, US |format=PDF |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Eri2by4O[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.acfacat.com/Breed%20Standards/AM%20BOBTAIL%20SH.pdf |title= American Bobtail Shorthair |author= |date=May 2007 |work=ACFACat.org |format=PDF |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Eri0Cewt[/tpl] The breed is technically now also sanctioned in the Cat Aficionado Association (CAA) of China, by virtue of the CAA having adopted all of ACFA's breed standards; it is unknown if any specimens are actually in China.

==Appearance==

American Bobtails require two to three years to develop, slower than many domestic cat breeds.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cfainc.org/Breeds/BreedsAB/AmericanBobtail.aspx |title=American Bobtail: About This Breed |author= |year= 2013 |work=CFAInc.com |publisher=CFA |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6Erk65fpi[/tpl][tpl]tertiary|date=March 2013|reason=This trivial source uncritically repeats breeder promotional claims, and cites no  sources of its own.

The American Bobtail is hearty, short-tailed cat. Its body is moderately long, with substantial boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The chest is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost as wide as chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to body. There is a concave curve from nose to brow, or rise to prominent brow, a broad unpinched muzzle, prominent whisker pads, a gently sloped wide nose and full, strong jaws. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape,with size proportionate to head. The aperture is angled to base of ear, and with medium wide spacing and deep sockets. Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Behavior==

Breeders claim[tpl]weasel-inline|date=March 2013[/tpl] that American Bobtails are playful, friendly, energetic and intelligent, but some are born scared, not playful, and not quick to open up. American Bobtails have dog-like personalities, often play fetch, learn tricks, and greet their owners at the door.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] They are very tolerant of being picked up by younger children and handled like a sack of potatoes.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] They have been known to escape from closed rooms and fastened cages. 
Bobtails also have a tendency to steal shiny objects and stash them away in a hiding place, requiring owners to know where their cat keeps their hoard when the owner wants to retrieve the items.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
