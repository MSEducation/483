Evolution of early Arabic calligraphy (9th – 11th century). The Basmala was taken as an example, from kufic [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|Qur’ān[/tpl] manuscripts.

(1) Early 9th century, script with no dots or diacritic marks (see image of early Basmala Kufic);

(2) and (3) 9th–10th century under Abbasid dynasty, Abu al-Aswad’s system establish red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel; later, a second black-dot system was used to differentiate between letters like [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|fā’[/tpl] and [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|qāf[/tpl] (see image of middle Kufic);

(4) 11th century, in al-Farāhídi’s system (system we know today) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels (see image of modern Kufic in Qur'an).

According to tradition, the first to commission a system of harakat was Muawiyah I of the Umayyad dynasty, when he ordered Ziad Ibn Abih, his [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|wālī[/tpl] in Basra (governed 664–673), to find someone who would devise a method to transcribe correct reading. Ziad Ibn Abih, in turn, appointed Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali for the task. Abu al-Aswad devised a system of dots to signal the three short vowels (along with their respective allophones) of Arabic. This system of dots predates the [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|i‘jām[/tpl], dots used to distinguish between different consonants.

===Abu al-Aswad's system===

Abu al-Aswad's system of Harakat was different from the system we know today. The system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel.
A dot above a letter indicated the vowel [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|a[/tpl], a dot below indicated the vowel [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|i[/tpl], a dot on the side of a letter stood for the vowel [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|u[/tpl], and two dots stood for the [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|tanwīn[/tpl].
However, the early manuscripts of the Qur'an did not use the vowel signs for every letter requiring them, but only for letters where they were necessary for a correct reading.

===Al Farahidi's system===

This is the precursor to the system we know today. [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|al-Farāhīdī[/tpl] found that the task of writing using two different colours was tedious and impractical. Another complication was that the [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|i‘jām[/tpl] had been introduced by then, which, while they were short strokes rather than the round dots seen today, meant that without a color distinction the two could become confused.
Accordingly he replaced the [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt[/tpl] with small superscript letters: small alif, yā’, and wāw for the short vowels corresponding to the long vowels written with those letters, a small s(h)īn for shaddah (geminate), a small khā’ for khafīf (short consonant; no longer used). His system is essentially the one we know today.Versteegh, 1997. The Arabic language. p 56ff.
