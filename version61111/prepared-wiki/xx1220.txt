</ref> These [[bible|biblical accounts]] are found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], namely Matthew 1:18, and the [[Gospel of Luke]], specifically Luke 1:26 and 2:40. According to these accounts, Jesus was born to Mary, assisted by her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], in the city of [[Bethlehem]].
According to popular tradition, the birth took place in a stable, surrounded by farm animals. A manger (that is, a feeding trough) is mentioned in [tpl]Bibleverse||Luke|2:7|KJV[/tpl], where it states Mary "wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn" (KJV); and "She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them" (NIV).
Shepherds from the fields surrounding Bethlehem were told of the birth by an angel, and were the first to see the child.[ref]
