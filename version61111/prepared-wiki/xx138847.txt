Queanbeyan is a city of 50,000 people located on the Queanbeyan River 291 km south-west of Sydney via Tarago and Bungendore and 18 km south-east of the centre of Canberra. The current principal is Mr John Clark.
The school runs a number of innovative programs including The Personal Best program in which students select to be in these classes if they wish to be challenged and encouraged in their learning, The College Program in which Year 11 and 12 sit for three subjects each year and sit for the Higher School Certificate. Over two years students complete 6 subjects but this method reduces to the stress, enables more subjects to run and gives both years of senior study purpose and dignity. A program to be introduced in 2010 is the Quick Track program in which students who do not choose Personal Best are given personal, academic and aptitude skills so that they can achieve in the Personal Best classes.
