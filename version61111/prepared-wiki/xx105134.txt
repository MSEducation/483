==History==

Northeast State began as Tri-Cities State Area Vocational-Technical School in 1966 under the governance of the State Board for Vocational Education. In 1970, the mission was expanded and the school became a regional center for vocational and technical training. The scope was again expanded in 1978 to include the awarding of both one-year certificates and associate degrees in technology, and the name was changed to Tri-Cities State Technical Institute. Effective on July 1, 1983, Tri-Cities State Tech was placed under the governance of the Tennessee State Board of Regents and became part of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee. On July 1, 1990, a university parallel component was added, and the current name was made official.
