The club's home ground is the 41,837-seat Stamford Bridge stadium, where they have played since their establishment.
Chelsea had their first major success in 1955, winning the league championship, and won various cup competitions during the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s and 2000s. The club has enjoyed its greatest period of success in the past two decades, winning 15 major trophies since 1997.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/HistoryTrophiesIndex/0,,10268,00.html |title=Trophy Cabinet |publisher=Chelsea F.C. official website |accessdate=20 May 2012 [/tpl]

Chelsea's regular kit colours are royal blue shirts and shorts with white socks. The club's crest has been changed several times in attempts to re-brand the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion rampant regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s.[tpl]cite news |title=Chelsea centenary crest unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4008257.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=2 January 2007 [/tpl] The club have sustained the fifth highest average all-time attendance in English football.[tpl]cite web | url=http://nufc.com/2011-12html/attendance-all-time.html | title=All Time League Attendance Records | accessdate=8 November 2013 |date=22 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120111003541/http://nufc.com/2011-12html/attendance-all-time.html |archivedate=11 January 2012[/tpl] Their average home gate for the 2012–13 season was 41,462, the sixth highest in the Premier League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soccerstats.com/attendance.asp?league=england|title=Home attendance|publisher=Soccerstats.com|accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl] Since July 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.[tpl]cite news |title=Russian businessman buys Chelsea |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3036838.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=11 February 2007 [/tpl]

==History==

In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | page=55[/tpl] Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/860972|title=HISTORY - CENTENARY|publisher=Chelsea F.C.|date=30 September 2004|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.
The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished 3rd in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1800262|title=Team History – 1905–29 |publisher=Chelsea F.C. official website|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl] Chelsea attracted large crowds[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0,,10268~910883,00.html|title=Between the Wars – Big Names and Big Crowds|publisher=Chelsea F.C. official website|accessdate=7 May 2012|archiveurl=http://archive.is/1kUL|archivedate=30 June 2012[/tpl] and had a reputation for signing big-name players,[tpl]cite news | date=10 January 2004 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article992039.ece | title=Little sign of change for Chelsea and their impossible dreams |work=The Times |location=UK| accessdate=15 March 2009 | author=Brian Glanville[/tpl] [tpl]registration required[/tpl] but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years.
Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in 1954–55. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League and the FA Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.[tpl]cite news | date=27 April 2005 | url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/europe/article2327902.ece | title=The great Chelsea surrender |work=The Times |location=UK | accessdate=29 December 2006 |author=Brian Glanville [/tpl] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.
Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill, Rick | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography – The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years| publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd| year=2006| isbn=978-0-7553-1466-9 | page=196[/tpl] In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton, Chelsea won the FA Cup in 1970, beating Leeds United 2–1 in a final replay. Chelsea took their first European honour, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over Real Madrid in Athens.
The late 1970s through to the 1980s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=84–87[/tpl] star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=143–157[/tpl] In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=89–90[/tpl] On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.
After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=90–91[/tpl] Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final with Glenn Hoddle. It was not until the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the club won the FA Cup in 1997 and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who led the team to victory in the League Cup Final, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, the FA Cup in 2000 and their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.
In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for £140 million. Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies,[tpl]cite news |title=Chelsea sack Ranieri |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3742477.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=1 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 [/tpl] and was replaced by José Mourinho.[tpl]cite news |title=Chelsea appoint Mourinho |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/3765263.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2 June 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2012 [/tpl] Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (2004–05 and 2005–06),[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/03/12/SOCCER_Chelsea.html&TEAMHD=soccer | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120603160253/http://www.sportinglife.com/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/03/12/SOCCER_Chelsea.html&TEAMHD=soccer | archivedate=3 June 2012 | title=Terry Eyes Back-to-Back Titles | publisher=Sporting Life | accessdate=22 January 2007 | author=Matt Barlow|date=12 March 2006 [/tpl] in addition to winning an FA Cup (2007) and two League Cups (2005 and 2007).

==Stadium==

Chelsea have only ever had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Celtic Park and Hampden Park.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=69–71[/tpl] Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.
Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000. The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. It eventually became known as the "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.
In the early 1970s the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.
When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Ken Bates era many additional features were added to the complex including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of "Chelsea Village" or "The Village".
The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the turnstiles and Chelsea's naming rights are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.[tpl]cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=91–92[/tpl]

Stamford Bridge has been used for a variety of other sporting events since 1905. It hosted the FA Cup Final from 1920 to 1922, has held ten FA Cup semi-finals (most recently in 1978), ten FA Charity Shield matches (the last in 1970), and three England international matches, the last in 1932; it was also the venue for an unofficial Victory International in 1946. The 2013 UEFA Women's Champions League Final was played at Stamford Bridge. thumb|230px|right|View from the West Stand of Stamford Bridge during a Champions League game, 2008 In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union match between the All Blacks and Middlesex, and in 1914 hosted a baseball match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox. It was the venue for a boxing match between world flyweight champion Jimmy Wilde and Joe Conn in 1918. The running track was used for dirt track racing between 1928 and 1932, greyhound racing from 1933 to 1968, and Midget car racing in 1948.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.speedcarworld.com.au/default.asp?Page=Release&Id=8958| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120325010050/http://www.speedcarworld.com.au/default.asp?Page=Release&Id=8958| archivedate=25 March 2012| title=U.S. Invades England 1948|work=speedcarworld.com| accessdate=19 February 2011[/tpl] In 1980, Stamford Bridge hosted the first international floodlit cricket match in the UK, between Essex and the West Indies.

The current club ownership have stated that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United.[ref]
