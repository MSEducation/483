The Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR) is an American non profit organization, 501(c)(3), located in Washington, DC. Established in 1981, the organization is dedicated to informing the news media, teachers, and other groups about the need for lab animals in medical and scientific research. The organization argues that promoting animal research leads to improved human and veterinary health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbresearch.org/AboutFBR/tabid/423/Default.aspx| title=About FBR |author = Foundation for Biomedical Research| accessdate = 2009-06-24[/tpl]

==Animal research==

Some animal rights supporters believe that alternatives exist for animal models in research; however the vast majority of scientists believe that no adequate alternatives exist, and that there is little realistic argument about the critical role that animal studies have played in medical progress.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animalresearch.info/en/medical/lectures/Animalresearchandmedicalprogress | title=Animal research and medical progress | author=Sir John Vane[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aboutanimaltesting.co.uk/scientists-against-animal-testing.html/| title=Scientists Against Animal Testing | author=About animal testing[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=guidelinesPolicies_UseOfAnimalsandHumans/| title=Policies on the Use of Animals and Humans in Neuroscience Research |author=The Society for Neuroscience[/tpl]
According to the Foundation for Biomedical Research, animal research has been responsible for every medical breakthrough over the past century, although this position has been disputed by some animal rights activists and organizations.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ruesch|first=Hans|title=1000 Doctors (and many more) Against Vivisection|publisher = Civis/Civitas| asin= B000FJGF82|year=1989[/tpl]Animal Experimentation Issues PCRM[tpl]cite web|url=http://caat.jhsph.edu/about/index.htm| title= The Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT)|accessdate= 2009-06-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://petaliterature.com/VIV230.pdf| title=Animals in Experimentation – Everybody Loses| author = PETA|accessdate=2009-06-24[/tpl] It cites animal research as leading to advances in antibiotics, blood transfusions, dialysis, organ transplantation, vaccinations, chemotherapy, bypass surgery, joint replacement, and methods for prevention, treatment, cure and control of disease, pain and suffering.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the total number of animals used in that country in 2005 was almost 1.2 million,2005 Report on Enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act U.S. Department of Agriculture, Accessed 8 February 2008 excluding rats and mice.The humane care and treatment of laboratory animals National Association of Biomedical Research, Accessed 8 February 2008[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Trull | first1 = Frankie L. | last2 = Rich | first2 = Barbara A. | year = 1999 | title = More Regulation of Rodents | url = | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5419| page = 1463 | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5419.1463 [/tpl] In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated at 20 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = N | last2 = Brown | first2 = S | title = The mouse ascending: perspectives for human-disease models. | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 993–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17762889 | doi = 10.1038/ncb437 [/tpl] The Foundation advocates the highest quality of animal care and treatment, stating that the use of animals in research is a privilege, and that animals deserve our respect and the best possible care.
