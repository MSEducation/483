The Forth Canoe Club, founded in 1934, is Scotland's oldest surviving canoe club.  It is a founding member of the Scottish Canoe Association.
The club originally met at Granton in North Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth. In 1982 it moved to Lochrin Basin at the Edinburgh end of the Union Canal following an extensive dredging operation by the club's second and current commodore Kelso Riddell.
When the Union Canal was developed by British Waterways as part of the Millennium Link, Forth Canoe Club lost its buildings there and moved to the Old St Andrew's Boathouse further along the canal in 2004.
The first commodore was Jack Cuthill and the main building of the Club was named after him. When this building was destroyed, the new building at Grandtully was named in his memory.
The club's motto, [tpl]lang|la|per ventus et per artus[/tpl] means "by wind and by skill".
Forth Canoe Club member David Florence represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member of the senior team.  At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he won a silver medal in the men's C1 single slalom event on 12 August 2008.
