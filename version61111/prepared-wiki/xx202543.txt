==Resistance & Special Operations Executive work==

Fontaine, a native Frenchwoman, began working with the Tinker network in 1943 with the organizer Ben Cowburn.  She worked initially as a courier, but soon became deeply involved in the network forming part of the nucleaus with Cowburn, his radio operator Barrett and another locally recruited Frenchman, Pierre Mulsant.  As the Gestapo closed in on the network in November 1943, Fontaine and Barrett were taken to England on a Henri DÃ©ricourt pick up.
In England Fontaine underwent SOE training.  She returned to France by boat on 25 March 1944 to work with the Minister circuit as a courier.
There is some discussion as to whether Fontaine was an official member of the SOE.  Vera Atkins claimed that she was recruited in the field and never became an official F Section Agent.Liane Jones, A Quiet Courage: Women Agents in the French Resistance, London, Transworld Publishers Ltd, 1990.
