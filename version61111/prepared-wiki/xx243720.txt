Pyridinoline, also known as Hydroxylysylpyridinoline, is a fluorescent cross-linking compound of collagen fibers. Crosslinks in collagen and elastin are derived from lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues,[tpl]cite journal |author=Gallop PM, Blumenfeld OO, Seifter S |title=Structure and metabolism of connective tissue proteins |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=41 |issue= 1|pages=617–72 |year=1972 |pmid=4343456 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.41.070172.003153[/tpl] a process catalyzed by lysyl oxidase. Fujimoto and colleagues first described the isolation and characterization of a fluorescent material in bovine achilles tendon collagen and termed it pyridinoline.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/0006-291X(77)90972-X |author=Fujimoto D, Akiba K, Nakamura N |title=Isolation and characterization of a fluorescent material in bovine achilles tendon collagen |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=1124–9 |date=June 1977 |pmid=901463[/tpl]] It is reported to be present in collagen of bone and cartilage, but is absent in collagen of skin. It is not present in newly synthesized collagen and is formed from aldimine cross-links during maturation of collagen fibers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Uchiyama A, Inoue T, Fujimoto D |title=Synthesis of pyridinoline during in vitro aging of bone collagen |journal=Journal of Biochemistry |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1795–8 |date=December 1981 |pmid=7334012 |url=http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7334012[/tpl] 
Pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline were found to be released into the blood during bone degradation and rapidly exereted in the urine. In a preliminary study, both these compounds were proposed as a marker for metastatic bone tumor in patients with prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Samma S, Kagebayashi Y, Yasukawa M, et al. |title=Sequential changes of urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline as markers of metastatic bone tumor in patients with prostate cancer: a preliminary study |journal=Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=26–30 |date=February 1997 |pmid=9070337 |doi=10.1093/jjco/27.1.26[/tpl]
