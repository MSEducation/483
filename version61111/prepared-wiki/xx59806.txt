Sakaguchi then decided to create a role-playing video game which he named Final Fantasy as a result of his personal situation; had the game not sold well, he would have quit the games industry and gone back to university.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/28960/Sakaguchi-discusses-the-development-of-Final-Fantasy |title=Sakaguchi discusses the development of Final Fantasy |author=Fear, Ed |date=December 13, 2007 |work=Develop |publisher=Intent Media |accessdate=October 16, 2008[/tpl] The game was released in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System on December 18, 1987, and was successful across Japan. Under Sakaguchi's watchful eye, Final Fantasy developed into a successful franchise, spanning from stand alone stories to spin-offs to direct sequels. In 1991, following the release of Final Fantasy IV for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, he was honoured with the position of Executive Vice President.[tpl]cite journal |publisher=Square USA |title=Hironobu Sakaguchi/Chairman and CEO |url=http://www.squareusa.com/sakaguchi.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000511162608/http://www.squareusa.com/sakaguchi.html |archivedate=May 11, 2000[/tpl] The last Final Fantasy game he directed was Final Fantasy V, becoming the producer for future installments of the franchise. In 1995, he became President at Square USA, Inc. His final role as game producer was for Final Fantasy IX. In an interview at the time he described it as his favorite Final Fantasy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/077/077571p1.html|title=Interview with Hironobu Sakaguchi |date=April 5, 2000|work=IGN|accessdate=February 14, 2010[/tpl] He later went on to serve more as an executive producer of the series, as well as many of Square's other games, including Vagrant Story, Parasite Eve and Kingdom Hearts. The Kingdom Hearts series would later go on to feature a character named Master Eraqus, who was designed to physically resemble Sakaguchi and match with Disney's Yen Sid. In May 2000, Sakaguchi received the Hall of Fame Award of the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.

===Time as film director===

A long time proponent of bringing together the story-telling vehicle of film and the interactive elements of games, Sakaguchi took the leap from games to film when he made his debut as film director in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, an animated motion picture based on his world-famous Final Fantasy series. Despite some positive reviews, the movie was a box office bomb, losing approximately 94 million dollars.[tpl]cite news|work=Boston.com|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/box_office_bombs?pg=8|title=Movies that were Box-office Bombs|last=Duffy|first=James|accessdate=January 2, 2010 | date=August 2, 2006[/tpl]

===Resignation from Square===

Sakaguchi voluntarily stepped down from his post as an executive vice president at Square. This event also reduced Square's financial capital. Square later merged with its rival, the Enix Corporation, which led to the creation of Square Enix in 2003. In 2004, Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker with the financial backing of Microsoft Game Studios.

===Mistwalker===

Sakaguchi founded Mistwalker, which began operation in 2004. In February 2005, it was announced that Mistwalker would be working with Microsoft Game Studios to create two role-playing video games for the Xbox 360. Still, the company remains independent from console exclusivity. Sakaguchi released the works Blue Dragon in 2006, and Lost Odyssey in 2007 on the Xbox 360, and ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat on the Nintendo DS. He was developing an action-RPG, titled Cry On, until the project was canceled in December 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172061 |title=1UP.com |publisher=1UP.com |date=December 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2010[/tpl]
