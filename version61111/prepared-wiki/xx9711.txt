Poetry (from the Greek poiesis — [tpl]lang|el|ποίησις[/tpl] — meaning a "making", seen also in such terms as "hemopoiesis"; more narrowly, the making of poetry) is a form of literary art  which uses aesthetic and rhythmic[tpl]cite web|title=Poetry|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/poetry?q=poetry[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Poetry|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|year=2013|postscript=—Based on the Random House Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/poetry?s=t[/tpl] qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.
Poetry has a long history, dating back to the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.  Early poems evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese Shijing, or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the Sanskrit Vedas, Zoroastrian Gathas, and the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Ancient attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition, verse form and rhyme, and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative, prosaic forms of writing. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more generally regarded as a fundamental creative act employing language.
Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy[tpl]cite book|author=Strachan, John R; Terry, Richard, G|isbn=978-0-8147-9797-6|title=Poetry: an introduction|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2000|page=119[/tpl] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.
Some poetry types are specific to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition,[tpl]cite book|author=Eliot, TS|chapter=The Function of Criticism|title=Selected Essays|isbn=978-0-15-180387-3|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1999|pages=13–34[/tpl] playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm.[tpl]cite book|author=Longenbach, James|title=Modern Poetry After Modernism|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-510178-2|year=1997|pages=9, 103[/tpl][tpl]cite book|pages=xxvii–xxxiii|editor=Schmidt, Michael|title=The Harvill Book of Twentieth-Century Poetry in English|publisher=Harvill Press|year=1999|isbn=1-86046-735-0[/tpl] In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.

==History==

Poetry as an art form may predate literacy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hoivik|first=S|author2=Luger, K|title=Folk Media for Biodiversity Conservation: A Pilot Project from the Himalaya-Hindu Kush|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=3 June 2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=321–346|doi=10.1177/1748048509102184[/tpl] Epic poetry, from the Indian Vedas (1700–1200 BC) and Zoroaster's Gathas to the Odyssey (800–675 BC), appears to have been composed in poetic form to aid memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies.[tpl]cite book|author=Ahl, Frederick; Roisman, Hannah M|title=The Odyssey Re-Formed|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1996|pages=1–26|isbn=0-8014-8335-2[/tpl]. Others suggest that poetry did not necessarily predate writing. [tpl]cite book|author=Goody, Jack|title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|page=98|isbn=0-521-33794-1[/tpl] Other forms of poetry developed directly from folk songs. The earliest entries in the ancient compilation Shijing, were initially lyrics, preceding later entries intended to be read.[tpl]cite book|first=Patricia|last=Ebrey|year=1993|title=Chinese Civilisation: A Sourcebook|edition=2nd|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0-02-908752-7|pages=11–13[/tpl]
The oldest surviving epic poem is the Epic of Gilgamesh, from the 3rd millennium BC in Sumer (in Mesopotamia, now Iraq), which was written in cuneiform script on clay tablets and, later, papyrus.[tpl]cite book|author=Sanders, NK (trans.)|title=The Epic of Gilgamesh|publisher=Penguin Books|edition=Revised|year=1972|pages=7–8[/tpl] Other ancient epic poetry includes the Greek epics Iliad and Odyssey, the Old Iranian books the Gathic Avesta and Yasna, the Roman national epic, Virgil's Aeneid, and the Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata.
The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in "poetics"—the study of the aesthetics of poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Abondolo|first=Daniel|title=A poetics handbook: verbal art in the European tradition|year=2001|publisher=Curzon|isbn=978-0-7007-1223-6|pages=52–53[/tpl] Some ancient poetic traditions; such as, contextually, Classical Chinese poetry in the case of the Shijing (Classic of Poetry), which records the development of poetic canons with ritual and aesthetic importance.[tpl]Cite book|author=Gentz, Joachim|chapter=Ritual Meaning of Textual Form: Evidence from Early Commentaries of the Historiographic and Ritual Traditions|editor=Kern, Martin|pages=124–148|isbn=978-0-295-98787-3|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2008[/tpl] More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Matsuo Bashō's Oku no Hosomichi, as well as differences in context spanning Tanakh religious poetry, love poetry, and rap.[tpl]cite book|pages=607–609, 620|title=A history of literary criticism|author=Habib, Rafey|isbn=978-0-631-23200-1|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005[/tpl]

===Western traditions===

Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry—the epic, the comic, and the tragic—and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre.[tpl]cite book|editor=Heath, Malcolm|title=Aristotle's Poetics|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1997|isbn=0-14-044636-2[/tpl] Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry, and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Frow|first=John|title=Genre|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28063-1|pages=57–59|edition=Reprint[/tpl]
Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age,[tpl]cite journal|author=Bogges, WF|title='Hermannus Alemannus' Latin Anthology of Arabic Poetry|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1968|volume=88|pages=657–70[/tpl] [tpl]cite book|author=Burnett, Charles|chapter=Learned Knowledge of Arabic Poetry, Rhymed Prose, and Didactic Verse from Petrus Alfonsi to Petrarch|title=Poetry and Philosophy in the Middle Ages: A Festschrift for Peter Dronke|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=2001|isbn=90-04-11964-7|pages=29–62[/tpl] as well as in Europe during the Renaissance.[tpl]cite book|author=Grendler, Paul F|title=The Universities of the Italian Renaissance|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8018-8055-6|page=239[/tpl] Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.[tpl]cite book|author=Kant, Immanuel; Bernard, JH (trans.)|title=Critique of Judgment|publisher=Macmillan|year=1914|page=131[/tpl] Kant argues that the nature of poetry as a self-consciously abstract and beautiful form raises it to the highest level among the verbal arts, with tone or music following it, and only after that the more logical and narrative prose.
This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English Romantic poet John Keats termed this escape from logic "Negative Capability".[tpl]cite book|last=Ou|first=Li|title=Keats and negative capability|year=2009|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-4724-0|pages=1–3[/tpl] This "romantic" approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the 20th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Watten|first=Barrett|title=The constructivist moment: from material text to cultural poetics|year=2003|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-6610-2|pages=17–19[/tpl]
During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade.[tpl]cite journal|author=Abu-Mahfouz, Ahmad|title=Translation as a Blending of Cultures|journal=Journal of Translation|volume=4|issue=1|year=2008|url=http://pnglanguages.org/siljot/2008/1/51140/siljot2008-1-01.pdf[/tpl] In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.[tpl]cite book|last=Highet|first=Gilbert|title=The classical tradition: Greek and Roman influences on western literature|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-500206-5|pages=355, 360, 479|edition=Reissued[/tpl]

===20th-century disputes===

Some 20th-century literary theorists, relying less on the opposition of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet creates.[tpl]cite book|author=Wimsatt, William K, Jr; Brooks, Cleanth|title=Literary Criticism: A Short History|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1957|page=374[/tpl] The underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between the creation of a poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.[tpl]cite book|last=Johnson|first=Jeannine|title=Why write poetry?: modern poets defending their art|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4105-7|page=148[/tpl]
The rejection of traditional forms and structures for poetry that began in the first half of the 20th century coincided with a questioning of the purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.[tpl]cite book|editors=Jenkins, Lee M; Davis, Alex|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-61815-1|pages=1–7, 38, 156[/tpl]
Recently, postmodernism has come to convey more completely prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.[tpl]cite book|author=Barthes, Roland|chapter=Death of the Author|title=Image-Music-Text|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|year=1978|pages=142–148[/tpl] Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.[tpl]cite book|last=Connor|first=Steven|title=Postmodernist culture: an introduction to theories of the contemporary|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20052-9|pages=123–128|edition=2nd[/tpl]

==Elements==

===Prosody===

Prosody is the study of the meter, rhythm, and intonation of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related.[tpl]Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=52[/tpl] Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=20–21[/tpl]

====Rhythm====

The methods for creating poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Syllable-timed languages include Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, Galician and Spanish. English, Russian and, generally, German are stress-timed languages.[tpl]cite book|author=Schülter, Julia|title=Rhythmic Grammar|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2005|pages=24, 304, 332[/tpl] Varying intonation also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch, such as in Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or tone. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese, Lithuanian, and most Subsaharan languages.[tpl]cite book|author=Yip, Moira|title=Tone|series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-521-77314-8|pages=1–4, 130[/tpl]
Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided).[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12[/tpl] In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter.[tpl]cite book|last=Jorgens|first=Elise Bickford|title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597–1651|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7|pages=23[/tpl] Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75–76[/tpl]
The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.[tpl]cite book|last=Walker-Jones|first=Arthur|title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|isbn=978-1-58983-086-8|pages=211–213[/tpl] Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bala Sundara Raman|first=L|author2=Ishwar, S|author3= Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth|title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry|journal=Tamil Internet|year=2003|pages=128–136|doi=|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.3.7738[/tpl] In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.[tpl]cite book|editor=Brogan, TVF|title=The Princeton handbook of multicultural poetries|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00168-5|page=86[/tpl]
The formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of free verse, rhythm is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter. Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is critical to English poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Hartman|first=Charles O|title=Free Verse An Essay on Prosody|year=1980|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-1316-9|pages=24, 44, 47[/tpl] Jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm as an alternative to accentual rhythm.[tpl]Harvnb|Hollander|1981|p=22[/tpl]

====Meter====

In the Western poetic tradition, meters are customarily grouped according to a characteristic metrical foot and the number of feet per line.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=24[/tpl] The number of metrical feet in a line are described using Greek terminology: tetrameter for four feet and hexameter for six feet, for example.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=25, 34[/tpl] Thus, "iambic pentameter" is a meter comprising five feet per line, in which the predominant kind of foot is the "iamb". This metric system originated in ancient Greek poetry, and was used by poets such as Pindar and Sappho, and by the great tragedians of Athens. Similarly, "dactylic hexameter", comprises six feet per line, of which the dominant kind of foot is the "dactyl". Dactylic hexameter was the traditional meter of Greek epic poetry, the earliest extant examples of which are the works of Homer and Hesiod.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Aoidoi|title=Introduction to Greek Meter|date=January 2006|author=Annis, William S|pages=1–15|url=http://aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf[/tpl] Iambic pentameter and dactylic hexameter were later used by a number of poets, including William Shakespeare and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unibl.eu/pdf/examples_metrical_systems.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=Examples of English metrical systems|publisher=Fondazione Universitaria in provincia di Belluno[/tpl] The most common metrical feet in English are:[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=23–24[/tpl]
There are a wide range of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four syllable metric foot with a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kiparsky, Paul|journal=Language|pages=576–616|title=Stress, Syntax, and Meter|date=September 1975|volume=51|issue=3|doi=10.2307/412889[/tpl]
Each of these types of feet has a certain "feel," whether alone or in combination with other feet. The iamb, for example, is the most natural form of rhythm in the English language, and generally produces a subtle but stable verse.[tpl]cite book|author=Thompson, John|title=The Founding of English Meter|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1961|page=36[/tpl] Scanning meter can often show the basic or fundamental pattern underlying a verse, but does not show the varying degrees of stress, as well as the differing pitches and lengths of syllables.[tpl]Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|pp=11–24[/tpl]
There is debate over how useful a multiplicity of different "feet" is in describing meter. For example, Robert Pinsky has argued that while dactyls are important in classical verse, English dactylic verse uses dactyls very irregularly and can be better described based on patterns of iambs and anapests, feet which he considers natural to the language.[tpl]Harvnb|Pinsky|1998|p=66[/tpl] Actual rhythm is significantly more complex than the basic scanned meter described above, and many scholars have sought to develop systems that would scan such complexity. Vladimir Nabokov noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term "scud" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.[tpl]cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=0-691-01760-3|pages=9–13[/tpl]

====Metrical patterns====

Different traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean iambic pentameter and the Homeric dactylic hexameter to the anapestic tetrameter used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a caesura (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a feminine ending to soften it or be replaced by a spondee to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36–71[/tpl] Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, iambic tetrameter in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.[tpl]cite book|author=Nabokov, Vladimir|title=Notes on Prosody|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|year=1964|isbn=0-691-01760-3|pages=46–47[/tpl]
Some common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:

===Rhyme, alliteration, assonance===

Rhyme, alliteration, assonance and consonance are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem,  to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65[/tpl] They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, Chaucer used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.[tpl]cite book|chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration|author=Osberg, Richard H|editor=Gaylord, Alan T|title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's verse|isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|pages=195–228[/tpl]
Rhyme consists of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.[tpl]cite book|chapter=Introduction|author=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.)|title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|year=1994|isbn=0-374-17674-4[/tpl] The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Daedalus|title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry|author=Kiparsky, Paul|pages=231–244|date=Summer 1973|volume=102|issue=3[/tpl]
Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures. Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic.[tpl]cite book|pages=64–86|title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre|author=Russom, Geoffrey|isbn=978-0-521-59340-3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998[/tpl] Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Liu|first=James JY|title=Art of Chinese Poetry|year=1990|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48687-1|pages=21–22[/tpl] Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.

====Rhyming schemes====

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme.[tpl]cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03861-5|pages=x–xi, 38–42[/tpl] Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain).[tpl]cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0-8122-1324-6[/tpl] Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.[tpl]cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49[/tpl] Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.[tpl]Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71–104[/tpl]
Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an "a-a-b-a" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27[/tpl] Similarly, an "a-b-b-a" quatrain (what is known as "enclosed rhyme") is used in such forms as the Petrarchan sonnet.[tpl]Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88–91[/tpl] Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the "a-b-c" convention, such as the ottava rima and terza rima.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81–82, 85[/tpl] The types and use of differing rhyming schemes is discussed further in the main article.

===Form===

Poetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry, and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.[tpl]cite book|last=Whitworth|first=Michael H|title=Reading modernist poetry|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4|page=74[/tpl] Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.[tpl]Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50–51[/tpl]
Among major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and calligraphy. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called poetic forms or poetic modes (see following section), as in the sonnet or haiku.

====Lines and stanzas====

Poetry is often separated into lines on a page. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7–13[/tpl] See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.
Lines of poems are often organized into stanzas, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–82[/tpl]
Other poems may be organized into verse paragraphs, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78[/tpl] Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.[tpl]cite book|editor=Dalrymple, Roger|title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-23290-2|page=10[/tpl]
In many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78–79[/tpl]
In some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In skaldic poetry, the dróttkvætt stanza had eight lines, each having three "lifts" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dróttkvætts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dróttkvætts.[tpl]cite book|title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6|pages=269–280|editor=McTurk, Rory[/tpl]

====Visual presentation====

Even before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Harvard Theological Review|title=Acrostics and Metrics in Hebrew Poetry|author=Freedman, David Noel|volume=65|issue=3|date=July 1972|pages=367–392[/tpl] In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.[tpl]cite book|last=Kampf|first=Robert|title=Reading the Visual – 17th century poetry and visual culture|year=2010|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-60011-3|pages=4–6[/tpl]
With the advent of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.[tpl]cite book|last=Bohn|first=Willard|title=The aesthetics of visual poetry|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06325-6|pages=1–8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|work=Wired|author=Sterling, Bruce|title=Web Semantics: Asemic writing|date=13 July 2009|url=http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2009/07/web-semantics-asemic-writing/|accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl]

===Diction===

Poetic diction treats the manner in which language is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form.[tpl]cite book|last=Barfield|first=Owen|title=Poetic diction: a study in meaning|year=1987|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-6026-1|edition=2nd|page=41[/tpl] Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry.[tpl]cite journal|journal=American Journal of Philology|author=Sheets, George A|title=The Dialect Gloss, Hellenistic Poetics and Livius Andronicus|pages=58–78|volume=102|issue=1|date=Spring 1981[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Blank|first=Paula|title=Broken English: dialects and the politics of language in Renaissance writings|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-13779-9|pages=29–31[/tpl] Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody,[tpl]cite book|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|title=21st-century modernism: the new poetics|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|isbn=978-0-631-21970-5|page=2[/tpl] through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.[tpl]cite book|title=Medieval lyric: genres in historical context|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02536-5|editor=Paden, William D|page=193[/tpl]
Poetic diction can include rhetorical devices such as simile and metaphor, as well as tones of voice, such as irony. Aristotle wrote in the Poetics that "the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor."[tpl]Gutenberg|name=The Poetics of Aristotle|1974[/tpl], p. 22. Since the rise of Modernism, some poets have opted for a poetic diction that de-emphasizes rhetorical devices, attempting instead the direct presentation of things and experiences and the exploration of tone.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-61815-1|pages=90–96|editors=Davis, Alex; Jenkins, Lee M[/tpl] On the other hand, Surrealists have pushed rhetorical devices to their limits, making frequent use of catachresis.[tpl]cite book|last=San Juan|first=E, Jr|title=Working through the contradictions from cultural theory to critical practice|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5570-9|pages=124–125[/tpl]
Allegorical stories are central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were prominent in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages.[tpl]cite book|last=Treip|first=Mindele Anne|title=Allegorical poetics and the epic: the Renaissance tradition to Paradise Lost|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-1831-4|page=14[/tpl] Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.[tpl]cite journal|last=Crisp|first=P|title=Allegory and symbol – a fundamental opposition?|journal=Language and Literature|date=1 November 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323–338|doi=10.1177/0963947005051287[/tpl]
Another strong element of poetic diction can be the use of vivid imagery for effect. The juxtaposition of unexpected or impossible images is, for example, a particularly strong element in surrealist poetry and haiku.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Modern Haiku|volume=35|issue=2|pages=21–44|year=2004|author=Gilbert, Richard|title=The Disjunctive Dragonfly[/tpl] Vivid images are often endowed with symbolism or metaphor. Many poetic dictions use repetitive phrases for effect, either a short phrase (such as Homer's "rosy-fingered dawn" or "the wine-dark sea") or a longer refrain. Such repetition can add a sombre tone to a poem, or can be laced with irony as the context of the words changes.[tpl]Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=37–46[/tpl]

==Forms==

Specific poetic forms have been developed by many cultures. In more developed, closed or "received" poetic forms, the rhyming scheme, meter and other elements of a poem are based on sets of rules, ranging from the relatively loose rules that govern the construction of an elegy to the highly formalized structure of the ghazal or villanelle.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=160–165[/tpl] Described below are some common forms of poetry widely used across a number of languages. Additional forms of poetry may be found in the discussions of poetry of particular cultures or periods and in the glossary.

===Sonnet===

Among the most common forms of poetry through the ages is the sonnet, which by the 13th century was a poem of fourteen lines following a set rhyme scheme and logical structure. By the 14th century, the form further crystallized under the pen of Petrarch, whose sonnets were later translated in the 16th century by Sir Thomas Wyatt, who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94[/tpl] A sonnet's first four lines typically introduce the topic, the second elaborates and the third posits a problem - the couplet usually, but not always, includes a twist, or an afterthought. A sonnet usually follows an a-b-a-b-c-d-c-d-e-f-e-f-gg rhyme pattern. The sonnet's conventions have changed over its history, and so there are several different sonnet forms. Traditionally, in sonnets English poets use iambic pentameter, the Spenserian and Shakespearean sonnets being especially notable.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119–129[/tpl] In the Romance languages, the hendecasyllable and Alexandrine are the most widely used meters, though the Petrarchan sonnet has been used in Italy since the 14th century.[tpl]cite book|pages=15–17|title=Petrarch and Petrarchism|author=Minta, Stephen|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1980|isbn=0-7190-0748-8[/tpl]
Sonnets are particularly associated with love poetry, and often use a poetic diction heavily based on vivid imagery, but the twists and turns associated with the move from octave to sestet and to final couplet make them a useful and dynamic form for many subjects.[tpl]Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119–133[/tpl] Shakespeare's sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with 20 being included in the Oxford Book of English Verse.[tpl]cite book|editor=Quiller-Couch, Arthur|title=Oxford Book of English Verse|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1900[/tpl]

===Shi===

Shi ([tpl]CJKV|t=詩|s=诗|p=shī|w=shih[/tpl]) Is the main type of Classical Chinese poetry.Watson, Burton (1971). CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century. (New York: Columbia University Press). ISBN 0-231-03464-4, 1 Within this form of poetry the most important variations are "folk song" styled verse (yuefu), "old style" verse (gushi), "modern style" verse (jintishi). In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of shi poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or jueju) or else an eight line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a caesura before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.Watson, Burton (1971). CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century. (New York: Columbia University Press). ISBN 0-231-03464-4, 1-2 and 15-18 The "old style" verse (gushi) is less formally strict than the jintishi, or regulated verse, which, despite the name "new style" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back to Shen Yue, in the 5th or 6th century, although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi'ang (661-702)Watson, Burton (1971). CHINESE LYRICISM: Shih Poetry from the Second to the Twelfth Century. (New York: Columbia University Press). ISBN 0-231-03464-4, 111 and 115  A good example of a poet known for his gushi poems is Li Bai. Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese The basic form of jintishi (lushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of allusion, and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.[tpl]cite book|last=Faurot|first=Jeannette L|title=Drinking with the moon|year=1998|publisher=China Books & Periodicals|isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7|page=30[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yugen|title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse|journal=T'ang Studies|date=1 June 2004|volume=2004|issue=22|pages=81–125|doi=10.1179/073750304788913221[/tpl] One of the masters of the form was Du Fu, who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).[tpl]cite book|last=Schirokauer|first=Conrad|title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations|year=1989|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=978-0-15-505569-8|edition=2nd|page=119[/tpl]

===Villanelle===

The villanelle is a nineteen-line poem made up of five triplets with a closing quatrain; the poem is characterized by having two refrains, initially used in the first and third lines of the first stanza, and then alternately used at the close of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain, which is concluded by the two refrains. The remaining lines of the poem have an a-b alternating rhyme.[tpl]cite book|page=314|author=Kumin, Maxine|chapter=Gymnastics: The Villanelle|editor=Varnes, Kathrine|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-472-06725-1[/tpl] The villanelle has been used regularly in the English language since the late 19th century by such poets as Dylan Thomas,"Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night" in [tpl]cite book|author=Thomas, Dylan|title=In Country Sleep and Other Poems|publisher=New Directions Publications|year=1952|page=18[/tpl] W.

===Tanka===

Tanka is a form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, with five sections totalling 31 onji (phonological units identical to morae), structured in a 5-7-5-7-7 pattern.[tpl]cite book|page=181|title=Global linguistic flows|editors=Samy Alim, H; Ibrahim, Awad; Pennycook, Alastair|isbn=978-0-8058-6283-6|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2009[/tpl] There is generally a shift in tone and subject matter between the upper 5-7-5 phrase and the lower 7-7 phrase. Tanka were written as early as the Asuka period by such poets as Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, at a time when Japan was emerging from a period where much of its poetry followed Chinese form.[tpl]cite book|last=Brower|first=Robert H|title=Japanese court poetry|year=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1524-9|pages=86–92|author2=Miner, Earl[/tpl] Tanka was originally the shorter form of Japanese formal poetry (which was generally referred to as "waka"), and was used more heavily to explore personal rather than public themes. By the tenth century, tanka had become the dominant form of Japanese poetry, to the point where the originally general term waka ("Japanese poetry") came to be used exclusively for tanka. Tanka are still widely written today.[tpl]cite book|title=The tanka anthology: tanka in English from around the world|year=2003|publisher=Red Moon Press|isbn=978-1-893959-40-8|pages=xxx–xlviii|editor=McCllintock, Michael; Ness, Pamela Miller; Kacian, Jim[/tpl]

===Haiku===

Haiku is a popular form of unrhymed Japanese poetry, which evolved in the 17th century from the hokku, or opening verse of a renku.[tpl]Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=117[/tpl] Generally written in a single vertical line, the haiku contains three sections totalling 17 onji, structured in a 5-7-5 pattern. Traditionally, haiku contain a kireji, or cutting word, usually placed at the end of one of the poem's three sections, and a kigo, or season-word.[tpl]cite book|title=Haiku moment: an anthology of contemporary North American haiku|year=1993|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle Co|isbn=978-0-8048-1820-9|editor=Ross, Bruce|page=xiii[/tpl] The most famous exponent of the haiku was Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694).

===Ode===

Odes were first developed by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear in many of the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins.[tpl]cite book|last=Gray|first=Thomas|title=English lyrics from Dryden to Burns|year=2000|publisher=Elibron|isbn=978-1-4021-0064-2|pages=155–156[/tpl] The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode.[tpl]cite book|last=Gayley|first=Charles Mills|title=English Poetry|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4179-0086-2|edition=Reprint|author2=Young, Clement C|page=lxxxv[/tpl] Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Kuiper|first=edited by Kathleen|title=Poetry and drama literary terms and concepts|year=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational Pub. in association with Rosen Educational Services|isbn=978-1-61530-539-1|page=51[/tpl]

===Ghazal===

The ghazal (also ghazel, gazel, gazal, or gozol) is a form of poetry common in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Urdu and Bengali poetry. In classic form, the ghazal has from five to fifteen rhyming couplets that share a refrain at the end of the second line. This refrain may be of one or several syllables, and is preceded by a rhyme. Each line has an identical meter. The ghazal often reflects on a theme of unattainable love or divinity.[tpl]cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan E|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase|isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|page=260[/tpl]
As with other forms with a long history in many languages, many variations have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society|volume=43|issue=3|date=Autumn 1990|title=Musical Gesture and Extra-Musical Meaning: Words and Music in the Urdu Ghazal|author=Qureshi, Regula Burckhardt|pages=457–497|doi=10.1525/jams.1990.43.3.03a00040[/tpl] Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter and the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Isaac|title=The Mystique of the Mushaira|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=1 June 1981|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1981.4745121.x[/tpl] Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Religion & Literature|volume=20|issue=1|date=Spring 1988|title=Mystical Poetry in Islam: The Case of Maulana Jalaladdin Rumi|author=Schimmel, Annemarie|pages=67–80[/tpl]

==Genres==

In addition to specific forms of poems, poetry is often thought of in terms of different genres and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics.[tpl]cite web|author=Chandler, Daniel|title=Introduction to Genre Theory|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/intgenre/intgenre.html|publisher=Aberystwyth University|accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl] Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.[tpl]cite book|pages=16, 391–402|title=Beyond the screen: transformations of literary structures, interfaces and genres|editors=Schafer, Jorgen; Gendolla, Peter|isbn=978-3-8376-1258-5|publisher=Verlag|year=2010[/tpl]

===Narrative poetry===

Narrative poetry is a genre of poetry that tells a story. Broadly it subsumes epic poetry, but the term "narrative poetry" is often reserved for smaller works, generally with more appeal to human interest. Narrative poetry may be the oldest type of poetry. Many scholars of Homer have concluded that his Iliad and Odyssey were composed from compilations of shorter narrative poems that related individual episodes. Much narrative poetry—such as Scottish and English ballads, and Baltic and Slavic heroic poems—is performance poetry with roots in a preliterate oral tradition. It has been speculated that some features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as meter, alliteration and kennings, once served as memory aids for bards who recited traditional tales.[tpl]cite book|pages=22–45|author=Kirk, GS|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|isbn=978-0-521-13671-6|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|edition=reprint[/tpl]
Notable narrative poets have included Ovid, Dante, Juan Ruiz, Chaucer, William Langland, Luís de Camões, Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Robert Burns, Fernando de Rojas, Adam Mickiewicz, Alexander Pushkin, Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred Tennyson.

===Epic poetry===

Epic poetry is a genre of poetry, and a major form of narrative literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature to the culture of the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons.[tpl]cite book|last=Hainsworth|first=JB|title=Traditions of heroic and epic poetry|year=1989|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|isbn=978-0-947623-19-7|pages=171–175[/tpl] Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent on the basis of his epic, Omeros.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/press.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1992: Derek Walcott|publisher=Swedish Academy[/tpl]

===Dramatic poetry===

Dramatic poetry is drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, sometimes related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse dates to the 6th century B.C., and may have been an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama,[tpl]cite book|author=Keith, Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=Sanskrit Drama in its origin, development, theory and practice|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=1992|pages=57–58|isbn=978-81-208-0977-2[/tpl] just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera.[tpl]cite book|author=Dolby, William|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theatre|editor=Mackerras, Colin|isbn=978-0-8248-1220-1|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1983|page=17[/tpl] East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's tragedy of Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's tragedy of Farhad.

===Satirical poetry===

Poetry can be a powerful vehicle for satire. The Romans had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for political purposes. A notable example is the Roman poet Juvenal's satires.[tpl]cite book|last=Dominik|first=William J|title=Roman verse satire: Lucilius to Juvenal|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci|isbn=978-0-86516-442-0|pages=1–3|author2=Wehrle, T[/tpl]
The same is true of the English satirical tradition. John Dryden (a Tory), the first Poet Laureate, produced in 1682 Mac Flecknoe, subtitled "A Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S." (a reference to Thomas Shadwell).[tpl]cite book|page=1056|editor=Black, Joseph|title=Broadview Anthology of British Literature|volume=1|isbn=978-1-55481-048-2|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2011[/tpl] Another master of 17th-century English satirical poetry was John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Review of English Studies|volume=24|issue=93|title=Satirical Inversion of Some English Sources in Rochester's Poetry|author=Treglown, Jeremy|pages=42–48[/tpl] Satirical poets outside England include Poland's Ignacy Krasicki, Azerbaijan's Sabir and Portugal's Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage.

===Light poetry===

Light poetry, or light verse, is poetry that attempts to be humorous.  Poems considered "light" are usually brief, and can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature word play, including puns, adventurous rhyme and heavy alliteration. Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English is usually formal.  Common forms include the limerick, the clerihew, and the double dactyl.
While light poetry is sometimes condemned as doggerel, or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets have also excelled at light verse.  Notable writers of light poetry include Lewis Carroll, Ogden Nash, X. J. Kennedy, Willard R. Espy, and Wendy Cope.

===Lyric poetry===

Lyric poetry is a genre that, unlike epic and dramatic poetry, does not attempt to tell a story but instead is of a more personal nature. Poems in this genre tend to be shorter, melodic, and contemplative. Rather than depicting characters and actions, it portrays the poet's own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions.[tpl]cite book|last=Blasing|first=Mutlu Konuk|title=Lyric poetry : the pain and the pleasure of words|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12682-1|pages=1–22[/tpl] Notable poets in this genre include John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Antonio Machado.

===Elegy===

An elegy is a mournful, melancholy or plaintive poem, especially a lament for the dead or a funeral song. The term "elegy," which originally denoted a type of poetic meter (elegiac meter), commonly describes a poem of mourning. An elegy may also reflect something that seems to the author to be strange or mysterious. The elegy, as a reflection on a death, on a sorrow more generally, or on something mysterious, may be classified as a form of lyric poetry.[tpl]cite book|last=Pigman|first=GW|title=Grief and English Renaissance elegy|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26871-4|pages=40–47[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Elegy|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20906-4|pages=10–34[/tpl]
Notable practitioners of elegiac poetry have included Propertius, Jorge Manrique, Jan Kochanowski, Chidiock Tichborne, Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, John Milton, Thomas Gray, Charlotte Turner Smith, William Cullen Bryant, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Evgeny Baratynsky, Alfred Tennyson, Walt Whitman, Louis Gallet, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramón Jiménez, William Butler Yeats, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Virginia Woolf.

===Verse fable===

The fable is an ancient literary genre, often (though not invariably) set in verse. It is a succinct story that features anthropomorphized animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that illustrate a moral lesson (a "moral"). Verse fables have used a variety of meter and rhyme patterns.[tpl]cite book|last=Harpham|first=Geoffrey Galt; Abrams, MH|title=A glossary of literary terms|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-89802-3|page=9|edition=10th[/tpl]
Notable verse fabulists have included Aesop, Vishnu Sarma, Phaedrus, Marie de France, Robert Henryson, Biernat of Lublin, Jean de La Fontaine, Ignacy Krasicki, Félix María de Samaniego, Tomás de Iriarte, Ivan Krylov and Ambrose Bierce.

===Prose poetry===

Prose poetry is a hybrid genre that shows attributes of both prose and poetry. It may be indistinguishable from the micro-story (a.k.a. the "short short story", "flash fiction"). While some examples of earlier prose strike modern readers as poetic, prose poetry is commonly regarded as having originated in 19th-century France, where its practitioners included Aloysius Bertrand, Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Stéphane Mallarmé.[tpl]cite book|last=Monte|first=Steven|title=Invisible fences: prose poetry as a genre in French and American literature|year=2000|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-3211-2|pages=4–9[/tpl] Since the late 1980s especially, prose poetry has gained increasing popularity, with entire journals, such as The Prose Poem: An International Journal,[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.providence.edu/prosepoem/|title=The Prose Poem: An International Journal|accessdate=10 December 2011|publisher=Providence College[/tpl] Contemporary Haibun Online[tpl]cite web|url=http://contemporaryhaibunonline.com|title=Contemporary Haibun Online|accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl] devoted to that genre.

===Speculative poetry===

Speculative poetry, also known as fantastic poetry, (of which weird or macabre poetry is a major subclassification), is a poetic genre which deals thematically with subjects which are 'beyond reality', whether via extrapolation as in science fiction or via weird and horrific themes as in horror fiction. Such poetry appears regularly in modern science fiction and horror fiction magazines. Edgar Allan Poe is sometimes seen as the "father of speculative poetry".[tpl]cite book|editor=Dutcher, Roger|title=The alchemy of stars|year=2005|publisher=Science Fiction Poetry Association|isbn=978-0-8095-1162-4|pages=11–17|author=Allen, Mike[/tpl]
