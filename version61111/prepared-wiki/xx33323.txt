In 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Academy Award.
Corman mentored and gave a start to many young film directors such as Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Peter Bogdanovich.[tpl]cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/41915/Roger-Corman-Hollywood-s-Wild-Angel/overview |title=Roger Corman: Hollywood's Wild Angel (1978) |last=Maslin |first=Janet |publisher=The New York Times |quote=Among the Corman associates and protegees interviewed are David Carradine, Peter Fonda, Ron Howard, Paul Bartel, Martin Scorcese, Joe Dante and Peter Bogdanovich.[/tpl] He helped launch the careers of actors Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson.
Corman has occasionally taken minor acting roles in the films of directors who started with him, including The Silence of the Lambs, The Godfather Part II, Apollo 13, The Manchurian Candidate (2004) and Philadelphia. A documentary about Corman's life and career entitled Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel premiered at Sundance and Cannes Film Festivals in 2011, directed by Alex Stapleton.

==Early life==

Corman was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Anne (née High) and William Corman, an engineer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Roger-Corman.html |title=Roger Corman Biography (1926–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last=H.W. Wilson Company|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Current Biography Yearbook|publisher=New York|year=1984|location=|pages=|month=|url=|id=[/tpl] His brother, Eugene Harold "Gene" Corman, has also produced numerous films, sometimes in collaboration with Roger. Corman and his brother were baptized in their mother's Catholic faith.How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime, by Roger Corman, 1998, p. 4 Corman went to Beverly Hills High School and then to Stanford University to study industrial engineering. While at Stanford, Corman enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program. After the end of World War II, Corman returned to Stanford and received a degree in industrial engineering. In 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on Slauson Avenue in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss "I've made a terrible mistake."[tpl]cite web|last=Holte|first=Michael Ned|title=Value Engineering: Roger Corman with his own Context|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/value-engineering-roger-corman-within-his-own-context|publisher=East of Borneo|accessdate=May 24, 2012[/tpl]
More interested in film, Corman found work at 20th Century Fox initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as The Gunfighter with Gregory Peck. When Corman received no credit at all he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the GI Bill, Corman studied English Literature at Oxford University. He then returned to Los Angeles, beginning his film career in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, then started directing films in 1955.

==Career==

Corman began to direct films in the mid-1950s, including Swamp Women (1955). In his early period, he produced up to nine movies a year.  His fastest film was perhaps The Little Shop of Horrors (1960), which was reputedly shot in two days and one night.Simpson, MJ (September 23, 1995). "Interview with Roger Corman" http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/rogercorman.html. Retrieved 2007-10-24. "I shot Little Shop of Horrors in two days and a night for about $30,000, and the picture has lasted all these years."[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Supposedly, he had made a bet that he could shoot an entire feature film in less than three days. Another version of the story claims that he had a set rented for a month, and finished using it with three days to spare, thus pushing him to use the set to make a new film. (This is a variation of the story behind 1963's The Terror, much of which was filmed in two leftover days with Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson, after The Raven, which featured them both, wrapped with two days to spare.)
In addition to producing and directing films for American International Pictures (AIP), Corman also partially funded other low-budget films released by other film companies. In 1959, Corman founded Filmgroup with his brother Gene, a company producing or releasing low-budget black-and-white films as double features for drive-ins and action houses. Finding that black-and-white double features were not as successful as colour films, Corman returned to AIP,pp. 22–41 Ray, Fred Olen Filmgroup in The New Poverty Row: Independent Filmmakers as Distributors McFarland, 1991 and Filmgroup ceased operation in 1962.

==The Edgar Allan Poe adaptations==

Corman's greatest acclaim as a director came with his Edgar Allan Poe cycle released between 1959 and 1964. Based on the works of Poe, made through American International Pictures and mostly in collaboration with writer/scenarist Richard Matheson, the series of eight films comprises House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Premature Burial (1962), Tales of Terror (1962), The Raven (1963), The Haunted Palace (1963), The Masque of the Red Death (1964) and The Tomb of Ligeia (1964). All but The Premature Burial starred Vincent Price. Other Poe films were made at AIP in the late 1960s and early 1970s directed by other filmmakers with Price in starring roles.
Corman also worked with set designer Daniel Haller and cinematographer Floyd Crosby on the series. Others who joined him include cinematographer Nicolas Roeg (on Masque), writers Robert Towne and Charles Beaumont, and actors Ray Milland, Basil Rathbone, Hazel Court, Barbara Steele, Debra Paget, and Peter Lorre. After The Raven was completed, Corman reportedly realized that he still had some shooting days left before the sets were torn down and so made another film, The Terror (1963), on the spot with the remaining cast, crew and sets.

==Other work==

He also directed one of William Shatner's earliest appearances in a lead role with The Intruder (a.k.a. The Stranger, 1962). Based on a novel by Charles Beaumont, the film, made for approximately US$80,000,[tpl]cite web|title=Box office / business for The Intruder|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055019/business|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl] is known for its treatment of segregation and civil rights.[tpl]cite web|title=The Intruder|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews32/the_intruder_corman.htm|work=DVD Beaver|accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl]
The late 1960s saw Corman and his films give a voice to the counter-culture of the time. In 1966, Corman made the first biker movie with The Wild Angels. It starred Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra and opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival. In 1967, The Trip, written by Jack Nicholson and starring Peter Fonda, began the psychedelic film craze of the late 1960s and was the American entry at Cannes that year. Joan Didion said she went to see The Wild Angels because "there on the screen was some news I was not getting from the New York Times. I began to think I was seeing ideograms of the future."Didion, Joan; The White Album; (1979) pg.100
In 1970, Corman founded New World Pictures which became a small independently-owned production/distribution studio,[tpl]cite web|last=Morris|first=Gary|title=Roger Corman's New World Pictures|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/27/newworldpictures1.php|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=January 2000[/tpl] making many cult films such as Women in Cages (1971), Death Race 2000 (1975), Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), Galaxy of Terror (1981), Children of the Corn (1984), and the Joe Dante film Piranha (1978).[tpl]cite web|title=New World Picture: Production Company – filmography|url=http://www.imdb.com/company/co0065427/#productionX20company|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl] Corman's distribution side of New World brought many foreign films to mass audiences in the United States for the first time, including the works of Ingmar Bergman, François Truffaut, Federico Fellini, and Akira Kurosawa. In a ten-year period, New World Pictures won more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film than all other studios combined. Corman eventually sold New World to an investment group in 1983 and later formed Concorde Pictures and New Horizons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35133/shout-if-you-want-roger-corman-creatures-and-classic-gamera-dvds|title=Shout If You Want Roger Corman Creatures and Classic Gamera DVDs![/tpl] Corman's penultimate film as director was Von Richthofen and Brown (1971). Corman had always wanted to make an aviation movie, having enjoyed piloting model planes as a young boy. He then returned to directing once more with Frankenstein Unbound (1990). In total, Roger Corman has produced over 300 movies and directed more than 50.
In 2009, Corman produced and directed alongside director Joe Dante the web series "Splatter" for Netflix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/4300-roger-corman-and-joe-dante-splatter-netflix.html|title=Roger Corman and Joe Dante SPLATTER Netflix[/tpl] The protagonist of the film is portrayed by Corey Feldman,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17716|title=Full Info on Feldman, Corman and Dante's 'Splatter'[/tpl] and the story talks of the haunting tale of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34261/see-a-gruesome-advance-clip-splatter|title=See a Gruesome Advance Clip from Splatter|publisher=DreadCentral[/tpl] He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante's web series Trailers From Hell.[tpl]cite web|title=Roger Corman|url=http://www.trailersfromhell.com/gurus/49|work=Trailers From Hell|accessdate=April 19, 2013[/tpl]

Jackson, Gale Anne Hurd, Carl Colpaert, Joe Dante, James Cameron, John Sayles, Monte Hellman, George Armitage, Jonathan Kaplan, George Hickenlooper, Curtis Hanson, Jack Hill, Robert Towne, Michael Venzor and Timur Bekmambetov. Many have said that Corman's influence taught them some of the ins-and-outs of filmmaking.Nashawaty, Chris "Roger Corman: Scorsese, Stallone, Sayles, and other A-listers talk about the B-movie King" Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved February 19, 2010 In the extras for the DVD of The Terminator, director James Cameron asserts, "I trained at the Roger Corman Film School." The British director Nicolas Roeg served as the cinematographer on The Masque of the Red Death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/masqueofreddeath1964.html|title=MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH: The Apex of Roger Corman's Poe Films[/tpl] Cameron, Coppola, Demme, Hanson, Howard and Scorsese have all gone on to win Academy Awards.  Howard was reportedly told by Corman, "If you do a good job on this film, you'll never have to work for me again."
Actors who obtained their career breaks working for Corman include Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, Michael McDonald, Dennis Hopper, Talia Shire, Sandra Bullock, and Robert De Niro.
