The museum was originally transformed from the former Kaohsiung Harbor Train Station, built during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. The station was then the first railway station in Kaohsiung with the original name of Takao Post. In 2003, the station building was classified as historical building by the Kaohsiung City Government. On 9 November 2008, the last train was pulled out from the station at 5.30 p.m.http://travelkaohsiung.com/takao-railway-museum-kaohsiung/
