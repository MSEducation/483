Bowen Field House is a 5,400 seat multi-purpose arena in Ypsilanti, Michigan on the Eastern Michigan University campus.  It opened in 1955 and was home to the Eastern Michigan Eagles men's and women's basketball teams until the Convocation Center opened in 1997. It currently serves as the home of Eastern Michigan Eagles track and field, Eastern Michigan Eagles wrestling, and Eastern Michigan Eagles gymnastics.
The last regular season basketball game at the Field House was against the University of Toledo on February 25, 1998, though EMU hosted Toledo again three days later in the Field House in the opening round of the Mid-American Conference tournament that year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=74IUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,3663593&dq=bowen-field-house |work=Toledo Blade |title=Boykins gets last word against UT |accessdate=2009-09-10 |date=1998-02-26 |last=Hackenberg |first=Dave[/tpl] EMU has brought basketball back to the Field House (Nov. 12-14), where the men's team will be playing Concordia University on the 12th and Robert Morris on the 14th, and the women's team will be hosting Butler on the 13th.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emueagles.com/news/2013/8/28/MBB_0828130329.aspx |work=EMUeagles.com |title=EMU Basketball Heads Back to Bowen |accessdate=2013-10-10 |date=2013-08-31 |last=Athletics |first=EMU[/tpl]
On December 4, 1995, during halftime of a basketball game against San Francisco State, more than 50 EMU students took the court for an hour to protest the arrest a month earlier of a black student by a white police officer at a residence hall. Approximately 1,300 spectators were ushered out of the arena, and the second half of the game was played in the empty arena.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NF0RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v4cDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5180,3411717&dq=bowen-field-house |title=Protest delays EMU game |accessdate=2009-09-10 |date=1995-12-05 |work=The Bryan Times[/tpl]
