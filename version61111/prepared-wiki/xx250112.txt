The Tamiami Formation is a Late Miocene to Pliocene geologic formation in the southwest Florida peninsula.Parker, Garald G., 1951, Geologic and hydrologic factors in the perennial yield of the Biscayne aquifer: Jour. Am. Water Works Assoc., v. 43, no. 10, p. 817-834, 7 figs.

==Age==

Period: Neogene 
Epoch: Late Miocene to Pliocene 
Faunal stage: Clarendonian through Blancan ~13.06â€”2.588 mya, calculates to a period of [tpl]Mya|13.06-2.588|million years[/tpl]

==Location==

The Tamiami Formation appears in the counties of Charlotte, Lee, Hendry, Collier and Monroe. It is widespread in Florida and part of the intermediate confining aquifer system.Mansfield, W. C., 1939, Notes on the upper Tertiary and Pleistocene mollusks of peninsular Florida: Florida Geological Survey Bulletin 18, 75 p. The Tamiami formation overlies the Hawthorn at every locality where the Hawthorn has been penetrated and is overlain unconformably by the Caloosahatchee marl of the Pliocene in Charlotte County.

==Composition==

The Tamiami Formation contains a wide range of mixed carbonate-siliciclastic lithologies and associated faunas. It occurs at or near the land surface in the southern peninsula with numerous named and unnamed members recognized within the Tamiami Formation. Its unevenness indicates that the upper part has been subjected to erosion.Missimer, T.M., 1992, Stratigraphic relationships of sediment facies within the Tamiami Formation of southwestern Florida: Proposed intraformational correlations; in Scott, T.M., and Allmon, W.D., (eds.), The Plio-Pleistocene stratigraphy and paleontology of southern Florida; Florida Geological Survey Special Publication 36, p. 63-92.

==Lithologies==

The Tamiami Formation includes:
Phosphate is present in limited quantities throughout the Tamiami in sand and gravel.

==Fossils==

Fossils appear in casts and molds, as well as original material.
