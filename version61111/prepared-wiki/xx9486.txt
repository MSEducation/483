The most northerly is North Ronaldsay, which lies [tpl]convert|4|km|mi|0[/tpl] beyond its nearest neighbour, Sanday. To the west is Westray has a population of 550. It is connected by ferry and air to Papa Westray, also known as "Papay". Eday is at the centre of the North Isles. The centre of the island is moorland and the island's main industries have been peat extraction and limestone quarrying.
Rousay, Egilsay and Gairsay lie north of the west Mainland across the Eynhallow Sound. Rousay is well-known for its ancient monuments, including the Quoyness chambered cairn and Egilsay has the ruins of the only round-towered church in Orkney. Wyre to the south east contains the site of Cubbie Roo's castle. Stronsay and Papa Stronsay lie much further to the east across the Stronsay Firth.  Auskerry is south of Stronsay and has a population of only five.  Shapinsay and its Balfour Castle are a short distance north of Kirkwall.
Other small uninhabited islands in the North Isles group include: Calf of Eday, Damsay, Eynhallow, Faray, Helliar Holm, Holm of Faray, Holm of Huip, Holm of Papa, Holm of Scockness, Kili Holm, Linga Holm, Muckle Green Holm, Rusk Holm and Sweyn Holm.

===The South Isles===

The southern group of islands surrounds Scapa Flow. Hoy is the second largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the highest elevation in the archipelago. The Old Man of Hoy is a well-known seastack. Burray lies to the east of Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay, which hosts the cultural events, the Festival of the Horse and the Boys' Ploughing Match on the third Saturday in August.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/tradition/festivalofhorse.htm|title=The Festival of the Horse and the Boys' Ploughing Match|publisher=Orknejyar|accessdate=6 April 2012[/tpl] It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles. Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy, and the latter is known for its large oil terminal. South Walls has a 19th-century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre. South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glims Holm, and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers.
Uninhabited South Islands include: Calf of Flotta, Cava, Copinsay, Corn Holm, Fara, Glims Holm, Hunda, Lamb Holm, Rysa Little, Switha and Swona. The Pentland Skerries lie further south, closer to the Scottish mainland.

==Geology==

The superficial rock of Orkney is almost entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age.Marshall, J.E.A., & Hewett, A.J. "Devonian" in Evans, D., Graham C., Armour, A., & Bathurst, P. (eds) (2003) The Millennium Atlas: petroleum geology of the central and northern North Sea. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may be seen on the Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.Hall, Adrian and Brown, John (September 2005) "Basement Geology". Retrieved 10 November 2008.
The Middle Devonian is divided into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is dominated by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie.Hall, Adrian and Brown, John (September 2005) "Lower Middle Devonian". Retrieved 10 November 2008. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.Brown, John Flett "Geology and Landscape" in Omand (2003) pp. 4-5.
The Old Man of Hoy is formed from sandstone of the uppermost Eday group that is up to [tpl]convert|800|m|yd[/tpl] thick in places. It lies unconformably upon steeply inclined flagstones, the interpretation of which is a matter of continuing debate.Mykura, W. (with contributions by Flinn, D. & May, F.) (1976) British Regional Geology: Orkney and Shetland. Institute of Geological Sciences. Natural Environment Council.
The Devonian and older rocks of Orkney are cut by a series of WSW-ENE to N-S trending faults, many of which were active during deposition of the Devonian sequences.Land Use Consultants (1998) "Orkney landscape character assessment". Scottish Natural Heritage Review No. 100.  A strong synclinal fold traverses Eday and Shapinsay, the axis trending north-south.
Middle Devonian basaltic volcanic rocks are found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics and the other two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain.Odling, N.W.A. (2000) "Point of Ayre".

Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. Boulder clay is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.Brown, John Flett "Geology and Landscape" in Omand (2003) p. 10.

==Climate==

Orkney has a cool temperate climate that is remarkably mild and steady for such a northerly latitude, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.Chalmers, Jim "Agriculture in Orkney Today" in Omand (2003) p. 129. The average temperature for the year is [tpl]convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl]; for winter [tpl]convert|4|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] and for summer [tpl]convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl]."Regional mapped climate averages" Met Office.

==Language, literature and folklore==

At the beginning of recorded history the islands were inhabited by the Picts, whose language was Brythonic.[tpl]#tag:ref|There is convincing place-name evidence for the Picts use of Brythonic or P-Celtic, although no written records survive. No certain knowledge of any pre-Pictish language exists anywhere in Scotland, but there may well have been times of significant overlap.Clarkson (2008) pp. 30-34. For example, the early Scottish Earls spoke Gaelic when the majority of their subjects spoke Norn and both of these languages were then replaced by Insular Scots. It is therefore possible that the Pictish aristocracy spoke one language and the common folk an unknown precursor such as Proto-Celtic.Lamb, Gregor "The Orkney Tongue" in Omand (2003) pp. 248-49.|group="Notes"[/tpl] The Ogham script on the Buckquoy spindle-whorl is cited as evidence for the pre-Norse existence of Old Irish in Orkney.[tpl]Cite journal| author=Forsyth, Katherine| title=The ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl from Buckquoy: evidence for the Irish language in pre-Viking Orkney?| journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland| volume=125| year=1995| pages=677–96| url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/psas/volumes.cfm|format=PDF| publisher=ARCHway| accessdate=12 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Only two Q-Celtic words exist in the language of modern Orcadians - "iper" from eabhar, meaning a midden slurry, and "keero" from caora - used to describe a small sheep in the North Isles.Lamb, Gregor "The Orkney Tongue" in Omand (2003) p. 250.|group="Notes"[/tpl]
