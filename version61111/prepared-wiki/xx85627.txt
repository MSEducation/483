[tpl]Nihongo|Future Boy Conan|未来少年コナン|Mirai Shōnen Konan[/tpl] is a post-apocalyptic science fiction anime series, which premiered across Japan on the NHK network between April 4 and October 31, 1978 on the Tuesday 19:30-20:00 timeslot. The official English title used by Nippon Animation is Conan, The Boy in Future. It is an adaptation of Alexander Key's novel The Incredible Tide.

==Production==

Spanning a total of 26 episodes, the series was produced by Nippon Animation and featured the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki, also contributing to character designs and storyboards. Other future prominent anime creators like Isao Takahata (storyboards, directing) and Yoshiyuki Tomino (storyboards) also worked on the series.

==Story==

The story begins in July 2008, during a time when humankind is faced with the threat of extinction. A devastating war fought between two major nations with ultra-magnetic weapons far greater than anything seen earlier brings about total chaos and destruction throughout the world, resulting in several earthquakes and tidal waves, the earth thrown off its axis, its crust being rocked by massive movements, and the five continents being torn completely apart and sinking deep below the sea.
An attempt by a group of people to flee to outer space failed, with their spaceships being forced back to earth and vanishing, thus shattering their hopes. But one of the spaceships narrowly escaped destruction and crash landed on a small island which had miraculously survived the devastation. The crew members of the spaceship settled there, as if they were seeds sown on the island.
Amidst these survivors, a boy named Conan is born on October 2010, bringing a new ray of hope to the earth. After several years, during which most of the other survivors had died and the only people left on the island were Conan and his grandfather, he meets a young girl named Lana, and their adventure begins. Between the different islands left in the world: Industria, High Harbor, Remnant, and others, the young group of adventurers travel and conflict rises between good and evil people. Throughout the series a pure love story develops between Conan and Lana.[tpl]cite journal |author= | title=純粋な少年「コナン」と少女「ラナ」の愛の物語「ラブストーリー」| trans_title= Pure Love Story Conan and Lana| language=Japanese|url=http://animage.jp | journal=Animage | location=Tokyo |publisher=Tokuma Shoten | issue=145 | date=June 10, 1990 | page=37 | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Miyazaki |first=Hayao |date=July 31, 1996 |chapter=「コ ナン」 を語る |trans_chapter= Speaking of Conan |title=出発点 1979~1996|trans_title=Starting Point 1979~1996 |url=http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Viz Media |pages=285–310| isbn=978-1-4215-0594-7 |accessdate= February 21, 2014[/tpl]

==Influences and reception==

In a 1983 interview, with Yōko Yomizawa, Hayao Miyazaki acknowledged that ratings for the show had not been very good, noting that episode twenty-five had received the highest rating, of 14 percent.
In her 1999 book, Hayao Miyazaki Master of Japanese Animation, Helen McCarthy identifies Conan as a "seminal" work and recognises themes and story elements in this production which Miyazaki would continue to explore throughout his career. McCarthy also notes continuity in the development of characters and their plight throughout Miyazaki's work. She sees Lana and Conan as precedents for his later heroines and characters and mentions, among others, Sheeta's rescue by Pazu, from Miyazaki's 1986 animated feature film Castle in the Sky, as an example.[tpl]cite book | last=McCarthy | first=Helen | authorlink=Helen McCarthy | year=1999 | title=Hayao Miyazaki Master of Japanese Animation | edition=2002 | url=http://www.stonebridge.com/shopexd.asp?id=210 | location=Berkeley, Ca | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | pages=39, 223 | isbn=1880656418[/tpl]

===Popularity in the Arab World===

The show was very popular in the Arab World and still is today.  Conan's name was changed to Adnan. Lana's name was changed to Leena so that they could have names similar to Arabic names. A DVD version was released for most of the episodes with the anime dubbed into the Arabic language.
