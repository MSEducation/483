In 2004 the magazine, previously published by Jim Sharp, was sold to an investment group based in Mobile, Alabama.Jim Bessman, "Words & Music", Billboard, May 15, 2004, p. 67.  In 2011, Albie Del Favero took over the reins, "joining the team as Co-Publisher, and President of its parent company ForASong Media, LLC.

The magazine holds six bi-monthly lyric contests. The winner of each contest receives a new Gibson acoustic guitar, a Shure SM58 microphone, and a feature in the magazine. One annual grand-prize winner for the 2014 contest will win a co-writing session with Ashley Monroe, and get a chance to record a demo at a leading Nashville studio.
A special section of the website, Songwriter U, focuses on the business of songwriting, and includes articles on royalty collection, marketing, touring, guitar instruction and lyric technique.
Advertisers include national instrument manufacturers, record companies who want to gain exposure for their singer/songwriters and bands, publishers who honor writer achievements, demo studios, recording software and a select group of non-musical companies who are positioning their products within the musical culture.[tpl]cite web|title=American Songwriter: About Us|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/about-us/|publisher=American Songwriter|accessdate=2013-02-23[/tpl]
