The Knox County Courthouse is a historic building in Center, Nebraska, the county seat of Knox County.
After a series of five elections to determine a county seat, Center — located on two corn fields in the geographic center of the county — was selected in 1901 as the county seat. A first courthouse was built in 1902. The current courthouse was constructed from February to October 1934. In addition to $50,000 raised by the county from tax levies, the courthouse was the first public building in Nebraska to be built using funds and workers from the Civil Works Administration and Federal Emergency Relief Administration.Knox County History.
