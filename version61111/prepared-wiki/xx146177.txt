The Dry River is a 9.0 mile long (14.5 km)New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system river in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is a tributary of the Saco River, which flows to the Atlantic Ocean in Maine.  For nearly its entire length, it is within the Presidential Range-Dry River Wilderness of the White Mountain National Forest. 
The Dry River rises in Oakes Gulf, a glacial cirque on the southern slopes of Mount Washington, the highest peak in the northeastern United States.  The river flows southwest through a wooded mountain valley between the southern part of the Presidential Range to its west and the lower Montalban Ridge, including Mount Isolation, to its east.  It is paralleled for its entire distance through the wilderness area by the Dry River Trail.
The river ends in Crawford Notch State Park, where it joins the Saco River.
