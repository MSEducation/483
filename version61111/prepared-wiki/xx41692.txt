==History==

The earliest recorded Old English name for the settlement was Streonshal in AD 656. Streanæshalc, Streneshalc, Streoneshalch, Streoneshalh, Streunes-Alae in Lindissi were recorded spellings between the 6th and 8th centuries. Prestebi, meaning the habitation of priests in Old Norse, is a 9th century name. Its name was recorded as Hwitebi and Witebi, meaning the white settlement in Old Norse, in the 12th century, Whitebi in the 13th century and Qwiteby in the 14th century.[tpl]citation |title=Parishes: Whitby|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64701 |work=A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2|series=Victoria County History |publisher=British History Online |pages=506–528 |year=1923|accessdate=5 September 2010|editor-last=Page|editor-first=William|separator=.[/tpl]

===Abbey===

A monastery was founded at Streonshal in AD 657 by King Oswiu or Oswy of Northumbria, as an act of thanksgiving, after defeating Penda, the pagan king of Mercia. At its foundation, the abbey was an Anglo-Saxon 'double monastery' for men and women. Its first abbess, the royal princess Hild, was later venerated as a saint.[tpl]cite book |last1=Bede|first1=|authorlink1=Bede|editor1-last=McClure |editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Collins |editor2-first=R.|title=The Ecclesiastical History of the English People|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=150–151[/tpl] The abbey became a centre of learning and here Caedmon the cowherd was "miraculously" transformed into an inspired poet whose poetry is an example of Anglo-Saxon literature. The abbey became the leading royal nunnery of the kingdom of Deira, and the burial-place of its royal family. The Synod of Whitby, in 664, established the Roman date of Easter in Northumbria at the expense of the Celtic one.[tpl]cite book|editor1-last=Lapidge |editor1-first=Michael |editor2-last=et al.|editor2-first=|title=The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England|year=1999|publisher=Blackwell |pages=155, 472[/tpl]
The monastery was destroyed between 867 and 870 in a series of raids by Vikings from Denmark under their leaders Ingwar and Ubba. Its site remained desolate for more than 200 years until after the Norman Conquest of 1066. After the Norman Conquest of England the area was granted to William de Percy who, in 1078 donated land to found a Benedictine monastery dedicated to St Peter and St Hilda.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/NRY/Whitby/WhitbyHistory.html |title=GENUKI: Whitby History |first=Colin |last=Hinson |accessdate=4 October 2011[/tpl] William de Percy's gift included land for the monastery, the town and port of Whitby and St Mary's Church and dependent chapels at Fyling, Hawsker, Sneaton, Ugglebarnby, Dunsley, and Aislaby, five mills including Ruswarp, Hackness with two mills and two churches.[tpl]cite web | url=http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/MatrixBooks/Dugdale/Volume1/Dugdale-Monasticon%20%28Vol.%201%20Part%2013%20Whitby%29.pdf | title=Dugdale's Monasticon Volume 1 | work=Monasticon Anglicanum: a History of the Abbies and other Monasteries, Hospitals, Frieries, and Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, with their Dependencies, in England and Wales | date=1817–1830 | accessdate=12 August 2011 | last=Dugdale|first= William, Sir[/tpl] In about 1128 Henry I granted the abbey burgage in Whitby and permission to hold a fair at the feast of St Hilda on 25 August. A second fair was held close to St. Hilda's winter feast at Martinmas. Market rights were granted to the abbey and descended with the liberty. Whitby Abbey surrendered in December 1539 when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries.

===Town===

In 1540 the town had between 20 and 30 houses and a population of about 200.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitbysights.co.uk/whitby-history/abriefhistory.html |title=A Brief History – Whitby |publisher=Whitby Sights |date= |accessdate=2 August 2009[/tpl]
The burgesses, who had little independence under the abbey, tried to obtain self-government after the dissolution of the monasteries. The king ordered Letters Patent to be drawn up granting their requests, but it was not implemented. In 1550 the Liberty of Whitby Strand, except for Hackness, was granted to the Earl of Warwick who in 1551 conveyed it to Sir John York and his wife Anne who sold the lease to the Cholmleys.[tpl]citation |title=The liberty of Whitby Strand|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64700 |work=A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2|series=Victoria County History |publisher=British History Online |pages=502–505 |year=1923|accessdate=5 September 2010|editor-last=Page|editor-first=William|separator=.[/tpl] In the reign of Elizabeth I, Whitby was a small fishing port. In 1635 the owners of the liberty governed the port and town where 24 burgesses had the privilege of buying and selling goods brought in by sea. Burgage tenure continued until 1837, when by an Act of Parliament, government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers.
At the end of the 16th century Thomas Chaloner visited alum works in the Papal States[tpl]cite web|first=John|last=Balston|url=http://www.wovepaper.co.uk/alumessay2.html |title=The Whatmans and Wove Paper – In Defence of Alum – 2.

At that time alum was important for medicinal uses, in curing leather and for fixing dyed cloths and the Papal States and Spain maintained monopolies on its production and sale.

Whitby grew significantly as a port as a result of the alum trade and by importing coal from the Durham coalfield to process it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/ecolodge/25/alum.htm |title=Alum Quarrying, The effect of extractive industry on the Yorkshire Coastal Landscape |publisher=East Yorkshire Coast – Geology and Geomorphology |accessdate=30 July 2011[/tpl]
Whitby grew in size and wealth, extending its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber. In 1790–91 Whitby built 11,754 tons of shipping, making it the third largest shipbuilder in England, after London and Newcastle.[tpl]cite book | title=A History of Whitby | publisher=Phillimore & co | last=White|first= Andrew | year=1993 | location=Chichester | page=69 | isbn=0-85033-842-5[/tpl] Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town's twin piers, improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade. In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port. The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales, and the whaler, the Resolution's catch produced 230 tons of oil. The carcases yielded 42 tons of whale bone used for 'stays' which were used in the corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant.[tpl]cite book|last=Young|first=George |title=A picture of Whitby and its environs|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q4BHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA199&dq=whitby++1814&hl=en&ei=CZUkTrP0OM-BhQf_6sW1DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=whitby%20%201814&f=false|year=1824|publisher=R. Rogers|location=Whitby|page=199[/tpl] Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside. Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company. As the market for whale products fell, catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only whaling ship, the Phoenix, remained.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.whitbysights.co.uk/whitby-history/whitbywhalers.html |title=Whitby Whalers |publisher= Whitby Sights |accessdate=22 July 2011[/tpl]
Whitby benefited from trade between the Newcastle coalfield and London, both by shipbuilding and supplying transport. In his youth the explorer James Cook learned his trade on colliers, shipping coal from the port.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/CoalMiningandRailways.html |title=Coal Mining in North East England |first= David |last= Simpson |work=England's North East |year = 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl] HMS Endeavour, the ship commanded by Cook on his voyage to Australia and New Zealand, was built in Whitby in 1764 by Tomas Fishburn as a coal carrier named Earl of Pembroke.

Whitby developed as a spa town in Georgian times when three chalybeate springs were in demand for their medicinal and tonic qualities. Visitors were attracted to the town leading to the building of "lodging-houses" and hotels particularly on the West Cliff. Then, in 1839, the Whitby and Pickering Railway connecting Whitby to Pickering and eventually to York was built, and played a part in the town's development as a tourism destination. George Hudson, who promoted the link to York, was responsible for the development of the Royal Crescent which was partly completed. For 12 years from 1847, Robert Stephenson, son of George Stephenson, engineer to the Whitby and Pickering Railway, was the Conservative MP for the town promoted by Hudson as a fellow protectionist.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.totalpolitics.com/history/5553/they-were-also-mps-robert-stephenson-18031859.thtml |title=They were also MPs: Robert Stephenson (1803–1859) |first=JB|last=Seatrobe |work=Total Politics |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl]

The advent of iron ships in the late 19th century and the development of port facilities on the River Tees led to the decline of smaller Yorkshire harbours. The Monks-haven launched in 1871 was the last wooden ship built Whitby and a year later the harbour was silted up.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=1224-0063&cid=0#0 |title=Records of the Smales Brothers, shipowners and shipbuilders|publisher=The National Archives |work= Access to Archives |year=2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.whitbysights.co.uk/whitby-history/whitbyport.html |title=Whitby Port – Whitby Sights |year=2011|accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]
On 30 October 1914, the hospital ship Rohilla was sunk, hitting the rocks within sight of shore just off Whitby at Saltwick Bay.

During the early 20th century the fishing fleet kept the harbour busy and few cargo boats used the port. It was revitalised as a result of a strike at Hull docks in 1955 when six ships were diverted and unloaded their cargoes on the fish quay. Endeavour Wharf, near the railway station, was opened in 1964 by the local council. The number of vessels using the port in 1972 was 291, increased from 64 in 1964.

==Governance==

By an Act of 1837 government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers. A Local Board was formed in 1872, and lasted until Whitby Urban District Council was formed under the Local Government Act 1894.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64701 |title=Parishes – Whitby | A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2 (pp. 506–528) |year=2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl] The townships of Whitby, Ruswarp and Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre were formed into a Parliamentary borough under the Reform Act of 1832 returning one member until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

==Geography and geology==

Whitby is situated on the east coast of Yorkshire facing the North Sea in a deep valley at the mouth of the River Esk. It has been a bridging point since at least medieval times and several bridges have spanned the river. The current bridge, built in 1908, is a swing bridge with a [tpl]convert|75|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] span that separates the upper and lower harbours which have a total area of around [tpl]convert|32.40|ha|acre|disp=flip[/tpl]. The houses are built of brick or stone, often with red pantiled roofs, in narrow, steep streets, on both sides of the river.[tpl]citation |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=Samuel|title=Whitby|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51398#s6|work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |publisher=British History Online |pages=543–551|year=1848 |accessdate=5 September 2010|separator=.[/tpl]

==Climate==

The area generally has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary from day to day as well as from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ne/ |title=Regional Climates: North East England |first= | publisher = The Met Office |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl]

==Demography==

According to the 2011 UK census, Whitby parish had a population of 13,213 living in 6,097 households.
In the 2001 UK census of the total number of 5,973 homes 2,034 were rented and 3,939 were owner occupied.
Of the 5,506 economically active persons aged between 16 and 74, 420 were unemployed. The number of people working in the service industry was 4,113. Approximately 2,500 people were aged under 16, 8,400 were aged 16–64, and 2,700 aged 65 and over. The mean age of the population was 41.78 years. The number of people who travel to work by motorised transport is 3,134 but 2,190 households have no cars or vans.

===Population change===

Note: Between 1801 and 1925 Whitby comprised Whitby, Ruswarp and part of Hawsker civil parishes and (between 1894 and 1925) Helredale civil parish, all of which were merged on 1 April 1925 into the current Whitby area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mdfs.net/Docs/Whitby |title=Whitby Census transcripts[/tpl]

===Religion===

In the three wards that make up the Whitby district of North Yorkshire, out of a population of 13,596 there are 10,286 who stated that their religion was Christian in the 2001 UK census. There were 19 Muslims, 17 Buddhists, 12 Jews, 3 Sikhs and 499 people had no religious affiliations.
St Mary's church is an ancient foundation, St Ninian's opened in Baxtergate in 1778 and St John's, also on Baxtergate, was consecrated in 1850. St Michaels was opened in 1856 and St Hilda's on the West Cliff was built in 1885. The Roman Catholic Church dedicated to St Hilda was built in 1867 on Baxtergate. There are places of worship for nonconformists including a United Reform Church; two Methodist chapels are no longer used. The Mission to Seafarers maintains a Christian ministry and has a chapel, reading room and recreational facilities.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1022837&SubsidiaryNumber=0 |title=Charity overview |first= |last=|work=charitycommission.gov.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011[/tpl]

==Economy==

Tourism supported by fishing is the mainstay of Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park.[tpl]cite web | url = http://democracy.scarborough.gov.uk/%28S%2803enhqfbpvsrejrgnsr2haap%29%29/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=21727 | title = Report on Whitby and the North York Moors National Park | publisher = Whitby Town Council | date = December 2010 | accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.yorkshire-forward.com/improving-places/rural-areas/market-towns/whitby/case-study-2 |title=Whitby Marina, North Yorkshire |publisher= Yorkshire Forward |year=2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area.

The harbour has a total area of about [tpl]convert|80|acre|ha[/tpl] and is used by commercial, fishing and pleasure craft. Inshore fishing, particularly for crustaceans and line fish, takes place along the coast. Lobsters, brown and velvet crabs are important to the local fishery.

==Transport==

Whitby is situated on the A171 road from Scarborough to Guisborough which originally passed over the swing bridge. A high level bridge over the Esk Valley was built in 1980 to avoid the bridge and ease congestion in the town centre. The A174 accesses coastal towns to the north and the A169 crosses the moors to Pickering. Whitby is served by the Yorkshire Coastliner bus line, operating from Leeds, Tadcaster, York, Scarborough, Bridlington, Pickering and Malton with connections beyond Yorkshire.[tpl]cite web |url= http://getdown.org.uk/bus/search/coastliner.shtml |title=Coastliner bus services – Summary |first= |last= |work=getdown.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl] Arriva runs bus services connecting Whitby to Scarborough and Middlesbrough.

==Landmarks==

The swing bridge spanning the Esk divides the upper and lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made of cast iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current electric swing bridge.[tpl]cite web |title=Whitby Bridge |url=http://yorkshireports.co.uk/content/whitby/bridge.aspx|publisher= Scarborough Borough Council |work=Yorkshire Ports |accessdate=19 July 2011[/tpl]
The bridge allowed the town to spread onto the west bank, whilst the east bank, the Haggerlythe, is dominated by St Mary's Church and the ruins of Whitby Abbey which is owned by English Heritage. St Mary's Church is a grade I listed building on the site of a Saxon church. The church's ancient foundation dates from the 12th century. Over time it has been extensively altered and enlarged but retains several features including box pews. The East Cliff is quite a distance by road from the church, the alternative is to climb the 199 steps of the "Church Stairs"CABE website or use the footpath called "Caedmon's Trod".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.17365|title=Background Information: Whitby Abbey|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl] The stone stairs, which replaced the original wooden steps, were built about 200 years old ago and renovated between 2005 and 2006.

===Literature===

The town has a strong literary tradition and can even be said that the earliest English literature comes from Whitby as Cædmon, the first known Anglo Saxon poetThe twelve named Anglo-Saxon poets are Æduwen, Aldhelm, Alfred the Great, Anlaf, Baldulf, Bede, Cædmon, Cnut, Cynewulf, Dunstan, Hereward, and Wulfstan (or perhaps Wulfsige). Most of these are considered by modern scholars to be spurious—see O'Donnell 2005, Introduction 1.22. The three for whom biographical information and documented texts survive are Alfred, Bede, and Cædmon. Cædmon is the only Anglo-Saxon poet known primarily for his ability to compose vernacular verse, and no vernacular verse survives that is known to have been written by either Bede or Alfred. There are a number of verse texts known to have been composed by Cynewulf, but we know nothing of his biography.

Charles Dickens is known to have visited Whitby and in a letter of 1861 to his friend Wilkie Collins, who was at the time in Whitby, Dickens says:
