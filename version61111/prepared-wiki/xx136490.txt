[[Posterior tibial recurrent artery]]

CATEGORIES: Arteries of the lower limb

The posterior tibial recurrent artery, an inconstant branch, is given off from the anterior tibial before that vessel passes through the interosseous space. 
It ascends in front of the Popliteus, which it supplies, and anastomoses with the inferior genicular branches of the popliteal artery, giving an offset to the tibiofibular joint.
