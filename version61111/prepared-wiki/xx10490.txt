[[Rankine scale]]

CATEGORIES: Units of temperature

Rankine ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|ŋ|k|ɪ|n[/tpl]) is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine, who proposed it in 1859. (The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848.)
The symbol for degrees Rankine is °R (or °Ra if necessary to distinguish it from the Rømer and Réaumur scales). By analogy with Kelvin, some authors call the unit Rankine, omitting the degree symbol.[tpl]cite book |last=Pauken |first=Michael |year=2011 |title= Thermodynamics For Dummies|url= |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-00291-9 |accessdate= |page=20[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Balmer |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=Modern Engineering Thermodynamics |url= |location=Oxford |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |isbn=978-0-12-374996-3 |accessdate= |page=10[/tpl] Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero, but the Rankine degree is defined as equal to one degree Fahrenheit, rather than the one degree Celsius used by the Kelvin scale. A temperature of −459.67 °F is exactly equal to 0 °R.
Some engineering fields in the United States measure thermodynamic temperature using the Rankine scale.http://www.physorg.com/tags/temperature/  The US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends not using degrees Rankine in NIST publications.B.8 Factors for Units Listed Alphabetically from Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI), NIST Special Publication 811, 2008 edition, Ambler Thompson and Barry N.
