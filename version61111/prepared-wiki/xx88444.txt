CATEGORIES: Sharp Corporation mobile phones

The J-SH04 was a mobile phone made by Sharp Corporation and released by J-Phone (SoftBank Mobile). It was only available in Japan, and was released in November 2000. It was the Japan's first ever phone with a built-in camera (110,000-pixel CMOS) and color display (256-color display). (It has been asserted to be the world's first,[tpl]cite web|first=Debjit|title=Sharp J-SH04: World’s First Ever Phone With Integrated Camera|url=http://gadgetizor.com/sharp-j-sh04-worlds-first-ever-phone-with-integrated-camera-pictures-2001/5482/|publisher=Digitizor Media & Web, Inc.|accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl] but Samsung's SCH-V200 phone equipped with a VGA camera was released in South Korea several months earlier.[tpl]cite web|title=Samsung integrate digital camera and phone|url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2000/7/1/samsungdigiphone|publisher=Digital Photography Review|accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl] ) The phone weights 74g, and its dimensions are 127 × 39 × 17 mm. It was succeeded by the J-SH05 flip phone, which was released just one month after.
There is an alternative analysis of the history of the mobile camera phone that more tightly defines what a camera phone is [tpl]cite web|title=Sharp J-SH04 – first to discover the consumer love affair with the camera phone (2001)|url=http://www.gsmhistory.com/vintage-mobiles/#sharp_sh04_2001|publisher=Stephen Temple|accessdate=6 April 2013[/tpl] and confirms the place of the Sharp SH04 as the world's first mobile camera phone. The Samsung SCH-V200 camera was only half-integrated. It shared the same case and battery but was not integrated with the phone function. It certainly could not convey an image "at a distance" thus not conforming to the tigher definition of a camera phone. The image of the SCH-V200 had to be down-loaded by wire to a PC. The Sharp SH04 was integrated both mechanically and electronically and could convey the captured image at a distance.  It was the point of origin of today's mobile camera phones.
