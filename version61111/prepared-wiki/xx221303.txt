Brian Wayne Transeau (born October 4, 1971), better known by his stage name, BT, is an American music producer, composer, audio technician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. He is an artist in the electronica genre – most often considered a composer of trance music, but known to work within several other styles. BT has also produced and written for artists such as Paul van Dyk, Peter Gabriel, 'N Sync, Sting, Blake Lewis, Tori Amos, and Tiësto. As a film composer, he has worked on films such as The Fast and the Furious and Monster.David Battino, Kelli Richards, The Art Of Digital Music, Backbeat Books, 2005, p. 10
BT is known for pioneering a production technique he calls the stutter edit. This technique consists of taking a small fragment (or fragments) of sound and then repeating it rhythmically. BT was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for his song "Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)". This song was recognized as using the largest number of vocal edits in a song (6,178 edits).BIAS Artist Profiles: BT BT's work with stutter edit techniques led to the formation of software development company, Sonik Architects, and the development of the sound-processing software plug-in Stutter Edit. The company also released a music remix app for the iPhone called Sonifi.
In 2010, BT was nominated for a Grammy Award for his studio album These Hopeful Machines under the category "Best Electronic/Dance Album".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2010&genre=49 |title=The Official Site of Music's Biggest Night |publisher=GRAMMY.com |accessdate=2013-02-20[/tpl]

==Early life and education==

BT was born in Rockville, Maryland on October 4, 1971. At an early age, he studied music and the Suzuki method at the Washington Conservatory of Music.[tpl]cite web|last=Small |first=Mark |url=http://www.Berklee.edu/bt/183/coverstory.html |title=BERKLEE | Berklee Today |publisher=Berklee.edu |accessdate=2012-05-02[/tpl]  He went on to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]"BT Wears His Lab Coat for These Hopeful Machines", Keyboard Magazine, Feb 2010

==Career==

In the early 1990s, BT moved back to Maryland and began collaborating with friends Ali "Dubfire" and Sharam of Deep Dish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://music.hyperreal.org/library/publicity/bt/|title=Hyperreal.org[/tpl] BT's productions were not yet popular in the US, and he had no idea that he had become popular across the Atlantic, where UK DJs like Sasha and Paul Oakenfold were regularly spinning his music for crowds. Sasha bought BT a ticket to London, where BT witnessed his own success—several thousand clubbers responded enthusiastically when Sasha played his song.Chris Gill, "BT's New Skool Breakbeat Science", Remix, Mar 2000 He was soon signed to Oakenfold's record label, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/bt/183/coverstory.html|title=Twenty-First-Century Prototype[/tpl] BT's songs "A Moment of Truth" and "Relativity" became hits in the UK, and it was during this time in which BT met Tori Amos.
In the early years of BT's career (roughly 1995–2000), he became a pioneering artist in the trance genre, despite the fact that he is not truly a DJ, and does not claim to be one.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/10/02/the_world_at_his_fingertips/?page=2 | work=The Boston Globe | title=The world at his fingertips | first=Christopher | last=Muther | date=2004-10-02[/tpl] BT has said of his musical background, "I'm not the traditional type of dance music artist. I'm not a DJ. I come from a classical music background. I attended the Berklee College of Music, and I played in punk bands."
In February 2014, BT partnered with EDM lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which 100% of the proceeds are donated to the Shark Trust.

===Ima===

BT's 1995 debut album Ima was a progressive house effort featuring collaborations with Vincent Covello & Tori Amos, as well as the opening track, "Nocturnal Transmission", being featured in The Fast and the Furious. The title, "Ima (今)", is the Japanese word for "now". However, BT also stated that it means many other things and that the intention of the album is to have a different effect for everyone.

===ESCM===

BT's second album ESCM (Electric Sky Church Music) released in 1997, features more complex melodies and more traditional harmonies along with a heavier use of vocals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-07-13/music/beatific/|title=Miami New Times[/tpl] The tone of the album is darker and less whimsical than Ima. The album, as a whole, is much more diverse than BT's debut album.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The biggest hit from ESCM was "Flaming June," a collaboration with German trance meister Paul van Dyk. Van Dyk and BT would collaborate on a number of works including "Namistai" (found on the later album Movement in Still Life) as well as van Dyk's remix of BT's "Blue Skies" and "Remember". "Remember" featured Jan Johnston on vocals. BT and van Dyk also remixed the van Dyk classic "Forbidden Fruit" as well as Dina Carroll's "Run to You".

===Movement in Still Life===

BT released his third album in the UK in 1999 (US Version 2000) Movement in Still Life and continued his previous experimentation outside of the trance genre. The album features a strong element of nu skool breaks, a genre he helped define with the popular "Hip-Hop Phenomenon,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lunarmagazine.com/features/bt.php|title=Lunar Magazine interview[/tpl] in collaboration with Tsunami One aka Adam Freeland & Kevin Beber.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/BT-Movement-In-Still-Life/release/14798 |title=BT - Movement In Still Life (CD, Album) at Discogs |year=2011 |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=2011-01-09[/tpl] The album hits a spectrum of genre-work. "Smartbomb" is a mix of funky, heavy riffs from both synthesizers and guitars woven over a hip-hop break and includes a lyric sample from "Love on Haight Street". "Shame" and "Satellite" lean toward an alt-rock sound, while "Godspeed" and "Dreaming" fall into classic trance ranks. "Running Down the Way Up", a collaboration with fellow electronic act Hybrid, features sultry vocals and acoustic guitars heavily edited into a progressive breakbeat track.

===Emotional Technology===

BT's fourth studio album, released on August 5, 2003, featured more vocal tracks than BT's previous fare, including six with vocals by BT himself. Emotional Technology was BT's least experimental album to date, and many consider it the "poppiest" of all of his work. The biggest single from the album, "Somnambulist", draws heavily from the breakbeats and new wave dance of New Order and Depeche Mode, whom BT has cited as major influences. The rest of the album fairly escapes genre labeling, from the dark guitar work of "Circles", to "The Only Constant is Change" which is reminiscent of "Satellite", the album blends genres and changes genres in mid-track. The single "Somnambulist" holds the Guinness World Record for most vocal edits in a single track, with 6,178 in the album version.Somnambulist

===This Binary Universe===

BT's fifth studio album, This Binary Universe, released on August 29, 2006, is his second album released in 5.1 surround sound, the first being the soundtrack to the 2003 film Monster.
The album features a mix of many genres, including jazz, breakbeats, and classical music. Three songs feature a full 110-piece orchestra. Animated videos were created to accompany each song.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/BT/+wiki|title=BTs' Last FM site[/tpl] The videos are included in a DVD packaged along with the CD.
Keyboard Magazine declared of the album, “In a hundred years, it could well be studied as the first major electronic work of the new millennium.”Stephen Fortner, "The Mind Of BT", Keyboard Magazine, Dec 2005
Unlike his previous two albums, which featured vocals on almost every track, this album contains none. The tracks also change genres constantly throughout. A good example is "The Antikythera Mechanism", which starts off almost lullaby-like, complete with a piano, acoustic guitars and reversed beats. Halfway through the track, the song explodes with a 110-piece orchestra, followed by a section of breakbeats and ending with the de-construction of the orchestra.
During November and December 2006, BT toured the album with Thomas Dolby opening. The concert featured a live slideshow of images from the online website DeviantArt as a backdrop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.deviantart.com/article/23585/|title=DeviantArt Presents BT and Thomas Dolby[/tpl]Images and accounts from the tour to date can be seen at dA Presents. dAPresents on deviantART

===These Hopeful Machines===

BT's sixth studio album, These Hopeful Machines, was released on February 2, 2010. The album featured guest vocalists/collaborators
Kirsty Hawkshaw, JES, Rob Dickinson of Catherine Wheel and Christian Burns. The album also features collaborations with Andrew Bayer ("The Emergency") and Ulrich Schnauss ("A Million Stars"). To date, this album contains the most singles released from any BT album, with 8 of the 12 tracks released as singles. Early official remixes were made by Armin van Buuren and Chicane. These Hopeful Machines was nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award in the Best Electronic/Dance Album genre. A remix album, titled These Re-Imagined Machines was released in 2011. These Humble Machines, an un-mixed album featuring shorter "radio edit" versions of the tracks (similar to the U.S. version of Movement in Still Life) was also released in 2011.

===If the Stars are Eternal So are You and I and Morceau Subrosa===

BT announced plans to release two solo albums, If the Stars are Eternal So are You and I,  his seventh album, and Morceau Subrosa, his eighth album.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.btmusic.com/brian-transeau/press/breaking-news/382-update-on-new-music-releases-part-1-of-2.html |title=Update on New Musical Releases (Part 1 of 2), BTMusic.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.btmusic.com/brian-transeau/press/breaking-news/382-update-on-new-music-releases-part-1-of-2.html |title=Update on New Musical Releases (Part 2 of 2), BTMusic.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/bt/posts/197720780336799 |title=Hello to All!

The album was finally released on June 19, along with Morceau Subrosa.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/bt/posts/235706849882145 |title=If the Stars are eternal so are You and I & Morceau Subrosa released, facebook.com[/tpl]
If the Stars are Eternal So are You and I, like This Binary Universe before it, is an about-face from BT's previous album These Hopeful Machines, utilizing minimal beats, ambient soundscapes, and glitch music, as opposed to the electronic music style of These Hopeful Machines. Morceau Subrosa is very different in style compared to most of BT's previous works, favoring ambient soundscapes and minimal beats.

===A Song Across Wires===

It has been announced that BT's ninth studio album, an electronic music album entitled A Song Across Wires,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.armadamusic.com/artist/bt/ |title=Armada Music Website: Armada 10 Years |publisher=Armada Music |accessdate=2013-05-17[/tpl] has been signed to Dutch record label Armada Music and released worldwide on August 16, 2013, following up These Hopeful Machines.[tpl]cite web|title=New Album: "A Song Across Wires|url=http://www.btmusic.com/2013/05/new-album-a-song-across-wires-available-august-16-2013/|accessdate=June 1, 2013[/tpl] On the album, BT collaborates with Arty, Senadee, Andrew Bayer, Tania Zygar, Nadia Ali, Aqualung, Adam K, Fractal, tyDi, K-pop singer Bada and more.[tpl]cite web|title=Good summer for music fans|url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/life_and_arts/article_c0ebb354-aea4-11e2-a30b-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=May 1, 2013[/tpl] The first single, "Tomahawk", was released on October 31, 2011.

==Software==

During the production of This Binary Universe, Transeau wanted to program drums in surround sound, and found that software tools to accomplish this weren't readily available. He decided to develop his own, and formed his own software company, Sonik Architects, and his own drum surround software called BreakTweaker. BreakTweaker was originally intended for release in 2007, with later plans to release additional tools and plugins specifically aimed at musicians and DJs, including his signature stutter edit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.progressive-sounds.com/artists/BT/BT-interview-8-2006.asp|title=Progressive Sounds[/tpl]
