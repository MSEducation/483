Knott's Berry Farm is a [tpl]Convert|160|acre|adj=on[/tpl] theme park in Buena Park, California, owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Since the theme park's acquisition by Cedar Fair, the park's annual attendance has steadily increased. The 2012 Global Attractions Attendance Report states Knott's Berry Farm is the 14th most visited theme park in North America.[tpl]cite web|title=2012 Global Attractions Attendance Report|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association[/tpl] The theme park has approximately 10,000 seasonal/full-time employees.http://www.linkedin.com/company/knott's-berry-farm The park has a well rounded roster of roller coasters, family rides, children rides, water rides and historical rides totaling to 40 rides currently with plans to expand in the future. The park is accessible by public transportation.
The theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions.  In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.
In the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the family business; the theme park was sold to Cedar Fair, while the food business was sold to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold to J. M. Smucker; Smucker's discontinued the line in 2013. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding other rides to the original park.

==History==

===Origin===

The theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called "Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant". The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park.
The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a "summer-long county fair". In 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. On April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes,Kooiman, Helen, Walter Knott: Keeper of the Flame, pp. 171–84, Plycon Press, Fullerton, CA, 1973.Salts, Christiane Victoria, Cordelia Knott: Pioneering Business Woman, pp. 75–78, The Literature Connection Books, Buena Park, CA, 2009.

Then with the northward expansion of a 1920s-era Knott's Airfield themed area featuring the Cloud 9 Dance Hall, Sky Cabin/Parachute Sky Jump and Motorcycle Chase steeple chase roller coaster above the electric guided rail Gasoline Alley car ride."Motorcycle Chase, Knott's Berry Farm, 1976" photograph of steeplechase-style roller coaster lift hill The expansion was inspired by the innovative new roller coaster Corkscrew.
Sky Tower was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin. Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25 mph+ or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction now held by nearby WindSeeker.) The illuminated "K" in logo script atop the Sky Tower was designated a landmark which prevented Knott's plan of converting the foundation to support WindSeeker.
Corkscrew debuted in 1975 as the first modern-day roller coaster to perform a 360-degree inverting element, twice. It was designed by Arrow Development. Corkscrew is still operating to this day, but was sold and relocated in 1989 to Silverwood in Athol, Idaho. Montezooma's Revenge was later opened in 1978 and remains in operation at Knott's Berry Farm.
Motorcycle Chase – A modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together. One or two riders straddled each "Indian motorcycle" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in "the road" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value."Motorcycle Chase, Knott's Berry Farm, 1976" photograph of steeplechase-style roller coaster with car ride combination. Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be re-themed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles now attached in four car trains, each car seated two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980.
Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now a vertical launch coaster takes its place Xcelerator.
December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.
In the 1980s, Knott's built the Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the "Urban Cowboy" era. The "Barn Dance" was featured in Knott's TV Commercials.
During the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:
The Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.
Mystery Lodge (1994) Inspired by General Motors "Spirit Lodge" pavilion, a live show augmented with Peppers Ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts [tpl]cite web|title=Knott's Mystery Lodge|url=http://brcweb.com/brc/projects/knotts_mystery_lodge|publisher=BRC Imagination Arts[/tpl] and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in Alert Bay, British Columbia.[tpl]cite web|title=Knott’s Berry Farm: Mystery Lodge|url= http://brcweb.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Mystery-Lodge.pdf |publisher=BRC Imagination Arts[/tpl] Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia then guests "move inside" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.
The Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.

===New owners===

In the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:
In the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson Standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.
In 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Foods, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.
In 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knott's refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.  Ironically, Cedar Fair tore down more of what Walter Knott had originally built than what Disney was planning.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Cedar Fair era (Present)===

Since being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when Knotts Berry Farm closed and demolished the water attraction.[tpl]cite news|last=Mello|first=Michael|title=Knott's Perilous Plunge's days are numbered|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ride-368423-knott-plunge.html|accessdate=February 28, 2014|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=August 13, 2012[/tpl] Also, Knotts Berry Farm announced in early January 2013, the most popular ride at the park: the Timber Mountain Log Ride would be closed for a 5 month major refurbishment.
On May 25, 2013, Knotts Berry Farm added three new family rides which replaced the spot of Perlious Plunge. They include: Coast Rider(wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (scrambler ride) and Surfside Gilders. All three of the rides added to the theme of the Boardwalk. The old bridge which connected the exit of Perlious Plunge and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gilders and Pacific Scrambler. Boomerang also was repainted to a lime-green color as part of the Boardwalk expansion.
On May 29, 2013, Knott's Timber Mountain Log Ride reopened after a five month refurbishment. The ride was updated with new animations and new scenes.Notability was the addition of new pine trees which were planted outside the ride's mountain. The log's front icons also received new updated icons as part of the major refurbishment.
On September 2, 2013, Knotts Berry Farm announced Windseeker would be closed and removed from the park. After the ride was closed by Cedar Fair for safety inspection, the ride was never cleared to operate. The ride will be removed and sent to Worlds of Fun by January 2014.
On November 22, 2013, Knotts Berry Farm announced a major announcement for the 2014 operating season. The park announced that the famous and historical ride: the Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a 6 month major refurbishment beginning in January 2014.[tpl]cite web|title=New For 2014: KNOTT'S ANNOUNCES MAJOR PLANS FOR 2014|url=https://www.knotts.com/what-s-new/2014-announcement|publisher=Knott's Berry Farm[/tpl] The major refurbishment is occurring due to the successful transformation of the 5 month refurbishment of the Timber Mountain Log Ride. Camp Snoopy will also receive an improved transformation as it is approaching its 30th anniversary. The park announced Camp Snoopy would receive a makeover with new rides.

==Annual park events==

The park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams.  During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a "haunted house" style attraction in the form of mazes and "scare zones" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scattered – often hidden out of view – throughout the park at this time.  Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer.  Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal.,Cassandra Peterson's MySpace page [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5QZvsWpKx|date =July 24, 2007[/tpl] although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event.[tpl]cite news|last=Fadroski|first=Kelli Skye|title=Elvira returns to Knott's Halloween Haunt|url=http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/says-372912-halloween-peterson.html|accessdate=October 1, 2012|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=September 27, 2012[/tpl]  During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Season of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.
Winter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide "solace" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks.  Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.
Every year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all Veterans and have run it every year since.
A Christmas event known as "Knott's Merry Farm" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.
Praise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.

==Current areas and attractions==

The park now consists of five themed areas:

===Ghost Town===

Craftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.
Western Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Bigfoot Rapids, still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling "Twenty Mule Team" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.
The Ghost Town area has a few other notable historical structures. Knott's Nature Center exhibiting their insect mini-zoo, once the one-room school house of Rivera, California, was relocated from the Wild Water Wilderness to Ghost Town in the summer of 2007. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainments – during "Knott's Merry Farm," two small productions of "The Gift of the Magi" and "A Christmas Carol," and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical "genuine illegal hitchin'" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.
Many parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.
What is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History – Ghost Town – Calico' section above.

====Wild Water Wilderness====

Wild Water Wilderness is a section of Ghost Town that features two major rides: the Bigfoot Rapids river rafting adventure, and Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008. Nearby Bigfoot Rapids is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.

===Fiesta Village===

Fiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme.  It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town.  Stores like La Tiendita and Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revolución, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.

===The Boardwalk===

Originally themed as Gypsy Camp, and later re-themed to the "Roaring '20s", "Knott's Airfield", then "The Boardwalk", this area is home to the most of Knott's major thrill rides.
Boardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of [erilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.
The world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over [tpl]convert|5900|sqft|m2[/tpl] of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.

===Camp Snoopy===

Camp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions.  Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' "Peanuts" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good amount of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.
Knott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.
On November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy will receive a makeover as the section is approaching its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm will open up new rides in Camp Snoopy.
The [tpl]RailGauge|2ft|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gaugeSteamlocomotive.info Grand Sierra Scenic Railroad takes guest on a five minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made smaller with the construction of Silver Bullet.

===Indian Trails===

Located next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance. One ride is located in this area. It is called Butterfield Stagecoach which is a family ride where an actual stagecoach take guest on a circular ride through Fiesta Village and Camp Snoopy. It is one original rides at the park. The ride was developed directly by the park and it opened in 1949.

===Public area===

Many of the popular original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration.  Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.

====East property====

The east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010, but is still used for wedding ceremonies. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.

In November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their "Berry Market" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all natural and uses the Knott family's original recipe. They are unable to use "Knott's" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.
