==Composition==

"Skipping a Beat" is an mid tempo R&B and pop song[tpl]cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2013/08/02/jordin-sparks-skipping-a-beat/ |title=New Song: Jordin Sparks, 'Skipping A Beat' |publisher=Buzzworthy.mtv.com |date=2013-08-02 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] that runs for a duration of three minutes and thirty-eight seconds. It was written by Cainon Lamb, Rebecca Johnson & Taurian Osbourne, while the song's production was provided by Lamb.  A writer from MTV describes the track as a "vaguely old-school '90s R&B track," which featured "ultra-romantic lyrics" over a "catchy humming hook,".
Lyrically, Sparks plays with music metaphors throughout, comparing switching up the tune on a song to falling in love.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rttnews.com/2165370/jordin-sparks-releases-new-single-skipping-a-beat.aspx?type=ent&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sitemap |title=Jordin Sparks Releases New Single 'Skipping A Beat' |publisher=Rttnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] the song is a confession on Sparks' behalf admitting a special love for admittedly her boyfriend Jason Derulo and her strong feelings towards him which causes her heart to start skipping beats, while hoping for more in the future. The first verse introduces the concept of the song: " You make my heart skip like we're playing hopscotch/Hope I'm the one that you wanna put the rock on/Hey, hey, you make it stutter/Hey, hey, think I love ya/Boy I think I'm gonna need an ambulance/Cause you been doing my heart some damage/But I like it, oh you're so exciting.

==Critical reception==

Following its release, "Skipping a Beat" was well received by most music critics. Mike Wass of Idolator called the track "an infectious mid-tempo pop song with urban roots" comparing it to Ariana Grande's hit single The Way "with an edge", and added that the track "seems to be an ode to her man. “You’re my lover, you’re my friend, you’re my gangsta,” she purrs over tinny synths and piano. It takes a couple of listens but the multitude of hooks pull you in and before you’re singing along. Always the sign of a great pop song".[tpl]cite web|author=Mike Wass |url=http://idolator.com/7474816/jordin-sparks-skipping-a-beat |title=Jordin Sparks Debuts New Song "Skipping A Beat": Listen To The Cute Urban-Pop Tune | Music News, Reviews, and Gossip on |publisher=Idolator.com |date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2013-09-01[/tpl] John Geraghty of Billboard wrote " With its breezy R&B vibe, the mid-tempo song is essentially the polar opposite" of Sparks' 2011 single "I Am Woman" which was originally planned to lead her third album. Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy called it a "vaguely old-school '90s R&B track" and called Sparks' "Battlefield" one of their favorite songs of 2009 & 2010 "so anything post-"Battefield" is gonna have to work very hard to win our approval... While we totally appreciate the ultra-romantic lyrics and that catchy "humming" hook, we're not entirely convinced that this is Jordin's most progressive offering to date.
