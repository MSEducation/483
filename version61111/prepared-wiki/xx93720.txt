CATEGORIES: Brown sauces, French sauces

Sauce Robert is a brown mustard sauce and one of the small sauces, or compound sauces, derived from the Classic French Espagnole sauce, one of the mother sauces in French cuisine.Escoffier, Auguste. "The Escoffier Cookbook." Crown Publishers, Inc, New York, 1969. p15. Sauce Robert is one of the earliest compound sauces on record. Of the 78 compound sauces systematized by Marie-Antoine Carême in the early 19th century, only two - Sauce Robert and Remoulade - were present in much older cookbooks, such as Massaliot's Le Cuisinier Roial et Bourgeois in 1691. A version of Sauce Robert also appears in Francois-Pierre de la Varenne (cook to Henry IV)'s Le Cuisinier François (1651), the founding text of modern French cuisine.Sokolov, Raymond "The Saucier's Apprentice," 'A brief history of French Sauces' pages 5-7. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc 1976.
