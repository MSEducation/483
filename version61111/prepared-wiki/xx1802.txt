The Colorado Front Range is a colloquial geographic term for the most populous region of the state of Colorado in the United States. The area is located just east of the foothills of the Front Range, aligned in a north-south configuration on the western edge of the Great Plains, where they meet the Rockies. Geologically, the region lies mostly within the Colorado Piedmont, in the valley of the South Platte and Arkansas rivers on the east side of the Rockies. The region contains the largest cities and the majority of the population of Colorado.

The addition of the adjacent Wyoming city of Cheyenne to the Colorado Front Range forms the full Front Range Urban Corridor.
