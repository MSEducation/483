==Phonology==

===Consonants===

For the stops and affricates there is a four-way distinction in phonation between tenuis [tpl]IPA|/p/[/tpl], voiced [tpl]IPA|/b/[/tpl], aspirated [tpl]IPA|/pʰ/[/tpl] and breathy voiced [tpl]IPA|/bʱ/[/tpl] series. [tpl]Harvtxt|Thakur|1975|pp=175–8[/tpl] lists as separate phonemes aspirated correlates of [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/m/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ɽ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɭ/[/tpl], but describes the aspiration as a voiceless pharyngeal friction. [tpl]IPA|/n̪/[/tpl] is dental, but becomes alveolar if the next syllable contains a retroflex consonant. [tpl]IPA|/ŋ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɲ/[/tpl] are rare, but contrast with the other nasals word-medially between vowels. [tpl]IPA|/ɳ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/ɭ/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/ɽ/[/tpl], together with their aspirated correlates, don't occur in  the beginning of words.[tpl]Harv|Thakur|1975|p=180[/tpl], an exception is the word [tpl]IPA|ɽəbɑːɳɑː[/tpl] "to throw" The glottal stop occurs only between a vowel and [tpl]IPA|/ɳ/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/l/[/tpl], e.g. [tpl]IPA|kɑːʔɭ[/tpl] "a trumpet", which contrasts with [tpl]IPA|kɑːɭ[/tpl] "famine". The pharyngeal fricative [tpl]IPA|/ħ/[/tpl] historically derives from [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] and occurs word-finally, e.g. [tpl]IPA|ɡʱɑːħ[/tpl] "grass", [tpl]IPA|biːħ[/tpl] "twenty".[tpl]Harv|Thakur|1975|p=181[/tpl]
