It was built together with the Anchor Exchange in Birmingham and the Kingsway exchange in London - all believed to provide hardened communications in the event of nuclear war. Today the underground site is used for telephone cabling. Constructed at a depth of 35 metres (115 ft), the tunnels are about 2 metres (80 in) in diameter. The exchange cost around Â£4 million, part of which was funded by the United Kingdom's NATO partners.

The tunnels are known to be used for British Telecom cables. The exchange rose to prominence in March 2004 when a fire in one of the tunnels caused 130,000 telephone lines in Manchester to be cut off. Ambulance and fire service calls around the North West region were also severely affected.[tpl]Cite web |title=Fire cuts off 130,000 phone lines |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/3577799.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=25 January 2011[/tpl]
