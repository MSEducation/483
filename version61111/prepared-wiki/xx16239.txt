==History==

Located in Karlskoga, Sweden, the company originates from the hammering trip hammer mill "Boofors" founded 1646. The modern corporate structure was created in 1873 with the foundation of Aktiebolaget (AB) Bofors-Gullspång. A leading Swedish steel producer by the early 1870s, Bofors expanded into weapons manufacture when steel produced via the Siemens-Martin process began to be used for gun manufacture. The company's first cannon workshop was opened in 1884. Bofors' most famous owner was Alfred Nobel, who owned the company from 1894 until his death in December 1896. [tpl]cite book|last=Bergengren|first=Erik|title=Alfred Nobel: The Man and His Work|date=1962|publisher=Thomas Nelson & Sons Ltd|location=Edinburgh[/tpl]  Nobel played the key role in reshaping the former iron and steel producer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry participant.

The name Bofors is strongly associated with the 40 mm anti-aircraft gun used by both sides during World War II. This automatic cannon is often simply called the Bofors gun and saw service on both land and sea.  It became so widely known that anti-aircraft guns in general were often referred to as Bofors guns. Another well-known gun made by the company was the Bofors 37 mm anti-tank gun, a standard anti-tank weapon used by a variety of armies early in the war. It was built under license in Poland and the USA and was also used in a variety of tanks, including the 7TP and M3A3 Stuart.[tpl]cite web|title=Present day|url=http://www.testcenter.se/index.php/about-bofors-test-center/organization|work=About BTC|publisher=Official website : Bofors Test Center|accessdate=4 March 2014[/tpl]
