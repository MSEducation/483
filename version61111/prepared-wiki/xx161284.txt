[[Complex partial status epilepticus]]

CATEGORIES: Medical emergencies, Epilepsy

Complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE) is one of the non-convulsive forms of status epilepticus, a rare form of epilepsy defined by its recurrent nature. CPSE is characterized by seizures involving long-lasting stupor, staring and unresponsiveness.[tpl]eMedicine|neuro|114[/tpl]  Sometimes this is accompanied by motor automatisms, such as eye twitching.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fernández-Torre JL, Gutiérrez-Pérez R, Velasco-Zarzosa M |title=Non-convulsive status epilepticus |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Revista de neurologia |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=744–52 |year=2003 |pmid=14593634 |doi=[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

As is the case with other non-convulsive status epilepticus forms, CPSE is dangerously underdiagnosed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Murthy JM |title=Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: An under diagnosed and potentially treatable condition |journal=Neurology India |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=453–4 |date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2003;volume=51;issue=4;spage=453;epage=454;aulast=Murthy |pmid=14742920 [/tpl] This is due to the potentially fatal yet veiled nature of the symptoms. Usually, an electroencephalogram, or EEG, is needed to confirm a neurologist's suspicions. The EEG is also needed to differentiate between absence status epilepticus (which affects the entire brain), and CPSE, which only affects one region.[tpl]cite journal |author=Husain AM, Horn GJ, Jacobson MP |title=Non-convulsive status epilepticus: usefulness of clinical features in selecting patients for urgent EEG |journal=J.

==Treatment==

Treatment is in the form of anti-epileptic drugs, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and topiramate.
