[[Cosmic crystallography]]

CATEGORIES: Physical cosmology

Cosmic Crystallography is a technique used in physics and astronomy to determine the possible topology of the universe (e.g. a torus, 3-sphere, etc.). astronomers observe sources of high redshift and look for repeating patterns that may indicate the connection of edges.

==Pair Separation Histograms==

Cosmic Crystallographers use Cosmic Separation Histograms to infer characteristics of the universe. Large spikes are expected to appear if the universe is not Simply Connected.
