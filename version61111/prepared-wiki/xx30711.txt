John Brown (8 December 1826 â€“ 27 March 1883) was a Scottish personal servant and favourite of Queen Victoria for many years. He was appreciated by many (including the Queen) for his competence and companionship, and resented by others for his influence and informal manner. The exact nature of his relationship with Victoria was the subject of great speculation by contemporaries, and continues to be controversial today.

==Early life==

Brown was born in Crathie, Aberdeenshire, to John Brown and Margaret Leys, and went to work as an outdoor servant (in Scots ghillie or gillie) at Balmoral Castle, which  Queen Victoria and Prince Albert leased in February 1848 and purchased outright in November 1851.
Brown had several younger brothers, three of whom also entered the royal service.  The most notable of these, Archibald Anderson "Archie Brown", fifteen years John's junior, eventually became personal valet to Victoria's youngest son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany.Scottish Tartans Authority

==Relationship with Victoria==

Prince Albert's untimely death in 1861 was a shock from which Queen Victoria never fully recovered. John Brown became a good friend and supported the mourning Queen. The Queen gave him gifts and created two medals for him, the Faithful Servant Medal and the Devoted Service Medal. She commissioned a portrait of him. After his death, she had a life-sized statue of him built on the grounds of Balmoral Castle. When he died, she honoured him with this tribute:[tpl]cite web|last=Scotland|first=Royal Deeside|title=John Brown, faithful servant to Queen Victoria|url=http://www.royal-deeside.org.uk/RDhistory/johnbrown.htm|publisher=Royal Deeside, Scotland[/tpl]
Victoria's children and ministers resented the high regard she had for Brown, and, inevitably, stories circulated that there was something improper about their relationship. The Queen's daughters joked that Brown was "Mama's lover",[tpl]cite news|last=Thornton|first=Michael|title=Victoria's secret?

The diaries of Lewis Harcourt contain a report that one of the Queen's chaplains, Rev. Norman Macleod, made a deathbed confession repenting of his action in presiding over Queen Victoria's marriage to John Brown. Debate continues over what credence to give this report. It should be emphasised that Harcourt did not receive the confession directly (he was nine at the time that Macleod died) but that it passed (if it did) from Macleod's sister to the wife of Henry Ponsonby, the Queen's private secretary, and thence to Harcourt's father Sir William Harcourt, the then Home Secretary. Sir William served as Home Secretary in the final three years of Brown's life. While it is true that some widowed monarchs have contracted private marriages with their servants, there is little evidence that Victoria married Brown.
Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the depth of Victoria and Brown's relationship comes from the pen of the Queen herself. A recently discovered letter written by Victoria shortly after Brown's death, to Viscount Cranbrook, reveals the true extent of the loss:
The phrase "life for the second time" relates to the death of her husband Prince Albert. The historian who discovered the letter believed that it suggested that Victoria, in her mind, equated Brown's death with Albert's, and that she therefore viewed him as more than a servant.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/dec/16/monarchy.stephenbates | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Letter from Queen Victoria points to affair with Brown | first=Stephen | last=Bates | date=16 December 2004 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] Whether Brown and Victoria were actual lovers, however, is not known.
Those who believe that the Queen saw Brown as little more than a servant point to the fact that after his death she became similarly attached to an Indian servant, Abdul Karim (the Munshi), one of two who had come to work for her in late June 1887. She called him the Munshi, and he came to be resented even more than John Brown had been: unlike Brown, whose loyalty was without question, there was evidence that Karim exploited his position for personal gain and prestige.[tpl]citation|last=Reid|first=Michaela|title= Ask Sir James:Sir James Reid, Personal Physician to Queen Victoria and Physician-in-Ordinary to Three Monarchs|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=London|year=1987[/tpl]
Tony Rennell's book Last Days of Glory: The Death of Queen Victoria reveals that Victoria had entrusted detailed instructions about her burial to her doctor, Sir James Reid (in lieu of Brown himself, who had died in 1883: the Queen's wish had been for him to attend to her). These included a list of the keepsakes and mementoes, photographs and trinkets she wished to be placed into the coffin with her: along with Albert's dressing gown and a plaster cast of his hand, the Queen was buried with a lock of Brown's hair, his photograph, and a ring worn by Brown's mother and given to her by Brown, along with several of his letters. The photograph, wrapped in white tissue paper, was placed in her left hand, with flowers discreetly arranged so as to hide it from view. The ring she wore on the third finger of her right hand.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1655_283/ai_112095011/pg_3 | work=Contemporary Review | title=Queen Victoria's 'secret marriage' | first=Raymond | last=Lamont-Brown | year=2003[/tpl]
The statues and private memorials that Victoria had created for Brown were destroyed and discarded at the order of her son, Edward VII, with whom Brown had often clashed and who bitterly resented Brown for his influence on his mother.

==Honours==

Design and manufacture of both medals were commissioned by Queen Victoria. 

==In popular culture==

The 1997 film Mrs. Brown is the fictionalised story of John Brown.  Billy Connolly stars as Brown and Dame Judi Dench as Victoria, with Antony Sher appearing as Benjamin Disraeli. His character, with a wink at Victoria's unspeakable grief over Albert's death, is informed that she would like to say goodbye at his deathbed. To which he replies: "Oh Lord, no. She will only want me to take a message to Albert."
Brown was played by Finlay Currie in the 1950 film The Mudlark. He also appears as a character in the play Victoria Regina by Laurence Housman.
Brown was played by William Dysart in the BBC television series Edward the Seventh (1975). King Edward is shown breaking a statue of Brown that he found in Victoria's chambers "by accident".
