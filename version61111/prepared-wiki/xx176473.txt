==Setting==

The show centers around Drinky Crow (an often drunk crow) and Uncle Gabby described as a drunken Irish monkey. It has a 19th-century nautical setting, where the main characters are constantly at war with the French, who are mostly alligators. It is characterized by graphic violence and surreal humor, so it normally is rated TV-MA-V for graphic violence.[tpl]cite press release | title = The Drinky Crow Show! | publisher = Fantagraphics Books | date = 2007-05-12 | url = http://www.fantagraphics.com/drinky.html | accessdate = 2008-01-01 [/tpl]

==Production==

The animation is somewhat unique in that, although it is CGI-animated and rendered in 3D using Maya,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2007/06/maakiemation | title=Maya Makes Drinky Crow Show's Boozy, 2-D World Spin | accessdate=2007-06-29 | publisher=Wired.com | date=2007-06-29[/tpl] its resolution and its color palette are deliberately kept low. This gives the show a more traditional cel-animated look, reminiscent of 1950s children's TV cartoon shows. Matt Danner and Eddie Trigeruos are show animators, while physical production is handled at Mirari Films.[tpl]cite web | url=http://lineboil.com/2009/02/the-drinky-crow-show-interview/ | title=The Drinky Crow Show Interview | accessdate=2009-02-10 | publisher=ColdHardFlash[/tpl]
