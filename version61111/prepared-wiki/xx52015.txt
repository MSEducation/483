In American English, the name gar (or garpike) is strictly applied to members of the Lepisosteidae, a family including seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine, waters of eastern North America, Central America, and the Caribbean islands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/FamilySummary.cfm?ID=34|title=Family Lepisosteidae - Gars|accessdate=2007-04-21[/tpl]Sterba, G: Freshwater Fishes of the World, p. 609, Vista Books, 1962

==Etymology==

In British English, the name gar was originally used for a species of needlefish, Belone belone, found in the North Atlantic and likely taking its name from the Old English word for "spear".[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gar|title=Gar|accessdate=2007-04-21[/tpl] Belone belone is now more commonly referred to as the "garfish" or "gar fish" to avoid confusion with the North American gars of the family Lepisosteidae.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/comnames/CommonNamesList.cfm?ID=47&GenusName=Belone&SpeciesName=belone&StockCode=57|title=Common Names of  Belone belone|accessdate=2007-04-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019180912/http://www.fishbase.org/comnames/CommonNamesList.cfm?ID=47&GenusName=Belone&SpeciesName=belone&StockCode=57  |archivedate = 2007-10-19[/tpl] Confusingly, the name "garfish" is commonly used for a number of other species of the related genera Strongylura, Tylosurus and Xenentodon of the family Belonidae, as well as of some more distantly related genera in the suborder Belonoidei.www.fishbase.org
The genus name Lepisosteus comes from the Greek lepis meaning "scale" and osteon meaning "bone".[tpl]cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Eschmeyer/GeneraSummary.cfm?ID=Lepisosteus|title=Genera reference detail|accessdate=2007-04-21[/tpl] Atractosteus is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from atraktos, meaning arrow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Eschmeyer/GeneraSummary.cfm?ID= Atractosteus|title=Genera reference detail|accessdate=2007-04-21[/tpl]

==Distribution==

The gars are members of the Lepisosteiformes (or Semionotiformes), an ancient order of "primitive" ray-finned fish; fossils from this order are known from the late Cretaceous onwards. Fossil gars are found in Europe, India, South America, and North America, indicating that in times past, these fish had a wider distribution than they do today. Gars are considered to be a remnant of a group of rather primitive bony fish that flourished in the Mesozoic, and are most closely related to the bowfin, another archaic fish now found only in North America. The many species of gar include the alligator gar, which can exceed ten feet in length.

==Anatomy and morphology==

Gar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins are close to the tail.[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Wiley, Edward G.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 78–79|isbn= 0-12-547665-5[/tpl] As their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. They also appear to surface in fast-moving rapids. As a result, they are extremely hardy and able to tolerate conditions that would kill most other fish.
All the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar Atractosteus spatula is the largest, as specimens have been recorded up to [tpl]convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=1073|title=Atractosteus spatula - Alligator gar|accessdate=2007-07-19[/tpl] Even the smaller species, such as Lepisosteus oculatus, are large, commonly reaching lengths of over [tpl]convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and sometimes much more.Kodera H. et al.: Jurassic Fishes.

==Ecology==

Gars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and bayous, often congregating in small groups. They are voracious predators, catching their prey with their needle-like teeth, obtained with a sideways strike of the head. They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs. Gars are found across all of North America (for example Lepisosteus osseus). Although gars are primarily found in freshwater habitats, several species enter brackish waters and a few, most notably Atractosteus tristoechus, are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.Monks N. (editor): Brackish Water Fishes, pp 322–324. TFH 2006, ISBN 0-7938-0564-3

==Species==

The gar family contains seven species, in two genera:[tpl]FishBase family|family=Lepisosteidae|year=2009|month=January[/tpl]
Family Lepisoteidae

==Significance to humans==

Gar flesh is edible, and sometimes available in markets, but unlike the sturgeon they resemble, their eggs are highly toxic to humans.[tpl]cite web|title=Gar|publisher=Environment.nationalgeographic.com|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/gar|accessdate=29 May 2011[/tpl] Several species are traded as aquarium fish.
The hard skin and scales of the gar were used by humans. Native Americans used the scales of the gar as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows in gar skin.[tpl]cite book|last=Burton|first=Maurice|title=The international wildlife encyclopedia, Volume 9|year=2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7266-7|page=929|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P0_AD0v7vl0C&pg=PA929|coauthors=Robert Burton|accessdate=18 July 2010[/tpl] Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture, but besides using the gar, Creek and Chickasaw people have ritual "garfish dances".[tpl]cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Mark|title=Season of the Gar: Adventures in Pursuit of America's Most Misunderstood Fish|year=2010|publisher=U of Arkansas P|isbn=978-1-55728-929-2|pages=118–19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yepqz2i3Iv4C&pg=PA119[/tpl]
