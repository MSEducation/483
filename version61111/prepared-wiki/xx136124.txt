In 1995, Waldron was first exposed to Paint Shop Pro because of the Observatory's early exploration of digital photography.  This software inspired Waldron to manipulate photographs for artistic purposes, creating kaleidoscopic patterns.  In 1998, Duncan Waldron and his family moved to New South Wales, Australia.
