==Career==

In 1969 Bangs became a freelance writer after reading an ad in Rolling Stone soliciting readers' reviews. His first piece was a negative review of the MC5 album Kick Out The Jams, which he sent to Rolling Stone with a note requesting that if the magazine were to pass on publishing the review, that he receive a reason for their decision; however, no reply was forthcoming as the magazine did indeed publish the review.
Bangs wrote about Janis Joplin's death by drug overdose, "It's not just that this kind of early death has become a fact of life that has become disturbing, but that it's been accepted as a given so quickly."[tpl]Cite book |title=A Bad Woman Feeling Good: Blues and the women who sing them |last=Jackson |first=Buzzy |year=2005 |publisher=W.W.

Let it blurt, p. 95 at Google Books  He moved to Detroit to edit and write for Creem. After leaving Creem, he wrote for  The Village Voice, Penthouse, Playboy, New Musical Express, and many other publications.
Bangs was enamored of the noise music of Lou Reed.Gere, Charlie.

At one point he climbed onto the stage while the J. Geils Band were playing in concert, and typed a supposed review of the event, in full view of the audience.[tpl]cite book| first= Stuart| last= Maconie| year= 2004| title= Cider With Roadies| edition= 1st | publisher= Random House | location= London | isbn= 0-09-189115-9 | page= 227[/tpl]
His review of Black Sabbath's first album in Rolling Stone was scathing, rating them as Cream wannabes: [tpl]quote|Cream clichés that sound like the musicians learned them out of a book, grinding on and on with dogged persistence. Vocals are sparse, most of the album being filled with plodding bass lines over which the lead guitar dribbles wooden Claptonisms from the master's tiredest Cream days. They even have discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitized speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters yet never quite finding synch—just like Cream! But worse.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/black-sabbath-19700917 | title = Album Review Black Sabbath - 'Black Sabbath' | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = 1970-09-17[/tpl][/tpl] Rolling Stone later rated the same album to be on their 500 Greatest Albums of all time at number 243.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/black-sabbath-black-sabbath-20120524 | title = '500 Greatest Albums of all Time' | publisher = Rolling Stone[/tpl]

==Style==

Bangs adopted a radical and critical style of working, apparent in this quote:
[tpl]quote|Well basically I just started out to lead interview with the most insulting question I could think of. Because it seemed to me that the whole thing of interviewing as far as rock stars and that was just such a suck-up. It was groveling obeisance to people who weren't that special, really. It's just a guy, just another person, so what?[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.furious.com/Perfect/lesterbangs.html | first = Jim | last = DeRogatis | title = A Final Chat with Lester Bangs | publisher = Perfect Sound Forever | date =November 1999| accessdate =2008-08-06[/tpl][/tpl]
