The Bullfrog Hills are a small range of mountains in southern Nye County, Nevada. The historic Rhyolite, Nevada, mining district was in the Bullfrog Hills, and the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad crossed the hills to its Rhyolite station via the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad. The Bullfrog mining district was located along the south margin of the hills. The original Bullfrog Mine is located on the south flank of Bullfrog Mountain to the west of Rhyolite and now just inside the northeast corner of the Death Valley National Monument.Beatty, Nevada–California, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1986 Beatty and the Bare Mountains lie to the east.
