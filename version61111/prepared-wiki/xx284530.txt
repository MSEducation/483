==Background==

Shortly after being signed to Velocity/Rise the band began working with ex-A Day to Remember lead guitarist Tom Denney for their debut album. In an interview with Rock Edition singer Richard Rogers noted that they had originally intended to release a 5 to 6 song EP.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Rock Edition |title=Interview with Richard Rogers of Secrets |url=http://www.rockedition.com/interviews/artist-interviews/interview-with-richard-rogers-of-secrets/ |date=January 23, 2012 |first=Michael |last=Duncan |accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl] The record label suggested that they instead release a full length album, and brought in Denney to assist.

Prior to this, they toured with Jamie's Elsewhere and Oh, Sleeper.

==Reception==

The album was met with mostly mixed reviews. Other reviewers noted that while the overall sound was quite catchy and had unique vocals, that the lyrics were somewhat generic and lacking in creativity. Grace Duffy of Under the Gun wrote that "There is a consistent air of indecision to The Ascent that costs it a few points, as its frequent shapeshifting doesnâ€™t always flatter the end result. It is nonetheless a hearty and ambitious effort and a compelling listen, strikingly good at best and entertaining even at worst."
