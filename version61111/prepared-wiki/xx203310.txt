Dewey Martin (born December 8, 1923) is a retired American film and television actor.

==Career==

Martin was born in 1923 in Katemcy, Texas. His film debut was an uncredited part in Knock on Any Door (1949). He also appeared in The Thing from Another World (1951), co-starred with Kirk Douglas in The Big Sky (1952), played younger brother of Humphrey Bogart in The Desperate Hours (1955), and was featured opposite Dean Martin in his first post-Martin and Lewis film, the notorious flop Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), but did not become a full-fledged star. 
He worked extensively in television as well, including The Twilight Zone episode "I Shot an Arrow Into the Air" and The Outer Limits episode "The Premonition", co-written by Ib Melchior. Starting in 1960 Martin also played Daniel Boone on four episodes of Walt Disney Presents, an unsuccessful attempt to duplicate the national craze which had ensued when Fess Parker had portrayed Davy Crockett on the same series several years earlier.
Martin was married to singer Peggy Lee for two years; the marriage ended in divorce.
His first cousin was former United States Senator Ross Bass (D-TN).
