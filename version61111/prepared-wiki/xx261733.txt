The South African Open, formerly the South African Championships, was an annual tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts from 1891 to 2011. The tournament was not played from 1900 to 1902 due to the Boer War, from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I, and from 1941 to 1945 due to World War II. It was also suspended from 1996 until 2006.
Sets were played on advantage until 1971; "lingering death" tie-breaks at six games all were subsequently adopted. Finals were the best-of-five-sets until the tournament's suspension in 1990; upon its return in 1992 finals were reduced to the best-of-three-sets. 
The most successful male player at the South African Championships – played from 1891 to 1967 during the Amateur Era – was Eric Sturgess, who won eleven titles between 1939 and 1957 and lost a further final in 1947 to Eustace Fannin. He also holds the overall record for the most consecutive titles won – seven between 1948 and 1954. Five players share the record for the most male wins at the tournament in the Open Era – Rod Laver (1969, 1970), Jimmy Connors (1973, 1974), Harold Solomon (1975, 1976), Vitas Gerulaitis (1981, 1982) and Aaron Krickstein (1992, 1993).
