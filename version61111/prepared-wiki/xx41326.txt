The Board of Governors is an independent governmental agency consisting of seven officials and their support staff of over 1800 employees headquartered in Washington, D.C.Federal Reserve Board, "The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions". It is independent in the sense that the Board currently operates without official obligation to accept the requests or advice of any elected official with regard to actions on the money supply, and its methods of funding also preserve independence. The Governors are nominated by the President of the United States, and nominations must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.[tpl]Cite web|first=Kevin |last=Hassett  |title=How the Fed Works |publisher=The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research  |url=http://www.american.com/archive/2007/september-october-magazine-contents/how-the-fed-works/ |accessdate=2008-01-12 [/tpl]
The presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks are nominated by each bank's respective Board of Directors, but must also be approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is generally considered to have the most important position, followed by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
The Federal Reserve System is primarily funded by interest collected on their portfolio of securities from the US Treasury, and the Fed has broad discretion in drafting its own budget,[tpl]Cite web|title=FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM: The Surplus Account |publisher=United States General Accounting Office |url=http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-02-939 |accessdate=2008-01-12 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120801033709/http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-02-939 |archivedate=2008-02-17[/tpl] but, historically, nearly all the interest the Federal Reserve collects is rebated to the government each year.http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/flaherty/Federal_Reserve.html Edward Flaherty, Department of Economics, College of Charleston (S.C.), "Debunking the Federal Reserve Conspiracy Theories", Public Eye (Political Research Associates).
The Federal Reserve has three main mechanisms for manipulating the money supply. It can buy or sell treasury securities.  Selling securities has the effect of reducing the monetary base (because it accepts money in return for purchase of securities), taking that money out of circulation. Purchasing treasury securities increases the monetary base (because it pays out hard currency in exchange for accepting securities). Secondly, the discount rate can be changed.  And finally, the Federal Reserve can adjust the reserve requirement, which can affect the money multiplier; the reserve requirement is adjusted only infrequently, and was last adjusted in 1992."Reserve Requirements", Fedpoints, Federal Reserve Bank of New York
In practice, the Federal Reserve uses open market operations to influence short term interest rates, which is the primary tool of monetary policy. The federal funds rate, for which the Federal Open Market Committee announces a target on a regular basis, reflects one of the key rates for interbank lending. Open market operations change the supply of reserve balances, and the federal funds rate is sensitive to these operations.http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed15.html "Federal Funds", Fedpoints, Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
In theory, the Federal Reserve has unlimited capacity to influence this rate, and although the federal funds rate is set by banks borrowing and lending funds to each other, the federal funds rate generally stays within a limited range above and below the target (as participants are aware of the Fed's power to influence this rate).
Assuming a closed economy, where foreign capital or trade does not affect the money supply, when money supply increases, interest rates go down. Businesses and consumers have a lower cost of capital and can increase spending and capital improvement projects. This encourages short-term growth. Conversely, when  the money supply falls, interest rates go up, increasing the cost of capital and leading to more conservative spending and investment. The Federal reserve increases interest rates to combat Inflation.

When money is deposited in a bank, it can then be lent out to another person. If the initial deposit was $100 and the bank lends out $100 to another customer the money supply has increased by $100. However, because the depositor can ask for the money back, banks have to maintain minimum reserves to service customer needs. If the reserve requirement is 10% then, in the earlier example, the bank can lend $90 and thus the money supply increases by only $90.  The reserve requirement therefore acts as a limit on this multiplier effect. Because the reserve requirement only applies to the more narrow forms of money creation (corresponding to M1), but does not apply to certain types of deposits (such as time deposits), reserve requirements play a limited role in monetary policy."Reserve requirements", Fedpoints, Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Currently, the US government maintains over US$800 billion in cash money (primarily Federal Reserve Notes) in circulation throughout the world,[ref]
