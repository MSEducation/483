==History==

Wichita State University began in 1886 as Fairmount College,  a private Congregational preparatory school, founded by Rev. Joseph Homer Parker.  Initially it was referred to as "Young Ladies College", "Wichita Ladies College", and "Congregational Female College".  It was to admit women twelve years and older who were "able to read, write, spell and recite the parts of speech."  Support came mainly from the Plymouth Congregational Church to build it, but the school never opened its doors. In 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school Fairmount Institute.  It opened in September to men and women, with an emphasis on training in preaching or teaching.  It closed because of financial difficulties. 
In 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society.  Amid growing financial troubles, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed.  A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall 569-student Fairmount College became the Municipal University of Wichita (popularly known as "Wichita University" or "WU").  It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi, and catered to students of limited means.  On July 1, 1964, it officially entered the state system of higher education as Wichita State University (WSU).Wichita State University History

The school discontinued its football program following the 1986 season due to poor attendance, financial red ink, NCAA recruiting violations, and the state of disrepair of Cessna Stadium. It had been never fully recovered from losing 16 starters, its athletic director, football coach and many others critical to the WSU program in a plane crash in 1970 (see below). Legendary NFL coach Bill Parcells was a linebacker at WSU in 1962 and 1963 before serving as a graduate assistant in 1964. Wichita State University was also the first Division 1-A school to hire a black head coach in College Football, Willie Jeffries in 1979.Willie Jeffries." SportsCentury. February 22, 2002.

===Shockers===

The name for WSU's athletic teams is the Shockers and, collectively, students are also referred to as being "Shockers." The name reflects the University's heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers.[tpl]cite web|author=webmaster@wichita.edu |url=http://www.wichita.edu/my/wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original – Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol.  WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. Elsea, who had been a Marine during World War II, decided that "the school needed a mascot who gave a tough impression, with a serious, no-nonsense scowl."
Once Elsea's mascot was adopted by the university, which by that time was known as the Municipal University of Wichita, all that was needed was a name. The Oct 7, 1948, issue of The Sunflower, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. It was freshman Jack Kersting who suggested the winning name, "WuShock."
In 1998, WuShock, also referred to as "Wu," marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help.  Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.[tpl]cite web|author=webmaster@wichita.edu |url=http://www.wichita.edu/thisis/aboutus/about_wushock.asp |title=WuShock: A True Original – Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas |publisher=Wichita.edu |date= |accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl]

===Football team plane crash===

On October 2, 1970, the first, or "gold" plane (the twin plane to the second, or black, plane) carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a Colorado airport after refueling, bound for Logan, Utah, for a game against Utah State University. It flew into a mountain valley too narrow to enable it to turn back and smashed into a mountainside, killing 31 of the 40 players, administrators and fans near a ski resort [tpl]convert|40|mi|km[/tpl] away from Denver. President Richard Nixon sent the president of the university a note which read, "Our thoughts and prayers go out to you in this time of sorrow."
