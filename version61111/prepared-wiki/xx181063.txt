UPMC Mercy is a main hospital facility of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and is located in the Uptown section of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, adjacent to downtown Pittsburgh and a few blocks from the Consol Energy Center. It is the first chartered hospital to have been founded in the city of Pittsburgh and it is also the first hospital in the world to have been established by the Sisters of Mercy.  It is also the first teaching hospital in the region, accepting residents to teaching positions beginning in 1848, one year after opening its doors.
In January 2008, Mercy Hospital merged with Pittsburgh health care giant UPMC, taking on its current name UPMC Mercy. UPMC Mercy remains Pittsburgh's only Catholic hospital that provides a full breadth of specialized services.

==History==

The Sisters of Mercy, a religious congregation founded in Ireland in 1831 by Catherine McAuley, brought its stated mission of caring and compassion to the growing industrial city of Pittsburgh in 1843. Mother Frances Warde led six other sisters to the United States, where they founded the first congregation of the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh. The pioneering “Seven Sisters” of Mercy opened the first permanent hospital in Pittsburgh, and the world’s first Mercy Hospital, on Jan. 1, 1847.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_546108.html | title=Nurses of Mercy sacrificed lives in 1848 epidemic | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2008-01-06 | last=Houser | first=Mark | location=Pittsburgh, PA | accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl] Founded by Bishop Michael O'Conner, it began life in a temporary frame building on Penn Avenue known as Concert Hall.[tpl]cite book | url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pitttext;idno=00awn8128m;seq=222 | title=Pioneer Medicine in Western Pennsylvania |first=Theodore | last=Diller | chapter=Hospitals, Schools and Journals | page=204 | publisher=Paul B. Hoeber, Inc. | location=New York |date=May 1927|accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl] The hospital they established was open to all regardless of race, nationality, age, gender, or religion. Mercy established the region’s first teaching hospital with resident physicians in training in 1848.
Mercy Hospital grew rapidly with Pittsburgh in the second half of the nineteenth century. To qualify for new funding sources, the hospital was incorporated, a board was established, and Thomas M. Carnegie was elected board president. The Sisters of Mercy and the physicians and nurses of Mercy Hospital continued to serve the Pittsburgh region through World War I, the worldwide epidemic of Spanish influenza, the Great Depression, and World War II. One of the most compelling examples of the hospital's service to the community occurred in 1931 when Mercy Hospital donated more than $600,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|600|1931|r=1[/tpl][/tpl] million today) worth of health care services at a time when one day in the hospital cost less than $4 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|4|1931|r=2[/tpl][/tpl] today). That commitment to the community was demonstrated again when, in the 1960s, Mercy decided to rebuild and remain in uptown Pittsburgh, and over the next four decades, the hospital expanded, replaced facilities, and developed specialized programs and advanced technology.
In 2006, Mercy Hospital decided to seek a strategic partner to strengthen and preserve its faith-based care and Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh merged with UPMC to become UPMC Mercy on Jan. 1, 2008. The hospital remains Pittsburgh’s only Catholic hospital with specialized services, including the neurosciences, Level I trauma and burn services, women’s health, orthopaedics, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.upmc.com/HospitalsFacilities/Hospitals/Mercy/about/Pages/mission-and-history.aspx | title=UPMC Mercy: Mission and History | accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06264/723762-28.stm | title=UPMC, Mercy: A chronology | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2006-09-21 | accessdate=2009-08-10[/tpl]

As a Catholic hospital, UPMC Mercy will not provide or permit medical procedures that are contrary to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, thus not providing some procedures available at other UPMC facilities.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.upmc.com/HospitalsFacilities/Hospitals/Mercy/about/Pages/catholic-healthcare.aspx | title=What Does It Mean to be a Catholic Hospital? | publisher=UPMC.com | accessdate=2011-05-16[/tpl]
