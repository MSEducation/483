[[Zorbing]]

CATEGORIES: Outdoor recreation

Zorbing (globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, generally made of transparent plastic.  Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope, but can also be done on a level surface in pubs and clubs around the UK, permitting more rider control.  In the absence of hills some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden or metal ramps. There are two types of orbs, harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harness orbs carry up to three riders, while the harness orbs are constructed for one to two riders. Double-harness spheres have different slope requirements, and must only be operated in specific locations.  The longer runs are approximately half a mile. The first zorbing site was established in Rotorua, New Zealand, by David and Andrew Akers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theogo.com/About_History.html | title=History of Zorbing | publisher=Outdoor Gravity NZ Ltd | accessdate =March 1, 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Hamster balls, hard plastic single layer spheres made for small rodent pets, have been manufactured and sold since at least the 1970s. A Russian article on the Zorb mentions a similar device having debuted in 1973.  In the early 1980s, the Dangerous Sports Club constructed a giant sphere (reportedly [tpl]convert|23|m|0|disp=or[/tpl] across) with a gimbal arrangement supporting two deck chairs inside.  This device was eventually cut up for scrap, with some of the plastic remnants used to cover a compost heap.  Human spheres have been depicted in mass media since 1990 when the Gladiators event Atlaspheres first aired, albeit with steel balls.
In 1994, Dwane van der Sluis and Andrew Akers conceived the idea for a type of sphere in Auckland, New Zealand, calling their invention the "Zorb".  With two other investors they created the firm ZORB Limited, and set to work commercializing sphereing.  Their business model was to develop the activity world-wide via a franchise system.  In 2000, van der Sluis exited from the company to return to his career as a software engineer; Akers continued to run the company as CEO until April 2006, when he resigned.  Around this time, ZORB's European master franchise operator, Michael Stemp, and Hungarian master franchise operator, Attila Csató, ended their affiliation with ZORB and started a manufacturing and sphereing consultancy firm, Downhill Revolution and created the human cocktail maker called Spinfizz.
Andrew Akers and his brother David Akers have since teamed up with Chris Roberts to create the OGO (Outdoor Gravity Orb) and The Fishpipe.
Sphereing is also referred to as Orbing or Zorbing, and Zorbing entered the Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2001 where it was defined as: "a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills".

==Construction==

The zorb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer between.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] This acts as a shock absorber for the rider, damping bumps while traveling. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic, as opposed to the rigid plastic, for example, of a hamster ball. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about [tpl]convert|3|m|0[/tpl] in diameter, with an inner orb size of about [tpl]convert|2|m|0[/tpl], leaving a 50–60 centimetre (20–24 in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately [tpl]convert|0.8|mm|2[/tpl] thick.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] The inner and outer orb are connected by numerous (often hundreds of) small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.

==Facilities==

Zorbing is performed at commercial locations, where prospective riders pay a fee for each ride or for a whole day's activity.  'Hill-Rolling' (the generic name for this activity) is practiced in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, the middle of Sweden, Estonia, the Gold Coast in Australia (currently not available), North Pole,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, Japan, Kochi in India, Phuket in  Thailand and Slovenia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]  In the United States, there are facilities in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Pigeon Forge, Tennessee (near Great Smoky Mountains National Park), Amesbury, Massachusetts, and Roundtop Mountain Resort, Lewisberry, Pennsylvania (near Hershey).  Several franchise-based companies (SphereMania, Orb 360) as well as OGO Inc, Downhill Revolution which do not sell franchises but do offer consultancy services and products to suitable operators) have entered the market.

==Records==

The Guinness Book of World Records recognises two sphereing records, set over two consecutive days in 2006:
