Berlin Brandenburg Airport [tpl]Airport codes|BER|EDDB[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-de|Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt[/tpl]) is an international airport under construction, located adjacent to the current Berlin Schönefeld Airport in Schönefeld [tpl]convert|18|km|mi[/tpl] south of the city centre of Berlin, the capital of Germany. It is intended to replace both Schönefeld and Berlin Tegel Airport, and to become the single commercial airport serving Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg, an area with a combined 6 million inhabitants. With a projected annual passenger number of around 27 million,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-13/berlin-airport-fiasco-shows-chinks-in-german-engineering-armor.html|title=Berlin Airport Fiasco Shows Chinks in German Engineering Armor|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=14 March 2013[/tpl] Berlin Brandenburg Airport would become the third busiest airport in Germany, superseding Düsseldorf Airport, and one of the fifteen busiest in Europe.
Air Berlin, Germanwings and easyJet are expected to become the leading carriers at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, having announced the intent to relocate and keep their hub / base operations there which they already maintain at Tegel and Schönefeld airports today.
Originally planned to be opened in 2010, Berlin Brandenburg Airport has encountered a series of delays due to poor construction planning, management and execution.[ref]
