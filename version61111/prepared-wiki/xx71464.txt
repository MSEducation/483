The [tpl]nihongo|battle of Mimasetōge|三増峠の戦い[/tpl] took place in 1569, as the forces of Takeda Shingen withdrew from repeated failed sieges of the Hōjō clan's Odawara Castle in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan. The Hōjō forces, led by the brothers Ujiteru and Ujikuni, lay in wait for him in the pass of Mimase. The Takeda vanguard, which included Baba Nobuharu, was hard-pressed; Shingen himself led up the Takeda main body. The battle turned in favor of the Takeda when Yamagata Masakage launched a furious counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Hôjô. The Hôjô were defeated and forced to retreat north, allowing the Takeda to return to Kai - though leaving behind some 900 dead.
