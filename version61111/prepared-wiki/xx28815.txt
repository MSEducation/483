Ashland is a city in Jackson County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It lies along Interstate 5 slightly north of the California border and near the south end of the Bear Creek Valley, an arm of the Rogue Valley. As of July 1, 2013, the city's population was estimated to be 20,295.
The city is the home of Southern Oregon University (SOU) and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF). These are important to Ashland's economy, which also depends on restaurants, galleries, and retail stores that cater to playgoers and other visitors. Lithia Park along Ashland Creek, historic buildings, and a paved intercity bike trail provide additional tourist attractions.
Ashland, originally called Ashland Mills, was named after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections. Ashland has a mayor-council government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal politics have differed, often sharply, with much of the rest of southwest Oregon.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of settlers in mid-19th century, the Shasta people lived in the valley along the creek approximately where Ashland is located.Davidson, p. 137 Early Hudson's Bay Company hunters and trappers, following the Siskiyou Trail, passed through the site in the 1820s.  In the late 1840s, settlers (mostly American) following the Applegate Trail began passing through the area. By the early 1850s, the Donation Land Act brought many white settlers into the Rogue Valley and into conflict with its native people. These often violent clashes continued until 1856.
In 1851, gold was discovered at Rich Gulch, a tributary of Jackson Creek, and a tent city developed on its banks, the area later known as Jacksonville.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Ashland|publisher=City of Ashland|url=http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110720140119/http://www.move2ashland.com/ashland/history_of_ashland.htm| archivedate=July 20, 2011[/tpl] Settlers arrived in the Ashland area in January 1852, including Robert B. Hargadine, Sylvester Pease, Abel D Helman, Eber Emery, and others.Davidson, p. 138 Helman and Hargadine filed the first donation land claims in Ashland. Helman and Emery built a sawmill along what they called Mill Creek (later renamed Ashland Creek) to turn timber into lumber for settlers. In 1854, they and another settler, M. B. Morris, built a second mill, Ashland Flouring Mills, to grind local wheat into flour. The community around the mill became known as Ashland Mills. A post office was established in Ashland Mills in 1855 with Helman as postmaster.
During the 1860s and 1870s the community grew, establishing a school, churches, businesses, and a large employer, Ashland Woolen Mills, which produced clothing and blankets from local wool. In 1871, the Post Office dropped "Mills" from Ashland's name. In 1872 Reverend J. H. Skidmore opened a college, Ashland Academy, a predecessor of Southern Oregon University.Davidson, pp. 142–44

Until 1926, when most rail service began taking a different route (east through Klamath Falls to avoid the steep grade through the Siskiyou Mountains), Ashland thrived on rail trade of local products, including pears, peaches, and apples.
In 1908, the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the creation of a park—Ashland Canyon Park—along Ashland Creek. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.Davidson, pp. 35–45
During the Fourth of July celebration in 1935, Angus L. Bowmer arranged the first performances of what would become the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The festival grew during the 20th century, and has become an award-winning and internationally-known regional theater company.Peterson, p. 93
Many of Ashland's historic buildings have been preserved and restored. The city has 48 individual structures and 2 historic districts (the Ashland Railroad Addition District and the Downtown District) on the National Register of Historic Places.[tpl]cite web|title=Ashland Oregon: From Stage Coach to Center Stage: Introduction|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/ashland/intro.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 10, 2013[/tpl] The structures include the Enders Building (home of the Columbia Hotel), which from 1910 to 1928 contained the largest mercantile establishment between Sacramento and Portland.[tpl]cite web|title=Ashland, Oregon: From Stage Coach to Center Stage: Enders Building|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/ashland/end.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 9, 2013[/tpl]

Ashland Creek and its tributaries begin on the flanks of Mount Ashland, at [tpl]convert|7533|ft|m[/tpl] above sea level in the Siskiyou Mountains south of the city. Upstream (south) of the city boundary, these streams flow mainly through the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. The creek flows through the city to meet Bear Creek, which roughly parallels I-5 along the east side of Ashland. Bear Creek, one of many streams in the Rogue Valley, flows generally northwest to join the Rogue River near Gold Hill, and from there the Rogue River flows generally west to its mouth on the Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite book|title=Oregon Atlas & Gazetteer|publisher=DeLorme|location=Yarmouth, Maine|year=2008|edition=7th|pages=58–61, 68–69|isbn=978-0-89933-347-2[/tpl] Ashland and the Bear Creek Valley are part of the Rogue Valley.
Oregon Route 99, running roughly parallel to I-5, passes through downtown Ashland. Oregon Route 66 enters Ashland from the east and intersects Route 99 near the city center.

==Climate==

Ashland lies within Oregon's southwest interior climate zone, in which all but the higher-elevation sites are in the rain shadow of the Oregon Coast Range to the west. The largest urban areas in this zone in addition to Ashland are Medford and Grants Pass in the Rogue Valley, and Roseburg in the Umpqua River Valley further north. Although the mountain peaks in this zone receive up to [tpl]convert|120|in|mm[/tpl] of precipitation a year, the urban areas and the valleys in which they lie generally get [tpl]convert|20|in|mm[/tpl] or less. This valley climate is particularly good for growing fruit, especially pears, and for producing other crops and farm goods such as hay, grain, poultry, and beef.Taylor, p. 57
Cloud cover in nearby Medford varies from an average of 21 percent in July to 86 percent in December.Taylor, p. 38 On average, precipitation falls in Ashland on 114 days each year and totals about [tpl]convert|20|in|mm[/tpl]. The average annual snowfall is only [tpl]convert|1.4|in|cm[/tpl]. The average relative humidity, measured at 4 p.m. daily, is 47 percent in Medford, varying from 26 percent in July to 76 percent in December.Taylor, p. 35
The coolest month is December, with an average high temperature of [tpl]convert|47|F|C[/tpl], and the warmest month is July, with an average high of about [tpl]convert|88|F|C[/tpl]. The highest temperature ever recorded in Ashland was [tpl]convert|108|F|C[/tpl], observed in August 1981, and the record low of [tpl]convert|-4|F|C[/tpl] occurred in December 1972.[tpl]cite web | title =  Monthly Averages for Ashland, Oregon|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/97520 |accessdate= April 18, 2013|publisher= The Weather Channel Interactive[/tpl]

Historically, Ashland has been something of a political outlier in southwest Oregon.[tpl]cite web|last=LaLande|first=Jeff|title=Ashland|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/ashland/|work=The Oregon Encyclopedia|publisher=Portland State University|accessdate=December 25, 2013[/tpl] In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally out of step with the rest of the region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.

==Economy==

Income from tourism is important to Ashland's economy. A large number of restaurants, galleries, and retail stores cater to thousands of visitors who attend plays each year at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 2011, the festival sold more than 390,000 tickets to its theater productions.[tpl]cite web|title=The Ashland Economy|publisher=Ashland Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.ashlandchamber.com/Page.asp?NavID=441|year=2011|accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl]
The town's largest employer is Southern Oregon University (SOU), which has a faculty and staff of more than 750.
