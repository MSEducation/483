Clybourn is a railroad station in Chicago serving Metra's Union Pacific/North Line and Union Pacific/Northwest Line.  It is located at 2001 North Ashland Avenue (at West Armitage Avenue) and is the first station north of Ogilvie Transportation Center. It is called Clybourn because nearby West Cortland Street was part of Clybourn before Clybourn was extended North.  Clybourn is situated between the Bucktown and DePaul neighborhoods, several miles north of downtown Chicago. In Metra's zone-based fare schedule, Clybourn is in zone A.
North Line and Northwest Line trains stop on separate platforms, between which is a small parking lot.  The busy Kennedy Expressway passes to the west of the station and the north branch of the Chicago River is several blocks to the east.  There is no ticket agent booth at the station; passengers must buy tickets on the train after boarding.
The station is in a mostly industrial neighborhood, though it is served by Chicago Transit Authority buses.  On January 2, 2007, the CTA also introduced weekday rush hour service on route 132 (Goose Island Express), with buses that go from Clybourn station to the Chicago Loop via Goose Island and West Loop.
The vast majority of trains that pass through the station make a scheduled stop there.  As of 2013, all 35 weekday inbound trains and 31 of 35 weekday outbound trains  on the North Line stop at Clybourn Station.  All 32 weekday inbound Northwest Line trains stop at Clybourn, as do 29 out of 32 weekday outbound trains.  In addition, all weekend trains on both lines stop at Clybourn.
