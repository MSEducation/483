Raven Oak (born December 21, 1977 in Riverside, California) is an American author, whose written works range from science fiction & fantasy to mystery and young adult literature. She wrote her first novel, a 320 page fantasy work at age twelve.Oak, Raven., Official Website Biography. She is also a singer, pianist and songwriter, whose musical works deal with the survival side of life. 
She grew up in many places around the U.S. including Michigan, Oklahoma, Florida, and Texas, where she eventually attended Richland College and later the University of North Texas as a music major. She received both her Bachelor of Science Degree and Master of Science Degree in CECS from UNT.
Her first CD, "Walls, Boxes, & Jars", was written when her attempts at writing music for college music classes resulted in being "shoved into one category or another." Her CD's sales donated to RAINN, the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network. RAINN, founded by singer/pianist Tori Amos, is America's only national hotline for rape and abuse.http://www.safe4all.org/resource-list/view/36322.
"After working through the horrors in my life, I really wanted to give back to a resource that helps so many people. Victims tend to stay victims—I wanted to learn how to be a survivor. RAINN helped with that."
Of Raven's music, Score! Music says: "Perfectly stunning musical compositions that, though they lack vocals, do not lack in emotional impact; it’s as though one can venture inside Raven’s being through her beautiful piano work. Think Tori Amos unplugged and without lyrics."Score! Music Magazine., Jeanne. October 2002. Splendid E-Zine says, "...Oak transcends the damning excesses of the Lilith Fair ghetto...if it's the job of a musician to tell stories through her instruments, Raven Oak does her job exceedingly well."Splendid E-Zine., Matthew Pollesel. February 22, 2002.
Currently residing in Seattle, WA, Raven Oak is currently focusing on writing full-time. Her music is currently on hiatus with an unknown release date for her second album, titled "Fight or Flight."
