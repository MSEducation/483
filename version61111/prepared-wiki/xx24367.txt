CATEGORIES: Apollo asteroids, Removed from Sentry Risk Table

[tpl]mp|(89959) 2002 NT|7[/tpl] (also written (89959) 2002 NT7) is a near-Earth object (NEO) with a diameter of 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) that became the first object observed by NASA's NEO program to be assigned a positive rating on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale, for a potential impact on February 1, 2019. Despite inflammatory press reports, the object had a "low probability" of impact, approximately one in a million.
Further observations of the object quickly re-rated the threat lower. As of July 25, 2002, the hazard rating on the Palermo scale had been lowered to -0.25. However, the discovery of an object with an initial Palermo hazard rating of 0.06 was a historical event for the NEO observation program.
[tpl]mp|2002 NT|7[/tpl] was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on August 1, 2002.
It is now known that on January 13, 2019 the asteroid will safely pass [tpl]convert|0.4078|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] from the Earth.
On January 30, 2020 the asteroid will pass [tpl]convert|0.02718|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off[/tpl] from 2 Pallas.
