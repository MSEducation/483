==Bathurst 1000==

Hahne's first start in the race was in 1984 when he partnered Englishman Jeff Allam in a Mobil Rover Racing Rover Vitesse to an easy Group A class win and an excellent 12th outright after starting 36th against much more powerful opposition. A brief return to the big Jags in 1985 saw Hahne team with Australian racer John Goss to win the 1985 James Hardie 1000[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/bathurst_1985.htm |title=James Hardie 1000 Mount Panorama, Bathurst 6th October, 1985 |publisher=Unique Cars and Parts |accessdate=2010-01-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100224033909/http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/bathurst_1985.htm| archivedate= 24 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] after starting sixth. His next time at Bathurst was in 1987 for the World Touring Car Championship round in an ill-fated Maserati Biturbo with Australian Kevin Bartlett. A troubled race week saw them start 34th and retire after only 29 laps with a broken differential. 1988 saw him in a Mark Petch Racing Ford Sierra RS500 with New Zealand racer Robbie Francevic, the car engineered by its previous owner, and Hahne's team boss in the 1988 ETCC, former Wolf Racing Formula One team owner Walter Wolf. Their strong charge finished on lap 103 due to overheating. That was Hahne's last race in the Bathurst 1000.
