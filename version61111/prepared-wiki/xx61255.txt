The state flag of Moldova is a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red, charged with the coat of arms of Moldova (an eagle holding a shield charged with an aurochs) on the center bar. The obverse is mirrored. The flag ratio is 1:2. Until further provisions, the State Flag of Moldova is used as the national flag and ensign as well, that is, civil, state and war flag and ensign.Law no. 217 from 17 September 2010 regarding the State Flag of the Republic of Moldovaflags.net, Flag of Republic of Moldova
The blue, red, and yellow tricolor of Moldova is almost identical to the flag of Romania, reflecting the two countries' national and cultural affinity. On Moldova's flag the yellow stripe is charged with the national arms. Like the Romanian coat of arms, the Moldovan arms, adopted in 1990, features a dark golden eagle holding an Orthodox Christian cross in its beak. Instead of a sword, the eagle is holding an olive branch, symbolizing peace. The blue and red shield on the eagle's chest is charged with the traditional symbols of Moldova: an aurochs' head, flanked by a rose at dexter and a crescent at senester, and having a star between its horns, all of gold. These two national flags are also very similar to the flags of Chad and Andorra, which are all based on vertical stripes of blue, yellow, and red.

==Colors==

Until 2010, the color shades of the Moldavian flag were not explicitly named. The Regulation regarding the flag stated that the colors of the flag must match the ones shown in the annex. Moldavian heraldist and vexillologist Silviu Andrieş-Tabac stated in an interview[tpl]cite web|url=http://geraldika.ru/symbols/5213 |title=Interview with Moldavian heraldist and vexillologist Silviu Andrieş Tabac, published in the daily newspaper "Vremea", 29 August 2003 |publisher=Geraldika.ru |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] that in 1990, when the flag was being created, "it was taken into account that many countries have similar tricolor flags. As a result, it was decided to abandon the ultramarine blue, which is present on the Romanian flag, in favor of the emerald-blue, used on the mural paintings of Voroneţ monastery...".
The French Album des pavillons nationaux et des marques distinctives (2000) by Armand du Payrat and Daniel Roudaut had suggested the following Pantone nuances, including those of the coat of arms: blue 549, yellow 143, red 186, green 340 and brown 464.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vexilla-mundi.com/moldova_flag.html |title=Flag of Moldova at |publisher=Vexilla-mundi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
However, a new law from 2010 defined the colors of the flag as Berlin blue, chrome yellow and vermillon red. The exact matches, according to annex no. 2, are as follows:

===Governmental standards===

In 2010 four new governmental standards, derived from the state flag, were established. The standard of the Minister of Defense has yet to be defined, its temporary replacement being the state flag. The other three standards, of the President, President of the Parliament and Prime Minister, are described as follows: 
A square flag with the coat of arms of Moldova on center, whose aquila is golden (instead of dark gold, or brown). The flag has a border of squares, each one measuring 1/9 of the flag's width and following the pattern blue-yellow-red-yellow. The background of the flag is purple for the President, red for the President of the Parliament and blue for the Prime Minister.
The original flags are kept in their respective offices. Duplicates are hoisted on the official residences when the people entitled to them are inside; also on their respective cars.

The current flag of Moldova was created in 1990, and is based on the national colors of Romanians, the blue-yellow-red tricolor. The reverse side differed from the Romanian flag in proportion, and by having a lighter blue.
The flag of Moldova was one of only three national flags with differing obverse and reverse sides[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presedinte.md/simb.php?lang=rom&page=702|title=Drapelul de stat al Republicii Moldova|publisher=The President of the Republic of Moldova|language=Romanian|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] — the others being the flags of Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. Although the reverse of the flag was officially stated as not containing any coat of arms, Moldovan flags with a coat of arms printed on the reverse were also used.
