Real World Studios is a residential recording studio in Box, Wiltshire, England associated with the Real World Records record label founded by rock musician Peter Gabriel.

==Description==

The studio's Big Room houses an SSL 9000K XL mixing console at its heart with additional outboard equipment surrounding the room including vintage pre-amplifiers, microphones and tape machines. The room is designed to be one big collaborative space without walls - but it also houses two isolation booths.
Adjoining the Big Room is the Wood Room. Designed to function as a flexible live room, the Wood Room features a more lively acoustic and a booth, mezzanine floor and movable acoustic screens. This room can operate as a more budget-friendly studio, independently (with a temporary control-room setup) or, most commonly, the two rooms are used together.
In January 2008 work was completed on the Big Room to provide a multi-purpose facility that could also accommodate final mixdowns for film and television projects. A separate foley recording studio was also created around that time and work to renovate and upgrade the foley studio was completed in Autumn 2010. Real World Studios has been host to film and TV projects including Quantum of Solace, The Golden Compass, Green Zone and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
The complex also houses a large rehearsal room, kitchen/dining facilities (with an on-site chef), and luxury accommodation.
