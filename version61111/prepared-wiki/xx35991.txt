The Mexican Revolution ([tpl]lang-es|Revolución mexicana[/tpl]) or Mexican Civil War ([tpl]lang-es|Guerra civil mexicana[/tpl]) was a major armed struggle that started in 1910, with an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against longtime autocrat Porfirio Díaz, and lasted for the better part of a decade until around 1920.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.ups.edu/faculty/jlago/fl380/source3_02.htm|title= MEXICAN REVOLUTION 1910-1920[/tpl] Over time the Revolution changed from a revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war with frequently shifting power struggles. This armed conflict is often categorized as the most important sociopolitical event in Mexico and one of the greatest upheavals of the 20th century,[tpl]cite journal|last=Knight|first=Alan|title=The Mexican Revolution|journal=History Today|date=May 1, 1980|volume=30|issue=5|pages=28|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&hid=21&sid=e69bc72f-b6f3-42c1-99ce-adaea35eecd4%40sessionmgr13|accessdate=5 November 2011[/tpl] which saw important experimentation and reformation in social organization.[tpl]cite book |last1=Cockcroft |first1=James |year=1992 |title=Mexico: Class Formation, Capital Accumulation, & the State | publisher= Monthly Review Press[/tpl]
After prolonged struggles, its representatives produced the Mexican Constitution of 1917.  The Revolution is generally considered to have lasted until 1920, although the country continued to have sporadic, but comparatively minor, outbreaks of warfare well into the 1920s. The Cristero War of 1926 to 1929 was the most significant relapse into bloodshed.
