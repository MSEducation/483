It is sited on the slopes of a Corallian limestone hill within the Blackmore Vale,[tpl]cite book|author=Ralph Wightman|title=Portrait of Dorset|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|year=1983|page=17|ISBN=0 7090 0844 9[/tpl] overlooking the flat Oxford Clay valley of the small River Cale, which drains into the Stour. The village lies within the North Dorset administrative district of the county, about [tpl]convert|3.5|mi|km[/tpl] south-west of the town of Gillingham.
The name of Kington Magna means great 'King's Town',[tpl]cite book|author=North Dorset District Council|title=North Dorset Official District Guide|publisher=Home Publishing Co.

In 1905 Sir Frederick Treves wrote that the village "straggles down hill like a small mountain stream." In the 2001 Census it had a population of 376.
