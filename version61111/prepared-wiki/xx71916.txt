He was a son of Saitō Yoshitatsu, and a great-grandson of Saitō Dōsan.  He was also a nephew of Oda Nobunaga's first wife, Nohime, herself a daughter of Saitō Dōsan.Saito Dosan - SamuraiWiki.

Saitō Tatsuoki succeeded his father at the age of 19. He was, however, an incapable ruler; unlike his father and grandfather.  
Tatsuoki became involved in a bitter rivalry with Akechi Mitsuhide, and lost to him decisively in 1574. He survived, but from this point on the Saitō clan were no longer a significant faction in the power struggles of the Sengoku period.
