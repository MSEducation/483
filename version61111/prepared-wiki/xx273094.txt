==Reception==

The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album three stars and said that "On first glance this LP looks like a dud...However, because the trumpeter was near the peak of his powers and his band does play such songs as "Moon River," "Days of Wine and Roses," and "Carioca" with spirit, the results are quite worthwhile, if not essential".
