A Partridge Family Christmas Card was originally released as a vinyl album of Christmas music in 1971.  The case of the album contains a reproduction of a Christmas card that was signed by the whole Partridge Family, the stars of a 1970s sitcom. The song "My Christmas Card to You" was original, but the remainder of the tracks were standards.  Like most of the Partridge Family songs, the lead vocals are sung by David Cassidy, who played Keith Partridge in the show.  The album also features one of the few Partridge Family recordings featuring Shirley Jones as the lead singer ("The Christmas Song").
A Partridge Family Christmas Card was the best-selling Christmas album in the United States during the Christmas season of 1971.  It was the number 1 album on Billboard magazine's special Christmas Albums sales chart for all four weeks that the magazine published the chart that year.[tpl]cite book | last = Whitburn  | first = Joel | title = Christmas in the Charts (1920-2004) | publisher = Record Research Inc. | year=2004 | location = Wisconsin  | page = 179 | isbn = 0-89820-161-6 [/tpl]
