[[Balance sheet]]

CATEGORIES: Financial statements, Accounting terminology

In financial accounting, a balance sheet or statement of financial position is a summary of the financial balances of a sole proprietorship, a business partnership, a corporation or other business organization, such as an LLC or an LLP. Assets, liabilities and ownership equity are listed as of a specific date, such as the end of its financial year. A balance sheet is often described as a "snapshot of a company's financial condition".[tpl]cite book |last=Williams |first=Jan R. |coauthors= Susan F. Haka, Mark S. Bettner, Joseph V. Carcello |title=Financial & Managerial Accounting |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |year=2008 |page=40 |isbn=978-0-07-299650-0[/tpl]  Of the three basic financial statements, the balance sheet is the only statement which applies to a single point in time of a business' calendar year.
A standard company balance sheet has three parts: assets, liabilities and ownership equity.  The main categories of assets are usually listed first, and typically in order of liquidity.[tpl]cite book | last = Daniels | first = Mortimer | title = Corporation Financial Statements | publisher = New York : Arno Press | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-405-13514-9 | pages = 13â€“14[/tpl] Assets are followed by the liabilities. The difference between the assets and the liabilities is known as equity or the net assets or the net worth or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation, net worth must equal assets minus liabilities.Williams, p.50
Another way to look at the balance sheet equation is that total assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity. Looking at the equation in this way shows how assets were financed: either by borrowing money (liability) or by using the owner's money (owner's or shareholders' equity). Balance sheets are usually presented with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other section with the two sections "balancing".
A business operating entirely in cash can measure its profits by withdrawing the entire bank balance at the end of the period, plus any cash in hand.  However, many businesses are not paid immediately; they build up inventories of goods and they acquire buildings and equipment.  In other words: businesses have assets and so they cannot, even if they want to, immediately turn these into cash at the end of each period.  Often, these businesses owe money to suppliers and to tax authorities, and the proprietors do not withdraw all their original capital and profits at the end of each period.  In other words businesses also have liabilities.

==Types==

A balance sheet summarizes an organization or individual's assets, equity and liabilities at a specific point in time. Two forms of balance sheet exist. They are the report form and the account form. Individuals and small businesses tend to have simple balance sheets.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sba.gov/library/balsheet.xls |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070715223932/http://www.sba.gov/library/balsheet.xls |archivedate=2007-07-15 |title=US Small Business Administration sample spreadsheet for a small business |accessdate=2003-08-10 [/tpl] Larger businesses tend to have more complex balance sheets, and these are presented in the organization's annual report.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/ar04/nonflash/10k_fr_bs.html |title=Microsoft Corporation balance sheet, June 30, 2004 |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-10-04[/tpl] Large businesses also may prepare balance sheets for segments of their businesses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/annualreport/2004/annual/md_8fc.shtml |title=International Business Machines "Global Financing" balance sheet comparing 2003 to 2004 |publisher=Ibm.com |accessdate=2012-10-04[/tpl] A balance sheet is often presented alongside one for a different point in time (typically the previous year) for comparison.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xbrl.org/taxonomy/int/fr/ifrs/ci/2003-07-15/ifrs-ci-2003-07-15_files/image016.jpg |title=Balance sheet comparing two year-end balance sheets |accessdate=2012-10-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.timberry.com/fm/BalanceSheet5-1-04.png|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071019044218/http://www.timberry.com/fm/BalanceSheet5-1-04.png|archivedate=2007-10-19 |title=Balance sheet comparing two year-end balance sheets |accessdate=2010-05-08 [/tpl]

===Personal balance sheet===

A personal balance sheet lists current assets such as cash in checking accounts and savings accounts, long-term assets such as common stock and real estate, current liabilities such as loan debt and mortgage debt due, or overdue, long-term liabilities such as mortgage and other loan debt. Securities and real estate values are listed at market value rather than at historical cost or cost basis. Personal net worth is the difference between an individual's total assets and total liabilities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.co.us/oed/sbdc/business/pbs.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307003615/http://www.state.co.us/oed/sbdc/business/pbs.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-07 |title=Personal balance sheet structure |accessdate=2010-05-08 [/tpl]

The small business's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities.Small Business Administration[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Public Business Entities balance sheet structure==

Guidelines for balance sheets of public business entities are given by the International Accounting Standards Board and numerous country-specific organizations/companys. The standard used by companies in the USA adhere to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) is a United States federal advisory committee whose mission is to develop generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for federal financial reporting entities.
Balance sheet account names and usage depend on the organization's country and the type of organization. Government organizations do not generally follow standards established for individuals or businesses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/financial/coa/balancesheet.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071119100727/http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/financial/coa/balancesheet.htm|archivedate=2007-11-19 |title=Personal balance sheet structure |accessdate=2010-05-08 [/tpl]University of Victoria (Canada) balance sheet accounts[tpl]dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]STATE OF ALABAMA CHART OF ACCOUNTSNew York State (USA) public utilities balance sheet accounts

Non-current assets (Fixed assets)

===Liabilities===

See Liability (accounting)

===Equity===

The net assets shown by the balance sheet equals the third part of the balance sheet, which is known as the shareholders' equity. It comprises::
Formally, shareholders' equity is part of the company's liabilities: they are funds "owing" to shareholders (after payment of all other liabilities); usually, however, "liabilities" is used in the more restrictive sense of liabilities excluding shareholders' equity. The balance of assets and liabilities (including shareholders' equity) is not a coincidence.  Records of the values of each account in the balance sheet are maintained using a system of accounting known as double-entry bookkeeping. In this sense, shareholders' equity by construction must equal assets minus liabilities, and are a residual.
Regarding the items in equity section, the following disclosures are required:

==Balance sheet substantiation==

Balance Sheet Substantiation is the accounting process conducted by businesses on a regular basis to confirm that the balances held in the primary accounting system of record (e.g. SAP, Oracle, other ERP system's General Ledger) are reconciled (in balance with) with the balance and transaction records held in the same or supporting sub-systems.
Balance Sheet Substantiation includes multiple processes including reconciliation (at a transactional or at a balance level) of the account, a process of review of the reconciliation and any pertinent supporting documentation and a formal certification (sign-off) of the account in a predetermined form driven by corporate policy.
Balance Sheet Substantiation is an important process that is typically carried out on a monthly, quarterly and year-end basis. The results help to drive the regulatory balance sheet reporting obligations of the organization.
Historically, Balance Sheet Substantiation has been a wholly manual process, driven by spreadsheets, email and manual monitoring and reporting. In recent years software solutions have been developed to bring a level of process automation, standardization and enhanced control to the Balance Sheet Substantiation or account certification process. These solutions are suitable for organizations with a high volume of accounts and/or personnel involved in the Balance Sheet Substantiation process and can be used to drive efficiencies, improve transparency and help to reduce risk.
Balance Sheet Substantiation is a key control process in the SOX 404 top-down risk assessment.

==Sample balance sheet==

The following balance sheet is a very brief example prepared in accordance with IFRS. It does not show all possible kinds of assets, liabilities and equity, but it shows the most usual ones. Because it shows goodwill, it could be a consolidated balance sheet. Monetary values are not shown, summary (total) rows are missing as well.
