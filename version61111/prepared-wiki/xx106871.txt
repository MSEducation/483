Ravenhill Stadium is located in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is the home ground of Ulster Rugby. With the opening of a new stand for the 2014 Heineken Cup quarter-final against Saracens on 5th April the capacity of the Stadium is now 18,000. Ravenhill is owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union.

==History==

The grounds were opened in the 1923/24 season, prior to that. The ground features an ornate arch at the entrance that was erected as a war memorial for those players killed in World War I and World War II. Prior to 1923 both Ulster and Ireland played games at the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society grounds at Balmoral, the Ulster Sports Club grounds at Cross Parade in Belfast.
Ravenhill has hosted 18 international matches, including pool games in both the 1991 and 1999 Rugby World Cups. The most recent Ireland international to be played at the stadium was on 24 August 2007 against Italy as a warm-up match for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Before that, Scotland was the last visitor in the 1954 Five Nations Championship. Ravenhill also hosted the 2007 Under 19 Rugby World Championship Final in which New Zealand defeated South Africa and other pool and semi-final matches.
Ravenhill has hosted notable Ulster matches in the Heineken Cup. Ulster beat Toulouse 15-13 at Ravenhill in the quarter-finals of the 1998-99 Heineken Cup. Ravenhill then hosted the 1998-99 Heineken Cup semi-final in which Ulster defeated Stade Francais 33-27. The most memorable moment in that game was when out half David Humphreys ran from the Ulster 10 meter line to score a try.
The stadium has been the annual venue for the Ulster Schools Cup final since 1924, which is traditionally contested on St Patrick's Day. The stadium is traditionally the venue for the Ulster Towns Cup, played on Easter Monday.
On 14 August 2012 the stadium hosted a friendly football match between Belfast side Crusaders and a Liverpool FC XI.Crusaders to play Liverpool at Ravenhill. From www.crusadersfc.com 18 June 2012

The stand is on the Mount Merrion side of the ground, and consists of a terraced area, over 500 premium seats, and 20 corporate boxes. The terrace area is now covered by a roof for the first time in the ground's history. The cost of the project is approximately £4.5 million, and has been funded by a mixture of public-sector funding, sales of premium tickets and boxes, and loans from the IRFU.[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
