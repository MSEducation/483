An urbanized area in Croatia can gain the status of grad (which can be translated as town or city as there is no distinction between the two terms in Croatian) if it meets one of the following requirements:
Grad (city/town) is the local administrative equivalent of općina (translated as "municipality"), with the only distinction being that the former usually comprise urban areas whereas the latter commonly consist of a group of villages. Note that both municipalities and city/towns often comprise more than one settlement, as the administrative territory of a grad may include suburban villages or hamlets near the city/town in question. Individual settlements (or naselje in Croatian) are the smallest statistical unit counted by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics but are not administrative entities, i.e. they are governed by the municipal or city/town council of the local administrative unit they belong to.

==List of cities and towns==

The following is a complete list of all officially designated 127 cities and towns in Croatia, sorted by population according to the 2011 population census. At the time of the previous census in 2001 there were 123 cities and towns in the country - four former municipalities were officially re-designated as towns prior to the 2011 census - Vodnjan (in 2003), and Kutjevo, Otok, and Sveta Nedelja (in 2006). In addition, the table includes data for Popovača, also a former municipality which was designated as town in the latest administrative revision in April 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/popovaca-dobila-status-grada-237487|title= Popovača dobila status grada|date=12 April 2013|work=Poslovni dnevnik|language=Croatian|accessdate=27 January 2014[/tpl]
The Grad column in the table below lists total population within the geographical boundary of the local government's jurisdiction. This means that the figure often includes other smaller settlements such as villages or hamlets located on the outskirts or near the town proper. In contrast, the Naselje ("settlement" in Croatian) column lists only population of the city/town proper, without the smaller settlements which administratively belong to the city. Both numbers are given as in some cases the figures may vary dramatically (for example Velika Gorica with nearby settlements has a population of around 63,000 but the city proper has only 31,000 citizens). 
Note that the town of Kaštela is a unique exception in that it only exists as an administrative unit - it is legally treated as an agglomeration of seven separate settlements with populations ranging from 3,000 to 7,000, none of which is actually called "Kaštela". Its town council is located in Kaštel Sućurac.
Another set of exceptions arises from the special status of the City of Zagreb, which is divided both into districts and into settlements. Unlike the other of its districts, the district of Sesvete still has the status of a standalone settlement with a population of 70,633 residents, which would make it a large city, but it doesn't have the status of a city (grad).[tpl]Croatian Census 2011 First Results | format = HTML | accessdate = 2012-03-20 | url = http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/htm/E11_Zup11_0000.html | title = City of Zagreb - Settlements[/tpl][tpl]Croatian Census 2011 First Results | format = HTML | accessdate = 2012-03-20 | url = http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/htm/E11_Zup11_1111.html | title = City of Zagreb - Town Districts[/tpl]
