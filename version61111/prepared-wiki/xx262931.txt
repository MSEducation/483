==History==

In 1912, Professor Alexandru Bărcăcilă established the "History Museum of Trajan High School". It was moved in 1926 to a new home near the Roman camp that formerly hosted a museum. It was then renamed the "Museum of History and Ethnography in Turnu Severin". After 1945, the museum grew in importance and developed its research area, under the name "Museum of the Iron Gates Region". On the 15th of May, 1972, the museum opened with its present displays having two departments: history and natural sciences, with an aquarium presenting Danubian fish species. Later on ethnography and art departments were added.[tpl]cite web|title=Drobeta Turnu Severin, by Nicolae Sfetcu [tpl]![/tpl] Nicolae .|url=http://www.academia.edu/4092473/Drobeta_Turnu_Severin_by_Nicolae_Sfetcu|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title="Iron Gates" Region Museum|url=http://ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro/iden.asp?k=436&-Muzeul-Regiunii-Portilor-de-Fier-DROBETA-TURNU-SEVERIN-Mehedinti|publisher=ghidulmuzeelor.cimec.ro|accessdate=15 March 2014[/tpl]
