Jake McGoldrick is a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. 
He represented District 1, known as the Richmond District neighborhood of San Francisco. McGoldrick was elected in 2000 as part of the progressive majority of candidates that were swept into office that year. A native of Philadelphia, McGoldrick has called San Francisco home for more than thirty years; much of that time in the Richmond. 
McGoldrick  was also a representative for San Francisco County in the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board of Directors. The former teacher, part-time college Instructor, and community activist was re-elected to a second term in November 2004. In 2007, local businessman David Heller, who had failed in his own run for the Board of Supervisors, announced his intention to collect signatures to recall McGoldrick. Business interests who wanted to recall Supervisor Jake McGoldrick failed to gather enough signatures to put it on the November ballot – falling about 1,000 signatures short. Proponents of this effort, which include the local Republican Party, tried and again failed to put the recall on the February 2008 ballot.BeyondChron: San Francisco's Alternative Online Daily News » Failure of McGoldrick Recall to Qualify Should Give Proponents Pause
