The idea of the World Choir Games originated from the effort to bring people together through singing in peaceful competition, showing that unity of nations through the arts can be effectively and illustratively demonstrated and challenged.
Organized by the Interkultur Foundation, the focus of the World Choir Games is on participation above winning. The Games aim to inspire people to "experience the strength of interaction, challenging personality and community equally by singing together".
