Coming of Age was a British situation comedy, written by Tim Dawson, and produced in house by BBC Productions, and broadcast on BBC Three. The show took a direct look at five sixth form students, Jas, Ollie, Matt, Chloe and DK, as well as, from series three, new character Robyn Crisp, who are living in Abingdon. Their lives rotate around the fictional Wooton College, their bedrooms, and Ollie's garden shed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/coming_of_age|title=Coming Of Age British Sitcom|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] A pilot originally aired in 2007, followed by the first series in 2008, a second series in 2010, and a third beginning in January 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcthree/2010/04/exclusive-coming-of-age-announ.shtml|title=Exclusive Coming of Age Announcement - brapppp!|accessdate=16 April 2010[/tpl] In 2011, the show was cancelled along with other long running BBC Three programmes including Ideal, Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps, Hotter Than My Daughter, and Doctor Who Confidential.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a342705/doctor-who-confidential-axed-by-bbc-three.html |title='Doctor Who Confidential' axed by BBC Three - Doctor Who News - TV |publisher=Digital Spy |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2012[/tpl] The first series was released on DVD on 26 October 2009, however, no further series have been released on DVD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coming-Age-DVD-Tony-Bignell/dp/B002KSA41K/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1314043200&sr=1-1 |title=Coming Of Age - Series 1 DVD|publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=22 August 2011[/tpl]

==Theme==

The Coming of Age production team joined forces with BBC Introducing, a BBC-wide project that supports unsigned, undiscovered and under-the-radar artists and DJs, to find the original theme tune and sound for the show. They held a competition for six up-and-coming artists including Kate Goes, to write a theme tune for the show from a written specification. KateGoes won, and worked with experienced composer Richie Webb, whose credits include That Mitchell and Webb Look and Comedy Shuffle, to create the final theme tune for the show.

==Episodes==

Twenty-three episodes of Coming of Age were broadcast over the course of three series. There are number of differences between the pilot and the subsequent series. Most notably, Alex Kew and Amy Yamazaki, who played Ollie and Jas in the pilot, have been replaced by Ceri Phillips and Hannah Job. Also, Dani Harmer originally played Chloe, but was replaced by Anabel Barnston. As well as new sets, the theme tune also changed, from "Steady, As She Goes" by The Raconteurs to a specially written piece by Birmingham band KateGoes and Richie Webb.

==Reception==

The show proved enormously popular with its target audience from the beginning, with Series 1 enjoying an average weekly reach of 1.2 million, and each episode appearing in the top 10 requested programmes on BBC iPlayer the day following transmission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/12_december/04/coming.shtml|title=Youth sitcom Coming of Age is recommissioned for BBC Three|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] Series 2 built on this success, with the first episode premiering to 719, 000 viewers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s54/survivors/news/a196070/bbcs-survivors-returns-to-45-million.html|title=BBC's 'Survivors' returns to 4.5 million|accessdate=15 January 2010[/tpl] BBC Three controller Danny Cohen (who commissioned the show) noted: "I'm delighted that Coming Of Age has been such a hit with young viewers. The writer Tim Dawson and the young cast are bright emerging stars for the BBC."  Despite this, the show often receives a poor reaction from television critics. Writing about the first episode, The Daily Telegraph's Culture magazine was negative: "Crudeness abounds... but neither wit nor charm has tagged along for the ride.".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3561459/Tuesdays-TV-and-radio-choices.html|title=Tuesday's TV & radio choices|accessdate=12 January 2010 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first1=Pete | last1=Naughton | first2=Gillian | last2=Reynolds | date=30 September 2008[/tpl] Harry Venning in The Stage
stated that most of the show's humour "was unremittingly dire" and stated " I sat through Coming Of Age with the will to live seeping from my every pore, leaving me drenched in a puddle of despair. Apparently writer Tim Dawson was 19 when he wrote it, which is about six years older than I would have guessed."

Meanwhile, The Scotsman said simply: "Coming of Age may be the worst BBC sitcom yet. It is supposedly aimed at teenagers, but I refuse to believe that even the easiest-to-please teenager is happy to accept something so horribly written, horribly acted and horribly vulgar in lieu of actual humour."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/entertainment/Last-night39s-TV-review-Dawn.4543784.jp|title=Last night's TV review: Dawn Porter: Free Lover, Channel 4 - Coming Of Age, BBC3|accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] However, some have been more willing to acknowledge the sitcomâ€™s appeal, with the British Comedy Guide conceding, "For its fans, it's a heightened reflection of their own experience of teenage years, with brilliantly absurd exchanges and sublime vulgarity to match."
