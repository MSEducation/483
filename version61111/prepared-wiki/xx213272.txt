Legend of the Seeker is a television series based on novels in the series titled The Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind. Distributed in U.S. by Disney-ABC Domestic Television, ABC Studios produced the series, which was its first foray into broadcast syndication, with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Joshua Donen, Ned Nalle, and Kenneth Biller serving as executive producers. The show premiered on November 1, 2008 and ran for two seasons before its cancellation in 2010.
The series follows the journeys of a long awaited "Seeker of Truth" named Richard Cypher (Craig Horner), a Confessor named Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan), a wizard named Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence), and a warrior named Cara (Tabrett Bethell) as they defend the people of their realm against tyranny and destruction. The story depicted in the television series substantially differs from that as portrayed in the written series.

==Plot==

The story takes place in the world author Terry Goodkind created in his The Sword of Truth fantasy novel series. The three main provinces are Westland, the Midlands and D'Hara. Westland is separated from the Midlands by a magical boundary, which was created to prevent any magic from entering Westland. On the other side of the Midlands is D'Hara, which is ruled by Darken Rahl. Seekers are accompanied by a Wizard of The First Order and Confessors, an ancient order of women, who oversee the welfare of the people of the Midlands and the Seeker.
The first season is loosely based on the first book of The Sword of Truth series Wizard's First Rule. Some of the stories feature events and characters not encountered in the books, while others loosely adapt events from the book. The story begins after the invasion of Darken Rahl's army into the Midlands. Kahlan Amnell, a Confessor, ventures into Westland in search of a wizard and the Seeker, who has been prophesied to defeat Rahl. Kahlan finds the wizard, Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander, and the Seeker, a young man named Richard Cypher, who is forced to accept a destiny he never knew about. Together, they set off on a quest to seek out and defeat Darken Rahl. The second season is loosely based on Stone of Tears, the second book in Goodkind's series. It tells the story of how Richard, Kahlan, and Zeddicus discover that their quest during the first season caused them to unintentionally help the Keeper of the Underworld create tears in the veil which separates the land of the dead from the world of the living. Their new quest is to find the Stone of Tears, seal the rifts between the worlds, and defeat the Keeper. They are joined in this quest by Cara, a Mord-Sith and their former enemy.

==Production==

===Development===

Sam Raimi became interested in adapting The Sword of Truth novels after his business partner Joshua Donen encouraged him to read the books,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw19773.html |title=Sam Rami and crew bring Terry Goodkind's best-selling series to TV with Legend of the Seeker|accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Spelling|first=Ian|date=2008-11-03|work=SciFi.com[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and he in turn gave the books to Robert Tapert to read.[tpl]cite web|url=http://screentalk.nzonscreen.com/interviews/producer-rob-tapert-interview|title=Rob Tapert on Xena and more|accessdate=2009-04-24|last=O'Leary|first=Clare|date=2009-01-28|work=nzonscreen.com[/tpl] Raimi considered adapting the first book into a movie or a five-part miniseries, but later settled on making a weekly television series after speaking to the books' author Terry Goodkind. A weekly television program would allow them to include most of the stories and important aspects of the series. Goodkind had resisted selling the rights of his books on multiple occasions before he met Raimi because he was not confident that other producers would maintain the integrity of his stories and characters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/893/893761p1.html |title=SDCC 08: Wizard's First Rule First Look |accessdate=2008-11-07 |last=Fickett|first=Travis|date=2008-07-24|work=IGN[/tpl] Raimi, who had produced Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess with Tapert and Ned Nalle, saw this as an opportunity to return to the first-run syndicated television business. However, the syndicated television business had diminished after the loss of crucial foreign markets[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989925.html |title=Sam Raimi banks on Disney's 'Seeker'|accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Thielman|first=Sam|date=2008-08-01|work=Variety[/tpl] and a gradual conversion of independent stations to UPN and WB programming that left little room for other syndicated dramas.
ABC Studios agreed to fund the project, making it its first venture into broadcast syndication, and greenlit the production for 22 episodes, after it was cleared for broadcast to stations representing 84% of the United States, with Tribune Company being the primary launch group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117982501.html|title=Raimi's 'First Rule' gets greenlight|accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Thielman|first=Sam |date=2008-03-16|work=Variety[/tpl] The show, which is heavily action-oriented and requires visual effects, was given a "network-sized" production budget of US$1.5 million per episode.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/26/arts/television/26barn.html |title=Swords and Sorcery Return to Syndication|accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Barnes|first=Brook|date=2008-10-26 |work=The New York Times[/tpl]
Originally named Wizard's First Rule (after the first book in The Sword of Truth series), the show was retitled to Legend of the Seeker at Goodkind's suggestion since the producers wanted to differentiate the show from the books, it would have been too restrictive for them to only include plotlines from the first book, and because this would allow them the opportunity to cover the story within all the books in the series.

===Writing===

Executive producers Raimi and Tapert intended Legend of the Seeker to be "just about telling the stories of these characters and the sacrifices they make for each other. Sometimes it's about the meaning of real friendship. And always, it's the stories of the hero's journey."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/general/view/2008_11_01_Legendary_director_Raimi_%E2%80%98Seeker__of_truth/srvc=home&position=also|title=Legendary director Raimi ‘Seeker’ of truth|accessdate=2008-11-19|last=Burke|first=Bill|date=2008-11-01|work=Boston Herald[/tpl] Tapert added, "We didn't want to have the '90s postmodern attitude where the audience is in on the joke. Seeker is much more serious than Hercules and Xena."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seeker-looks-revive-a-dormant-122071|title='Seeker' looks to revive a dormant genre|accessdate=November 11, 2012|last=Nordyke|first=Kimberly|date=October 30, 2008|work=The Hollywood Reporter[/tpl]
With show's production based in New Zealand and a writing staff based in Los Angeles, one of the biggest challenges has been dealing with the time differences and the communication issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/081003-legend-of-the-seeker.html|title=Popular Fantasy Books Inspire Sam Raimi's New TV 'Legend'|accessdate=2008-11-19|last=Eramo|first=Steven|date=2008-10-03|work=Newsarama.com[/tpl] Kenneth Biller noted that the biggest challenges the writing staff faced were to create standalone episodes while integrating the storylines and mythology created by Terry Goodkind, and to "honor the books without literally translating them". As such, the series contains some stories from the books and new stories and events created by the series' writers. Raimi's reason for the changes is that the structure of a novel differs from a weekly one-hour television program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE0R7215rcY526|title=Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert Delve Back Into Fantasy with Legend of the Seeker| accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Gallagher|first=Brian|date=2008-10-28|work=MovieWeb.com[/tpl] Tapert and Raimi maintain that while the writers have had to create events that are not portrayed in the books, they have remained faithful to the characters, themes and overarching story of the books:
Goodkind released a message to his readers on his official website prior to the show's production, saying: "No series (or mini-series, or feature film) can follow the underlying book exactly. Sam Raimi and his team want to keep the TV series true to my vision, so rest assured that I am going to be intimately involved in the writing of each of the episodes." He added, "If you love the book just the way it is, then enjoy the book for what it is and come to the TV series prepared to enjoy the show for what it is."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terrygoodkind.com/news/news2.html|title=A Message From Terry |accessdate=2009-02-22|last=Goodkind |first=Terry|date=2008-02-21|work=Terry Goodkind's official website[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] However, after production started, Goodkind released another press statement in response to questions posed to him by fans: "I want you all to understand that ABC studios chose not to consult me on actors, scripts, or any other aspect of the show," he stated. "I have had no input whatsoever on the TV series, so I am the wrong person to write to or complain about the show. If you wish to make comments, positive or negative, please direct them to Disney/ABC." He continued, "For my part, I trust in Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert to at some point be able to exert their immense creative talent and do a great job at bringing to life the characters we all love."

===Casting===

When casting the role of Richard Cypher, Tapert recalled that when he saw Craig Horner's audition tape, he "absolutely thought he was the guy, instantly". Raimi thought that although Horner is older than the character he plays (even though he actually is not), he was "very believable" and that "he's got enough good qualities in him, in real life, and he will probably make the audience believe that he's taking that ride towards making a responsible person and that growth of character that's so important for me in the stories of Terry Goodkind." Horner had not heard of the books prior to the audition, and was convinced by a friend to read the books and try out for the role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/081105-legend-horner.html|title=Australian Actor Seeks to Create American TV 'Legend'|accessdate=2008-11-07|last=Cairns |first=Bryan|date=2008-11-05|work=Newsarama.com[/tpl]
For the role of Kahlan Amnell, Raimi credits Tapert for finding Bridget Regan, whom he saw on one of the audition tapes they received. Raimi thought that she grounded the fantastical situations by being "very human and real", and recalled, "I was moved by her and I believed her and I thought we couldn't ask for anything more." Like Horner, Regan had not read the books prior to the audition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/925/925984p1.html|title=Legend of the Seeker Star Bridget Regan Confesses|accessdate=2008-11-06|last=Fowler|first=Matt |date=2008-10-31|work=IGN |pages=1–2[/tpl] Horner and Regan were brought together for a "chemistry reading" in Los Angeles, upon which the producers concurred that they had found their two lead actors.

===Filming===

Production was set to begin in May 2008, but it was delayed by six weeks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20081111-0722-apontv-legendofseeker.html |title='Seeker': A girl, a guy, a wizard and a quest|accessdate=2008-11-15|last=Moore|first=Frazier|date=2008-11-11|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune[/tpl] The series was shot entirely in New Zealand in high-definition. Though based in Auckland, filming took place in various places in and outside of the city: at Henderson Valley Studios,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994987.html|title=New Zealand|accessdate=2008-11-15|last=Chai|first=Paul|date=2008-10-30 |work=Variety[/tpl] in the city's outskirts and in the mountainous region around Queenstown.

===Cancellation===

Tribune, the major distributor of the series, decided not to renew the series on March 4, 2010, but according to a statement from ABC Studios,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b170768_hell_yes_legend_of_seeker_aint_dead.html |title=Hell to the Yes: Legend of the Seeker Ain't Dead Yet! |publisher=E!
