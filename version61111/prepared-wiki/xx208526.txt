He then moved over to the Worcester Grays of the Atlantic Association for the next few years. During this time, Stafford was mainly a pitcher but also played as an outfielder occasionally. He had his best pitching season in 1888, when he went 16–7 with a 2.87 earned run average.
After a short stint in the Players' League in 1890, Stafford went to the Western Association in 1891 and then the California League in 1892. In 1893, he was acquired by the National League's Giants. He had given up pitching by this time. While Stafford never put up good hitting numbers in the major leagues, he was versatile in the field. With the Giants, he was mainly an outfielder in 1893; a third baseman in 1894; the starting second baseman in 1895; and an outfielder again in 1896."General Stafford Statistics and History". baseball-reference.com.

Overall, he played 571 games in the majors, including 251 as an outfielder, 161 as a second baseman, and 131 as a shortstop.
