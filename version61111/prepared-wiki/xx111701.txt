[[Kalina cycle]]

CATEGORIES: Thermodynamic cycles

The Kalina cycle, developed by Dr. Alexander Kalina is a thermodynamic process for converting thermal energy into usable mechanical power.
It uses a solution of 2 fluids with different boiling points for its working fluid.  Since the solution boils over a range of temperatures as in distillation, more of the heat can be extracted from the source than with a pure working fluid.  The same applies on the exhaust (condensing) end.  This provides efficiency comparable to a Combined cycle, with less complexity.http://vganapathy.tripod.com/kalina.html Overview of the Kalina cycle
By appropriate choice of the ratio between the components of the solution, the boiling point of the working solution can be adjusted to suit the heat input temperature.  Water and ammonia is the most widely used combination, but other combinations are feasible.
Because of this ability to take full advantage of the temperature difference between the particular heat source and sink available, it finds applications in reuse of industrial process heat, geothermal energy, solar energy, and use of waste heat from power plants (Bottoming cycle).

Recoverable heat from industrial processes
The Kalina cycle[tpl]cite web|title=Kalina Cycle|url=http://kalinacycle.net/[/tpl]   has been thought to increase thermal power output efficiencies by up to 50% in suitable installations, and is ideally suited for applications such as steel, coal, oil refineries and cement production plants.

==Second Generation==

A second generation of Kalina cycle systems was developed by Dr. Kalina and Kalex LLC. These systems are technically Kalina cycles (in that they utilize muti-component working fluid with variable composition) but they do not use the "Kalina cycle" trademark.[tpl]cite web|title=Kalina, Alexander I., New Binary Geothermal Power System. Sochi, Russia: International Geothermal Workshop, Geothermal Energy Society, 2003|url=https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/Russia/IGW2003/W00024.PDF/[/tpl]
Unlike first generation Kalina cycle systems, which are applicable only for relatively low-temperature heat sources, the second generation of Kalina cycle systems is applicable to both low and relatively high temperature heat sources.[tpl]cite web|title=Kalina, Alexander I., United States Patent Application 20100101227,  April 29, 2010|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=13&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=kalex&OS=kalex&RS=kalex/[/tpl]
For low temperature heat sources, second generation Kalina cycles are projected to attain thermal efficiencies higher than those possible with first generation cycles.[tpl]cite web|title=Kalina, Alexander I., New Thermodynamic Cycles and Power Systems for Geothermal Applications, GRC Transactions, Vol. 30, 2006|url=http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1025123.pdf/[/tpl]

==Licensing==

The Kalina cycle trademark and all first generation global patents that are still in force are owned by Wasabi Energy plc. owner of Global Geothermal Ltd., parent company of Recurrent Engineering Inc.http://www.wasabienergy.com/portfolio/globalgeothermal.aspx
Some of the original Kalina cycle patents have expired and have now entered the public domain.[tpl]cite web|title=Kalina, Alexander I., United States Patent: 4,548,043 "Method of generating energy", October 22, 1985|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=100&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Kalina.INNM.&p=2&OS=IN/Kalina&RS=IN/Kalina/[/tpl]
Global Geothermal Ltd. (parent company: Wasabi Energy Ltd.) owns all the worldwide entities licensed to deploy the first generation Kalina Cycle process.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
As a result GGL controls the Kalina cycle rights and over 200 international patents associated with this technology. The process is currently used via licensing deals with Siemens and Shanghai Shenge New Energy for all their Chinese applications.http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/214334/AIM-market-Wasabi-Energy-hopes-China-will-warm-to-Kalina-Cycle-technology#ixzz1CqOQwWxx FLSmidth has the exclusive right in most countries to offer the first generation Kalina cycle technology to the cement and lime industries.http://www.flsmidth.com/en-US/eHighlights/Archive/Cement/2011/October/Exclusive+agreement+maximises+waste+heat+recovery
All second generation Kalina cycle patents are currently owned by Kalex LLC, a company founded by Dr. Kalina.
