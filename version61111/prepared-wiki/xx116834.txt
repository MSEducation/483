Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam al-Sarimi Arabic:عبدالرحمن بن ملجم السريمي was the Kharijite assassin of Imām Ali ibn Abi Talib,http://www.al-islam.org/restatement/66.htm the first cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.
A number of the Kharijites met in Mecca and remembered the Battle of Nahrawan that was fought in 659 by the Caliphate under Ali and the Kharijites in Baghdad which resulted in Khariji defeat. One of the Kharijis said "If we just bought ourselves revenge for the honour of our deceased brothers". They agreed to assassinate three of the leaders of Islam: ibn Muljam was to kill Ali, and Alhujjaj Al Tamimi was to kill Muawiya, and Amr ibn Bakr Al Tamimi was to kill 'Amr ibn al-'Aas.
Ibn Muljam was to assassinate Ali in the morning of 19th Ramadan 40 AH, which would correspond to January 25th, 661, as Ali was performing Fajar Prayer in the Mosque of Kufa.http://www.ezsoftech.com/stories/infallible2b.asp

While the other two did not succeed in achieving their end, ibn Muljam did succeed. He came to Kufa and waited till the 19th of Ramadan approached. On the 19th of Ramadan of the 40th Hijra ibn Muljam attacked Ali. Ibn Muljam was arrested and handed over to Ali's son, Hasan ibn Ali, who killed him.
