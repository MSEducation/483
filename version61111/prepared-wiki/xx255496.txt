CATEGORIES: 1977 films, Latter Day Saint films

The Mailbox is a 24-minute film produced by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It portrays an old lady whose loneliness is amplified as she daily walks to the mailbox, only to find nothing there for her. Her neighbours and the mailman provide some relief, but her family doesn't seem to care.  The film is available through the Brigham Young University Office of Creative Works on a compilation DVD with other LDS films.
