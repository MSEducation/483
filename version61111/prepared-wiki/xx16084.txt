==History==

Originally founded in 1996 as the Mining Company, the site was launched on April 21, 1997 by Scott Kurnit, owner of General Internet; Bill Day and a group of other entrepreneurs in New York City.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,3272,00.html|author=David Kushner|title= Drilling Begins at The Mining Company|publisher=Wired|date=April 21, 1997[/tpl] The original goal was to maintain 1,800 topic areas, but after five years of operation, this number was reduced to 700. The original business plan offered writers a minimum rate of $250 a month or one-third of the advertising revenue generated within their topic area. The Mining Company also employed approximately 50 full-time staff for administration, advertising sales and the overall site-design work.
