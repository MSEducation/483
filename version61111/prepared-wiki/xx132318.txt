[[Voere VEC-91]]

CATEGORIES: Bolt-action rifles, Caseless firearms

The Voere VEC-91 was made by Voere and was the first commercial sporting rifle to combine caseless ammunition and electronic firing. Depending upon its chambering, it fired a 5.56 (0.223"), 5.7 mm or 6 mm projectile at speeds of up to 930 metres per second (3,051 feet per second). When chambered for 5.7 mm it had a 5 round magazine, and it had a 4 round magazine when chambered in 6 mm. Two 15 volt dry cell batteries, located in the pistol grip, allowed it to fire approximately 5,000 rounds without replacing the batteries. Voere also made a pistol version. The rifle was first exported to the United States in 1993, but the weapon was not a commercial success and production ended shortly thereafter.
The weapon was capable of great accuracy due to several factors inherent to the design, and several factors due to its implementation. First, the trigger activated a button, requiring little pressure. Second, the electronic ignition meant that there was no latency due to lock time. With respect to the implementation, the rifle came with a match grade premium barrel. Lastly, all ammunition came from one source, with the result that all rounds were identical within manufacturing tolerances.
