Queen Savang Vadhana of Siam ([tpl]lang-th|สว่างวัฒนา[/tpl]; RTGS: Sawang Watthana, 10 September 1862 – 17 December 1955) was a consort of King Chulalongkorn or Rama V. Her full name and title was Queen Sri Savarindira ([tpl]lang-th|ศรีสวรินทิรา[/tpl]; RTGS: Si Sawarinthira) – thus she was not the Rajini (queen), but just was a highest consort. Already long widowed, after her first grandson's accession in 1935 she became known as Somdech Phra Phan Vasa Ayyika Chao (สมเด็จพระพันวัสสาอัยยิกาเจ้า; [tpl]RTGS|Somdet Phra Phan Watsa Ai-yika Chao[/tpl]), which means The Queen Grandmother because she was the grandmother of both King Ananda Mahidol and the present king King Bhumibol Adulyadej or Rama IX.

She received the title of Queen Grandmother, having been renamed Sri Savarindira by King Prajadhipok while she was Queen Aunt.
Queen Sri Savarindira was also the grandmother of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). Although her son, Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis did not survive to become king she lived to see two of her grandsons become king.
