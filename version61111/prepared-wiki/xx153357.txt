Windmill Down is a rural location near the town of Hambledon in Hampshire.  It was used as a venue for major cricket matches in the 18th century and from 1782 as the home of the Hambledon Club.

==Opening of Windmill Down==

Hambledon used Broadhalfpenny Down from at least 1753 until 1781 when it was abandoned for being "too remote".  Broadhalfpenny is about two miles from the village whereas Windmill Down is adjacent.  Oddly enough, Broadhalfpenny had a good pub immediately opposite (the famous Bat and Ball Inn) but Windmill Down did not! Ashley Mote, The Glory Days of Cricket, Robson, 1997

==Major cricket venue==

On Tuesday 18 June 1782, the Hampshire Chronicle reported the first meeting on Windmill Down, referring to the ground as "a field called the New Broad Halfpenny adjoining to the Town of Hambledon".G B Buckley, Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket, Cotterell, 1935  It is probable but unconfirmed that the first match was played there a week later.  The first definite major match was Hampshire v All-England in August 1782, All-England winning by 147 runs.

==Last match==

Windmill Down was used regularly as the home venue for Hampshire matches until July 1795 when the last recorded match took place there.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862
