Carl Olof (Olle) Hedberg (May 31, 1899, Norrköping, Sweden – September 20, 1974, Verveln, Östergötland, Sweden) was a Swedish author. 
Hedberg is best known as a probing satirist of the middle class and conventional world in general. His first novel, Rymmare och fasttagare (Prisoner's base), was published in 1930, and from then on would write a novel every year for the next several decades. His works of the 1940s entail a search for religious and moral values.(April 1, 1995). Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature. Merriam-Webster. ISBN 0-87779-042-6. Page 528. Bekänna färg (Show one’s hand), published in 1947, is considered to be one of his most important novels from this period. 
His works do not aspire to a philosophical greatness.  Rather he himself is more of a realist and a disenchanted moralist.Seymour-Smith, Martin (1973). Funk & Wagnalls Guide to Modern World Literature. Funk & Wagnalls. ISBN 0-308-10079-4. Page 1025. He was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1957.
Hedberg committed suicide 1974, a few weeks after his daughter Birgitta succumbed to a sudden illness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bonnierforlagen.se/Forlag/Forfattare/?personId=31363|title=Olle Hedberg|publisher=Bonnierförlagen|accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]
