Thanesar is an old and historic town on the banks of the Sarsawati Ghaggar river in the state of Haryana in northern India. It is located in Kurukshetra District, approximately 160 km northwest of Delhi. Prabhakaravardhana, father of Harshavardhana, was the ruler of Thanesar and the first king of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at Sthanishvara (present day Thanesar).

==Origin of name==

The name Thanesar is derived from its name in Sanskrit, Sthanishvara which means Place/Abode of the Lord. (Sthana-Place/region, Ishvara-Lord)

==History==

===Introduction===

Thanesar was an obscure village until the 1950s. After the partition of India, a large refugee camp was set up here, which became the nucleus of a bustling commercial city. It grew so much that in 23 January 1973, a new district named Kurukshetra district was created, of which Thanesar was the main town. Now Thanesar is a Municipal Council. People now tend, erroneously, to refer to Thanesar town as "Kurukshetra".

===Mythological importance===

The new district was named Kurukshetra in order to capitalize on the purported mythological significance of the area. According to the epic Mahabharata, Krishna along with his family came from Dwaraka to participate in the fair of solar eclipse at Kurukshetra. It is believed that the Mughal Emperor Akbar, accompanied by his court historian Abul Fazl, too visited Kurukshetra during the Solar Eclipse in 1567. Abul Fazl’s Akbarnama refers to the eclipse in Kurukshetra and the Pilgrims bathing in the Brahma Sarovar. The French traveler François Bernier of the Mughal Emperor Shahjehan’s era also mentions the sacred baths at the Indus, Ganges and the sacred tanks of Thaneshwar (Kurukshetra) on the occasion of the Solar Eclipse."Solar Eclipse at Kurukshetra "
Historians are also investigating this city's link with the Indus Civilisation. They are also looking into the possibility that the Ghaggar river is actually the famous Saraswati river of the Vedas.

===Religious and historical importance===

Thanesar derives its name from the words "Sthaneshwar" which means "Place of God". The Sthaneshwar Mahadev Temple, whose presiding deity is Lord Shiva, is believed to be the oldest temple in the vicinity. Kaleshwar Mahadev Temple & Dukha Bhanjan Mahadev Temples are also the oldest temples of Thanesar. Other religious sites include the Brahma Sarovar, the Sannihit Sarovar, Gurdwara 6th Patashahi and the Devi Bhadrakali temple, which is counted among the 51 Shakti Peethas. The bathing-fair held here on the occurrence of a solar eclipse is said to be attended by half a million pilgrims.

===Sack of Sthaneshwar by Mahmud of Gazni===

Thanesar was sacked and many of its temples were destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni.
Firishta records''Farishta Vo1 Page 29 Translation by John Briggs that
, the most sacred Hindu place, in the kingdom of Hindoostan. It had reached the ears of the King that Thanesur was held in the same veneration by idolaters, as Mecca by the faithful; that they had there set up a number of idols, the principal of which they called Jugsoma, pretending that it had existed ever since the creation. Mahmood having reached Punjab, required, according to the subsisting treaty with Anandpal Tuar (Tomar King of Delhi - Indraprasth), that his army should not be molested on its march through his country. An embassy was accordingly sent to inform the Raja of his intentions, and desiring him to send safe-guards into his towns and villages, which he would take care should be protected from the followers of his camp. Anandpal Tuar, agreeing to this proposal, prepared an entertainment for the reception of the King, at the same time issuing orders for all his subjects to supply the camp with every necessary of life.
The Raja's brother, with two thousand horse was also sent to meet the army, and to deliver the following message:
"My brother is the subject and tributary of the King of Gazni, but he begs permission to acquaint his Majesty, that Thanesur is the principal place of worship of the inhabitants of the country: that if it is required by the religion of Mahmood to subvert the religion of others, he has already acquitted himself of that duty, in the destruction of the temple of Nagrakote. But if he should be pleased to alter his resolution regarding Thanesur, Anandpal Tuar promises that the amount of the revenues of that country shall be annually paid to Mahmood, that a sum shall also be paid to reimburse him for the expense of his expedition, besides which, on his own part, he will present him with fifty elephants, and jewels to a considerable amount."
Mahmood replied, "The religion of the faithful inculcates the following tenet: ‘That in proportion as the tenets of the Prophet are diffused, and his followers exert themselves in the subversion of idolatry, so shall be their reward in heaven;’ that, therefore, it behooved him, with the assistance of God, to root out the "worship of idols" from the face of all India. “How then should he spare Tahnesur? "
This answer was communicated to Raja Anandpal Tuar of Delhi, who, resolving to oppose Sultan Mahmood, sent messengers throughout Hindoostan to acquaint the other rajas that Mahmood, without provocation, was marching with a vast army to destroy Thanesur, now under his immediate protection. He observed, that if a barrier was not expeditiously raised against this roaring torrent, the country of Hindoostan would be soon overwhelmed, and that it behooved them to unite their forces at Thanesur, to avert the impending calamity.
Mahmood, having reached Tahnesur before the Hindus, had time to take measures for its defence; the city was plundered, the idols broken, and the idol Jugsoma was sent to Ghazni to be trodden under foot. According to Hajy Mahommed Kandahary, a ruby was found in one of the temples weighing 450 miskals, and it was allowed by every one who saw it to be a wonder that had never be¬fore been heard of.
Mahmood, after the capture of Thanesur, was desirous of proceeding to Delhi. But his nobles told him, that it would be impossible to keep possession of it, till he had rendered Multan a province of his own government, and secured himself from all apprehension of Anundpal, the Hindushahi Raja of Lahore. The King resolved, therefore, for the present, to proceed no further, till he had accomplished these objects. Anundpal Shahi, however, conducted himself with so much policy and hospitality towards Mahmood, that he returned peaceably to Ghazni. On this occasion, the Mahmood's army brought to Ghazni 200,000 captives, and much wealth, so that the capital appeared like an Indian city, no soldier of the camp being without wealth, or without many slaves.
