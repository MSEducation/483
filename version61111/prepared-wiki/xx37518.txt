Andrew D. Gordon is a British computer scientist employed by Microsoft Research. His research interests include programming language design, formal methods, concurrency, cryptography, and access control.

==Biography==

Gordon earned a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1992. Until 1997 Gordon was a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He then joined the Microsoft Research laboratory in Cambridge, England, where he is a principal researcher in the Programming Principles and Tools group.Programming, Principles, and Tools group, Microsoft Research, accessed 2012-02-02.

==Research==

Gordon is one of the designers of Concurrent Haskell, a functional programming language with explicit primitives for concurrency. He is the co-designer with Martin Abadi of spi calculus, an extension of the π-calculus for formalized reasoning about cryptographic systems.[tpl]citation|title=The modelling and analysis of security protocols: the CSP approach|first1=Peter|last1=Ryan|first2=Steve A.|last2=Schneider|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|year=2001|isbn=978-0-201-67471-2|contribution=9.10 Spi calculus|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q1lABK_C9X8C&pg=PA234|pages=234–235[/tpl].

==Awards and honours==

Gordon's Ph.D. thesis, Functional Programming and Input/Output, won the 1993 Distinguished Dissertation Award of the British Computer Society.Awards, honours, prizes and competitions won, Cambridge Computer Laboratory, accessed 2012-02-02. His 2000 paper on the ambient calculus subject with Luca Cardelli, "Anytime, Anywhere: Modal Logics for Mobile Ambients", won the 2010 SIGPLAN Most Influential POPL Paper Award.SIGPLAN awards, retrieved 2012-02-01.
