Urine-indicator dye is a fictional substance thought to form a colored cloud in a swimming pool to indicate the presence of urine from people urinating while swimming.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/science/poolpiss.asp | title=Piscine of the Crime | publisher=Snopes | date=December 14, 2000 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 | author=Mikkelson, Barbara[/tpl] Rumors of the chemical's existence go back at least as far as 1958, with a 1985 biography of Orson Welles describing such a dye as existing in 1937, and references to the substance can be found through popular culture over quite a lengthy time period. However, the dye does not exist, and although a chemical could be manufactured to react to urine, it would be difficult to prevent it from reacting to other substances present in pool water.
A few companies capitalized on the urban legend by creating professional pool signs that warned that the pool was indeed being monitored with the chemical called "wee alert" or a similar catchy name.  The signs were a strong deterrent particularly for adults.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
The 2010 film Grown Ups and the 2011 film Take This Waltz both feature scenes in which the chemical is presented as if it were real.
