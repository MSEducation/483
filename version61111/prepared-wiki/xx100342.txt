CATEGORIES: Automotive accessories

A headliner is a composite material that is adhered to the inside roof of automobiles or yachts. It typically consists of a face fabric with nonwoven or foam backing. Headliners consist of multilayered composite materials that bring together multiple functionalities, including the requested look, feel, stiffness, and sound reduction needed in cars. Automotive headliner is optimised with respect to head impact counter measureHeholt, Susan. Daimler Chrysler, USP 7014259 (B2) or to integrate additional LED lighting film behind the fabric. Most headliners consists of a tricot knit fabric that is knapped to provide a soft touch and uniform appearance. The fabric is adhered with melted polyurethane foam. This fabric-foam composite is glued to the interior fiberglass roof of the automobile.
There are more complex knit products used as a face fabric, as well as less expensive non-woven products. Recent headliner developments include environmentally friendly products made of recyclable backing-adhesive and face fabric.
In yachts, foam-backed vinyl is often used.

==Replacements==

When a headliner fails, it sags or falls from the roof. Repairs may involve tacking or replacing the entire headliner. Heat, humidity, and time rapidly degrade the bond that the polyurethane foam has on the face fabric. As the foam oxidizes and yellows, the fabric-foam bond fails. This failure is more common in cars produced in the 1970s.
Replacing the entire headliner fabric is usually necessary as the oxidized foam can prove nearly impossible to remove from the sagging fabric. To do this one would purchase a headliner replacement kit, headliner adhesive, and a scrubbing brush.[tpl]cite web|title=Headliner Repair Kit Guide|url=http://www.headlinerfix.com|work=Headliner Replacement Kit|publisher=HeadlinerFix.com|accessdate=3 October 2012[/tpl]

2) Peel the old headliner fabric. 
3) Brush off the old adhesive foam from the headliner board. 
4) Glue new headliner fabric and reinstall back into the vehicle.  
This also happens to similar vinyl headlining in boats, but with less predictability.
