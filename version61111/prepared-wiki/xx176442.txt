Danger in the Air was a regional bluegrass band based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area from the mid-1980s until 1990. It is best known as the band in which Robin Lynn Macy performed while simultaneously founding the all-female group the Dixie Chicks in 1989.Danger in the Air - Song List"Dixie Chicks", Contemporary Musicians.

The band was founded by Drew Garrett (bass) and Andy Owens (mandolin) in mid 1985.  Both musicians were established bluegrass musicians. The original group also included Robin Macy on guitar and vocals. James McKinney joined the group early in 1986 on banjo. Stephan Dudash (5-string viola) was a late addition. As a five-piece, the band won first place at several regional competitions and placed fourth in the national SPBGMA band contest in Nashville.Sounds Right Recording web site
Danger in the Air released two cassettes: a self-titled recording and Airtight.
In 1990, the band dissolved, due in part to Macy's commitments to the fledgling band, The Dixie Chicks. James McKinney moved to Nashville where he continued to perform using the band's name. After dropping the name in 2003, he and his wife performed as the James & Angela McKinney Band.  Angela McKinney has since pursued a solo career.Angela McKinney and Her Mighty Small Band, website
