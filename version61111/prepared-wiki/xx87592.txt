Elsternwick railway station is located on the Sandringham line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick opening on 19 December 1859.Elsternwick Vicsig
The station opened, as part of the Melbourne & Hobson's Bay United Railway Company's network. The company and network was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878 to become part of Victorian Railways. As with the suburb Ripponlea, which had been named after the adjacent "Rippon Lea Estate" of Frederick Sargood, Elsternwick had been named after the largest property in the district, Charles Ebden's "Elster".Elster was German for "magpie". The creek nearby became known as the Elster Creek; and, when a village grew up on the creek, the Anglo-Saxon suffix ‘wick’, meaning village, was added.http://www.anps.mq.edu.au/documents/Sept_2004.pdf
In the 1880s, Elsternwick station also functioned as the Melbourne end of the railway line to the large scale sugar beet processing mill that had been established at Rosstown, now known as Carnegie. This railway was seldom used and it ceased to function in 1916.
An electric tramline between Elsternwick and Point Ormond opened in 1915, closing on 22 October 1960. The tram terminated at the railway station, with the route becoming part of the extended 246 bus route. The current station and grade separation of the Glen Huntly Road / tramway / railway level crossing was completed in October 1960.[tpl]cite book|last=SE Dornan & RG Henderson|first=|title=Electric Railways of Victoria|publisher=Australian Electric Traction Society|page=50|isbn=0-909459-06-1|year=1979[/tpl] Elsternwick was upgraded to a Premium station on 13 November 1995.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1997|title=Upgrading Eltham to a Premium Station|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Heritage Society|pages=page 310[/tpl] The station ground level carpark was closed in 2002 and 2003 while a residential/retail development was built on it in a deal where the developer got the land and built a multistorey carpark with lift access for commuters.
