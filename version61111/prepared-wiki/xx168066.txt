Synodontis membranacea is a species of upside-down catfish native to northern Africa.  This species is a component of local commercial fisheries.
S. membranacea can be recognized by the unusually wide membranes on its barbels that give the appearance of a moustache. These fish are patterned with a few large spots on their body that fade quickly with growth.[tpl]cite web |publisher=PlanetCatfish |date=June 13, 2006 |url=http://www.planetcatfish.com/cotm/cotm.php?article_id=82 |work=Catfish of the Month |title=November 1999 |accessdate=August 2, 2007[/tpl] There is a comb of very small spines near the point of the operculum, but they do not protrude through the skin.[tpl]cite journal |author=John P.
