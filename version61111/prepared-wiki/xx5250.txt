[[FIFA World Cup Trophy]]

The World Cup is a gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two trophies have represented victory: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970, and the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day.
The trophy, originally named Victory, but later renamed in honour of former FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and lapis lazuli and depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil won the trophy outright in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.
The subsequent trophy, called "FIFA World Cup Trophy", was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holder of the trophy is Spain, winner of the 2010 World Cup.

==Jules Rimet Trophy==

The Jules Rimet Trophy was the original prize for winning the Football World Cup. Originally called "Victory", but generally known simply as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, it was officially renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. Designed by Abel Lafleur and made of gold plated sterling silver on a white/yellow marble base. Since 1958 this base has been replaced with a high base made of lapis lazuli, it stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb).[tpl]cite web| author=FIFA | title = Jules Rimet Cup | url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/worldcup/julesrimettrophy.html | accessdate =9 June 2009 | publisher=fifa.com [/tpl] It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the Conte Verde, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, on 21 June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.
During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it.[tpl]cite web| author=DDI News | title = History | url = http://www.ddinews.com/FIFA/FIFA%20World%20Cup%20history | year = 2006 | accessdate =5 July 2006 | publisher=ddinews.com [/tpl]
On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. The trophy was found just seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Upper Norwood, South London, by a dog named Pickles.[tpl]cite news | first=ALASTAIR | last=REID | coauthors= | title=The World Cup | date=10 September 1966 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/articles/060703fr_archive01 | work=The New Yorker | accessdate =2 February 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070224033726/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/content/articles/060703fr_archive01  | archivedate=24 February 2007 [/tpl]
As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica had to also disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This replica was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, several times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a replica[tpl]cite web| author=Simon Kuper | title = Solid gold mystery awaits the final whistle | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/87e8256e-cbcc-11da-a7bf-0000779e2340.html | year =2006 | accessdate =5 July 2006 |work=Financial Times [/tpl] and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.
The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930.[tpl]cite web| author=Mark Buckingham | title = 1970 World Cup – Mexico | url = http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx?hlid=373674 | year = 2006 | accessdate =2 October 2006 | publisher=Sky Sports |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061013182428/http:/home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx%3Fhlid%3D373674 |archivedate = 13 October 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.
On 20 December 1983, the wooden rear of the cabinet was pried open with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, as it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold away.
The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using 1.8 kg (3.97 lb) of gold. This replica was presented to the Brazilian president in 1984.[tpl]cite web| author=Associated Press | title = Trophy as filled with history as Cup | url = http://media.cnnsi.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/news/2002/06/25/trophy_ap/ | year = 2006 | accessdate =5 July 2006 | publisher=CNN [/tpl]

==FIFA World Cup Trophy==

A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries.[tpl]cite web |title=The FIFA World Cup Trophy |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/brand/trophy.html |accessdate=10 August 2009 |work=FIFA.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association[/tpl] Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands 36.5 centimetres (14.4 inches) tall and is made of 5 kg (11 lb) of 18 carat (75%) gold with a base (13 centimetres 5.1 inches in diameter) containing two layers of malachite. It has been asserted by Martyn Poliakoff that the trophy is hollow; if, as is claimed, it were solid, the trophy would weigh 70–80 kg and would be too heavy to lift.[tpl]cite web |title=Chemistry of the World Cup Trophy |author=Periodic Videos |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCgElVlZhk |accessdate=5 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/10301713.stm |title=Professor says World Cup trophy cannot be solid gold |publisher=BBC News |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010[/tpl] Produced by Bertoni, Milano in Paderno Dugnano, it weighs 6.175 kg (13.6 lb) in total and depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory." It was first presented at the 1974 FIFA World Cup, to West German captain Franz Beckenbauer, followed by Argentina captain Daniel Passarella in 1978, Italy captain Dino Zoff in 1982, Argentina captain Diego Maradona in 1986, West Germany captain Lothar Matthäus in 1990, Brazil captain Carlos Dunga in 1994, France captain Didier Deschamps in 1998, Brazil captain Cafu in 2002, Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro in 2006 and Spain captain Iker Casillas in 2010.
The trophy has the visible engravement "FIFA World Cup" in outpouring letters at its base. The name of the country whose national team wins each tournament is engraved in the bottom side of the trophy, and therefore is not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The text states the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language, for example – "1974 Deutschland", "1994 Brasil". In 2010, however, the name of the winning nation was engraved "2010 Spain", in English, not in Spanish.[tpl]cite news |url=http://globotv.globo.com/rede-globo/jornal-da-globo/t/edicoes/v/taca-da-copa-do-mundo-chega-ao-brasil/3296190/ |title=Taça da Copa do Mundo chega ao Brasil (World Cup trophy arrives in Brazil) |publisher=Globo TV |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date=21 April 2014[/tpl] As of 2010, ten winners have been engraved on the base. It is not known whether FIFA will retire the trophy after they run out of space at the bottom; as recent images of the trophy show, there is space left for only four more engravings at the most, which means that should occur in 2030, when the tournament will celebrate its 100th anniversary. FIFA's regulations now state that the trophy, unlike its predecessor, cannot be won outright: the winners of the tournament receive a replica which is gold plated rather than solid gold.
