[[Weakly compact cardinal]]

CATEGORIES: Large cardinals

In mathematics, a weakly compact cardinal is a certain kind of cardinal number introduced by [tpl]harvtxt|Erdős|Tarski|1961[/tpl]; weakly compact cardinals are large cardinals, meaning that their existence can not be proven  from the standard axioms of set theory.
Formally, a cardinal κ is defined to be weakly compact if it is uncountable and for every function f: κ  2  → {0, 1} there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f.  In this context, κ  2  means the set of 2-element subsets of κ, and a subset S of κ is homogeneous for f if and only if either all of S2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to 1.
The name "weakly compact" refers to the fact that if a cardinal is weakly compact then a certain related infinitary language satisfies a version of the compactness theorem; see below. 
Weakly compact cardinals are Mahlo cardinals, and the set of Mahlo cardinals less than a given weakly compact cardinal is stationary.
Some authors use a weaker definition of weakly compact cardinals, such as one of the conditions below with the condition of inaccessibility dropped.

==Equivalent formulations==

The following are equivalent for any uncountable cardinal κ:
A language Lκ,κ is said to satisfy the weak compactness theorem if whenever Σ is a set of sentences of cardinality at most κ and every subset with less than κ elements has a model, then Σ has a model. Strongly compact cardinals are defined in a similar way without the restriction on the cardinality of the set of sentences.
