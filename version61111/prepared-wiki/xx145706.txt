In mathematics, a Bessel process, named after Friedrich Bessel, is a type of stochastic process.  The Bessel process of order n is the real-valued process X given by
where ||·|| denotes the Euclidean norm in Rn and W is an n-dimensional Wiener process (Brownian motion) started from the origin.
The n-dimensional Bessel process is the solution to the  stochastic differential equation
For n ≥ 2, the n-dimensional Wiener process is transient from its starting point: with probability one, Xt > 0 for all t > 0.  It is, however, neighbourhood-recurrent for n = 2, meaning that with probability 1, for any r > 0, there are arbitrarily large t with Xt  2, meaning that Xt ≥ r for all t sufficiently large.
A notation for the Bessel process of dimension ''n' started at zero is BES0(n).
0- and 2-dimensional Bessel processes are related to local times of Brownian motion via the Ray-Knight theorems.[tpl]cite book |first=D. |last=Revuz |first2=M. |last2=Yor |title=Continuous Martingales and Brownian Motion |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1999 |isbn=3-540-52167-4 [/tpl]
The law of a Brownian motion near x-extrema is the law of a 3-dimensional Bessel process (theorem of Tanaka).
