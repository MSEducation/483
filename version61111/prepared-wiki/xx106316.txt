==History==

The 143rd Infantry Brigade was originally formed in World War I as a part of the Territorial Army's 48th (South Midland) Division, and served with that Division in both world wars. A key precursor was the formation of the Warwickshire Brigade in 1906.
The Brigade was re-raised in 1984, moving to Shrewsbury in 1986.  It finally settled into its current formation in 1991, taking on responsibility for the Army in Shropshire, Staffordshire, Hereford and Worcester, Warwickshire and the West Midlands.  With the disbandment of 5th Division, 143 (West Midlands) Brigade came under the control of the new Support Command based in Aldershot, in April 2012.
The brigade will move to Donnington in 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shrewsburychronicle.com/2013/03/08/urgent-talks-over-copthorne-hq/|title=Urgent talks over Copthorne HQ|publisher=Shrewsbury Chronicle|accessdate=20 April 2014[/tpl]
