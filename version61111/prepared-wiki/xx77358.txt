==Career==

Brown notes that he was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beldenmusic.com/Good%20Eats.html|title=Good Eats Music|last=Belden|first=Patrick |accessdate=2008-06-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080626033356/http://beldenmusic.com/Good%20Eats.html| archivedate= June 26, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Profile: Alton Brown |year=2005 |url=http://www.neci.edu/profile_altonbrown.html |accessdate=2007-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928024458/http://www.neci.edu/profile_altonbrown.html |archivedate = September 28, 2007[/tpl] Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment ("unitaskers"), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gizmodo.com/5347140/alton-brown-kitchen-gadget-judgment-calls-+-yea-or-nay |title=Alton Brown: Kitchen Gadget Judgment Calls – Yea or Nay? |last=Rothman |first=Wilson |date=August 27, 2009 |publisher=Gizmodo |accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl]

Brown is a Christian. Brown says, "I'm not a spooky snake handler because I live in Georgia and I'm Christian, that I believe in the Bible, that I travel with the Bible, that I read the Bible every day. I'm still me. I'm still a guy doing a job. I find, actually, that people ask me a lot about it. I don't hit people over the head with the Bible ... I still feel a funny little tinge in my stomach when I'm out to dinner with my wife and daughter in New York. We'll go to dinner and we'll be sitting around the table and we'll say Grace. You know what? People are going to stare at you. I used to feel really self-conscious. But I've gotten to a point where I think, nah, I'm not going to feel bad about that. I'm not going to apologize about that."[tpl]cite web|author=September 28, 2010, by Joshua David Stein |url=http://eater.com/archives/2010/09/28/alton-brown-on-next-iron-chef-faith-vessel.php |title=Alton Brown on Being a Vessel, Next Iron Chef, and His Faith – Eaterrogation – Eater National |publisher=Eater.com |date=September 28, 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-23[/tpl]
