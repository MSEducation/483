==History==

The theatre company was founded by graduates of the Maly Theatre studio in 1925, and named after the great Russian actress Maria Yermolova, with her blessing. It started out like most theatres did back then: as a school at first, then a travelling company and eventually became a stationary company. It was one of Moscow's most popular dramatic theatres from 1940 to 1960.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.teatr.ru/th/theatre-info.asp?tw=1&iti=435&dt=20060117&tt=2 | title=Yermolova Theatre  | language=Russian |publisher =MoscowOut.Ru| accessdate=2008-11-20[/tpl]
