A graphics tablet or digitizer is a computer input device that enables a user to hand-draw images, animations and graphics, similar to the way a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the surface. Capturing data in this way, either by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes is called digitizing.
The device consists of a flat surface upon which the user may "draw" or trace an image using an attached stylus, a pen-like drawing apparatus. The image is displayed on the computer monitor, although some graphics tablets also have a screen.
Some tablets are intended as a replacement for the mouse as the primary pointing and navigation device for desktop computers.

==History==

The first electronic handwriting device was the Telautograph, patented by Elisha Gray in 1888.[tpl] citation | last = Gray | first = Elisha | title = Telautograph | publisher = United States Patent 386,815 | date = 1888-07-31 | url = [/tpl] Elisha Gray is best known as a contemporaneous inventor of the telephone to Alexander Graham Bell.
The first graphics tablet resembling contemporary tablets and used for handwriting recognition by a computer was the Stylator in 1957.[tpl] citation  | last = Dimond | first = Tom | title = Devices for reading handwritten characters | publisher = Proceedings of Eastern Joint Computer Conference | pages = 232–237 | date = 1957-12-01 | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1457765 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 [/tpl] Better known (and often misstated as the first digitizer tablet) is the RAND Tablethttp://sophia.javeriana.edu.co/~ochavarr/computer_graphics_history/historia/ also known as the Grafacon[tpl] citation  | last = Engelbart | first = Douglas C. | title = Display-Selection Techniques for Text Manipulation | publisher = IEEE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics | pages = 5–15 | date = March 1967 | url = http://dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-133184.html#2 | accessdate = 2013-03-26 [/tpl] (for Graphic Converter), introduced in 1964. The RAND Tablet employed a grid of wires under the surface of the pad that encoded horizontal and vertical coordinates in a small magnetic signal. The stylus would receive the magnetic signal, which could then be decoded back as coordinate information.
The acoustic tablet, or spark tablet, used a stylus that generated clicks with a spark plug. The clicks were then triangulated by a series of microphones to locate the pen in space.[tpl] citation | title = Spark Pen | last = Whetstone | first = A. | publisher = Science Accessories Corporation: United States Patent 3,626,483 | date = 1971-12-07 | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US3626483 | accessdate = 2009-11-16[/tpl] The system was fairly complex and expensive, and the sensors were susceptible to interference by external noise.
Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems as well as bundled with PC's and PC based CAD software like AutoCAD.
Summagraphics also made an OEM version of its BitPad which was sold by Apple Computer as the Apple Graphics Tablet accessory to their Apple II. These tablets used a magnetostriction technology which used wires made of a special alloy stretched over a solid substrate to accurately locate the tip of a stylus or the center of a digitizer cursor on the surface of the tablet. This technology also allowed Proximity or "Z" axis measurement.
The first home computer graphics tablet was the KoalaPad. Though originally designed for the Apple II, the Koala eventually broadened its applicability to practically all home computers with graphics support, examples of which include the TRS-80 Color Computer, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit family. Competing tablets were eventually produced; the tablets produced by Atari were generally considered to be of high quality.
In 1981, musician Todd Rundgren created the first color graphics tablet software for personal computers, which was licensed to Apple as the Utopia Graphics Tablet System.[tpl]cite news|last=Mackintosh|first=Hamish|title=Talk time: Todd Rundgren|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2004/mar/18/onlinesupplement|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 March 2004[/tpl]
In the 1980s, several vendors of graphics tablets began to include additional functions, such as handwriting recognition and on-tablet menus.[tpl] citation | title = Pencept Penpad (TM) Manual | publisher = Pencept, Inc. | date = 1983-06-15 | url = http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio83.html#Pencept83 [/tpl][tpl] citation | title = SAC GP-10 Two-dimensional Sonic Digitizer | publisher = Science Accessories Corporation | date = 1988-06-15 | url = http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio85.html#SAC85 [/tpl]

==Operation==

There have been many attempts to categorize the technologies that have been used for graphics tablets:
For all these technologies, the tablet can use the received signal to also determine the distance of the stylus from the surface of the tablet, the tilt (angle from vertical) of the stylus, and other information in addition to the horizontal and vertical positions, such as clicking buttons of the stylus or the rotation of the stylus.
Compared to touchscreens, a graphics tablet generally offers much higher precision, the ability to track an object which is not touching the tablet, and can gather much more information about the stylus, but is typically more expensive, and can only be used with the special stylus or other accessories.
Some tablets, especially inexpensive ones aimed at young children, come with a corded stylus, using technology similar to older RAND tablets.

==Styluses==

===Puck===

After styluses, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. This is opposed to mice, which can only sense their relative velocity on a surface (most tablet drivers are capable of allowing a puck to emulate a mouse in operation, and many pucks are marketed as "mice".) Pucks range in size and shape, some are externally indistinguishable from a mouse, while others are fairly large device with dozens of buttons and controls. Professional pucks often have a reticle or loupe which allows the user to see the exact point on the tablet's surface targeted by the puck, for detailed tracing and computer aided design (CAD) work.

==Embedded LCD tablets==

Some graphics tablets incorporate an LCD into the tablet itself, allowing the user to draw directly on the display surface.
Graphics tablet/screen hybrids offer advantages over both touch screens and ordinary tablets. Unlike touch screens, they offer pressure sensitivity, and their resolution is generally higher.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] While their pressure sensitivity and resolution are typically no better than those of ordinary tablets, they offer the additional advantage of directly seeing the location of the physical pen device relatively to the image on the screen. This often allows for increased accuracy and a more tactile, "real" feeling to the use of the device.
Wacom holds many patents on the key technologies for graphic tablets,Wacom Co., Ltd. Patents. Patentgenius.com.

For instance, the Wacom Cintiq series ranges from just below [tpl]US$|1000[/tpl] to over [tpl]US$|2000[/tpl].
Some commercially available graphics tablet-screen hybrids include:

==Uses==

Graphics tablets, because of their stylus-based interface and ability to detect some or all of pressure, tilt, and other attributes of the stylus and its interaction with the tablet, are widely considered[tpl]according to whom|date=September 2012[/tpl] to offer a very natural way to create computer graphics, especially two-dimensional computer graphics. Indeed, many graphics packages can make use of the pressure (and, sometimes, stylus tilt or rotation) information generated by a tablet, by modifying the brush size, shape, opacity, color, or other attributes based on data received from the graphics tablet.
In East Asia, graphics tablets, known as "pen tablets", are widely used in conjunction with input-method editor software (IMEs) to write Chinese, Japanese, Korean characters (CJK). The technology is popular and inexpensive and offers a method for interacting with the computer in a more natural way than typing on the keyboard, with the pen tablet supplanting the role of the computer mouse. Uptake of handwriting recognition among users who use alphabetic scripts has been slower.
Graphics tablets are also very commonly found in the artistic world. Using a pen on a graphics tablet combined with a graphics-editing program, such as Adobe Photoshop, gives artists a lot of precision while creating digital drawings. Photographers can also find working with a graphics tablet during their post processing can really speed up tasks like creating a detailed layer mask or dodging and burning.
Educators make use of tablets in classrooms to project handwritten notes or lessons and to allow students to do the same, as well as providing feedback on student work submitted electronically. Online teachers may also use a tablet for marking student work, or for live tutorials or lessons, especially where complex visual information or mathematical equations are required.
Tablets are also popular for technical drawings and CAD, as one can typically put a piece of paper on them without interfering with their function.
Finally, tablets are gaining popularity as a replacement for the computer mouse as a pointing device.[tpl]when|date=September 2012[/tpl] They can feel more intuitive to some users than a mouse, as the position of a pen on a tablet typically corresponds to the location of the pointer on the GUI shown on the computer screen. Those artists using a pen for graphics work will as a matter of convenience use a tablet and pen for standard computer operations rather than put down the pen and find a mouse.
Graphics tablets are available in various sizes and price ranges; A6-sized tablets being relatively inexpensive and A3-sized tablets far more expensive. Modern tablets usually connect to the computer via a USB interface.

Interactive whiteboards offer high resolution wall size graphic tablets up to 95" along with options for pressure and multiple input. These are becoming commonplace in schools and meeting rooms around the world.Interactive Produts. DTC Worldwide. Retrieved on 2013-12-09.
Touch screens like those found on some tablet computers, iPads, and the Nintendo DS are operated in similar ways, but they usually use either optical grids or a pressure-sensitive film instead, and therefore they do not need a special pointing device.
The graphics tablet are also used for Audio Haptic products where blind or visually impaired people touch swelled graphics on a graphic tablet and get audio feedback from that.[tpl] cite news | url = http://www.axistive.com/audio-haptics-for-visually-impaired-information-technology.html | last = Aaron Marks | title = Audio Haptics for Visually Impaired Information Technology | publisher = Axistive | date = 2006-11-17 [/tpl] The product that is using this technology is called Tactile Talking Tablet or T3.

==Possible radiation==

As noted above, some tablets use slight electromagnetic radiation both to "communicate" with the pen and—in newer cordless-, battery-free pen models—to charge it as well. Although this radiation usually falls in or near the low frequency range (well below that emitted by mobile phones, for example),  some users are concerned about the possible health side effects of the extended exposure to such radiation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://graphicssoft.about.com/b/2006/11/01/wacom-radiation.htm |title=Wacom Radiation? |publisher=Graphicssoft.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/10230117 |title=Warning about prolonged EMF exposure. |publisher=Digital Photography Review forums |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/hardware/19428-electromagnetic-pollution-caused-tablets.html |title=Electromagnetic pollution caused by tablets |publisher=TabletPC Reviews forum |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.penciljack.com/forum/showthread.php?117629-Question-about-Wacom-Tablets |title=Question about Wacom Tablets.. |publisher=Penciljack forum |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26[/tpl]
