USS ''Jimmy Carter'' (SSN-23), the third and last Seawolf-class submarine.

==Ship history==

The contract to build Carter was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 29 June 1996, and her keel was laid on 5 December 1998. Original schedules called for Carter to be commissioned in late 2001 or early 2002, but on 10 December 1999, Electric Boat was awarded a US$887 million extension to the Carter contract to modify the boat for highly classified missions and testing of new submarine systems, missions previously carried out by [tpl]USS|Parche|SSN-683[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | last = Zimmerman | first = W.

The ship sponsor was former First Lady Rosalynn Carter.
Carter is roughly 100 feet (30 m) longer than the other two ships of her class.  This is due to the insertion of a plug (additional section) known as the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), which allows launch and recovery of ROVs and Navy SEAL forces. The plug features a fairing over a wasp-waist shaped passageway allowing crew to pass between the fore and aft sections of the hull while providing a space to store ROVs and special equipment that may need to launch and recover from the submarine.[tpl]cite journal | last = Davis, USN | first = RADM John P. | title = USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23): Expanding Future SSN Missions | url = http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_5/ussjimmycarter.html | journal = Undersea Warfare | volume = 2 | issue = 1 |date=Fall 1999 | publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-30 [/tpl] 
Carter has additional maneuvering devices fitted fore and aft that will allow her to keep station over selected targets in odd currents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] Past submarines outfitted this way[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=Unsourced.

Intelligence experts speculate that the MMP may find use in similar missions as an underwater splicing chamber for fiber optic cables.[tpl]cite news | title = New Nuclear Sub Is Said to Have Special Eavesdropping Ability | agency = Associated Press |work=The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | date = 20 February 2005 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/20submarine.html | accessdate = 2009-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Zorpette | first = Glenn |date=Jan 2002 | title = Making Intelligence Smarter | journal = IEEE Spectrum | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 38â€“43 | publisher = IEEE | issn = 0018-9235 | doi = 10.1109/6.975021 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/6/21038/975021/975021.html | accessdate = 2009-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Neil Jr.  | title = Spy agency taps into undersea cable | work = ZDNet News | publisher = CBS Interactive | date = 23 May 2001 | url = http://www.zdnet.com/news/spy-agency-taps-into-undersea-cable/115877 | accessdate = 2009-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Jimmy Carter: Super Spy? | publisher = Defensetech.org | date = 21 February 2005 | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070203165457/http://www.defensetech.org/archives/001397.html | accessdate = 2009-06-30[/tpl]
On 24 January 2004 Commander David Bartholomew Jr., commanding officer of PCU (Pre-Commissioning Unit) Jimmy Carter was relieved of command because of a "loss of confidence" in his ability "pending further administrative or disciplinary action as appropriate."
Captain Robert D. Kelso, deputy chief of staff of Submarine Development Squadron 12 at Naval Submarine Base New London, took temporary command of the PCU until a new commanding officer could be named.
On 19 November 2004 Jimmy Carter completed alpha sea trials, her first voyage in the open seas. On 22 December, Electric Boat delivered Jimmy Carter to the US Navy, and she was commissioned 19 February 2005 at NSB New London.
Jimmy Carter began a transit from NSB New London to its new homeport at the Bangor Annex of Naval Base Kitsap, Washington on 14 October 2005 but was forced to return when an unusually high wave caused damage while the submarine was running on the surface.  The damage was repaired and Carter left New London the following day, arriving at Bangor the afternoon of 9 November 2005.
On 16 June 2006 Commander David Honabach took command from Captain Kelso.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.northwestnavigator.com/index.php/navigator/kitsap/uss_jimmy_carter_gets_a_new_boss/|title= USS Jimmy Carter gets a new boss|first= MC1 Mary|last= Popejoy|date= 16 June 2006|work= The Northwest Navigator |publisher= Sound Publishing, Inc|accessdate= 2008-06-18 [/tpl]
