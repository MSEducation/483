Anthony Alexander Jarrett (born 13 August 1968 in Enfield, London) is a former sprint and hurdling athlete from England. He was a silver medalist in the 110 metres hurdles at the World Championships in 1993 and 1995, and at the European Championships in 1990, and won the gold medal in the event at the Commonwealth Games in 1998. 
Jarrett came 4th in the 110m hurdles at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, missing out on a bronze medal by 1000th of a second to Jack Pierce of the USA. He again narrowly missed out on an Olympic medal when he was a member of the 4 x 100m sprint relay team that also finished 4th in the Olympic final of that year. Four years earlier in 1988 he finished in 6th place in the 110m hurdles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
Jarrett's career was overshadowed by the achievements of fellow Briton Colin Jackson, who beat him into second place on numerous occasions at major competitions such as the World Championships, Commonwealth Games (twice), European Championships and Goodwill Games. Jackson also defeated Jarrett eight times at the national championships. In all Jarrett won two individual world silver medals and one individual bronze medal in the 110m hurdles, and another silver and bronze medal in the 4 x 100m sprint relay.
Jarrett was disqualified for false starts at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the first round, and in the semi-finals of the 2001 World Championships, events from which he appeared never to recover. 
Jarrett's personal best time for the 110m hurdles is 13.00 seconds, set when he finished as runner-up to Jackson at the 1993 World Championships.
