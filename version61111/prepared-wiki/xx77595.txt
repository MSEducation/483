==Synopsis==

The show takes place on the fictional planet of Eternia, a planet of magic, myth and fantasy. The show's lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia's rulers, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Whenever Prince Adam uses the Sword of Power, and when he holds it aloft and says the magic words "By the Power of Grayskull, I HAVE THE POWER" he is endowed with fabulous secret powers and transformed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. Together with his close allies, Battle Cat (who undergoes a similar transformation from being Adam's cowardly pet tiger Cringer), The Sorceress, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of Skeletor. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If he succeeds, Skeletor would rule Eternia and possibly the whole universe.

==Production history==

The Mattel company developed the original He-Man action figure in 1981; the franchise backstory was conceived by the Filmation animation studio.  Some time after, both firms pitched the idea to the ABC network, who turned it down.  The resulting series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, debuted through barter syndication in September 1983,[tpl]#tag:ref|In the practice of barter syndication, production companies give television stations a series for free, in exchange for advertising.[tpl]cite book|last=Engelhardt|first=Tom|editor1-last=Gitlin|editor1-first=Todd|title=Watching Television: A Pantheon Guide to Popular Culture|chapter=Children's Television: The Shortcake Strategy|pages=76–77|isbn=0-394-74651-1|year=1986|accessdate=September 3, 2010|publisher=Pantheon Books (Random House)[/tpl]|group=nb[/tpl] and became the first syndicated show to be based on a toy.  By 1984, it was seen on 120 U.S. stations and in more than 30 countries.
Despite the limited animation techniques that were used to produce the series, He-Man was notable for breaking the boundaries of censorship that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children's TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time in years, a cartoon series could feature a muscular superhero who was actually allowed to hit people (although he more typically used wrestling-style moves rather than actually punching enemies), though he still could not use his sword often; more often than not He-Man opted to pick up his opponents and toss them away rather than hit them. The cartoon was controversial in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys; advertising to children was itself controversial during this period. In the United Kingdom, advertising regulations forbade commercials for He-Man toys to accompany the program itself. In similar fashion to other shows at the time: notably G.I. Joe, an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by this controversy was made by including a "life lesson" or "moral of the story" at the end of each episode. This moral was usually directly tied to the action or central theme of that episode.[tpl]cite news|title= Video: A He-Man for All Seasons|work= Time|date=1985-01-07|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956236,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03[/tpl]
The show was so successful that it spawned a spin-off series, She-Ra: Princess of Power following the adventures of He-Man's sister.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/remembering-ishe-rai-and-ihe-mani-interview-lou-scheimer|title= Remembering She-Ra and He-Man: Interview with Lou Scheimer|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work= Animation World Network |publisher= |date= [/tpl] Mattel's subsequent attempts to relaunch the He-Man toy line have also led to the short-lived sequel series The New Adventures of He-Man in the early 1990s, and an update of the series for a contemporary audience in 2002.[tpl]cite news|title= On the Tube: Cartoon Network brings He-Man, the Masters back for 20th anniversary |work= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=2002-08-16|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20020816owen0816fnp4.asp|accessdate=2010-03-05 | first=Rob | last=Owen[/tpl]
It is also noted for featuring early script-writing work from J. Michael Straczynski, later the creator of Babylon 5; Paul Dini and Brynne Stephens, both of whom who would go on to write acclaimed episodes of Batman: The Animated Series; Beast Wars story editor Larry DiTillio; and David Wise, later the head-writer of the TV version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/659/659754p1.html |title= He-Man and the Masters of the Universe — Season One, Volume One|accessdate=2008-06-25 |work=IGN  |publisher= |date= 2008-05-11[/tpl]

==Reception==

He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is considered the most successful animated series ever made by Filmation. The show was often criticized by parent groups as a cartoon designed to advertise action figures.[tpl]cite news|title= THE MEDIA BUSINESS; F.C.C.

The pilot episode, "Diamond Ray of Disappearance", has a minute or so of footage missing due to the master tapes being damaged. In the original version, after teleporting the King and Queen and Man-At-Arms away to another dimension, Skeletor turns the ray onto Orko, who gets stuck inside a vase which deflects the beam. Orko escapes to warn He-Man. This footage has not been lost; it is still existent on other media in circulation. However, complications over the rights to it prevented it from being inserted back into the DVD release.
