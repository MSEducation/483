The Fuji-Cup was a German football competition held during the summer break from 1986 to 1996 immediately prior to the kick-off the Fu√üball-Bundesliga season. The competition featured four leading teams, playing two semi-finals and a final in a generally more provincial area of the country. Nowadays there is a similar competition named LIGA total! Cup.
The competition competed with the DFB-Supercup although ultimately the two competitions were replaced by the DFB-Ligapokal.
