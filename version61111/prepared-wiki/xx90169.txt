Mount Hubbard is one of the major mountains of the Saint Elias Range. It is located on the Alaska/Yukon border; the Canadian side is within Kluane National Park and Reserve, and the American side is part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The mountain was named in 1890 by USGS geologist Israel Russell after Gardiner Greene Hubbard, first president of the National Geographic Society, which had co-sponsored Russell's expedition.
Hubbard is the highest point of a large massif with three named summits; the other two are Mount Alverstone and Mount Kennedy. Alverstone and Hubbard form a corner of the U.S.-Canadian border: the border extends roughly south from these peaks toward the Alaska panhandle, and roughly west toward Mount Saint Elias, approximately [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] away. The Hubbard Glacier separates Mount Hubbard from Mount Vancouver to the west, while the Lowell Glacier lies to the east of the peak.
Mount Hubbard is the eighth highest peak in the United States, and the twelfth highest peak in Canada[tpl]ref|prom[/tpl]. It is also notable for its large rise above local terrain. For example, its west face rises 7,500 feet (2,286 m) above the Alverstone Glacier in less than 2 miles (3.2 km), and the peak rises [tpl]convert|11000|ft|m|-1[/tpl] above the Hubbard Glacier to the southwest in only [tpl]convert|7|mi|km|1|abbr=on[/tpl]. Mount Hubbard is just over [tpl]convert|20|mi|km|0|abbr=pon[/tpl] from tidewater at Disenchantment Bay. However, despite its precipitous drops to the west, the eastern side provides a nontechnical (though long) route to the summit.
