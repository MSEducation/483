[tpl]nihongo|Super Bomberman 4|スーパーボンバーマン４|Sūpā Bonbāman Fō[/tpl] is a multiplayer action-party video game, developed by Produce and published by Hudson Soft for the Super Family Computer, released on April 26, 1996 exclusively in Japan. It is the fourth installment of the Super Bomberman franchise for the console.
The story begins at an unknown time after Super Bomberman 3. Bagular's brain escaped the explosion of his flying saucer and has summoned the Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber to get revenge on White and Black Bomber. The two, along with other fellow Bombermen, are sent hurtling back in time to fight through different eras and ultimately stop Bagular.

==Gameplay==

Super Bomberman 4 is an action game in which players lay bombs to destroy enemies or other bombermen. Other than laying bombs, the game includes a number of power-ups, which allows players to increase the range of a bomb's explosion, punch or kick bombs already on the ground, or pick them up and throw them at another player. The explosions of the bombs can harm anyone on the field, including the bombermen who left the bomb in the first place. There are two game modes, Normal Game (the campaign, which can be played with two players), and the Battle Game, which has three separate modes.
New to the game are a wide range of creatures which are enemies to the player, but when defeated, they turn into eggs. When the player picks an egg, they can use the creatures, which come in two types, organic and mechanical. Players can pick additional eggs to store more creatures, but only of the same type of creature that they are riding.
Certain stages contain cages with trapped allies inside. When freed, allies move around the stages mostly destroying the soft blocks. Stages also have secret warps which transport the player to a number of bonus stages. This warps can only be accessed when two players play the game together, and one player, using the Power Glove item, tosses the other player to the warp.

===Normal Game===

Normal Game returns to the objective of the original game, with Bomberman needing to defeat all enemies to reveal the goal. Normal Game features five worlds, each with eight levels. Bomberman will face the Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber in the seventh level of each world, then face the world's boss at the eighth level. When a world is cleared, the player may revisit it. Levels may also be revisited via passwords.

===Battle Game===

The Battle Game has three modes. Battle Royale is the classic Bomberman battle mode, in which a maximum of five players (human-controlled or CPU) can play against each other, or divide themselves in two teams. Bombermen that are controlled by the CPU can have three different difficulty levels. Revenge carts can be enabled, and a bonus game, where the winner of a single match participates on a race to get an item, can also be enabled. The battle mode has ten stages, which can be changed using two different passwords.
Champion Mode allows a max of two players to face the Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber in order for three rounds. The credits will appear when the player defeats the Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber.
Maniac Mode allows players to customize their own match with a number of options. Players can edit how and which items will appear on the battlefield and how many hits they can take before being defeated. However, players cannot make teams, change the timer, rounds, or stages, and are instead forced to play on the normal battle stage, with three rounds and three minutes.
In Battle Game, the player can choose to play as Bomberman, the Four Bomber Kings, and Great Bomber. The Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber each have a unique ability. Bazooka Bomber, Jet Bomber, and Great Bomber, however, will have their speed, number of bombs, and the range of their explosions decreased for ten seconds after using their abilities. Bomberman also has a unique ability that allows him to stop other Bombermen from grabbing or pushing him.

==Synopsis==

===Characters===

During the Normal Game, the first player controls the White Bomber, the hero of the game and the Bomberman series as a whole. Full of cheerful spirit, and with a sense of justice, but his weak point is that he is competitive and reckless. The second player controls the Black Bomber, White Bomber's reformed ally and rival. A mischievous individual who leads his own gang of Bombers, which include Red Bomber, Blue Bomber, Green Bomber and Yellow Bomber. Red Bomber, Blue Bomber, and Green Bomber appear in the Battle Game, controlled by the third, fourth, and fifth player, respectively.
White and Black Bomber are after the Great Bomber and his Four Bomber Kings. Great Bomber's special ability is invisibility. The Four Bomber Kings are Bazooka Bomber, who is equipped with a bazooka connected to his backpack, which acts more like a flame thrower. Jet Bomber, who flies using the jet-pack attached to his back, which can destroy anyone who steps in the ignition flames behind him. Lady Bomber, the female member of the Four Bomber Kings who uses three missile bits to fire lasers that scatter two power-ups from any bombermen she hits.
And Hammer Bomber, who is equipped with a spiky, extendable morning star, which scatters two items when it hits other bombermen.
Great Bomber and the Four Bomber Kings are led by the Bagular Head. Bagular perished in Super Bomberman 3, but his brain managed to escape.

===Story===

After pursuing and eventually destroying Bagular, White Bomber enjoyed a moment of rest with Black Bomber and his friends while returning home on a space shuttle. All passengers are unaware that four lights approach the shuttle, and they eventually collide with the ship. This creates a time hole in space that transports White and Black Bomber to the prehistoric age. There, White Bomber meets Great Bomber, who following the late Bagular's will, is leading the Four Bomber Kings on an operation through time to capture him and his friends. White Bomber and Black Bomber must battle through time to foil Bagular's plan.

==Development==

===Audio===

The music of the game was composed by Jun Chikuma. The game reuses music from other installments in the series. The map screen music from Bomberman '93 is used in the map screen of the game, and the first world, final world, and final boss music from Bomberman '94 is used in the first world, fifth world, and final boss of the game, respectively. The battle menu theme is taken from Super Bomberman 3, as is the battle game music.
