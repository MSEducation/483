The Úrvalsdeild karla ([tpl]IPA-is|ˈurvalsˌteilt ˈkʰartla[/tpl], Men's Select Division) is the top tier of the Icelandic football pyramid.  Because of the harsh winters in Iceland, it is generally played in the spring and summer (May to September). It is run by the Football Association of Iceland (KSI) and currently comprises 12 clubs. At the end of the 2012-2013 European season, UEFA ranked the league 40th in Europe.UEFA Country Ranking 2009 Bert Kassies' site, accessed 12 February 2009 From 27 April 2009, the Úrvalsdeild have been known as Pepsi-deildin (Engl. "The Pepsi League") after KSÍ and Ölgerðin (the producers of Pepsi in Iceland) signed a three-year sponsorship contract.Pepsi-deildin í knattspyrnu 2009 KSÍ's official site, accessed 28 April 2009
The top division consists of 12 clubs. Each club faces every other club twice during the season, once at home and once away. At the end of each season, the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated to the second level of the Icelandic league system, the 1. deild karla (First Division), with the top two clubs of the First Division automatically promoted to the Úrvalsdeild.
For the first time in the competition's history, the 2008 season saw 12 teams compete in the premier division, a part of KSI's attempt to strengthen Icelandic football.
Therefore, only one team were relegated in the 2007 season and three clubs were promoted from the First Division.
KR hold the most titles, with 26. Valur is next with 20, and ÍA and Fram Reykjavík follow with 18 each. The current champions of Iceland are KR.

===Championship History===

Only 10 teams in 96 years have won the Icelandic league title. Breiðablik UBK are the most recent to join the list, winning their first title in 2010. KR has won the most titles. They have been Iceland's champions 26 times.
As can be expected, the league has been dominated by teams from the Greater Reykjavik Area which contains nearly two thirds of Iceland's population. Only four teams from outside the GRA have ever won the league (ÍBK, ÍA, ÍBV and KA) – and among those teams, ÍBV and KA (who have won a combined four titles) are the only teams located more than an hour's drive from Reykjavík to have won the league.
