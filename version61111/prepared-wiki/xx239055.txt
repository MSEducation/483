 Carver Elementary School

Carver Elementary School is a comprehensive public elementary school in Henry County, Virginia. Named for the African American agriculturist, chemist, inventor, and educator, George Washington Carver, the school is located approximately five miles northwest of the city of Martinsville, Virginia. Carver Elementary enrolls approximately 500 students in grades PK-5. It is one of 11 comprehensive elementary schools operated by Henry County Schools. 
The campus consists of a [tpl]convert|86000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] building situated on a [tpl]convert|24.75|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] tract of land.http://www.martinsville.com/userdocs/FiscalCapacityand%20FacilitiesPart2.pdf Owing to the building's history as a high school, the school features a large gym, auditorium, and athletic facilities not commonly found at elementary schools. Substantial renovations were completed as part of the elementary school conversion in 2004, including reconfiguration of science labs and vocational shops to serve as classrooms.
Carver is the largest of the Henry County elementary schools and unique in that its student body feeds into both Fieldale-Collinsville Middle School and Laurel Park Middle School.

==History==

The building that houses Carver Elementary School opened as George Washington Carver High School in 1950. It was the lone high school for the African American community of Henry County. In 1967, the faculty of the school became integrated, and in 1971, the student body was integrated. With the opening of Magna Vista High School in 1988, George Washington Carver High School became George Washington Carver Middle School.
Declining enrollment in the 1990s left each of the four Henry County high schools operating at less than 50% capacity, and long-term deferred maintenance left many schools in a state of disrepair.http://www.martinsville.com/userdocs/FiscalCapacityand%20FacilitiesPart2.pdf In 2004, the county implemented a controversial reorganization plan which closed five schools and  consolidated four high schools and four middle schools to create two high schools and two middle schools. As part of the reorganization, G.W. Carver Middle School was consolidated with John D. Bassett Middle School to form Fieldale-Collinsville Middle School. Spencer-Penn Elementary School and Fieldale Elementary School were closed and consolidated to form Carver Elementary School.
