Edward J Grug III (born 29 May 1980) is the pen name of Robert Forrest, an Australian cartoonist and comic writer: he takes his pseudonym from Grug, the main character in a series of children's books by Ted Prior.  He lives in Perth, Western Australia.
Grug's comics have appeared in Australian small press anthologies such as The Ink, Dreams of Tomorrow, and Something Wicked, but he is best known for his webcomics.  He is the artist for "The Bizarre Life of Charlie Red-Eye," appearing at Modern Tales, and creates "If Nobody's Likes Me, Why am I So Popular?", a collection of fiction and non-fiction comics posted to his Livejournal as part of the Daily Grind Iron Man Challenge.  His fiction comics tend to feature cute creatures involved in existential crises of various levels of severity while his non-fiction comics focus on his life and thoughts.
He is a proponent of the 24-hour comic as well and has participated in the 24 Hours in Oz Comics Challenge since 2003.  His entry for 24 Hour Comics Day 2006 was chosen as one of the 10 printed in that year's collection, edited by Nat Gertler.
He was the regular artist on the 5-day-a-week series Sketchies, written by T Campbell and Phil Kahn.
His artwork appeared on the cover of The Holy Sea's 2008 album A Beginner's Guide to the Sea.
His story, Fertile Grounds, appeared in Tango Six, and was republished in the 2009 book The Tango Collection published by Allen & Unwin, edited by Bernard Caleo.
