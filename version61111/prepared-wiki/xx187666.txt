Squid is a popular food in many parts of the world.
In many of the languages around the Mediterranean sea, squid are referred to by a term related to the Italian "calamari" (singular "calamaro"), which in English has become a culinary name for Mediterranean dishes involving squid, especially fried squid (fried calamari).[tpl]cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/calamari|title=Definition of calamari|publisher=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary[/tpl]

==Fried squid==

Fried squid (fried calamari, calamari) is a dish in Mediterranean cuisine. It consists of batter-coated, deep fried squid, fried for less than two minutes to prevent toughness. It is served plain, with salt and lemon on the side.
In North America, it is a staple in seafood restaurants. It is served as an appetizer, garnished with parsley, or sprinkled with parmesan cheese. It is served with dips: peppercorn mayonnaise, tzatziki, or in the United States, marinara sauce, tartar sauce, or cocktail sauce. In Mexico it is served with Tabasco sauce or habanero. Other dips, such as ketchup, aioli, and olive oil are used. In Turkey it is served with tarator sauce. Like many seafood dishes, it may be served with a slice of lemon.
In South Africa, Australia and New Zealand fried calamari is popular in fish and chip shops; imitation calamari of white fish may also be used. When offered for sale as whole fresh animals, the term Calamari should only be used to describe the Northern and Southern Calamari (Sepioteuthis spp.), however once prepared as food it is common to apply the term calamari to any squid species and even cuttlefish.

==Squid preparation==

The body (mantle) can be stuffed whole, cut into flat pieces or sliced into rings. The arms, tentacles and ink are edible; the only parts of the squid that are not eaten are its beak and gladius (pen).

==Name==

The word Calamari is the plural form of the Italian word for squid, Calamaro.
Also known as Kalamari (Greek), Kalamar (Turkish), Calmar (French), Kalmari (Finnish), Calamar (Spanish), the name derives from the Late Latin word calamarium for "ink pot", after the inky fluid that squid secrete. Calamarium in turn derives from Greek kalamos (κάλαμος) meaning "reed," "tube" or "pen".calamari. The Free Dictionary.
