==Career==

===Film===

McCormack's first notable role was as the character Murron MacClannough in the multiple Academy Award winning film Braveheart. Her screen debut however was as the lead in the Anna Campion directed film Loaded, and she has subsequently stated that she had a "miserable time with the director (Anna Campion)... it was my first film job, I needed to be mollycoddled, I needed to be helped through it, and I wasn't. Mostly, it was a horrible experience." After Braveheart, McCormack had lead roles in Nils Gaup's Northstar and Marshall Herskovitz's Dangerous Beauty. Other films include Spy Game and 28 Weeks Later. Despite being in demand, she does few films, stating that "I read very few scripts I'm passionate about... Maybe one in every twenty or thirty."Blackwelder, Rob.
