Shane Geoghegan (7 March 1980 – 9 November 2008) was a rugby player for Garryowen who was shot and killed in a case of mistaken identity as part of a gang feud in Dooradoyle, a suburb in the city of Limerick, Ireland. The murder took place in the early hours of Sunday morning, 9 November 2008. He had no links with organised crime gangs.

==Background to the crime==

===The victim===

Shane Geoghegan was a 28-year-old native of Limerick City. He worked for Air Atlanta as an aircraft fitter and was a keen rugby fan, playing as prop with Garryowen and was captain of their third team and had a girlfriend – Jenna Barry. He was described as "A nice, decent guy who was well respected by young and old alike" by the secretary of his rugby club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article5133965.ece|title=Rugby captain Shane Geoghegan shot dead in drugs feud 'mistake'|author=David Sharrock|work=The Times|date=1 November 2008|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] It is believed that he bore a resemblance to a drug dealer called John McNamara,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sundayworld.com/columnists/?aid=995|title=Streets of Terror|author=Paul Williams|work=Sunday World|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] who was the target of a contract killing and lived nearby.

===Limerick criminal gang feud===

The murder was linked to the ongoing Limerick feud between rival criminal gangs and their battle to control drug supplies in Limerick. At least 13 people had been murdered in a turf war between the McCarthy-Dundon and Keane-Collopy gangs. There have also been cases of abductions and torture.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7733370.stm|title=Anger erupts over Limerick murder|publisher=BBC News|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl]

==The crime==

Shane watched the Ireland v Canada rugby international with friends on Saturday night.  He then walked home through the Kilteragh housing estate in Dooradoyle at 1.30am. He was gunned down when up to 15 shots were fired at him. Shane managed to run to the rear of a house in Clonmore, where he was hit three times in the upper body and once in the head. Members of the recently established Emergency Support Unit were the first at the scene after a 999 call was made from concerned residents who heard the sound of gunshots. A burnt-out getaway vehicle was found nearby.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/Shock-in-Limerick-at-horrific.4676883.jp|title=Shock in Limerick at horrific case of mistaken identity|author=Petula Martyn|work=Limerick Leader|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl]

==Investigation and trial==

Up to 200 Gardaí worked on the murder enquiry, with 50 officers dedicated to the case on a daily basis.  Searches were carried out resulting in seizures of handguns, ammunition and drugs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.limericknewswire.com/2008/11/|title=Firearms found at Southside industrial estate|publisher=Limericknewswire.com|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] One of the leaders of the McCarthy-Dundon crime family handed himself in to Gardaí in the week following the shooting out of fear of being murdered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/gardai-stunned-as-gang-boss-dundon-hands-himself-in-1537767.html|author=Ian Mallon|title=Gardaí stunned as gang boss Dundon hands himself in|publisher=Evening Herald|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] During the investigation, some of the suspects were tracked via their Bebo pages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2008/nov/23/geoghegan-killers-driver-reveals-all-on-bebo-page/|title=Geoghegan killer's driver reveals all on Bebo page|work=The Sunday Tribune|date=23 November 2008|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] Social networking sites were identified as a problem in glorifying gun crime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/apr/19/can-anything-save-limerick-now/|title=Can anything save Limerick now?|author=Ali Bracken and Justine McCarthy|work=The Sunday Tribune|date=19 April 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] In March 2009, Gardaí arrested 15 people in connection with the shooting.
Twenty-three-year-old Barry Doyle from Portland Row, Dublin but living in Limerick was subsequently charged with the murder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.limerickindependent.com/local-news/local-news/garda%ED-widen-the-net-in-hunt-for-killers-of-shane-geoghegan/|title=Garda widen the net in hunt for killers of Shane Geoghegan|author=David Raleigh|publisher=Limerick Independent|date=4 March 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] He was put on trial in the Central Criminal Court in February 2011. Doyle was believed to be working on behalf of the McCarthy-Dundon gang and allegedly shot Geoghegan in a case of mistaken identity, thinking he was a criminal linked to the Keane-Callopy gang.
The trial of Barry Doyle resulted in a hung jury after one of the longest deliberation in Irish legal history.  Due to the fact that according to his defence counsel Martin O'Rourke SC, his confession was due to threats and inducements made while in custody.  On 15 February 2012, following a re-trial, Barry Doyle was convicted of the murder of Shane Geoghegan, in which he pleaded not guilty.  The jury of three women and eight men returned a unanimous guilty verdict, after deliberating for six hours.
Justice Garrett Sheehan imposed a life sentence on Doyle, then a 26-year-old father-of-three. "There is only one sentence this court can impose and that's life in prison,” he said.  He thanked the jury for their dedicated service and the "careful attention" they gave the case, and excluded them from jury duty for five years.
Gardai continue to pursue their investigations into this case and in particular targeting more senior figures behind the killing.
On 18 August 2012, John Dundon from Limerick City, was also charged with the murder at the Special Criminal Court. He was found guilty on 13 August 2013 and sentenced to life in prison.[tpl]citeweb|url = http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/john-dundon-guilty-of-the-murder-of-innocent-rugby-player-shane-geoghegan-29495257.html|title=John Dundon guilty of the murder of innocent rugby player Shane Geoghegan|date=13 August 2013|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=14 August 2013 [/tpl][tpl]citeweb|url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0813/467816-john-dundon-court/|title=John Dundon guilty of murder of Shane Geoghegan|date=13 August 2013|publisher=RTÉ News|accessdate=14 August 2013 [/tpl][tpl]citeweb|url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/dundon-the-judgment-239803.html|title=Dundon: The judgment|date=13 August 2013|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=14 August 2013 [/tpl]

==Political fallout==

Then Justice Minister Dermot Ahern made a statement to Dáil Éireann following the killing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/D%C3%A1il%20Statement%20by%20the%20Minister%20for%20Justice,%20Equality%20and%20Law%20Reform,%20Mr.%20Dermot%20Ahern,%20T.D.,%20on%20the%20killing%20of%20Shane%20Geoghegan%20%E2%80%93%2013%20November%202008|title=Dáil Statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Dermot Ahern, T.D., on the killing of Shane Geoghegan |work=Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform|date=13 November 2008[/tpl]
National public opinion demanded strong action from the Government. Local TD and Minister for Defence Willie O'Dea, came under pressure to secure changes to the law and greater resources to tackle Limerick city's gangland crime.
As a result, the Justice Minister introduced the Criminal Justice Bill 2009.
This introduced measures designed to tackle gangland crime:
There have been concerns that these laws are an infringement upon citizen's rights.[tpl]cite web|url=http://presseurop.eu/en/content/article/70821-guns-limerick|title=Guns of Limerick|author=Johannes Leithäuser|publisher=Presseurop|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl]
