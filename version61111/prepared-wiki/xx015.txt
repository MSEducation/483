In South Dakota and Florida, Goldwater finished second to "unpledged delegates", but he finished before all other candidates.]]
At the time of Goldwater's presidential candidacy, the Republican Party was split between its conservative wing (based in the West and South) and moderate/liberal wing (based in the Northeast). He alarmed even some of his fellow partisans with his brand of staunch fiscal conservatism and militant anti-communism. He was viewed by many traditional Republicans as being too far on the right wing of the political spectrum to appeal to the mainstream majority necessary to win a national election. As a result, moderate Republicans recruited a series of opponents, including New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton, to challenge Goldwater. Goldwater would defeat Rockefeller in the winner-take-all California primary and secure the nomination.  He also had a solid backing from Southern Republicans.  A bright young  Birmingham lawyer, John Grenier, secured commitments from 271 of 279 southern convention delegates to back Goldwater. Grenier went on to serve as executive director of the national GOP during the Goldwater campaign.  This was the Number 2 position to party chairman Dean Burch, Goldwater's fellow Arizonan.
Goldwater famously declared in his bold acceptance speech at the 1964 Republican Convention, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue." This paraphrase of Cicero was included at the suggestion of Harry V. Jaffa, though the speech was primarily written by Karl Hess. Because of President Johnson's popularity, however, Goldwater held back from attacking the president directly; he did not even mention Johnson by name in his convention speech.
Past comments came back to haunt Goldwater throughout his campaign. Once he had called the Eisenhower administration "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater.[tpl]Citation | title = Living room candidate | year = 1964 | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ike-at-gettysburg | contribution = Ike at Gettysburg | publisher = Goldwater | type = campaign ad[/tpl]. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party.[tpl]Citation needed| date=January 2011[/tpl] In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that "sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea". That comment boomeranged on him during the campaign in the form of a Johnson television commercial,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/eastern-seabord | year = 1964 | title = Living room candidate | contribution = Eastern Seabord | publisher = Johnson | type = campaign ad[/tpl]. as did remarks about making Social Security voluntary,[tpl]Citation | url = http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/social-security | contribution = Social Security | publisher = Johnson | type = campaign ad | year = 1964 | title = Living room candidate[/tpl]. and statements in Tennessee about selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, a large local New Deal employer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The Goldwater campaign spotlighted Ronald Reagan, who appeared in a campaign ad.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/ronald-reagan | publisher =Goldwater | type = ad | work =Living room candidate | contribution = Ronald Reagan | date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate= March 3, 2012[/tpl]  In turn, Reagan gave a stirring, nationally televised speech, "A Time for Choosing", in support of Goldwater.[tpl]Citation | first = Ronald | last = Reagan | url = http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/ronaldreaganatimeforchoosing.htm | title = A Time for Choosing | type = televised address on behalf of Barry Goldwater | date = October 27, 1964 | place = Los Angeles, CA[/tpl]. The speech prompted Reagan to seek the California Governorship in 1966 and jump-started his political career. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly, later well known for her fight against the Equal Rights Amendment, first became known for writing a pro-Goldwater book, A Choice, Not an Echo, attacking the moderate Republican establishment.
Former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, a moderate Republican from Connecticut, was a friend of Goldwater and supported him in the general election campaign. Bush's son, George H. W. Bush (then running for the Senate from Texas against Democrat Ralph Yarborough), was also a strong Goldwater supporter in both the nomination and general election campaigns.
Future Chief Justice of the United States and fellow Arizonan William H. Rehnquist also first came to the attention of national Republicans through his work as a legal adviser to Goldwater's presidential campaign.  Rehnquist had begun his law practice in 1953 in the firm of Denison Kitchel of Phoenix, Goldwater's national campaign manager and friend of nearly three decades.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/24/local/me-kitchel24|title=Denison Kitchel, 94; Ran Goldwater's Presidential Bid|date=October 24, 2002|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 2, 2013[/tpl]
Goldwater was painted as a dangerous figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan "In your heart, you know he's right" with the lines "In your guts, you know he's nuts", and "In your heart, you know he might" (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only deterrence). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.
Goldwater's provocative advocacy of aggressive tactics to prevent the spread of communism in Asia led to effective counterattacks from Lyndon B. Johnson and his supporters, who claimed that Goldwater's militancy would have dire consequences, possibly even nuclear war. In a May 1964 speech, Goldwater suggested that nuclear weapons should be treated more like conventional weapons and used in Vietnam, specifically that they should have been used at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 to defoliate trees.[tpl]cite journal|title=Nuclear Weapons and the Vietnam War|url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub/vietnam_weapons.pdf|last=Tannenwald |first=Nina|journal=The Journal of Strategic Studies|volume=29|issue=4|year=2006|pages=675–722|doi=10.1080/01402390600766148[/tpl] Regarding Vietnam, Goldwater charged that Johnson's policy was devoid of "goal, course, or purpose", leaving "only sudden death in the jungles and the slow strangulation of freedom".Matthews 2002 Goldwater's rhetoric on nuclear war was viewed by many as quite uncompromising, a view buttressed by off-hand comments such as, "Let's lob one into the men's room at the Kremlin."[tpl]cite web |title=Harper's Magazine |work=Tentacles of Rage |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2004/Republican-Propaganda1sep04.htm[/tpl] He also advocated that field commanders in Vietnam and Europe should be given the authority to use tactical nuclear weapons (which he called "small conventional nuclear weapons") without presidential confirmation.[tpl]Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rUwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11-IA1&dq=goldwater+1964+%22small+conventional+nuclear+weapons%22)+intitle:life&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TQxPT4KGFMmngwftxsXoDQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA |title=Our Defense: a Crucial Issue for Candidates |work=Life |date=September 25, 1964 |page=11 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
Goldwater did his best to counter the Johnson attacks, criticizing the Johnson administration for its perceived ethical lapses, and stating in a commercial that "we, as a nation, are not far from the kind of moral decay that has brought on the fall of other nations and people.... I say it is time to put conscience back in government. And by good example, put it back in all walks of American life." Goldwater campaign commercials included statements of support by actor Raymond Massey[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/raymond-massey |title=Goldwater ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] and moderate Republican senator Margaret Chase Smith.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/senator-margaret-chase |title=Goldwater ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
Before the 1964 election, the muckraking Fact magazine, published by Ralph Ginzburg, ran a special issue titled "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater". The two main articles contended that Goldwater was mentally unfit to be president. The magazine attempted to support this claim with the results of an unscientific poll of psychiatrists it had conducted. Fact had mailed questionnaires to 12,356 psychiatrists, and published a "sampling" of the comments made by the 2,417 psychiatrists who responded, of whom 1,189 said Goldwater was unfit to be president. Not one of the psychiatrists had actually interviewed Goldwater himself.[tpl]cite news |author=Richard A.

After the election, Goldwater sued the publisher, the editor and the magazine for libel in Goldwater v. Ginzburg. "Although the jury awarded Goldwater only $1.00 in compensatory damages against all three defendants, it went on to award him punitive damages of $25,000 against Ginzburg and $50,000 against Fact magazine, Inc."[tpl]cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=396&invol=1049 |title=Ginzburg v.

=====Daisy=====

A Democratic campaign advertisement known as Daisy showed a young girl counting daisy petals, from one to ten. Immediately following this scene, a voiceover counted down from ten to one. The child's face was shown as a still photograph followed by images of nuclear explosions and mushroom clouds. The campaign advertisement ended with a plea to vote for Johnson, implying that Goldwater (who was not mentioned by name) would provoke a nuclear war if he was elected. The advertisement, which featured only a few spoken words of narrative and relied on imagery for its emotional impact, was one of the most provocative in American political campaign history, and many analysts credit it as being the birth of the modern style of "negative political ads" on television. The ad aired only once and was immediately pulled, but was then shown many times by television stations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy |title="Daisy" ad |publisher=Livingroomcandidate.org |date=September 7, 1964 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

=====Results=====

Goldwater only won his home state of Arizona and five states in the Deep South, depicted in red. The Southern states, traditionally Democratic up to that time, voted Republican primarily as a statement of opposition to the Civil Rights Act, which had been passed by Johnson and the Northern Democrats, as well as the majority of Republicans in Congress, earlier that year.Charles S Bullock III, and Mark J. Rozell, The Oxford Handbook of Southern Politics (2012) p 303
In the end, Goldwater received 38.4% of the popular vote, and carried six states: Arizona (with 50.45% of the popular vote) and the core states of the Deep South: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. In carrying Georgia by a margin of 54-45, Goldwater became the first Republican nominee to win the state.
In all, Johnson won an overwhelming 486 electoral votes, to Goldwater's 52. Goldwater, with his customary bluntness, remarked, "We would have lost even if Abraham Lincoln had come back and campaigned with us." He maintained later in life that he would have won the election if the country had not been in a state of extended grief (referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy), and that it was simply not ready for a third President in just 14 months.
Goldwater's poor showing pulled down many supporters. Of the 57 Republican Congressmen who endorsed Goldwater before the convention, 20 were defeated for reelection, along with many promising young Republicans. On the other hand, the defeat of so many older politicians created openings for young conservatives to move up the ladder. While the loss of moderate Republicans was temporary—they were back by 1966—Goldwater also permanently pulled many conservative Southerners and white ethnics out of the New Deal Coalition.Goldberg, Barry Goldwater 232-37
"In the South, Goldwater broke through and won five states—the best showing in the region for a GOP candidate since Reconstruction. In Mississippi—where Franklin D. Roosevelt had won nearly 100 percent of the vote just 28 years earlier—Goldwater claimed a staggering 87 percent."Kornacki, Steve (February 3, 2011) The "Southern Strategy", fulfilled, Salon It has frequently been argued that Goldwater's strong performance in Southern states previously regarded as Democratic strongholds foreshadowed a larger shift in electoral trends in the coming decades that would make the South a Republican bastion (an end to the "Solid South")—first in presidential politics and eventually at the congressional and state levels, as well.[tpl]cite news |first=Daniel |last=Rodriguez |author2=Weingast, Barry |title=How the GOP Helped the Democrats Destroy the Solid South |date=July 2006 |publisher= |url=http://politicalscience.stanford.edu/faculty/documents/weingast-untold%20story%20of%201964%20civil%20rights%20act.pdf |work=Stanford University |pages= |accessdate =January 7, 2007 |language =|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Goldwater and the revival of American conservatism===

Although Goldwater was not as important in the American conservative movement as Ronald Reagan after 1965, he shaped and redefined the movement from the late 1950s to 1964. Arizona Senator John McCain, who had succeeded Goldwater in the Senate in 1987, summed up Goldwater's legacy, "He transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan."[tpl]cite news | last = Grove | first = Lloyd | title = Barry Goldwater's Left Turn | work = The Washington Post | date = July 28, 1994 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwater072894.htm | accessdate =October 25, 2008[/tpl] Columnist George Will remarked after the 1980 Presidential election that it took 16 years to count the votes from 1964 and Goldwater won.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/05/AR2008110503927.html |title=What Would Goldwater Do?|work=The Washington Post|first=George|last=Will|authorlink=George Will|date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
The Republican Party recovered from the 1964 election debacle, picking up 47 seats in the House of Representatives in the 1966 mid-term election. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1968. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote an article in the National Review "affirming that he was not against liberals, that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like Max Lerner".Rothbard, Murray N.. "Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal". Ludwig von Mises Institute.
Goldwater was a strong supporter of the environment. He explained his position in 1969:
Throughout the 1970s, as the conservative wing under Reagan gained control of the party, Goldwater concentrated on his Senate duties, especially in military affairs. He played little part in the election or administration of Richard Nixon, but he helped force Nixon's resignation in 1974.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,942972,00.html |title=The Last Week: The Unmaking of the President|work=Time|date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] In 1976 he helped block Rockefeller's renomination as vice president. When Reagan challenged Ford for the presidential nomination in 1976, Goldwater endorsed Ford, looking for consensus rather than conservative idealism. As one historian notes, "The Arizonan had lost much of his zest for battle."Kolkey, Jonathan Martin. The New Right, 1960–1968: With Epilogue, 1969–1980. University Press of America. 1983. quote p. 254Brennan, Mary C. Turning Right in the Sixties: The Conservative Capture of the GOP. University of North Carolina Press. 1995. ch. 6Reinhard, David W. The Republican Right since 1945. University Press of Kentucky. 1983, p. 230.
In 1979, when President Carter normalized relations with Communist China, Goldwater and some other senators sued him in the Supreme Court, arguing that the president could not terminate the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Republic of China (Taiwan) without the approval of Congress. The case, Goldwater v. Carter, was dismissed by the court as a political question.

===Later life===

By the 1980s, with Ronald Reagan as president and the growing involvement of the religious right in conservative politics, Goldwater's libertarian views on personal issues were revealed; he believed that they were an integral part of true conservatism. Goldwater viewed abortion as a matter of personal choice, not intended for government intervention.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 331[/tpl]
As a passionate defender of personal liberty, he saw the religious right's views as an encroachment on personal privacy and individual liberties.[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 315[/tpl]  In his 1980 Senate reelection campaign, Goldwater won support from religious conservatives but in his final term voted consistently to uphold legalized abortion and, in 1981, gave a speech on how he was angry about the bullying of American politicians by religious organizations, and would "fight them every step of the way".[tpl]Citation | url = http://pieceofmind.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/wwbd-what-would-barry-do/ | title = Piece of mind | contribution = WWBD: What Would Barry Do | publisher = Word press | date = November 10, 2006[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | last = Goldwater | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = September 17, 1981 | title = The 'New Right' Has Nothing to Do with the 'Old Conservatism'[/tpl].[tpl]Citation | page = 39 | title = The God Delusion[/tpl]. Goldwater also disagreed with the Reagan administration on certain aspects of foreign policy (for example, he opposed the decision to mine Nicaraguan harbors). Notwithstanding his prior differences with Dwight D. Eisenhower, Goldwater in a 1986 interview rated him the best of the seven Presidents with whom he had worked.
On May 12, 1986, Goldwater was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan.
After his retirement in 1987, Goldwater described the Arizona Governor Evan Mecham as "hardheaded" and called on him to resign, and two years later stated that the Republican party had been taken over by a "bunch of kooks".[tpl]Sfn | Goldberg | 1995 | p = 329[/tpl]
He is a 1987 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution. In 1988, in recognition of his career, Princeton University's American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Goldwater the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service.[tpl]Citation | url = http://archives-trim.un.org/webdrawer/rec/552938/view/Item-in-KAA%20Schoolsuniversities%202002%20-%20oct.%20-%20dec..PDF | title = Item in KAA | format  = PDF | publisher = UN[/tpl].
In a 1994 interview with the Washington Post, the retired senator said,
[tpl]quote |When you say "radical right" today, I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican party and make a religious organization out of it.

Goldwater visited the small town of Bowen, Illinois in 1989 to see first hand where his mother was raised.
In response to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's opposition to the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass."[tpl]Citation | first = Ed | last = Magnuson | newspaper = Time | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954833-2,00.html | title = The Brethren's First Sister | date = July 20, 1981 | accessdate = January 1, 2007[/tpl].Goldberg, Barry Goldwater, p. 315 (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the "nuts", but the news media "changed the anatomical reference."[tpl]Citation | last = Dean | first = John | title = Broken Government | year = 2008 | publisher = Penguin[/tpl].[tpl]Rp | needed = yes | date =July 2013[/tpl]) Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran-Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward.  "He was sitting in his office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?'

Some of Goldwater's statements in the 1990s alienated many social conservatives. He endorsed Democrat Karan English in an Arizona congressional race, urged Republicans to lay off Bill Clinton over the Whitewater scandal, and criticized the military's ban on homosexuals: "Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar."[tpl]Citation | title = Ban On Gays Is Senseless Attempt To Stall The Inevitable | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/barry-goldwater.html | publisher = CMU[/tpl]. He also said, "You don't need to be 'straight' to fight and die for your country. You just need to shoot straight."Goldberg, Barry Goldwater, p. 332 A few years before his death he addressed establishment Republicans by saying, "Do not associate my name with anything you do.

==Hobbies and interests==

===Amateur radio===

Goldwater was an avid amateur radio operator from the early 1920s onwards, with the call signs 6BPI, K3UIG and K7UGA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smecc.org/barry_goldwater.htm |title=An Afternoon with Senator Goldwater |publisher=Smecc.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=262314 |title=FCC K7UGA record |publisher=Wireless2.fcc.gov |date=May 29, 1998 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl] The latter is now used by an Arizona club honoring him as a commemorative call. During the Vietnam War, he spent many hours giving servicemen overseas the ability to talk to their families at home over the Military Affiliate Radio System (MARS).
Goldwater was also a prominent spokesman for amateur radio and its enthusiasts. Beginning in 1969 up to his death he appeared in numerous educational and promotional films (and later videos) about the hobby that were produced for the American Radio Relay League (the United States national society representing the interests of radio amateurs) by such producers as Dave Bell (W6AQ), ARRL Southwest Director John R. Griggs (W6KW), Alan Kaul (W6RCL), Forrest Oden (N6ENV), and the late Roy Neal (K6DUE). His first appearance was in Dave Bell's "The World of Amateur Radio" where Goldwater discussed the history of the hobby and demonstrated a live contact with Antarctica. His last on-screen appearance dealing with "ham radio" was in 1994, explaining a then-upcoming, Earth-orbiting ham radio relay satellite.
Electronics were a hobby for Goldwater beyond amateur radio. He enjoyed assembling Heathkits, completing more than 100 and often visiting their maker in Benton Harbor, Michigan to buy more, before the company exited the kit business in 1992.Fisher, Lawrence M. "Plug Is Pulled on Heathkits, Ending a Do-It-Yourself Era" The New York Times, March 30, 1992.

===Kachina dolls===

In 1916, Goldwater visited the Hopi Reservation with Phoenix architect John Rinker Kibby, and obtained his first kachina doll. Eventually his doll collection included 437 items and was presented in 1969 to the Heard Museum in Phoenix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special25/articles/1203goldwater2.html |title=Goldwater Kachinas a public treasure |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=December 3, 1986 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Photography===

Goldwater was an accomplished amateur photographer and in his estate left some 15,000 of his images to three Arizona institutions. He was very keen on candid photography. He got started in photography after receiving a camera as a gift from his wife on their first Christmas together. He was known to use a 4x5 Graflex, Rolleiflex camera,16 MM Bell and Howell motion picture camera, and Nikon FT 35 mm. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society from 1941 becoming a Life Member in 1948.Information provided by The Royal Photographic Society, United Kingdom, dated October 6, 2011, "Royal Photographic Society".
For decades, he contributed photographs of his home state to Arizona Highways and was best known for his Western landscapes and pictures of native Americans in the United States. Three books with his photographs are People and Places, from 1967; Barry Goldwater and the Southwest, from 1976; and Delightful Journey, first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. Ansel Adams wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.Arizona Republic, May 31, 1998
Goldwater's photography interests occasionally crossed over with his political career, as well. John F. Kennedy, as president, was known to invite former congressional colleagues to the White House for a drink. On one occasion, Goldwater brought his camera and photographed President Kennedy. When Kennedy received the photo, he returned it to Goldwater, with the inscription, "For Barry Goldwater – Whom I urge to follow the career for which he has shown such talent – photography! – from his friend – John Kennedy." This quip became a classic of American political humor after it was made famous by humorist Bennett Cerf. The photo itself was prized by Goldwater for the rest of his life, and recently sold for $17,925 in a Heritage auction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6047&Lot_No=47197 |title=Heritage Auctions description of signed Kennedy photo |publisher=Historical.ha.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

===UFOs===

Goldwater was one of the more prominent American politicians to openly show an interest in UFOs.
On March 28, 1975, Goldwater wrote to Shlomo Arnon: "The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret." Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was "just as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have to wait much longer."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anomalies.net/archive/Text-Archive/txt1/469.ufo |title=FOIA documents | publisher = Anomalies |accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]
The April 25, 1988, issue of The New Yorker carried an interview where Goldwater said he repeatedly asked his friend, Gen. Curtis LeMay, if there was any truth to the rumors that UFO evidence was stored in a secret room at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and if he (Goldwater) might have access to the room. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him "holy hell" and said, "Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again."[tpl]Citation | first = Burton | last = Bernstein | title = Profiles | contribution = AuH2O | newspaper = The New Yorker | date = April 25, 1988 | page = 43[/tpl].
In a 1988 interview on Larry King's radio show, Goldwater was asked if he thought the U.S. Government was withholding UFO evidence; he replied "Yes, I do." He added:
[tpl]quote | I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities...  I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about – and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.[tpl]cite web| first =P | last = Cooke |url=http://www.bibleufo.com/quotecong.htm |title=UFO Quotations – The United States Congress |publisher=Bible UFO | accessdate = March 3, 2012[/tpl][/tpl]
