Nvu (pronounced "N-view") is a WYSIWYG HTML editor,Nvu home page based on the Composer component of Mozilla Application Suite 1.7. It is intended to be an open source alternative to proprietary software like Microsoft Expression Web and Adobe Dreamweaver. As a WYSIWYG editor, it is designed to be easy for novice users, and does not require any knowledge of HTML or CSS to use. It runs on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.
Nvu was the brainchild of Kevin Carmony, CEO for Linspire, who wanted an easy-to-use, WYSIWYG HTML editor for Linux users.  Under Carmony's direction, Linspire started and sponsored Nvu, hiring Daniel Glazman, former Netscape Communications Corporation employee, to be the lead developer.
As Nvu was discontinued, the Mozilla community has created a fork project, KompoZer.

==Development==

The original plan in June 2005 was to merge back the numerous changes into Mozilla Composer's source code tree.[tpl]Cn|date=February 2012[/tpl] Since then the Mozilla Suite has been discontinued (then reintroduced as SeaMonkey), and no one has merged the Nvu code back into Composer.
Daniel Glazman announced in September 2006 that he had stopped official development on Nvu, and he would be developing a successor to it. A community-driven fork, KompoZer, has continued the development of Nvu with the support of Mozilla Foundation.
In September 2008 Daniel Glazman announced a new WYSIWYG HTML editor, BlueGriffon, written from scratch and based on Mozilla Gecko and XULRunner.BlueGriffon Announcement

==Standards compliance==

The application includes a built-in HTML validator, which uploads pages to the W3C's HTML Validator and checks for compliance.
