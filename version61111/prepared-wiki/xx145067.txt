[[Twister (magic trick)]]

CATEGORIES: Magic tricks

The twister is a famous stage magic trick.  A girl is placed in an upright cabinet, with her head and feet visible.  The magician spins the cabinet, then opens the front.  The girl's body is now a narrow, twisted rope from which her fingers protrude.  The magician closes the cabinet, rotates it in the opposite direction, and releases the assistant.
