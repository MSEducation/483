RAF Templeton was a World War II Royal Air Force airfield in Pembrokeshire operational from December 1942 and closed in July 1945. It is named after the village of Templeton.
RAF Templeton was managed by RAF Coastal Command, and had a particular role in training for the defence of the oil installations in Milford Haven. 
The site remains in MoD ownership as the Templeton Dry Training Area (part of the Pembrokeshire Defence Training Estate). It is used for a variety of training tasks, including helicopter and air defence exercises, infantry and driver training. Usage is shared with a number of other activities, including agriculture, storage and model aircraft flying.
