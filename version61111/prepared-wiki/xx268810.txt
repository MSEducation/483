==Early life==

Lam was born in Hamburg, Germany to father Lam Kam Fat (Traditional Chinese: 林金發), a chef and an owner of a restaurant in Hamburg, and a local German woman. His father originates from the Ma Tso Lung, a remote township formerly a Frontier Closed Area in North District, Hong Kong and emigrated to Hamburg in the 1980s. Lam has three older sisters. When he was young, he often went back to Hong Kong with his family in summer holidays and was playing football in Sheung Shui, challenging some adult footballers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://m.on.cc/football/pitch/20111001/football-20111001-fbnewc012011100104x0.html |title=親叔為港血漢堡新星正名 林志堅至堅！|language=Traditional Chinese |work=on.cc |publisher=Oriental Daily News |accessdate=1 October 2011[/tpl]

==Club career==

===Hamburger SV===

Lam began his career with the youth club for Hamburger SV in 2005 and in 2010 became an active player in the reserve team, Hamburger SV II, where he developed under manager Rodolfo Cardoso. In the 2011–12 season, after the dismissal of first-team coach Michael Oenning on 19 September 2011, Rodolfo was appointed the interim coach of the first team and started Lam (in Rodolfo's first game at the helm of HSV) against VfB Stuttgart on 23 September 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hsv.de/saison/meldungen-saison/bundesliga/saison-201112/07-spieltag/mutig-cardoso-schickt-lam-ins-rennen/ |title=Mutig! Cardoso schickt Lam ins Rennen|language=German |work=HSV.de|publisher=Hamburger SV |accessdate=23 September 2011 | date = 22 September 2011[/tpl] Cardoso's decision to start Lam proved to be a good one, as Lam was widely praised in his debut, with HSV sporting director Frank Arnesen saying, "He has done fantastically, he was totally relaxed. That was a real dream debut."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mopo.de/hsv/hsv-neuling-zhi-gin-lam-das-traum-debuet-des-china-krachers,5067038,10895986.html |title=Das Traum-Debüt des China-Krachers|language=German |work=mopo.de|publisher=Hamburger Morgenpost | accessdate = 25 September 2011 | date = 24 September 2011| first = Florian | last = Rebien[/tpl]
On 15 September 2013, he scored his first professional goal in the away league match against Borussia Dortmund. However, his goal could not save his team from losing 2-6.

==Style of play==

Hamburger SV coach Rodolfo Cardoso described Lam as a courageous player, unafraid to claim the ball, and "a very intelligent player... who can play anywhere."
