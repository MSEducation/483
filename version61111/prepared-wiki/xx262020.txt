Mohamoud Jama (born 30 November 1987) and Bille Ilias Mohamed (born 15 June 1984) are two Swedish citizens of Somali descent who were convicted of "conspiracy to commit terrorist crime" by  the District court ("Tingsrätten i Göteborg") in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2010.[tpl]cite news |title=Sweden Jails Two For Plotting Terror Attacks In Somalia |url=http://www.rttnews.com/Content/MarketSensitiveNews.aspx?Id=1501632&SM=1&SimRec=2 |newspaper=RTTNews |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] The men, who both denied the accusations, were sentenced to four years in prison by the court.
Jama and Mohamed were arrested in Gothenburg and Stockholm in May and June 2010 following an investigation by the Swedish Security Service. The court said in its ruling that the accused "had taken it upon themselves and decided with the Somali islamist militia al-Shabaab to commit terrorist crimes in the form of suicide attacks".
In March 2011 they were both released from custody, following trial in Court of appeal for Western Sweden ("Hovrätten för västra Sverige")that soon after announced the exculpatory verdict.
The prosecution based its case on interrogations of the two suspects, witness accounts and a long line of tapped telephone conversations, claimed to have proof the two men had been in contact with al-Shabaab leader Yassin Ismail Ahmed.
The recorded telephone conversations also showed that Mohamed had attended an al-Shabaab training camp in Somalia and that he aimed to "return to Somalia and wanted to become a martyr," while Jama "was preparing for a future suicide mission," the charge sheet said.
