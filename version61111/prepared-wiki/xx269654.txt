The film was initially titled Shaadi of the Dead.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2011/10/01/16402/|title=Abhay Deol starrer Shaadi Of The Dead retitled as Rock The Shaadi|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|accessdate=2011-10-02|date=2011-10-02[/tpl] But as per sources, producer was not satisfied about "Shaadi Of The Dead" and he was keen to have a better title before the movie's shooting starts. So for this producer threw open the challenge to the entire team asking if anyone could come up with a new title. Finally, Abhay had come out with apt suggestion, since he is deeply involved with the movie and its concept, the project has finally titled as Rock the Shaadi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/71657.html |title=It's now 'Rock The Shaadi' for Abhay-Genelia - Bollywood Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011[/tpl]
Abhay Deol’s girlfriend Preeti Desai has joined the cast of the movie in a cameo role.
"The movie should be a blast because Punjabi weddings are fun, flamboyant and colourful. And this one has zombies too. No, I’ve never met one but loads of people have been trying to chew on my brains for years", laughs Genelia.
Abhay is equally kicked about this Zombie- meets-Punjabi wedding. "Tandoori Bheja Fry will be the main dish. You're often told to leave you brains behind when you go for a madcap comedy but if you do so in this case, you may end up with the zombies feasting on them", he chuckles. "Rock the Shaadi is one of the funniest scripts I've read. I wouldn't mind having a big fat Pun-Zom wedding myself."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Abhay-to-romance-Genelia-in-Rock-The-Shaadi/Article1-753376.aspx |title=Abhay to romance Genelia in Rock The Shaadi for Abhay-Genelia |publisher=hindustantimes |date=Mar 15, 2012 |accessdate=Mar 15, 2012[/tpl]
