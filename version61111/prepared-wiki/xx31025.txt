==Litigation==

In July 2013, the English High Court of Justice found that Microsoft’s use of the term "SkyDrive" infringed on Sky’s right to the "Sky" trademark. On 31 July 2013, BSkyB and Microsoft announced their settlement, in which Microsoft will not appeal the ruling, and will rename its SkyDrive cloud storage service after an unspecified "reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand," plus "financial and other terms, the details of which are confidential".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-to-rebrand-skydrive-after-losing-trademark-skirmish-7000018804/ |title= Microsoft to rebrand SkyDrive after losing trademark skirmish |last1= Foley |first1= Mary Jo |date= July 31, 2013 |website= All About Microsoft |publisher= ZDNet |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/microsoft-will-rebrand-skydrive-after-it-settles-trademark-case-with-sky-broadcasting/ |title= Microsoft Will Rebrand SkyDrive After It Settles Trademark Case With Sky Broadcasting |last1= Lardinois |first1= Frederic |date= Jul 31, 2013 |website= TechCrunch |publisher= |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl] On 27 January 2014, Microsoft announced "that SkyDrive will soon become OneDrive" and "SkyDrive Pro" becomes "OneDrive for Business".[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.onedrive.com/onedrive-for-everything-your-life/|last=Gavin|first=Ryan|title=OneDrive for Everything in Your Life|website= The OneDrive Blog |publisher=Microsoft |date=2014-01-27|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-rechristens-skydrive-as-onedrive-7000025617/|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|title=Microsoft rechristens 'SkyDrive' as 'OneDrive'|date=2014-01-27|accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]

==Criticism and controversies==

===Digital terrestrial television===

BSkyB initially faced competition from the ONdigital digital terrestrial television service (later renamed ITV Digital). ITV Digital failed for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to numerous administrative and technical failures, nervous investors after a large down-turn in the advertising market and the dot com crash, and BSkyB's aggressive marketing and domination of premium sporting rights. While Sky had been excluded from being a part of the ONdigital consortium, thereby making them a competitor by default, Sky was able to join ITV Digital's free-to-air replacement, Freeview, in which it holds an equal stake with the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and National Grid Wireless. Prior to October 2005, three BSkyB channels were available on this platform: Sky News, Sky Three, and Sky Sports News. Initially BSkyB provided Sky Travel to the service. However, this was replaced by Sky Three on 31 October 2005, which was itself later rebranded as 'Pick TV' in 2010. On 8 February 2007, Sky announced its intention to replace its three free-to-air digital terrestrial channels with four subscription channels. It was proposed that these channels would offer a range of content from the Sky portfolio including sport (including English Premiership Football), films, entertainment and news.[ref]
