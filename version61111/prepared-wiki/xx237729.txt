==Name==

Originally, the barracks were named the Brotherhood and Unity Barracks ([tpl]lang-sl|Vojašnica bratstva in enotnosti[/tpl]). Later, they were renamed after the Slovene Partisan commander and Yugoslav people's hero Franc Rozman, a.k.a. Stane. In July 2012, they were renamed after Edvard Peperko (1966–1991), who was among the first Slovenes to die in the Ten-Day War in 1991. The renaming was ordered in June 2012 by Aleš Hojs, the Slovenian Minister of Defence. It was opposed by the Partisan veteran organization, opposition parties, and one of the coalition parties.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/dl-franc-rozman-stane-ocitno-ni-padel-za-samostojno-slovenijo/286700 |title=DL: Franc Rozman - Stane "očitno ni padel za samostojno Slovenijo" |language=Slovene |trans_title=DL: evidently Franc Rozman Did Not Fall for an Independent Slovenia |newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=4 July 2012[/tpl]
