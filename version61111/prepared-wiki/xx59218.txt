Northwest Airlink was the trade name of Northwest Airlines' regional airline service, which flew turboprop and regional jet aircraft from Northwest's domestic hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit, and Memphis.  Service was primarily to small-to-medium sized cities and towns where larger aircraft might not be economical to operate and also to larger markets to either provide additional capacity or more frequent flights than could be justified using mainline aircraft.  Beginning in July, 2009, the Northwest Airlink trade name was phased out, and replaced by the Delta Connection trade name, for Delta Air Lines as part of the Delta/Northwest merger.
