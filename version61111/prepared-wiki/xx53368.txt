==History==

===Ancient times===

Human settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770BC~256BC), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao (胶澳) when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.

===German colonial period and Japanese occupation===

In 1891, the Qing government decided to make the area a defense base against naval attack and began to improve Qingdao's existing fortifications. German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification.[tpl]cite book |title=By Order of the Kaiser, Otto von Diederichs and the Rise of the Imperial German Navy 1865–1902 |last=Gottschall |first=Terrell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-55750-309-1 |page=146 |pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] China conceded the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known,  existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of [tpl]convert|552|km2|acre sqmi[/tpl], it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. "The so-called Marktstrasse (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tsingtau.org/landmann-gottfried-1860-1926-uhrmacher-optiker-bierbrauer/ |title=Landmann Gottfried 1860-1926 Uhrmacher, Optiker, Bierbrauer |language=German |trans_title=Gottfried Landmann, 1860-1926: Watchmaker, Optician, Beer Brewer |last1=Matzat |first1=Wilhelm |last2= |first2= |date= May 2003 |work=tsingtau.org |publisher=Wilhelm Matzat |accessdate=2010-06-09[/tpl] Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of "Tsingtao" (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later.[tpl]cite book |last1=Schultz-Naumann |first1=Joachim  |authorlink1= |title=Unter Kaisers Flagge: Deutschlands Schutzgebiete im Pazifik und in China einst und heute |trans_title=Under the Kaiser's Flag: Germany's protected areas in the Pacific and in China then and now |url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1985 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Universitas |location= |language=German |isbn=978-3-8004-1094-1 |page=183[/tpl] The area had the highest school density and the highest per capita student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.  Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German influence extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.
Identified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (Reichsmarineamt) rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt).  The navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the ships to conduct operations throughout the Pacific. Beginning January 1898 the marines of III. Seebataillon were based at Tsingtao.
Before the outbreak of World War I, ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions.  The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas to plan a transit to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by Allied fleets.see German East Asia Squadron, Battle of Coronel and Battle of the Falkland Islands for fleet engagements
After a minor British naval attack on the German colony in 1914, Japan occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The failure of the Allied powers to restore Chinese rule to Shandong after the war triggered the May Fourth Movement.
The city reverted to Chinese rule in December, 1922, under control of the Republic of China. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in 1929. Japan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938 with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast.

===Post–World War II===

After World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.
Since the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. [tpl]USS|Rentz|FFG-46|6[/tpl], [tpl]USS|Reeves|DLG-24|6[/tpl], and [tpl]USS|Oldendorf|DD-972|6[/tpl] and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).
Northern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.

===Qingdao city planning and development===

In 1891, the Qing Government decided to make coastal Tsingtao(Jiao’ao) a defense base against naval attack and started the spade work of improving its’ existing fortifications. However, Tsingtao was took over in November 1891 by German troops on the excuse of the murder in the region of a German missionary, which led to the signing on March 6, 1898 of the Jiao’ao Concession Treaty between Qing Dynasty and Germany and interruption of Chinese endeavors of local urban construction (Li 2005, p.81). From then on Tsingtao had been a German colony until November 1914 when Japanese took the place of Germany.
After the First World War, Chinese people struggled for the return of Tsingtao, which in 1919 triggered the well-known “May 4th Movement ” in connection with the Tsingtao sovereignty. On February 4, 1922, Japan could do nothing but sign with Chinese Government the Sino- Japanese Treaty. China took back  Tsingtao on December 10 the same year and opened it up to commerce and trade. The city became a directly-controlled municipality of the Republic of China (ROC) in July 1929. Nevertheless, Tsingtao fell into the hands of Japanese once again in January 1938 and was taken back one more time in September 1945. The city was liberated by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops on June 2, 1949 prior to the founding of the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 and stands still as the capital of Shandong Province(Warner 2001, p.25).  

====1891-1914====

The development of Tsingtao urban space during Germany-occupied period (1891-1914). The urban development of Tsingtao originated from the port area in the southern since the occupation by Germany in 1891. The large scale urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. In the year of 1910, the Germans drew up fro the second time the city planning of Tsingtao(Warner 2001, p.33). As a result, the former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade.

====1914-1922====

The development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupied period (1914-1922). In 1914, Tsingtao was took over by Japanese and served as a base for the plunder of natural resources of Shandong and the North of China. With the development of industry and commerce, a so-called “New City District” was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones(Li 2007, p.133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.

====1922-1938====

The development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922-1938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p.327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat. 

====1938-1949====

The development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938-1949). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realize them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets(Lu 2001, p.339).
