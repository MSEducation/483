CATEGORIES: Microorganisms

A microorganism (from the [tpl]lang-el|μικρός[/tpl], mikros, "small" and [tpl]lang|grc|ὀργανισμός[/tpl], organismós, "organism") is a microscopic organism, which may be a single cell[tpl]cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 13th | publisher = Pearson Education | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-321-73551-X |page = 1096[/tpl] or multicellular organism. The study of microorganisms is called microbiology, a subject that began with Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's discovery of microorganisms in 1675, using a microscope of his own design.
Microorganisms are very diverse and include all the bacteria and archaea and almost all the protozoa. They also include some members of the fungi, algae, and animals such as rotifers. Many macro animals and plants have juvenile stages which are also microorganisms. Some microbiologists also classify viruses as microorganisms, but others consider these as nonliving.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Rybicki EP |title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics |journal=S Aft J Sci |volume=86 |pages=182–6 |year=1990 |issn=0038-2353[/tpl] Most microorganisms are microscopic, but there are some bacteria such as Thiomargarita namibiensisMax Planck Society Research News Release Accessed 15 September 2012 and some protozoa such as Stentor, which are macroscopic and visible to the naked eye.
Microorganisms live in every part of the biosphere including soil, hot springs, on the ocean floor, high in the atmosphere and deep inside rocks within the Earth's crust (see also endolith). Microorganisms are crucial to nutrient recycling in ecosystems as they act as decomposers. As some microorganisms can fix nitrogen, they are a vital part of the nitrogen cycle, and recent studies indicate that airborne microorganisms may play a role in precipitation and weather.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Christner BC, Morris CE, Foreman CM, Cai R, Sands DC |title=Ubiquity of biological ice nucleators in snowfall |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5867 |pages=1214 |year=2008 |pmid=18309078 | doi = 10.1126/science.1149757 |bibcode=2008Sci...319.1214C[/tpl]

===Pre-microbiology===

The possibility that microorganisms exist was discussed for many centuries before their discovery in the 17th century. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by Jainism, which is based on Mahavira's teachings as early as 6th century BCE.Mahavira is dated 599 BCE - 527 BCE. See.

In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances.
All these early claims about the existence of microorganisms were speculative and were not based on any data or science. Microorganisms were neither proven, observed, nor correctly and accurately described until the 17th century. The reason for this was that all these early studies lacked the microscope.

===History of microorganisms' discovery===

Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) was one of the first people to observe microorganisms, using microscopes of his own design.Payne, A.S. The Cleere Observer: A Biography of Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek, p. 13, Macmillan, 1970  Robert Hooke, a contemporary of Leeuwenhoek, also used microscopes to observe microbial life; his 1665 book Micrographia describes these observations and coined the term cell.
Before Leeuwenhoek's discovery of microorganisms in 1675, it had been a mystery why grapes could be turned into wine, milk into cheese, or why food would spoil. Leeuwenhoek did not make the connection between these processes and microorganisms, but using a microscope, he did establish that there were forms of life that were not visible to the naked eye.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, concerning the Worms in Sheeps Livers, Gnats, and Animalcula in the Excrements of Frogs | url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/link.asp?id=4j53731651310230 | journal = Philosophical Transactions (1683–1775) | volume = 22 | pages = 509–18 | year = 1753 | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1700.0013 |accessdate=30 November 2006| issue = 260–276 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| author = Leeuwenhoek A | title = Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, F.

Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–1799) found that boiling broth would sterilise it, killing any microorganisms in it. He also found that new microorganisms could only settle in a broth if the broth was exposed to air.
Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) expanded upon Spallanzani's findings by exposing boiled broths to the air, in vessels that contained a filter to prevent all particles from passing through to the growth medium, and also in vessels with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a curved tube that would not allow dust particles to come in contact with the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths at the beginning of his experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of spontaneous generation and supported germ theory.
In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) established that micro-organisms can cause disease. He found that the blood of cattle who were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking a small sample of blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a micro-organisms and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates.The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905 Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 November 2006. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.[tpl]Cite journal| author = O'Brien S, Goedert J | title = HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled | journal = Curr Opin Immunol | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–18 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8902385 | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6[/tpl]

==Classification and structure==

Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere in the taxonomic organization of life on the planet. Bacteria and archaea are almost always microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, as well as some animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as micro-organisms, although the field of microbiology also encompasses the study of viruses.

===Prokaryotes===

Prokaryotes are organisms that lack a cell nucleus and the other membrane bound organelles. They are almost always unicellular, although some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex structures as part of their life cycle.
Consisting of two domains, bacteria and archaea, the prokaryotes are the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below +140 °C. They are found in water, soil, air, animals' gastrointestinal tracts, hot springs and even deep beneath the Earth's crust in rocks.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Gold T |title=The deep, hot biosphere |journal=Proc.

The number of prokaryotes on Earth is estimated to be around five million trillion trillion, or 5 × 1030, accounting for at least half the biomass on Earth.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W | title = Prokaryotes: The unseen majority | doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 95 | issue = 12 | pages = 6578–83 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9618454 | pmc = 33863|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.6578W [/tpl]

====Bacteria====

Almost all bacteria are invisible to the naked eye, with a few extremely rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Schulz H, Jorgensen B | title = Big bacteria | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 55 | pages = 105–37 | year =2001 |pmid=11544351 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.105[/tpl] They lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, and can function and reproduce as individual cells, but often aggregate in multicellular colonies.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Shapiro JA |title=Thinking about bacterial populations as multicellular organisms |journal=Annu. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue= |pages=81–104 |year=1998 |pmid=9891794 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.52.1.81 |url=http://www.sci.uidaho.edu/newton/math501/Sp05/Shapiro.pdf[/tpl] Their genome is usually a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a process referred to as natural transformation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnsborg O, Eldholm V, Håvarstein LS |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Res. Microbiol. |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–78 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17997281 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |url=[/tpl] (Also see Transformation (genetics)).  In nature, the development of competence for transformation is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012).

Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Eagon R | title = PSEUDOMONAS NATRIEGENS, A MARINE BACTERIUM WITH A GENERATION TIME OF LESS THAN 10 MINUTES | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 736–7 | year =1962 | pmid=13888946 | pmc = 279347[/tpl]

====Archaea====

Archaea are also single-celled organisms that lack nuclei. In the past, the differences between bacteria and archaea were not recognised and archaea were classified with bacteria as part of the kingdom Monera. However, in 1990 the microbiologist Carl Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | doi= 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc = 54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W[/tpl] Archaea differ from bacteria in both their genetics and biochemistry.

===Eukaryotes===

Most living things that are visible to the naked eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, including humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.Eukaryota: More on Morphology. (Retrieved 10 October 2006)
Mitochondria are organelles vital in metabolism as they are the site of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. They evolved from symbiotic bacteria and retain a remnant genome.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Dyall S, Brown M, Johnson P | title = Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5668 | pages = 253–7 | year = 2004|pmid = 15073369 | doi = 10.1126/science.1094884|bibcode = 2004Sci...304..253D [/tpl] Like bacteria, plant cells have cell walls, and contain organelles such as chloroplasts in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes. Chloroplasts produce energy from light by photosynthesis, and were also originally symbiotic bacteria.
Unicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell throughout their life cycle.  This qualification is significant since most multicellular eukaryotes consist of a single cell called a zygote only at the beginning of their life cycles. Microbial eukaryotes can be either haploid or diploid, and some organisms have multiple cell nuclei (see coenocyte).
Unicellular eukaryotes usually reproduce asexually by mitosis under favorable conditions.  However, under stressful conditions such as nutrient limitations and other conditions associated with DNA damage, they tend to reproduce sexually by meiosis and syngamy. (Also see Meiosis.)

====Protists====

Of eukaryotic groups, the protists are most commonly unicellular and microscopic. This is a highly diverse group of organisms that are not easy to classify.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Kingdom protozoa and its 18 phyla |journal=Microbiol.

====Animals====

Some micro animals are multicellular but at least one animal group, Myxozoa, is unicellular in its adult form. Microscopic arthropods include dust mites and spider mites. Microscopic crustaceans include copepods, some cladocera and water bears. Many nematodes are also too small to be seen with the naked eye. A common group of microscopic animals are the rotifers, which are filter feeders that are usually found in fresh water. Some micro-animals reproduce both sexually and asexually and may reach new habitats by producing eggs can survive harsh environments that would kill the adult animal. However, some simple animals, such as rotifers, tardigrades and nematodes, can dry out completely and remain dormant for long periods of time.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lapinski J, Tunnacliffe A |title=Anhydrobiosis without trehalose in bdelloid rotifers |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=553 |issue=3 |pages=387–90 |year=2003 |pmid=14572656 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01062-7[/tpl]

====Fungi====

The fungi have several unicellular species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, such as the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kumamoto CA, Vinces MD |title=Contributions of hyphae and hypha-co-regulated genes to Candida albicans virulence |journal=Cell.

====Plants====

The green algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.[tpl]Cite book|author=Thomas, David C. |title=Seaweeds |publisher=Natural History Museum |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-565-09175-1 [/tpl]

==Habitats and ecology==

Microorganisms are found in almost every habitat present in nature. Even in hostile environments such as the poles, deserts, geysers, rocks, and the deep sea. Some types of microorganisms have adapted to the extreme conditions and sustained colonies; these organisms are known as extremophiles. Extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the Earth's surface,[tpl]Cite journal| author = Szewzyk U, Szewzyk R, Stenström T | title = Thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria isolated from a deep borehole in granite in Sweden | doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1810 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1810–3 | year = 1994 | pmid = 11607462 | pmc = 43253 | bibcode=1994PNAS...91.1810S[/tpl] and it has been suggested that the amount of living organisms below the Earth's surface may be comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface. Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a vacuum, and can be highly resistant to radiation, which may even allow them to survive in space.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Horneck G | title = Survival of microorganisms in space: a review | journal = Adv Space Res | volume = 1 | issue = 14 | pages = 39–48 | year = 1981|pmid = 11541716 | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(81)90241-6[/tpl] Many types of microorganisms have intimate symbiotic relationships with other larger organisms; some of which are mutually beneficial (mutualism), while others can be damaging to the host organism (parasitism). If microorganisms can cause disease in a host they are known as pathogens and then they are sometimes referred to as microbes.

===Extremophiles===

Extremophiles are microorganisms that have adapted so that they can survive and even thrive in conditions that are normally fatal to most life-forms. For example, some species have been found in the following extreme environments:
Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their extreme environment can be exploited in bio-technology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Cavicchioli R |title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life |journal=Astrobiology |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=281–92 |year=2002 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode=2002AsBio...2..281C[/tpl]

===Soil microorganisms===

The nitrogen cycle in soils depends on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. One way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Barea J, Pozo M, Azcón R, Azcón-Aguilar C | title = Microbial co-operation in the rhizosphere | doi= 10.1093/jxb/eri197 | journal = J Exp Bot | volume = 56 | issue = 417 | pages = 1761–78 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15911555[/tpl]

===Symbiotic microorganisms===

Symbiotic micro-organisms such as fungi and algae form an association in lichen. Certain fungi form mycorrhizal symbioses with trees that increase the supply of nutrients to the tree.

==Importance==

Microorganisms are vital to humans and the environment, as they participate in the Earth's element cycles such as the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle, as well as fulfilling other vital roles in virtually all ecosystems, such as recycling other organisms' dead remains and waste products through decomposition. Microorganisms also have an important place in most higher-order multicellular organisms as symbionts. Many blame the failure of Biosphere 2 on an improper balance of microorganisms.[tpl]Cite book| title = The Genesis of Germs: The Origin of Diseases and the Coming Plagues | author = Gillen, Alan L. | publisher = New Leaf Publishing Group | year = 2007 | page = 10 | isbn = 0-89051-493-3[/tpl]

===Use in digestion===

Some forms of bacteria that live in animals' stomachs help in their digestion. For example, cows have a variety of different micro-organisms in their stomachs that are essential in their digestion of grass and hay.
The gastrointestinal tract contains an immensely complex ecology of microorganisms. A typical person harbors more than 500 distinct species of bacteria, representing dozens of different lifestyles and capabilities. The composition and distribution of this menagerie varies with age, state of health and diet.
The number and type of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract vary dramatically by region. In healthy individuals the stomach and proximal small intestine contain few microorganisms, largely a result of the bacteriocidal activity of gastric acid; those that are present are aerobes and facultative anaerobes. One interesting testimony to the ability of gastric acid to suppress bacterial populations is seen in patients with achlorhydria, a genetic condition which prevents secretion of gastric acid. Such patients, which are otherwise healthy, may have as many as 10,000 to 100,000,000 microorganisms per ml of stomach contents.
In sharp contrast to the stomach and small intestine, the contents of the colon literally teem with bacteria, predominantly strict anaerobes (bacteria that survive only in environments virtually devoid of oxygen). Between these two extremes is a transitional zone, usually in the ileum, where moderate numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are found.
The gastrointestinal tract is sterile at birth, but colonization typically begins within a few hours of birth, starting in the small intestine and progressing caudally over a period of several days. In most circumstances, a "mature" microbial flora is established by 3 to 4 weeks of age.
It is also clear that microbial populations exert a profound effect on structure and function of the digestive tract. For example:
The morphology of the intestine of germ-free animals differs considerably from normal animals - villi of the small intestine are remarkably regular, the rate of epithelial cell renew is reduced and, as one would expect, the number and size of Peyer's patches is reduced.
The cecum of germ-free rats is roughly 10 times the size of that in a conventional rat.
Bacteria in the intestinal lumen metabolize a variety of sterols and steroids. For example, bacteria convert the bile salt cholic acid to deoxycholic acid. Small intestinal bacteria also have an important role in sex steroid metabolism.
Finally, bacterial populations in the large intestine digest carbohydrates, proteins and lipids that escape digestion and absorption in small intestine. This fermentation, particularly of cellulose, is of critical importance to herbivores like cattle and horses which make a living by consuming plants. However, it seems that even species like humans and rodents derive significant benefit from the nutrients liberated by intestinal microorganisms.

===Use in food===

Microorganisms are used in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and other food-making processes.
They are also used to control the fermentation process in the production of cultured dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. The cultures also provide flavour and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/micro.html |title= Dairy Microbiology |accessdate=9 October 2006 |publisher= University of Guelph[/tpl]

===Use in water treatment===

The majority of all oxidative sewage treatment processes rely on a large range of microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents which are not amenable to sedimentation or flotation. Anaerobic microorganisms are also used to reduce sludge solids producing methane gas (amongst other gases) and a sterile mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer composed of a wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.[tpl]Cite book| title = Biology of Wastewater Treatment | author = Gray, N.F. | publisher = Imperial College Press | year = 2004 | page = 1164 | isbn = 1-86094-332-2[/tpl]

===Use in production of chemicals, enzymes etc.===

Micro-organisms are used for many commercial and industrial production of chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules. 
Examples of organic acid produced include
Micro-organisms are used for preparation of bioactive molecules and enzymes.

===Use in science===

Micro-organisms are essential tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, since they are simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Castrillo JI, Oliver SG |title=Yeast as a touchstone in post-genomic research: strategies for integrative analysis in functional genomics |journal=J.

==Importance in human health==

===Human digestion===

Micro-organisms can form an endosymbiotic relationship with other, larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that live within the human digestive system contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates.[tpl]Cite journal| author = O'Hara A, Shanahan F | title = The gut flora as a forgotten organ | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 688–93 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16819463 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400731 | pmc = 1500832[/tpl]

===Diseases caused by microbes===

Micro-organisms are the cause of many infectious diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, micro-organisms by the strict definition. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], no clear examples of archaean pathogens are known,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Eckburg P, Lepp P, Relman D |title=Archaea and Their Potential Role in Human Disease |journal=Infect Immun |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=591–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12540534 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.71.2.591-596.2003 |pmc=145348[/tpl] although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lepp P, Brinig M, Ouverney C, Palm K, Armitage G, Relman D |title=Methanogenic Archaea and human periodontal disease | doi= 10.1073/pnas.0308766101 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=16 |pages=6176–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15067114 |pmc=395942|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.6176L [/tpl]

==Importance in ecology==

Micro-organisms are critical to the processes of decomposition required to cycle nitrogen and other elements in the natural environment.

==Hygiene==

Hygiene is the avoidance of infection or food spoiling by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, the levels of harmful microorganisms can be reduced to acceptable levels. However, in some cases, it is required that an object or substance be completely sterile, i.e. devoid of all living entities and viruses. A good example of this is a hypodermic needle.
In food preparation microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods (such as the addition of vinegar), clean utensils used in preparation, short storage periods, or by cool temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, the two most common methods are irradiation and the use of an autoclave, which resembles a pressure cooker.
There are several methods for investigating the level of hygiene in a sample of food, drinking water, equipment, etc.  Water samples can be filtrated through an extremely fine filter. This filter is then placed in a nutrient medium. Microorganisms on the filter then grow to form a visible colony. Harmful microorganisms can be detected in food by placing a sample in a nutrient broth designed to enrich the organisms in question. Various methods, such as selective media or polymerase chain reaction, can then be used for detection. The hygiene of hard surfaces, such as cooking pots, can be tested by touching them with a solid piece of nutrient medium and then allowing the microorganisms to grow on it.
There are no conditions where all microorganisms would grow, and therefore often several methods are needed. For example, a food sample might be analyzed on three different nutrient mediums designed to indicate the presence of "total" bacteria (conditions where many, but not all, bacteria grow), molds (conditions where the growth of bacteria is prevented by, e.g., antibiotics) and coliform bacteria (these indicate a sewage contamination).
