==History==

The magazine originally had offices in Los Angeles and New York and was published by Rupert Murdoch. The founding editor was Susan Lyne and many notable people worked under her, including Peter Biskind who spent a decade at the magazine as executive editor and went on to write the bestselling book, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. He said that early on the magazine "gave us a lot of freedom to do hard-hitting, in-depth reporting."[ref]
