==Corporate history==

May 1985 - ERM Advanced Telematics was founded as ERM Electronic Systems ltd by Meir Hayman.
The company was focused on designing vehicle security solutions and manufactured its devices using third party manufacturing facilities.
1998 - ERM moved to its new location in Rishon LeZion where, for the first time, launched its new SMT lines and since then all design, manufacturing and assembling is done in-house.
March 2000 - Cellular network based M2M (Machine to Machine), being much cheaper and easy spread due to cellular providers efforts, made its tone and slowly conquered markets from the old RF solutions. Soon, ERM began manufacturing its first line of telematics device - SkyLink.
November 2007 - Ituran, being a public company, acquired 51% of ERM Electronic Systems and started moving all its new customers to GSM/GPS technology based on ERM's devices.
ERM then launched its new StarLink Family of telematics products and started gaining new knowledge about automotive worldwide.
Supporting Ituran's subsidiaries in Israel, Brazil, Argentina and soon to come USA, ERM managed to launch more innovative solutions, slowly making its way to become one of the important telematics manufacturers in the world.
January 2013 - ERM was re-branded as an international manufacturer and changed its name to ERM Advanced Telematics.
