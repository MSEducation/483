Tommy Baldwin Jr. (born October 27, 1966 in Bellport, New York) is the team majority owner of Tommy Baldwin Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. His father, Tom Baldwin, was a former champion NASCAR modified driver. Baldwin himself briefly pursued a racing career before becoming a mechanic.

==Mechanic career==

He started as a crew chief in 1997 for owner Junie Donlavey. In 1998 he moved to Bill Davis as the crew chief for Ward Burton. Burton and Baldwin won four races together, including the 2002 Daytona 500, until his departure late that season. In 2003, Baldwin became the crew chief of the #7 Sirius Satellite Radio Dodge Intrepid for Ultra Motorsports driven by Jimmy Spencer.
After Sirius' departure from the team, Baldwin joined Evernham Motorsports as the crew chief for Kasey Kahne. Kahne won NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors in 2004 with Baldwin, and won his first race with him at Richmond International Raceway the following season. Between 2003 and 2004, Baldwin fielded a Busch Series team with Eddie D'Hondt driven by a variety of drivers, including Wally Dallenbach, Jr., Damon Lusk, Tracy Hines, and Paul Wolfe. He sold the team to Evernham following 2004.
After 2005, he joined Robert Yates Racing to work with Elliott Sadler midway through the season, he left to return with BDR.

Baldwin announced on January 6, 2009 that he started his own Sprint Cup Series Team named Tommy Baldwin Racing and it will be running Toyotas. Scott Riggs was named to pilot the car for the 2009 season. Baldwin's cars for the Daytona 500 were mainly built and assembled by volunteer crew members who were laid off by other race teams affected by the economic crisis. The #36 qualified for the race and earned a three-race sponsorship from Red Bank Outfitters and a one-race deal with Mahindra Tractors (which jumped aboard after Mike Skinner failed to qualify at Daytona). During much of Speedweeks, the car was unsponsored and white.
On May 25, 2009, Sprint Cup Series driver Scott Riggs announced that he would leave Tommy Baldwin Racing following the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway after the team. Riggs was 42nd in the point standings, with eight starts in the first 12 Sprint Cup races this season. His best finish was a 25th position, which came in the 2009 season-opening Daytona 500.
TBR team owner Tommy Baldwin immediately announced that Mike Skinner, Patrick Carpentier and Brian Simo would be sharing driving duties in the No.36 Toyota for the remainder of the 2009 season. Carpentier filled in for Skinner when Truck Series commitments prevented him from driving in the Cup Series. Simo failed to qualify for both road course events. In September Michael McDowell replaced Carpentier and Robert Richardson ran the November Talladega race. For much of the 2009 season, Tommy Baldwin Racing was a start and park operation, the reason Riggs left the team.
In 2010 Tommy Baldwin Racing hired Mike Bliss to drive car #36. Wave Energy Drink returned as sponsor and the team also switched to Chevrolet in 2010, after driving Toyotas in 2009. The team later used a number of drivers after Bliss left, including Geoffrey Bodine, Steve Park, Johnny Sauter, Ron Fellows, Casey Mears, J.J. Yeley, and Dave Blaney. TBR also ran a #35 for a handful of races.
For 2011, Baldwin retained Blaney for a full season in the 36. The team once again went to Daytona with an unsponsored vehicle, but earned sponsorship from Golden Corral at Daytona after the team made the race. Accell Construction, All Sport, and Big Red also supported the team throughout the season. Blaney led at Daytona and Talladega and nearly pulled off upset victories at both tracks before being involved in late race incidents just laps before the finish. After a 13th place finish at Richmond, the team moved into the Top 35 in owner's points for the first time in its three-year history. Ron Fellows drove the car at Watkins Glen, Stephen Leicht piloted the 36 at Richmond, and Mike Skinner at Atlanta after medical issues forced Blaney from the car. The #36 finished 33rd in owner's points, which guaranteed the team a starting spot in the 2012 Daytona 500. In January 2012, Baldwin sold the owner's points from the #36 to Stewart Haas Racing to allow the No. 10, driven by Danica Patrick, to be locked into the Daytona 500.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20120131/NASCAR/120139963|title=Danica Patrick to drive Tommy Baldwin Racing car in 10 Cup races, including Daytona 500|date=January 31, 2012|work=AutoWeek|accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl]
Baldwin also ran the #35 with Steve Park, Geoffrey Bodine, and Blaney on a part-time basis.
TBR's best finish is third, when Blaney drove the 36 at the October 2011 Talladega race.
