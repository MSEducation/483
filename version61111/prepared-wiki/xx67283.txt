This book deals with correct performance conventions and procedures relevant to different periods and styles (for example Gregorian intonation, divisions upon parts, French baroque over-dotting, etc.). It covers these various topics in a chronological order, also giving descriptions of period instruments and their uses. It is a book useful for those wishing to compose in a more authentic antiquated style, and for those wishing to make performances more historically "correct".
