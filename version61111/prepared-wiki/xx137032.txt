This is a list of Australian floral emblems.  It encompasses the national flower and the official flowers of the constituent states.
After the Federation of Australia took place in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. Archibald Campbell had founded the Wattle Club in Victoria in 1899 to promote interest in and profile of the wattle as a unique Australian flower. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle Acacia pycnantha, although lost out to the latter in 1912. The economist and botanist R. T. Baker proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence  of its flowers. The South Australian Evening News also supported the bid, but to no avail.[tpl]cite book|last=Nixon|first=Paul|title=The Waratah|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=East Roseville, NSW|year=1997|origyear=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-86417-878-6|page=85[/tpl]
In New South Wales, the New South Wales waratah was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of the state in 1962 by the then governor Sir Eric Woodward, after being used informally for many years.Nixon, p. 86.
