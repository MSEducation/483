==History==

In her 1995 book Apartheid of Sex, biopolitical lawyer and writer Martine Rothblatt describes "transgenderism" as a grassroots social movement seeking transgender rights and affirming transgender pride. For many in the transgender - or "trans" - movement, the label transgender encompasses not only transsexual and transgender people but also transvestites, drag queens, drag kings, intersex individuals, and anyone non-conventionally gendered (i.e., anyone identifying or behaving in a manner that runs counter to expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned them after birth) or sexed (if one includes transsexual people).[tpl]cite paper| author = Brackman, Harold | title = Martine Rothblattâ€™s The Apartheid of Sex 15 Years Later | year = 2009 | url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/rothblatt20090708/ |accessdate=2009-07-15[/tpl]
