 Pebble-mound mice are morphologically readily recognizable<ref name=F130>Ford, 2006, p.&nbsp;130</ref> and share a [[pseudogene]] that is absent in other groups. They are unique among [[Muridae|murid]] rodents in exhibiting mutations in the ''[[ZPc]]'' gene that change the protein sequence.<ref name=F131>Ford, 2006, p.&nbsp;131</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==

Pebble-mound mice are found in areas with suitable amounts of available pebbles across tropical Australia. They occur in areas with hot summers and mild winters, with precipitation mainly during the summer. They generally live in open, rocky areas with the vegetation dominated by Eucalyptus trees, but the distributions of the Kakadu and eastern pebble-mound mice also includes areas with denser vegetation and that of the western pebble-mound mouse is dominated by Acacia instead.Ford and Johnson, 2006, p. 517 The distribution of pebble-mound mice is limited by suitable climate and by the availability of pebbles. Competition with other rodents is unlikely to play a major role.Ford and Johnson, 2007, pp. 518–520 The distribution of pebble-mound mice, especially the western pebble-mound mouse, is slowly shrinking because of expanding arid areas, leading to fragmentation of their habitat.Ford and Johnson, 2007, p. 520
Currently, the western and eastern pebble-mound mice are each separated from the central and Kakadu pebble-mound mice by large swaths of unsuitable, sandy habitat. These areas may have been bridges by rocky habitats until the early Pleistocene, suggesting that the current distribution of pebble-mound mice dates at least from that period.Ford and Johnson, 2007, pp. 520–521

==Behavior==

Pebble-mound mice are the only mammals to create mounds of small stones around their burrows. The mice carry the pebbles in their mouths in a radius of 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) around the nest and move them into location with their forelimbs. Mounds may cover areas of up to 10 m2 (110 sq ft) and include up to 50 kg (110 lbs) of pebbles, concentrated near burrow entrances, above burrows, and against trees. Mounds probably last for centuries and are re-used by successive generations.Breed and Ford, 2007, p. 134; Ford and Johnson, 2007, p. 515 Because resources are sparse, home ranges tend to be relatively large and may be greater than 5 ha (12 acres).
The function of the mounds may be one of protection against predators. Pebble mounds are at the center of social life at least in the two best-studied species, the western and eastern pebble-mound mice. In western pebble-mound mice, mounds have been found to contain up to 14 individuals, but social groups in eastern pebble-mound mice are smaller. Young animals are raised in the mounds. For unclear reasons, females visit and manipulate different mounds. Females only disperse to adjacent mounds, but males may move longer distances, though they remain in pebbly areas.Breed and Ford, 2007, pp. 134–135; Ford and Johnson, 2007, p. 515 Male eastern pebble-mound mice may move up to 2 km (more than 1 mi) in a single night.Breed and Ford, 2007, pp. 116–117

==Conservation==

The IUCN currently lists three of the four species as "Least Concern" because of their wide distribution and occurrence in protected areas. The population size of the central pebble-mound mouse appears to be stableAplin and Woinarski, 2008 and while the western and eastern species are declining, their decline is unlikely to be fast enough to qualify for one of the IUCN's other categories.Burnett and Aplin, 2008; Morris and Burbidge, 2008 The Kakadu pebble-mound mouse is listed as "Vulnerable" because of its small and declining distribution and because it does not occur in meaningful protected areas.Woinarski, 2008
