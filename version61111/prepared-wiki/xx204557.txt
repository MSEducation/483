The song's narrator tells of how his former lover has left him. Having not heard from her or her family, he says that he would "prefer a bad excuse to no news". In the verses, he offers several possibilities as to her disappearance, such as "Lost her car at the mall / Got locked in a bathroom stall".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=1820 |title=Lonestar review |accessdate=2008-06-09 |last=Wahlert |first=Brian |work=Country Standard Time[/tpl] The radio edit replaces the line "Joined a cult, joined the Klan" with "playin' guitar with the band".
