More Than You Think You Are, released on November 19, 2002, is the third album from the American rock band Matchbox Twenty. Although not as commercially successful as the band's two earlier records, (Yourself or Someone Like You and Mad Season), it had a large radio presence and produced three consecutive singles in the US. It is also their last album with rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor who left the band in 2005.
