==History==

Gdov was founded in the 14th century, as an outpost guarding the city of Pskov.[tpl]cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|pages=106[/tpl] Between 1431 and 1434, Pskovians built a fortress there, the remains of which can still be seen. It was attacked on numerous occasions by Swedes and Poles (e.g., during the Russo–Swedish War (1590–1595) and the Ingrian War), captured by Swedes in 1614, but was finally returned to Russia in 1617 according to the Treaty of Stolbovo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00017/09000.htm|title=Gdov|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gdov.reg60.ru/orajone/istorija|title=История района|publisher=Портал муниципальных образований Псковской области|language=Russian|accessdate=May 21, 2012[/tpl]
In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, it was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). Gdov was mentioned as one of the towns into which the governorate was divided. In 1780, Gdov was granted town status; its coat of arms was granted on May 28, 1781. Between 1874 and 1912, Gdov issued Zemstvo stamps. The first stamp, worth two kopecks, appeared on April 16, 1874. Stamp production ceased, however, with the coming of World War I. In 1919, Gdov was an area where important events of the Civil War in Russia and the Estonian War of Independence were taking place. Originally, the area east of Lake Peipus was under control of the revolutionary government. On May 15, 1919 the detachment under command of Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz (subordinate to General Rodzianko) captured Gdov, and the whole Uyezd thus came under control by the White Army troops of Nikolai Yudenich. In November 1919, the Red Army recaptured Gdov.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bibliotekar.ru/sovetskaya-rossiya/21.htm|title=История Советской России|last=Ратьковский|first=И.С.|coauthors=Ходяков М.

On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished, and Gdovsky District was established, with the center in the town of Gdov. It included parts of former Gdovsky Uyezd. The governorates were abolished as well, and the district belonged to Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930 the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts became directly subordinate to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940 Gdovsky District was a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs formed at the state boundaries of Soviet Union. Between 19 July 1941, and 4 February 1944 Gdov was occupied by German troops. The town was seriously damaged during the war, and partially restored afterwards. On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Pskov Oblast.[tpl]cite web|url=http://classif.spb.ru/sprav/np_lo/44_Gdovsky_rayon.htm|title=Гдовский район (авг. 1927 - авг. 1944)|publisher=Справочник истории административно-территориального деления Ленинградской области|language=Russian|accessdate=May 22, 2012[/tpl]
