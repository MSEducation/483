Transcendental is the début album from UK progressive metal band To-Mera. Their style is characterised by female vocals, long, multi-sectioned songs, heavy riffs and jazzy sections. The album has been likened to the works of bands such as Symphony X, SikTh, Dillinger Escape Plan and Opeth.[tpl]Citation needed|date = January 2009[/tpl]

==Work on the album==

The album was recorded and mixed between May and July 2006 in Hungary (drums, vocals, guitars), England (keyboards, bass) and France (Audio mixing and mastering). The cover was created by Eliran Kantor. The band liked the website he made for them so much that they took the album artwork directly from it.
The band chose Transcendental as a début album title to reflect the emotional effects of their music. The idea that the title was chosen to hint at the Transcendental Études written by Hungarian composer Franz Liszt - which were considered some of the most technical musical pieces of their time - has been denied by the band.
