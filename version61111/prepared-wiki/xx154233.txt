Scripture in Song Recordings Limited was the name of a recording company registered in 1973 by Dave and Dale Garratt of New Zealand, with the aim of better incorporating scripture into contemporary worship music.  The Garratts produced a series of albums and songbooks of the same name, and became leading musicians and songwriters in the Charismatic movement in the 1970s and 80s. They have gone on to become leading figures in the global school of ethnodoxology, a discipline which helps indigenous cultures understand and express Christian doctrine in their own musical forms.
The company was struck off by the New Zealand Companies Office in 2002.Scripture in Song Recordings Limited business.govt.nz
