AIESEC is an international not-for-profit organization that empowers young people with practical leadership opportunities to develop themselves into global leaders with an urge to make a difference to society. AIESEC, comes from the French acronym for Association internationale des étudiants en sciences économiques et commerciales (English: International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences).  However, the full name is no longer in use.  Members come from a variety of college majors not necessarily from an area related to economic or commercial sciences
As of January 2014, the AIESEC network includes over 90,000 members in 124 countries and territories. It is the largest student-run organization in the world.
AIESEC's international headquarters is in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

==History==

The idea behind AIESEC started in the 1930s, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries, but mostly on their own initiative, and it all came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.[tpl]cite web |url= http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| title= AIESEC Helps Interns Make Adjustments| accessdate=2008-02-11 |last= Kern| first= Beth| date= 2003-10-02| work= University Chronicle| publisher=[/tpl]  
In 1944, though, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students.  In Stockholm, Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of Czechoslovakia) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) founded AIESE.  This was the predecessor of AIESEC, which was officially founded in 1948.  At the time, the organization's stated mission was “to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.”  
In 1949, 89 students participated in the so-called "Stockholm Congress", the first of many exchange programs.[tpl]cite web| title=AIESEC| url=http://www.aiesec.org/cms/aiesec/AI/about/index.html| work=AIESEC web site| publisher=AIESEC| accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl]

===U.S. involvement begins===

In the late 1950s, AIESEC/Europe reached out to the United States and established contact with Yale University and Columbia Business School. In 1959 three students set up AIESEC chapters at Yale and Columbia, with the result that in the summer of 1959, AIESEC/US exchanged twelve trainees. AIESEC/US member, Morris Wolf, was chosen the first U.S. secretary general, and was part of establishing the first permanent international office for AIESEC in Geneva, Switzerland (1960.)  The following year, the first international secretary general, Victor Loewenstein, spearheaded the expansion of the organization into South America.  There were 4,232 exchanges reported for the year in 1970.

==Today==

AIESEC annually offers “24,000 leadership positions and delivers over 500 conferences to its membership of over 90,000 students".  It is present in over 2,400 universities across the globe.
