[[Antiproton]]

CATEGORIES: Antimatter, Baryons, Nucleons

The antiproton, [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Antiproton[/tpl], pronounced p-bar) is the antiparticle of the proton. Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy.
The existence of the antiproton with −1 electric charge, opposite to the +1 electric charge of the proton, was predicted by Paul Dirac in his 1933 Nobel Prize lecture.[ref]

The antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicists Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics. An antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark ([tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark[/tpl][tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up antiquark[/tpl][tpl]SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down antiquark[/tpl]).  The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception that the antiproton has electric charge and magnetic moment that are the opposites of those in the proton.  The questions of how matter is different from antimatter, and the relevance of antimatter in explaining how our universe survived the Big Bang remain open problems - open, in part, due to  the relative dearth of antimatter in today's universe.

==Occurrence in nature==

Antiprotons have been detected in cosmic rays for over 25 years, first by balloon-borne experiments and more recently by satellite-based detectors. The standard picture for their presence in cosmic rays is that they are produced in collisions of cosmic ray protons with nuclei in the interstellar medium, via the reaction, where A represents a nucleus:
[tpl]SubatomicParticle|Proton[/tpl] +  A → [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Proton[/tpl]+ [tpl]SubatomicParticle|Antiproton[/tpl] +[tpl]SubatomicParticle|Proton[/tpl]+ A
The secondary antiprotons ([tpl]SubatomicParticle|Antiproton[/tpl]) then propagate through the galaxy, confined by the galactic magnetic fields. Their energy spectrum is modified by collisions with other atoms in the interstellar medium, and antiprotons can also be lost by "leaking out"[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] of the galaxy.
The antiproton cosmic ray energy spectrum is now measured reliably and is consistent with this standard picture of antiproton production by cosmic ray collisions.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Dallas C. |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=Cosmic Ray Antiprotons |journal=Proc. SPIE |volume= 2806|issue= |pages= 113|id= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003485 |quote=|doi=10.1117/12.253971 |series=Gamma-Ray and Cosmic-Ray Detectors, Techniques, and Missions |editor1-last=Ramsey |editor1-first=Brian D |first2=S.

This also provides a lower limit on the antiproton lifetime of about 1-10 million years. Since the galactic storage time of antiprotons is about 10 million years, an intrinsic decay lifetime would modify the galactic residence time and distort the spectrum of cosmic ray antiprotons. This is significantly more stringent than the best laboratory measurements of the antiproton lifetime:
The magnitude of properties of the antiproton are predicted by CPT symmetry to be exactly related to those of the proton. In particular, CPT symmetry predicts the mass and lifetime of the antiproton to be the same as those of the proton, and the electric charge and magnetic moment of the antiproton to be opposite in sign and equal in magnitude to those of the proton. CPT symmetry is a basic consequence of quantum field theory and no violations of it have ever been detected.

==Modern experiments and applications==

Antiprotons are routinely produced at Fermilab for collider physics operations in the Tevatron, where they are collided with protons. The use of antiprotons allows for a higher average energy of collisions between quarks and antiquarks than would be possible in proton-proton collisions. This is because the valence quarks in the proton, and the valence antiquarks in the antiproton, tend to carry the largest fraction of the proton or antiproton's momentum.
Their formation requires energy equivalent to a temperature of 10 trillion K (1013 K) and this does not tend to happen naturally. However, at CERN, protons are accelerated in the Proton Synchrotron to an energy of 26 GeV, and then smashed into an iridium rod. The protons bounce off the iridium nuclei with enough energy for matter to be created. A range of particles and antiparticles are formed, and the antiprotons are separated off using magnets in vacuum.
In July 2011, the ASACUSA experiment at CERN determined the mass of the antiproton to be [tpl]val|fmt=commas|1836.1536736|(23)[/tpl] times more massive than an electron.[tpl]cite journal | journal=Nature | volume=475 |issue=7357 | pages=484–8 | year=2011 |last=Hori |first=M. |last2=et al. | title=Two-photon laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium and the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio |doi=10.1038/nature10260 | first2=Anna | last3=Barna | first3=Daniel | last4=Dax | first4=Andreas | last5=Hayano | first5=Ryugo | last6=Friedreich | first6=Susanne | last7=Juhász | first7=Bertalan | last8=Pask | first8=Thomas | last9=Widmann | first9=Eberhard | displayauthors=8| pmid=21796208 | first10=Dezső | first11=Luca | first12=Nicola[/tpl] This is the same as the mass of a proton, within the level of certainty of the experiment.
Antiprotons have been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engr.psu.edu/antimatter/Papers/pbar_med.pdf|title=Antiproton portable traps and medical applications[/tpl] The primary difference between antiproton therapy and proton therapy is that following ion energy deposition the antiproton annihilates depositing additional energy in the cancerous region.
