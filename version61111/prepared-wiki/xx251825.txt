Sergeant John J. Cowell was an Irish World War I flying ace credited with 16 aerial victories. Although he scored 15 of his victories as a gunner, he did move on to score once more as a pilot.

==Success as an observer==

Sergeant Cowell joined 20 Squadron as an observer/gunner during Bloody April 1917. He successfully manned the rear guns of a Bristol F.2 Fighter for such other aces as Richard M. Trevethan, Cecil Roy Richards, Reginald Condon, and Oliver Vickers. Beginning on 5 May 1917, and extending through 28 July, Cowell scored fifteen victories, destroying a German two-seater reconnaissance plane and five German fighters, and driving down nine more German fighters out of control. For his valor during these fights, he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal on 11 June 1918, as well as the Military Medal with Bar.[tpl]cite book |title= Above the War Fronts: The British Two-seater Bomber Pilot and Observer Aces, the British Two-seater Fighter Observer Aces, and the Belgian, Italian, Austro-Hungarian and Russian Fighter Aces, 1914-1918 |page= 10–11 [/tpl]

==Death in action as a pilot==

He was then posted to Home Establishment. While there, he trained as a pilot. He returned to 20 Squadron to pilot a "Brisfit" from the front seat, and scored his final victory a year and a day after his fifteenth. The following day, 30 July 1918,  he was shot down and killed by balloon buster Friedrich Ritter von Röth of Jasta 16.[tpl]cite book |title= Pusher Aces of World War 1 |page= 80 [/tpl]
