The Order of Chosen Friends was a fraternal benefit order that existed in North America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The group suffered a number of splits during its lifetime, leading scholar Alan Axelrod to call it  "almost a parody" of fraternal benefit societies of the time.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 pp.49-50
The Order was originally founded by a group of individuals who wished to found an organization that would pay old age and disability benefits. This group, a number of whom were Freemasons and Oddfellows launched the OCF in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 28, 1879. Like most fraternal societies of the day, the original Order had a secret ritual and was organized in the typical three tiered structure of local "Councils", statewide "Grand Councils" and a national "Supreme Council". Before the schisms occurred it had 12,000 members.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, pp.71-72
In 1881 the Order of United Friends split from the OCF in New York State, over dis agreements over insurance practices. The next year the Chosen Friends in California spit off to form an independent organization. The United Friends of Michigan left in 1889 and the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends was formed in Ontario in 1891. Lastly German speaking members left to form the United League of America in 1895. In spite of all this the group was able to rebound and had 32,255 members in 1899. However, adverse publicity about the organizations financial difficulties finally spelled the end of the Order in the early twentieth century.Schmidt p.72
The United Friends of Michigan appear to have become defunct in the 1910s.Schmidt p.343 The California group, the Independent Order of Chosen Friends, flourished for a few years before collapsing.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.185 Preuss states that the IOCF was founded in 1887 
The Canadian Order of Chosen Friends were originally incorporated in the Province of Ontario in 1887. The Canadian affiliates left the OCF when many members became dissatisfied with the parent order. For several years there was considerable litigation between the two over the use of the name "Chosen Friends" and because of financial matters. The Order established a sickness department in 1890 and a child insurance department in 1917. It made "very necessary actuarial adjustments" in 1915, which, nevertheless, resulted in a significant decrease in membership. However, by the early 1920s the Order had rebounded again and had 32,000 members. In 1943 the Order became the Reliable Life Insurance Society. It was turned into a stock own life insurance company in 1964. Its headquarters were in Hamilton, Ontario.Schmidt pp.61-2
