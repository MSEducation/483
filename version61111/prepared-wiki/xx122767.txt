Lubert Stryer (born March 2, 1938, in Tianjin, China) is the Mrs. George A. Winzer Professor of Cell Biology, Emeritus, at the Stanford University School of Medicine.http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Lubert_Stryer/http://www.amphilsoc.org/public-profile/C27D90EF-D697-DE11-A8C4-0013724C588C His research over more than four decades has been centered on the interplay of light and life. In 2007, he received the National Medal of Science from President Bush at a ceremony at the White House for elucidating the biochemical basis of signal amplification in vision, pioneering the development of high density micro-arrays for genetic analysis, and authoring a biochemistry textbook.http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=109741
Stryer received his B.S. degree from the University of Chicago in 1957 and his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School. He was a Helen Hay Whitney Research Fellowhttp://www.hhwf.org/cgi/DirScript.cgi in the Department of Physics at Harvard and then at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biologyhttp://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/about-lmb/archiveservice/alumni/s in Cambridge, England, before joining the faculty of the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford in 1963. In 1969, he moved to Yale to become Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, and in 1976, he returned to Stanford to head a new Department of Structural Biology.http://www.amphilsoc.org/public-profile/C27D90EF-D697-DE11-A8C4-0013724C588C

==Research profile==

Stryer and coworkers pioneered the use of fluorescence spectroscopy, particularly Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), to monitor the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules.Stryer, L., 1968. Fluorescence spectroscopy of proteins. Science 1632:526-533http://probes.invitrogen.com/resources/whatsnew/pressrelease/051302.html In 1967, Stryer and Haugland showed that the efficiency of energy transfer depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor,Stryer, L.,and Haugland, R.P., 1967. Energy transfer: a spectroscopic ruler. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 58:719-725Lakowicz, J.R., 2006. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Springer, 3rd ed., p. 449) as predicted by Förster's theory. They proposed that energy transfer can serve as a spectroscopic ruler to reveal proximity relationships in biological macromolecules.
A second contribution was Stryer's discovery of the primary stage of amplification in visual excitation.Fung,B., Hurley, J.B., and Stryer, L., 1981. Flow of information in the light-triggered cyclic nucleotide cascade of vision. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  78:152-156http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/85/i29/html/8529awards.html Stryer, together with Fung and Hurley, showed that a single photoexcited rhodopsin molecule activates many molecules of transducin, which in turn activate many molecules of a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Stryer's laboratory has also contributed to our understanding of the role of calcium in visual recovery and adaptation.Koch, K.-W., and Stryer, L., 1988. Highly cooperative feedback control of retinal rod guanylate cyclase by calcium ion. Nature 334:64-66Stryer participated in developing light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical synthesis for the synthesis of peptides and polynucleotides.Fodor, S.P.A., Read, J.L., Pirrung, M.C., Stryer, L., Lu, A.T., and Solas, D., 1991. Light-directed, spatially addressable parallel chemical synthesis. Science 251:767-773Fodor, S.P.A., Pirrung, M.C., Read, J.L., and Stryer, L., Array of oligonucleotides on a solid substrate. U.S. Patent No. 5,445,934. Issued August 29, 1995http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/newcomb/newcomb2007.shtml Light-directed combinatorial synthesis has been used by Stephen Fodor and coworkers at Affymetrix to make DNA arrays containing millions of different sequences for genetic analyses.
Starting in 1975, Stryer authored four editions of a textbook entitled Biochemistry.Latchman,D.S. (1995) Trends Biochem. Sci. 20:488.
Stryer also chaired a National Research Council committee that produced a report entitled Bio2010: Transforming Undergraduate Education for Future Research Biologists.http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10497http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC256982/
