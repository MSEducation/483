CATEGORIES: Technology companies of Canada

Mercurial Communications was a Canadian company that developed the Netscape 8.0 Browser for Netscape, a division of AOL. Netscape offered the browser to AOL but they declined in favour of AOL's Microsoft Internet Explorer-based browser. The version was based on code used by the Mozilla Foundation for Firefox.
At the end of July 2007, Mercurial Communications shut its doors and entered receivership.
