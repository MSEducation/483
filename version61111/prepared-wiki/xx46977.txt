HPD lies in the dramatic cluster of personality disorders. People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs.

==Characteristics==

People with HPD are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good social skills, despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention.[tpl]cite web | publisher=The Cleveland Clinic | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | url=http://www.clevelandclinic.org/health/health-info/docs/3700/3795.asp?index=9743 | accessdate=23 November 2011[/tpl] HPD may also affect a person's social and/or romantic relationships, as well as their ability to cope with losses or failures. They may seek treatment for clinical depression when romantic (or other close personal) relationships end.
Individuals with HPD often fail to see their own personal situation realistically, instead dramatizing and exaggerating their difficulties. They may go through frequent job changes, as they become easily bored and may prefer withdrawing from frustration (instead of facing it). Because they tend to crave novelty and excitement, they may place themselves in risky situations. All of these factors may lead to greater risk of developing clinical depression.[tpl]cite web | title=Histrionic personality disorder | publisher=PubMed Health | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002498/ %7C accessdate 17 June 2012[/tpl]
Additional characteristics may include:
Some histrionics change their seduction technique into a more maternal or paternal style as they age.

===Mnemonic===

A mnemonic that can be used to remember the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder is "PRAISE ME":[tpl]cite journal|last=Pinkofsky|first=HB|title=Mnemonics for DSM-IV personality disorders|journal=Psychiatric services|location=Washington, D.C.|date=September 1997|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1197–8|pmid=9285984[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Personality Disorders|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/pd.html|date=March 2001|accessdate=2 May 2, 2006[/tpl]

==Causes==

There is little research done to find evidence as to what causes histrionic personality disorder and where it stems from, however there are a few theories that relate to the lineage of its diagnosis. Traits such as extravagance, vanity, and seductiveness of hysteria have similar qualities to women diagnosed with HPD.Barlow, H.D. & Durand, V.M. (2005). Personality Disorders. (pp.443-444). Abnormal Psychology: An Intergrative Approach (4th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomas Wadsworth. An example of over-zealousness could be compared to the famous grande hystérie, a well-known demonstration of hypnotism by Jean-Martin Charcot by using his most well-known subject, Blanche Wittmann. Wittmann was known for her attractiveness and ability to make herself the center of attention from her hysteria and lavish performance.Fancher, R.E. & Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company.

===Psychoanalytic theory===

Psychoanalytic theories incriminate authoritarian or distant attitudes by one (mainly the mother) or both parents, along with conditional love based on expectations the child can never fully meet.[tpl]cite web | last =Bienenfeld|first=David| publisher=WebMD | title =Personality Disorders | url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3472.htm | year = 2006 |work=Medscape Reference| accessdate=10 January 2007[/tpl] Using psychoanalysis Freud believed the lustfulness was a projection of the patient's lack of ability to love unconditionally and develop cognitively to maturity, and that such patients were overall emotionally shallow.Pfohl, B. (1995). Histrionic personality disorder. The DSM IV Personality Disorders, 173-192.
He believed the reason of not being able to love could have been from a traumatic death experience from a close relative during childhood or divorce between parents, which gave the wrong impression of committed relationships. Exposure to one or multiple traumatic occurrences of a close friend or family member leaving (abandonment or fate of mortality) would make the person unable to form true and affectionate attachments towards people.Nickert, J. (n.d.) Histrionic Personality Disorder.

===HPD and antisocial personality disorder===

Another theory suggests that histrionic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder could have a possible relationship to one another. Research has found two-thirds of patients diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder also meet similar criteria with antisocial personality disorder.Barlow, H.D. & Durand, V.M. (2005). Personality Disorders. (pp.443-444). Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach (4th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomas Wadsworth. This suggests that both disorders based towards sex-type expressions may have the same underlying problem. Women are hyper-sexualized in the media consistently, engraining thoughts that the only way women are to gain attention is by exploiting themselves, and when seductiveness isn't enough, theatricals are the next step in achieving attention.Bornstein, R.F. & Widiger, T.A. (2001). Comprehensive Handbook of Psychopathology. Adams, H.E. & Sutker, P.B. (Ed.) New York, NY. Men can just as well be flirtatious towards multiple women yet feel no empathy or sense of compassion towards them.Barlow, H.D. & Durand, V.M. (2005). Personality Disorders. (pp.443-444). Abnormal Psychology: An Intergrative Approach (4th ed.). Belmont, CA: Thomas Wadsworth. They may also be the center of attention by exhibiting the "Don Juan" macho figure as a role-play.Bornstein, R.F. & Widiger, T.A. (2001). Comprehensive Handbook of Psychopathology. Adams, H.E. & Sutker, P.B. (Ed.) New York, NY. Both examples suggest that predisposition could be a factor as to why certain people are diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder, however little is known whether or not the disorder is influenced by any biological compound or genetically inheritable.Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2011). Personality Disorders. (pp. 281-283). Abnormal Psychology (5th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. Little research has been conducted to determine the biological sources, if any, of this disorder.

==Diagnosis==

The person's appearance, behavior, and history, along with a psychological evaluation, are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis. There is no test to confirm this diagnosis. Because the criteria are subjective, some people may be wrongly diagnosed.

===DSM-IV-TR===

The previous edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM IV-TR, defines histrionic personality disorder (in Cluster B) as:
{{quote|A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:
The DSM-IV requires that a diagnosis for any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.

===ICD-10===

The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder as:[ref][tpl]cite book|title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10)|year=2010|chapter=Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders (F00-F99)|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F60.4|publisher=World Health Organization[/tpl]
([tpl]ICD10|F|60|4|f|60[/tpl])[/ref]{{quote| A personality disorder characterized by:
It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.

===Comorbidity===

Most histrionics also have other mental disorders. Comorbid conditions include: antisocial, dependent, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders,Hales E and Yudofsky JA, eds, The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., 2003 as well as depression, bipolar disorder,[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] anxiety disorders, panic disorder, somatoform disorders, anorexia nervosa, substance use disorderArmenian Medical Network and attachment disorders, including reactive attachment disorder.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Millon's subtypes===

Theodore Millon identified six subtypes of histrionic personality disorder. Any individual histrionic may exhibit none or one of the following:Millon, Theodore (2004). Personality Disorders in Modern Life. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. ISBN 0-471-23734-5.

==Treatment==

Treatment is often prompted by depression associated with dissolved romantic relationships. Medication does little to affect the personality disorder, but may be helpful with symptoms such as depression.[tpl]cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/sx17t.htm#psych |title=Psych Central: Histrionic Personality Disorder Treatment|publisher=Psych Central[/tpl] Treatment for HPD itself involves psychotherapy, including cognitive therapy.

===Interviews and self-report methods===

In general clinical practice with assessment of personality disorders, one form of interview is the most popular; an unstructured interview.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. The actual preferred method is a semi-structured interview but there is reluctance to use this type of interview because they can seem impractical or superficial.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. The reason that a semi-structured interview is preferred over an unstructured interview is that semi-structured interviews tend to be more objective, systematic, replicable, and comprehensive.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. Unstructured interviews, despite their popularity, tend to have problems with unreliability and are susceptible to errors leading to false assumptions of the client.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. One of the single most successful method for accessing personality disorders by researchers of normal personality functioning is the self-report inventory following up with a semi-structured interview.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. There some disadvantages with the self-report inventory method that with histrionic personality disorder there is a distortion in character, self-presentation, and self image.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. This cannot be assessed simply by asking most clients if they match the criteria for the disorder.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic. Most projective testing depend less on the ability or willingness of the person to provide an accurate description of the self, but there is currently limited empirical evidence on projective testing to assess histrionic personality disorder.Sutker, P. B. (2002). Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent Personality Disorders. Comprehensive handbook of psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 513-514). New York: Kluwer Academic.

===Functional analytic psychotherapy===

Another way to treat histrionic personality disorder after identification is through functional analytic psychotherapy.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy.Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. The job of a Functional Analytic Psychotherapist is to identify the interpersonal problems with the patient as they happen in session or out of session.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy.Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. Initial goals of functional analytic psychotherapy are set by the therapist and include behaviors that fit the client's needs for improvement.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy.Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. Functional analytic psychotherapy differs from the traditional psychotherapy due to the fact that the therapist directly address and the patterns of behavior as they occur in-session.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.  The in-session behaviors of the patient or client are considered to be examples of their patterns of poor interpersonal communication and to adjust their neurotic defenses.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. To do this, the therapist must act on the client's behavior as it happens in real time and give feedback on how the client's behavior is affecting their relationship during therapy.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.  The therapist also helps the client with histrionic personality disorder by denoting behaviors that happen outside of treatment; these behaviors are termed "Outside Problems" and "Outside Improvements".Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.  This allows the therapist to assist in problems and improvements outside of session and to verbally support the client and condition optimal patterns of behavior".Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. This then can reflect on how they are advancing in-session and outside of session by generalizing their behaviors over time for changes or improvement".Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.

===Coding client and therapist behaviors===

This is called coding client and therapist behavior.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.   In these sessions there is a certain set of dialogue or script that can be forced by the therapist for the client to give insight on their behaviors and reasoning".Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.
Here is an example from"Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. the conversation is hypothetical. T = therapist C = Client This coded dialogue can be transcribed as:
“(ECRB) T:Tell me how you feel coming in here today (CRB2) C: Well, to be honest, I was nervous. Sometimes I feel worried about how things will go, but I am really glad I am here. (TCRB2) T: That’s great. I am glad you’re here, too. I look forward to talking to you. (CRB1) C: Whatever, you always say that. (becomes quiet). I don’t know what I am doing talking so much. (TCRB1) T: Now you seem to be withdrawing from me. That makes it hard for me to give you what you might need from me right now. What do you think you want from me as we are talking right now?”.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.

====Functional ideographic assessment template====

Another example of treatment besides coding is Functional Ideographic Assessment Template.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. The functional ideographic assessment template, also known as FIAT, was used as a way to generalize the clinical processes of functional analytic psychotherapy.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. The template was made by a combined effort of therapists and can be used to represent the behaviors that are a focus for this treatment.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339. Using the FIAT therapists can create a common language to get stable and accurate communication results through functional analytic psychotherapy at the ease of the client; as well as the therapist.Callaghan, G. M., Summers, C. J., & Weidman, M. (2003). The treatment of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder behaviors: A single-subject demonstration of clinical improvement using functional analytic psychotherapy. Journal of contemporary psychotherapy, 33(4), 321-339.

==Epidemiology==

Approximately 1–3% of the general population may be diagnosed with HPD.Livesley, W. John (2001) Handbook of Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment The Guilford Press. ISBN 978-1572306295. Major character traits may be inherited, while other traits may be due to a  combination of genetics and environment, including childhood experiences.[tpl]cite web | title =Histrionic Personality Disorder | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Histrionic Personality Disorder: Description, Incidence, Prevalence, Risk Factors, Causes, Associated Conditions, Diagnosis, Signs and symptoms and treatment | url=http://www.health.am/psy/histrionic-personality-disorder/ | year = 2006 | accessdate=10 January 2007|first=Melissa|last=Arthur[/tpl] This personality is seen more often in women than in men.[tpl]cite book|last=Suinn|first=Richard M.|title=Fundamentals of abnormal psychology|year=1984|publisher=Nelson-Hall|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8304-1071-6|pages=335–336|edition=Updated[/tpl] It has typically been found that at least two thirds of persons with HPD are female, however there have been a few exceptions.[tpl]cite journal|author=Corbitt, E., Widiger, T. |year=1995|title=Sex differences among the personality disorders: An exploration of the data|journal= Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|volume= 2|pages= 225–238|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2850.1995.tb00041.x|issue=3[/tpl] Whether or not the rate will be significantly higher than the rate of women within a particular clinical setting depends upon many factors that are mostly independent of the differential sex prevalence for HPD.[tpl]cite journal|author=Widiger, T. |year=1998|title=Sex biases in the diagnosis of personality disorders|journal= Journal of Personality Disorders|volume= 12|pages= 95–118|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.2.95|pmid=9661097|issue=2[/tpl]

==History==

The history of Histrionic Personality Disorder stems from the word hysteria.Blais, M.A., Hilsenroth, M. & Fowler, C. (1998). Rorschach correlates of the DSM-IV histrionic personality disorder. Journal of Personality Assessment, 70(2), 355-365.Hysteria can be described as an exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion that people, especially in groups, experience.Hysteria 1. (n.d.). In Google, Retrieved September 11, 2013, from https://www.google.com/search?q=hysteria.#q=hysteria+definition Beliefs about hysteria have varied throughout time. Take for example, female hysteria. It wasn’t until Sigmund Freud who studied histrionic personality disorder in a psychological manner. “The roots of histrionic personality can be traced to cases of hysterical neurosis described by Freud.” Pfohl, B. (1995). Histrionic personality disorder. The DSM IV Personality Disorders, 173-192. He developed the psychoanalytic theory in the late 19th century and the results from his development led to split concepts of hysteria. One concept labeled as hysterical neurosis (also known as conversion disorder) Crimlisk, H. & Ron, M. (1999) Conversion hysteria: history, diagnostic issues, and clinical practice. Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, 4(3), 165-180. and the other concept labeled as hysterical character (currently known as histrionic personality disorder). These two concepts must not be confused with each other, as they are two separate and different ideas.
Histrionic Personality Disorder is also known as hysterical personality. Hysterical personality has evolved in the past 400 years Alam, C.M. & Merskey, H. (1992). The development of hysterical personality. History of Psychiatry, 3, 135-165. and it first appeared in the DSM II (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2nd edition) under the name hysterical personality disorder. The name we know today as histrionic personality disorder is due to the name change in DSM III, 3rd edition. Renaming hysterical personality to histrionic personality disorder is believed to be because of possible negative connotations to the roots of hysteria, such as intense sexual expressions, demon possessions, etc.Bakkevig, J.F. & Sigmund, K. (2010). Is the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, histrionic personality disorder category a valid construct? Comprehensive Psychiatry, 51, 462-470.
Histrionic Personality Disorder has gone through many changes. From hysteria, to hysterical character, to the development of hysterical personality, to what it is listed as in the most current DSM, DSM-V, the 5th edition. "Hysteria is one of the oldest documented medical disorders.”  Hysteria dates back to both ancient Greek and Egyptian writings. Most of the writings related hysteria and women together, similar to today where the epidemiology of histrionic personality disorder is generally more prevalent in women and also frequently diagnosed in women.Sutker, P.B. & Adams, H.E. (2002). Histrionic, narcissistic, and dependent personality disorders. In Comprehensive Handbook of Psychopathology (3rd ed., pp. 509-517). New York, NY: Kluwer Academic Publishers.

===Social Implications===

The prevalence of Histrionic Personality Disorder in women is apparent and urges a re-evaluation of culturally constructed ideas around what is considered normal emotional behaviour.
The diagnostic approach classifies Histrionic Personality Disorder behaviour as “excessive”, considering it in reference to a social understanding of normal emotionality. ‘Histrionic Personality Disorder’, in American Psychiatric Association, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association, Arlington, VA, pp. 667.
Whilst regarding former associations between femininity and hysteria, one must question whether this influences the ease in which female 'sufferers' are diagnosed more readily than males, and whether a subjective cultural stigma that aligns intense emotionality with female behaviour is prevalent. Steinberg Gould, C 2011, ‘Why the Histrionic Personality Disorder should not be in the DSM: A new taxonomic and moral analysis’, The International Journal of Feminist Approaches to the Bioethics, vol 4, no. 1, pp. 26. 
This further enables us to question Histrionic Personality Disorder as a psychiatric disorder, or whether it can be seen as a “cultural disorder” where those diagnosed are the victims of a society that interprets such behaviour as excessive. Steinberg Gould, C 2011, ‘Why the Histrionic Personality Disorder should not be in the DSM: A new taxonomic and moral analysis’, The International Journal of Feminist Approaches to the Bioethics, vol 4, no. 1, pp. 37.
