The Patriots ([tpl]lang-fr|Les patriotes[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-fr|le patʁiˈjɔt|[/tpl]) is a 1994 French film by director Éric Rochant which focuses on certain activities carried out by the Mossad, as well as describing some of their operational tactics. It is a fictionalized account of two separate missions undertaken by the Israeli secret services. The first part relates the acquisition of the plans of the nuclear power plant which was later bombed by the Israeli Air Force (the Osirak nuclear site in Iraq). The second part of the movie is an interpretation of the Jonathan Pollard spy scandal. 
The film was entered into the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2975/year/1994.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Patriots |accessdate=2009-08-30|work=festival-cannes.com[/tpl]
