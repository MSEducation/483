In 1911 Austro-Hungary wanted to modernise their armed forces, and asked the French to supply a huge loan to help  do this. The French government opposed this because Austria was not part of the Triple Alliance. Fairfax and Crozier realised that Austro-Hungary was opposed to the German Alliance, and tried to change the mind of the French government to support Austro-Hungary. If they had succeeded, it might have averted  the First World War.  In 1913 Fairfax wrote “Some day Serbia will set Europe by the ears and bring about a universal war on the continent.”  He was realised that Archduke Franz Ferdinand was a certifiable maniac, and was not fit to inherit his father’s empire, and told his government so.Aynho - Minutes of April 2009 meeting - The Cartwright papers
