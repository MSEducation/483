This is a list of the administrative regions (in [tpl]lang-pt|região administrativa[/tpl]) in the Distrito Federal (DF), Brazil.

==History==

The Constitution of Brazil divides the country into Federated states and these into municipalities, but explicitly forbids the Federal District to subdivide into municipalities.
However, the Federal District is divided into administrative regions, according to law 4.545/64.
The administrative regions are governed by regional administrators with powers equivalent to a mayor.
There are 31 administrative regions in the Federal District.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sistemasweb.desenvolvimento.gov.br/investimento_web/arquivos/legislacao_leiorganica.pdf |title= Lei Orgânica do Distrito Federal |publisher=Portal CLDF |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2012-08-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brasilia.df.gov.br/005/00502001.asp?ttCD_CHAVE=4352 |title= Estrutura do Distrito Federal |publisher=Portal GDF |language=Portuguese |accessdate=2012-08-24[/tpl]
