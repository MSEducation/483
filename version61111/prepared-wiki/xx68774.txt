In the 1980s, Shankar initiated a series of practical and experiential courses in spirituality around the globe.

==Philosophy and teachings==

===Spirituality===

Shankar teaches that spirituality is that which enhances human values such as love, compassion and enthusiasm. It is not limited to any one religion or culture. Hence it is open to all people. He feels the spiritual bond we share as part of the human family is more prominent than nationality, gender, religion, profession, or other identities that separate us.Shankar, Sri Sri Ravi. Bang on the Door. Santa Barbara, CA: Art of Living Foundation. 1995. ISBN 1-885289-31-6
In Shankar's view, "Violence-free society, disease-free body, quiver-free breath, confusion-free mind, inhibition-free intellect, trauma-free memory, and sorrow-free soul is the birthright of every human being."http://www.artofliving.org/wisdom-best-shock-absorber
According to him, science and spirituality are linked and compatible, both springing from the urge to know. The question, "Who am I?" leads to spirituality; the question, "What is this?" leads to science. Emphasizing that joy is only available in the present moment, his stated vision is to create a world free of stress and violence. His programs are said to offer practical tools to help accomplish this. He sees breath as the link between body and mind, and a tool to relax the mind, emphasizing the importance of both meditation/spiritual practice and service to others. In his view, "Truth is spherical rather than linear; so it has to be contradictory."Washington Post interview. Washingtonpost.com (2007-07-05). Retrieved on 2011-09-07.

===Sudarshan Kriya===

Sudarshan Kriya ([tpl]lang-sa| सुदर्शन क्रिया[/tpl] sudarśana-kriyā) is a "breathing-based technique"Sudarshan Kriya page on Art of Living Foundation's website. Srisri.org. Retrieved on 2011-09-07. that is a core component of the Art of Living courses and "the cornerstone of . . . Art of Living Foundation's trauma relief programs". 
It involves "Ujjayi breathing" and "Bhastrika" in "Vajrasana" followed by rhythmic breathing in "Sukhasana".[tpl]cite news|title=Sudarshan Kriya, a stress buster|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-09-09/bangalore/27189063_1_sudarshan-kriya-sudarshan-kriya-spinal-cord|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Sep 9, 2003[/tpl]
A number of medical studies on its preparatory practices have been published in international peer-reviewed journals.List of Art of Living research articles published in international peer reviewed journals Aolresearch.org. A range of mental and physical benefits are reported in these studies, including reduced levels of stress (reduced cortisol—the "stress" hormone), improved immune system, relief from anxiety and depression (mild, moderate, and severe),[tpl]cite journal|pmid=10708840|year=2000|last1=Janakiramaiah|first1=N|last2=Gangadhar|first2=BN|last3=Naga Venkatesha Murthy|first3=PJ|last4=Harish|first4=MG|last5=Subbakrishna|first5=DK|last6=Vedamurthachar|first6=A|title=Antidepressant efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in melancholia: A randomized comparison with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and imipramine|volume=57|issue=1–3|pages=255–9|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|doi=10.1016/s0165-0327(99)00079-8[/tpl] increased antioxidant protection, and enhanced brain function (increased mental focus, calmness and recovery from stressful stimuli), among other findings.Gautier, Francois. The Guru of Joy. New York: Hay House, 2008. p. 155-164. Persons enrolling for the courses sign a non-disclosure agreement with an undertaking not to teach the learned techniques (including Sudarshan Kriya) to other people without taking Teacher's Training.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
According to Bharti Verma, M.D., in The Way of Grace, by David Lucas Burge and Gary Boucherle, "Sudarshan Kriya is not hyperventilation. The process is unlike hyperventilation and seems much more complex in its nature. A person hyperventilating will often experience lightheadedness, blurred vision, muscle spasms of hands and feet, a general feeling of being unwell, fainting and loss of consciousness. In contrast, course participants learning Sudarshan Kriya report a state of deep relaxation while feeling rejuvenated and re-energized. Clearly the experiences of persons practicing Sudarshan Kriya are exactly the opposite of what a hyperventilating exercise would be expected to produce."[tpl]cite web|title=Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: The Way of Grace|url=http://www.srisri.com/12-13-text.htm|date=June 2012[/tpl]
