[[Age of the Earth]]

The age of the Earth is 4.54 ± 0.05 billion years [tpl]nowrap|(4.54 × 109 years ± 1%).[/tpl] This age is based on evidence from radiometric age dating of meteorite material and is consistent with the ages of the oldest-known terrestrial and lunar samples. Following the scientific revolution and the development of radiometric age dating, measurements of lead in uranium-rich minerals showed that some were in excess of a billion years old.[ref]

The oldest such minerals analyzed to date – small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia – are at least 4.404 billion years old.[ref]
