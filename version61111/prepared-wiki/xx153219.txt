Drowned Out is a 2002 documentary by Franny Armstrong about the Sardar Sarovar Project. Shot over three years, Drowned Out follows one family’s stand against a government dam project which is set to destroy their home and their village.

==Plot==

The documentary follows the villagers of Jalsindhi – a village in Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the Narmada River about 10 miles upstream from the Sardar Sarovar project - through their battle against the dam. The lead character is Luharia Sonkaria, who is the village’s medicine man, a role that was his father’s and grandfather’s before him. The government provides them no viable alternatives - they offer unusable land a hundred miles away or a small sum of money in compensation for their river-side land. The film documents hunger strikes, rallies, and a six year Supreme Court case, and finally follows the villagers as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. The documentary features Arundhati Roy, who has been an outspoken activist bringing international attention to the controversy.

==Production==

The documentary was shot over three years on three separate trips to India by Franny Armstrong. Assisted by her sister  in the first year and by an Australian camera operator in the second, Armstrong shot 80% of the film herself. There was no electricity ‘on location’ so Armstrong used a portable solar charger she purchased in the UK.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.talkingpix.co.uk/InterviewFrannyArmstrong.html | work=Talking Pix | location=London | title=Drowned Out.

===Screening in Jalsindhi village===

In August 2003, the Spanner Films crew returned to Jalsindhi village, where Drowned Out had been shot, to screen the film for the villagers. They made a makeshift cinema on the side of the village school, with a diesel generator for electricity, a bedsheet for a screen and  a simple sound system.  About 120 people from Jalsindhi and surrounding villages came to the screening, and for almost all of them it was the first time they had seen a moving image.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.spannerfilms.net/cinema_jalsindhi | work=Spanner Films | location=London | title=Cinema Jalsindhi | date=4 August 2010 | accessdate=10 January 2011 [/tpl]
