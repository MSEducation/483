Only those carillons having at least 23 bells will be taken into consideration.[/tpl] and by the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America,The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA) defines a carillon as "a musical instrument consisting of at least two octaves of carillon bells arranged in chromatic series and played from a keyboard permitting control of expression through variation of touch. A carillon bell is a cast bronze cup-shaped bell whose partial tones are in such harmonious relationship to each other as to permit many such bells to be sounded together in varied chords with harmonious and concordant effect."

==Pseudo-carillons==

(Instruments which sound like a carillon but fall outside the definitions of a carillon by the World Carillon Federation and by the Guild of Carillonneurs in North AmericaThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA) defines a carillon as "a musical instrument consisting of at least two octaves of carillon bells arranged in chromatic series and played from a keyboard permitting control of expression through variation of touch. A carillon bell is a cast bronze cup-shaped bell whose partial tones are in such harmonious relationship to each other as to permit many such bells to be sounded together in varied chords with harmonious and concordant effect." The GCNA's Co-Webmaster defines a "traditional carillon" as one played from a traditional baton keyboard, and a "non-traditional carillon" as a musical instrument with bells but played from an electric keyboard or by any automatic method.
