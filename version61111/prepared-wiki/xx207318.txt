[tpl]nihongo|Kuroiso Station|黒磯駅|Kuroiso-eki[/tpl] is a JR East railway station located in Nasushiobara, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. This station serves as the terminal station for two subsections of the JR East Tōhoku Main Line, connecting the Utsunomiya Line (for Utsunomiya, Ōmiya, and Ueno) to the south and the Southern Tōhoku Main Line (for Fukushima, Sendai, and Morioka) to the north. 
This station is also the boundary of DC electrification and AC electrification.  As a result, those riding the train as it pulls into the station may notice the lights go out, then turn back on seconds later.
