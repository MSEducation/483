==History==

Opened as Grange station by the Waterford and Limerick Railway, by the beginning of the 20th century the station was run by the Great Southern and Western Railway. It was absorbed into the Great Southern Railways in 1925. 
The station was then nationalised, passing on to the Coras Iompair Ã‰ireann as a result of the Transport Act 1944 which took effect from 1 January 1945. 
It was closed in 1963.
