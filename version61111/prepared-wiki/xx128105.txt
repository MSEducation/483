===Petition to the 15th National Congress===

In August 1997, he petitioned the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to introduce political reforms with his essay "Reform the political system and take the path to democratisation". In defense of fellow workers against corruption and substandard working conditions, he tried to stand for election as a factory representative to the National People Congress, on a platform critical of the All China Federation of Trade Unions. He was detained on 25 March 1998, and was tried on 6 September 1998 and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.nlcnet.org/campaigns/archive/chinareport/unionprisioners.shtml | title = Labor Activists Imprisoned in China |date = 28 February 2000| publisher = National Labor Committee [/tpl]

===Petition to the 16th National Congress===

In November 2002, he was responsible for drafting the Open letter to the Sixteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and collecting 192 signatures to support his demands for democracy. Zhao was charged with "attempted subversion of state power" and tried behind closed doors at the Xian People's Court on 10 July 2003. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for his crimes.
HRIC president Liu Qing denounced the trial for being "just another form of intimidation through an unfair legal process. It is especially objectionable that a trial over an open letter was held in secret on the pretext of protecting state secrets".[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.justresponse.net/Zhao_appeal.html | title = Appeal for release of Zhao Changqing |date = 3 September 2003  | publisher = Just Response [/tpl]
