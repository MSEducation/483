William H. Nicklas (1866â€“1960) was an Ohio architect who was best known for his church designs in partnership with Sidney Badgley.
Nicklas was born in New Philadelphia, Ohio and graduated from Ohio Northern University. He first began his career in education and was working as an architect by 1894 in New Philadelphia. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1897 and worked in Sidney Rose Badgley's office as a draftsman. Nicklas became a partner in 1904 in the firm which became known as Badgley and Nicklas until it was dissolved in 1913.  Nicklas continued the firm for several years after the death of Badgley in 1917.  
The largest portion of the firm's work was in the Cleveland area but also designed buildings throughout the Midwestern United States. Many of these buildings are today listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
