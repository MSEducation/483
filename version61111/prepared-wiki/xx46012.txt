[[Cayley–Dickson construction]]

CATEGORIES: Hypercomplex numbers

In mathematics, the Cayley–Dickson construction, named after Arthur Cayley and Leonard Eugene Dickson, produces a sequence of algebras over the field of real numbers, each with twice the dimension of the previous one. The algebras produced by this process are known as Cayley–Dickson algebras. They are useful composition algebras frequently applied in mathematical physics.
The Cayley–Dickson construction defines a new algebra based on the direct sum of an algebra with itself, with multiplication defined in a specific way and an involution known as conjugation.  The product of an element and its conjugate (or sometimes the square root of this) is called the norm.
The symmetries of the real field disappear as the Cayley–Dickson construction is repeatedly applied: first losing order, then commutativity of multiplication, and next associativity of multiplication.
More generally, the Cayley–Dickson construction takes any algebra with involution to another algebra with involution of twice the dimension.Schafer (1995) p.45

==Complex numbers as ordered pairs==

The complex numbers can be written as ordered pairs (a, b) of real numbers a and b, with the addition operator being component-by-component and with multiplication defined by
A complex number whose second component is zero is associated with a real number: the complex number (a, 0) is the real number a.
Another important operation on complex numbers is conjugation. The conjugate (a, b)* of (a, b) is given by
The conjugate has the property that
which is a non-negative real number.  In this way, conjugation defines a norm, making the complex numbers a normed vector space over the real numbers:  the norm of a complex number z is
Furthermore, for any nonzero complex number z, conjugation gives a multiplicative inverse,
In as much as complex numbers consist of two independent real numbers, they form a 2-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.
Besides being of higher dimension, the complex numbers can be said to lack one algebraic property of the real numbers: a real number is its own conjugate.

==Quaternions==

The next step in the construction is to generalize the multiplication and conjugation operations.
Slight variations on this formula are possible; the resulting constructions will yield structures identical up to the signs of bases.
The product of an element with its conjugate is a non-negative real number:
As before, the conjugate thus yields a norm and an inverse for any such ordered pair.  So in the sense we explained above, these pairs constitute an algebra something like the real numbers.  They are the quaternions, named by Hamilton in 1843.
Inasmuch as quaternions consist of two independent complex numbers, they form a 4-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

==Octonions==

From now on, all the steps will look the same.
For exactly the same reasons as before, the conjugation operator yields a norm and a multiplicative inverse of any nonzero element. 
This algebra was discovered by John T. Graves in 1843, and is called the octonions or the "Cayley numbers".
Inasmuch as octonions consist of two quaternions, the octonions form an 8-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.
For the reason of this non-associativity, octonions have no matrix representation.

==Further algebras==

The Cayley–Dickson construction can be carried on ad infinitum, at each step producing a power-associative algebra whose dimension is double that of the algebra of the preceding step.  All the algebras generated in this way over a field are quadratic: that is, each element satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients from the field.Schafer (1995) p.50

==General Cayley–Dickson construction==

[tpl]harvtxt|Albert|1942|p= 171[/tpl] gave a slight generalization, defining the product and involution on B=A⊕A for A an algebra with involution (with (xy)* = y*x*) to be 
for  γ an additive map that commutes with * and left and right multiplication by any element. (Over the reals all choices of γ are equivalent to −1, 0 or 1.) In this construction, A is an algebra with involution, meaning:
The algebra B=A⊕A produced by the Cayley–Dickson construction is also an algebra with involution.
B inherits properties from A unchanged as follows. 
Other properties of A only induce weaker properties of B:
