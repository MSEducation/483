Bull City Red (born George Washington, Durham, North Carolina, United States) was an American, Piedmont blues guitarist, singer, and predominately washboard player, most associated with Blind Boy Fuller and the Reverend Gary Davis. Little is known of Red's life outside of his recording career.

==Biography==

George Washington's primary nickname, "Bull City Red", came from the 'Bull City' town of Durham, where he was born. He was sometimes alternatively called Oh Red. Although he was just good enough as a guitarist to imitate Fuller, with whom he frequently played, he was a very talented washboard player and also sang.[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p37667/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Biography by Bruce Eder |publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=December 26, 2009[/tpl] 
A partial albino, Red was a street musician in Durham before becoming the sole sighted member of a band managed by talent scout J. B. Long that included at various times Fuller, Sonny Terry and Davis.[tpl]cite book | first = Alan | last = Young | title = Woke me up this morning: Black gospel singers and the gospel life | series = American made music series | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-87805-944-X | page = 11[/tpl] In 1935, then a trio featuring Red, Davis and Fuller, the band went to New York to enter the recording studio for the first time, in a session for the American Record Corporation (ARC).[tpl]cite book | first = Gary | last = Davis |author2=Stefan Grossman | title = Stefan Grossman's Early Masters of American Blues Guitar: Rev.

Accompanying Fuller along with Terry, Red recorded many songs for ARC's Perfect label between 1935 and Fuller's death during surgery in 1941.[tpl]cite book | first = Jean Bradley | last = Anderson | title= Durham County: a history of Durham County, North Carolina | publisher = Duke University Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8223-1056-2 | page = 375[/tpl] 
Red also recorded gospel music based songs under the name of 'Brother George and His Sanctified Singers' along with Fuller, Terry, and Sonny Jones. He recorded "I Saw the Light" with guitar backing by Davis. On Fuller's latter day compilation album, Get Your Yas Yas Out, Red played the washboard on "Jitterbug Rag". Between 1935 and 1939, he struck out on his own as well, recording solo with his own vocals, guitar and washboard. His tracks included "Black Woman and Poison Blues" and "I Won't Be Dogged Around".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wirz.de/music/magpifrm.htm|title=Magpie Records discography|publisher=Wirz.de|accessdate=January 25, 2014[/tpl] 
In 1941, Red became involved with another band. In late 1940, he had introduced Brownie McGhee and his collaborator Jordan Webb to his manager and fellow musicians Fuller and Terry. After Fuller's death, the group came together along with another washboard player, Robert Young, to record.
