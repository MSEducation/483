Ismoil Somoni Peak (Tajik: Қуллаи Исмоили Сомонӣ, Qullai Ismoili Somonī; Russian: пик Исмаила Самани pik Ismaila Samani) is the highest mountain in Tajikistan and in the former Russian Empire and later in the Soviet Union, named after Ismail Samani, the ancestor of the Samanid dynasty.
When the existence of a peak in the Soviet Pamir Mountains higher than Lenin Peak was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with Garmo Peak; but as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the Akademiya Nauk Range, was named Stalin Peak (Pik Stalina, пик Сталина), after Joseph Stalin. In 1962, the name was changed to Communism Peak (Tajik: Пики Коммунизм, Piki Kommunizm; Russian: пик Коммуни́зма, Pik Kommunizma), and in 1998 to its current name.
The first ascent was made 9 September 1933 by the Soviet mountaineer Yevgeniy Abalakov.The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. Communizma Peak
