[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]

CATEGORIES: Environment of Iceland, Plate tectonics, Underwater ridges of the Atlantic Ocean

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a mid-ocean ridge, a divergent tectonic plate or constructive plate boundary located along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, and part of the longest mountain range in the world. In the North Atlantic, it separates the Eurasian and North American Plates, whereas in the South Atlantic it separates the African and South American Plates. The Ridge extends from a junction with the Gakkel Ridge (Mid-Arctic Ridge) northeast of Greenland southward to the Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic. Although the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is mostly an underwater feature, portions of it have enough elevation to extend above sea level. The section of the ridge that includes the island of Iceland is also known as the Reykjanes Ridge. The average spreading rate for the ridge is about 2.5 cm per year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html|title=Understanding plate motions|last=USGS|date=5 May 1999|accessdate=13 March 2011[/tpl]

==Discovery==

A ridge under the Atlantic Ocean was first inferred by Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1850. The ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS Challenger in 1872.Hsü, Kenneth J. (1992) Challenger at Sea, Princeton, Princeton University Press, page 57 A team of scientists on board, led by Charles Wyville Thomson, discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic while investigating the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable.Redfern, R.; 2001: Origins, the Evolution of Continents, Oceans and Life, University of Oklahoma Press, ISBN 1-84188-192-9, p. 26 The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925Alexander Hellemans and Brian Bunch, 1989, Timeline of Science, Sidgwick and Jackson, London and was found to extend around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean by the German Meteor expedition.Stein, Glenn, A Victory in Peace: The German Atlantic Expedition 1925-27, June 2007
In the 1950s, mapping of the Earth’s ocean floors by Bruce Heezen, Maurice Ewing, Marie Tharp and others revealed that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge had a strange bathymetry of valleys and ridges,Ewing, W.M.; Dorman, H.J.; Ericson, J.N. & Heezen, B.C.; 1953: Exploration of the northwest Atlantic mid-ocean canyon, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 64, p. 865-868 with its central valley being seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes.Heezen, B. C. & Tharp, M.; 1954: Physiographic diagram of the western North Atlantic, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 65, p. 1261Hill, M.N. & Laughton, A.S.; 1954: Seismic Observations in the Eastern Atlantic, 1952, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, series A, mathematical & physical sciences 222(1150), p. 348-356 Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth’s oceans.Edgar W. Spencer, 1977, Introduction to the Structure of the Earth, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill, Tokyo The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.

==Notable features along the ridge==

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley that runs along the axis of the ridge along nearly its entire length. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates.
Near the equator, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is divided into the North Atlantic Ridge and the South Atlantic Ridge by the Romanche Trench, a narrow submarine trench with a maximum depth of [tpl]convert|7,758|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], one of the deepest locations of the Atlantic Ocean. This trench, however, is not regarded as the boundary between the North and South American Plates, nor the Eurasian and African Plates.

==Islands on or near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge==

The islands, from north to south, with their respective highest peaks and location, are:
Northern Hemisphere (North Atlantic Ridge):
Southern Hemisphere (South Atlantic Ridge):

==Geology==

The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise, which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing the oceanic crust and lithosphere.
This divergent boundary first formed in the Triassic period, when a series of three-armed grabens coalesced on the supercontinent Pangaea to form the ridge. Usually, only two arms of any given three-armed graben become part of a divergent plate boundary. The failed arms are called aulacogens, and the aulacogens of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge eventually became many of the large river valleys seen along the Americas and Africa (including the Mississippi River, Amazon River and Niger River).
The ridge is about [tpl]convert|2,500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] below sea level, while its flank is about 5,000 meters deeper."The Mediterranean Was a Desert" by Kenneth J. Hsü, illustration 13.
The Fundy Basin on the Atlantic coast of North America between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in Canada is evidence of the ancestral Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
