==History==

The movement developed as a reaction to British colonialism in India, which was believed by a group of prominent Indian scholars — consisting of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Muhammad Yaqub Nanautawi, Shah Rafi al-Din, Sayyid Muhammad Abid, Zulfiqar Ali, Fadhl al-Rahman Usmani and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi — to be corrupting the Islamic religion. They therefore founded an Islamic seminary known as Darul Uloom Deoband.Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, p 626. ISBN 0521779332 From here the Islamic revivalist and anti-imperialist ideology of the Deobandis began to develop.The Six Great Ones at Darul Uloom Deoband Gradually Darul Uloom Deoband became the second largest focal point of Islamic teachings and research after the Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt. Through organisations such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Tablighi Jamaat its ideology began to spread and the graduates of Darul Uloom Deoband from countries like Saudi Arabia, China and Malaysia opened up thousands of madrasas throughout South Asia, specifically in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.my/books?id=JdC90uc8PfQC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=The+Deobandi+movement+developed+as+a+reaction+to+the+British+colonialism+in+India&source=bl&ots=7tuDf54Gml&sig=AJJ5mP1TjczLYYCHzCVEqTifdl4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ohkXUJ-7Ha2QiQfHhIHADw&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=The%20Deobandi%20movement%20developed%20as%20a%20reaction%20to%20the%20British%20colonialism%20in%20India&f=false |title=Islamic Radicalism and Multicultural Politics: The British Experience - Tahir Abbas - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.my |accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl]

==Presence==

===In India===

The Deobandi Movement has been influenced by Wahhabism from its early days.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=t7qXcVbacjsC&pg=PA30&dq=deoband+wahabi+oxford&hl=en&sa=X&ei=q20fU7uQBMfmqwHAyYGQAw&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=deoband%20wahabi%20oxford&f=false |title=The Taliban: Ascent to Power - M.

===In Pakistan===

Some 15 per cent of Pakistan's Sunni Muslims would consider themselves Deobandi [tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-barelvi.htm |title=Barelvi Islam |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl] and according to Heritage Online, nearly 65% of the total seminaries (Madrasah) in Pakistan are run by Deobandis, 25% by Barelvis, 6% by Ahle Hadith and 3% by various Shia organizations. The Deobandi movement in Pakistan was a major recipient of funding from Saudi Arabia from the early 1980s up until the early 2000s, whereby this funding was pulled in favor of the rival Ahl al-Hadith movement.Sushant Sareen, The Jihad Factory: Pakistan's Islamic Revolution in the Making, pg. 282. New Delhi: Har Anand Publications, 2005. Having seen Deoband as a counterbalance to Iranian influence in the region, Saudi funding is now strictly reserved for the Ahl al-Hadith.

===In the United Kingdom===

According to The Times, about 600 of Britain's nearly 1,500 mosques are run by Deobandi affiliated scholars, and 17 of the country's 26 Islamic seminaries follow Sunni Deobandi teachings, producing 80% of all domestically trained Ulema.Hardline takeover of British Masjid, The Times, 7 September 2007

==Beliefs==

The Deobandi movement sees itself as a maslak, or scholastic tradition, situated within orthodox Sunni Islam. It grew out of the Islamic scholastic tradition of Medieval Transoxania and Mughal India, and it considers its visionary forefather to be Shah Waliullah al-Dihlawi, the celebrated Indian Islamic scholar and thinker of the eighteenth century.

===Fiqh (Islamic Law)===

Deobandis are strong proponents of the doctrine of Taqlid. In other words, they believe that a Muslim must adhere to one of the four schools (madhhabs) of Sunni Islamic Law, and generally discourage inter-school eclecticism.Martin Van Bruinessen, Julia Day Howell, Sufism and the 'Modern' in Islam, p 130, ISBN 1850438544 They themselves are predominantly followers of the Hanafi madhhab.Metcalf, Barabara. "Traditionalist" Islamic Activism: Deoband, Tablighis, and Talibs. "These orientations --"Deobandi," "Barelvi" or "Ahl-i Hadith" -- would come to define sectarian divisions among Sunni Muslims of South Asian background to the present." Students at madrasas affiliated with the Deobandi movement will study the classic books of Hanafi Law such as Nur al-Idah, Mukhtasar al-Quduri, Sharh al-Wiqayah, and Kanz al-Daqa’iq, culminating their study of the madhhab with the Hidayah of al-Marghinani.[tpl]cite journal|last=Haque|first=Ziaul|title=Muslim Religious Education in Indo-Pakistan|journal=Islamic Studies|year=1975|volume=14|issue=4|page=284|publisher=Islamic Research Institute, International Islamic University, Islamabad|quote=The following books and subjects are studied ... Fiqh: Hidayah, Quduri, Nur al-Idah, Sharh-i Waqayah, Kanz al-Daqa'iq[/tpl]
With regard to views on Taqlid, one of their main opposing reformist groups are the Ahl-i Hadis, also known as the ghair-muqallid, the nonconformists, because they eschewed taqlid in favor of the direct use of Quran and Hadith.[tpl]cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Barbara Daly|title=Islamic revival in British India : Deoband, 1860-1900|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=0-19-566049-8|page=141|edition=3rd impression.[/tpl] They often accuse those who adhere to the rulings of one scholar or legal school of blind imitation, and frequently demanded scriptural evidence for every argument and legal ruling.[tpl]cite book|last=Khan|first=Fareeha|title=Traditionalist Approaches to Shari'ah Reform: Mawlana Ashraf 'Ali Thanawi's Fatwa on Women's Right to Divorce|year=2008|page=59|format=Doctoral Dissertation -- University of Michigan|quote=Polemicists from among the Ahl-i Hadith were especially being targeted in Thanawi's explanation, since they accused those who adhered to the rulings of one scholar or legal school of "blind imitation." It was the practice of the Ahl-i Hadith to demand and provide proofs for every argument and legal ruling.[/tpl] Almost since the very beginnings of the movement, Deobandi scholars have generated a copious amount of scholarly output in attempts to defend their adherence to a madhhab in general. In particular, Deobandis have penned much literature in defense of their argument that the Hanafi madhhab is in complete accordance with the Quran and Hadith.[tpl]cite book|last=Zaman|first=Muhammad Qasim|title=The Ulama in Contemporary Islam: Custodians of Change|year=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=24|quote=The Deobandi sensitivity to the Ahl-i Hadith challenge is indicated by the polemics they engaged in with the Ahl-i Hadith and by the large commentaries on classical works of hadith written specifically to refute them[/tpl]
In response to this need to defend their madhhab in light of scripture, Deobandis became particularly distinguished for their unprecedented salience to the study of Hadith in their madrasas. Their madrasa curriculum incorporates a feature unique among the global arena of Islamic scholarship, the Daura-e Hadis, the capstone year of a student's advanced madrasa training, in which all six canonical collections of Sunni Hadith (the Sihah Sittah) are reviewed.[tpl]cite book|last=Zaman|first=Muhammad Qasim|title=The Ulama in Contemporary Islam: Custodians of Change|year=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=39|quote=...gave a new and, in the Indian context, unprecedented salience to the studyof hadith in their madrasas. Hadith had, of course, been studied in precolonial Indian madrasas, but the Deobandis instituted the practice of studying (or, more exactly, “reviewing”) all six of the Sunni canonical collections of hadith in the course of a single year; this practice has come to serve in Indian and Pakistani madrasas as the capstone of a student’s advanced madrasa[/tpl] In a Deobandi madrasa, the position of Shaykh al-Hadith, or the resident professor of Sahih Bukhari, is held in much reverence.

===Theology===

In tenets of faith, the Deobandis follow the Maturidi school of Islamic theology.David Emmanuel Singh, Islamization in Modern South Asia: Deobandi Reform and the Gujjar Response, p 167.[tpl]cite web|author=ibnummabd on February 19, 2009 at 6:04 pm |url=http://www.deoband.org/about-2/ |title=About |publisher=Deoband.org |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=29 April 2013[/tpl] 
Their schools teach a short text on beliefs by the Maturidi scholar Nasafi.Martin van Bruinessen, Stefano Allievi, Producing Islamic Knowledge: Transmission and Dissemination in Western Europe, p 100. ISBN 1136932860

===Sufism===

Deoband's curriculum combined the study of the revealed sciences (Qur'an, Hadith and Law) with rational subjects (logic, philosophy and science). At the same time it was Sufi in orientation and affiliated with the Chisti order. Its Sufism however, was closely integrated with Hadith scholarship and the proper legal practice of Islam.
According to Qari Muhammad Tayyib — the 8th rector or Mohtamim of the Darul Uloom Deoband who died in 1983 — "the Ulema of Deoband ... in conduct ... are Sufis, ... in Sulook they are Chisti sufi order .... They are initiates of the Chistiyyah, Naqshbandiya, Qadriyah and Suhrawardiyya Sufi orders.”Fatawa Rahimiyyah (Eng. Trans.), vol.1, p.58.The Deobandis are followers of Sufism| ahya.orgTraversing the path of Suluk| January 26, 2012

==Movements==

===Tablighi Jamaat===

Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim missionary organisation, began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement. Its inception is believed to be a response to Hindu reform movements, which were considered a threat to vulnerable and non-practicing Muslims. It gradually expanded from a local to a national organisation, and finally to a transnational movement, and it now has followers in over 150 countries. Although its beginnings were from the Deobandi movement, no particular interpretation of Islam has been endorsed since the beginning of the movement.[tpl]cite web|author = Burton, Fred and Stewart, Scott| title=Tablighi Jamaat: An Indirect Line to Terrorism|url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/tablighi_jamaat_indirect_line_terrorism|publisher=Stratfor|accessdate=1 September 2011[/tpl]

===Sipah-e-Sahaba===

Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) is a Deobandi Pakistani banned organization, and a formerly registered Pakistani political party. Established in the early 1980s in Jhang by Maulana Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, its stated goal is to primarily to deter major Shiite influence in Pakistan in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. The organization was banned by President Pervez Musharraf in 2002 as a terrorist organization under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.B.

In October 2000 Maulana Masood Azhar, founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), was quoted as saying that "Sipah-e-Sahaba stands shoulder to shoulder with Jaish-e-Muhammad in Jehad."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/terroristoutfits/Ssp.htm |title=Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan[/tpl]  A leaked U.S. diplomatic cable described JeM as "another SSP breakaway Deobandi organization."[tpl]cite news | title = 2009: Southern Punjab extremism battle between haves and have-nots | date = 2011-05-22 | publisher = Dawn Media Group | url = http://www.dawn.com/2011/05/22/2009-southern-punjab-extremism-battle-between-haves-and-have-nots.html | work = Dawn.com |accessdate=25 May 2011[/tpl]
