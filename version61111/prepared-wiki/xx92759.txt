John Glashan (born John McGlashan, 24 December 1927 - 15 June 1999) was a Scottish cartoonist, illustrator and playwright.  He was the creator of the "Genius" cartoons.
Glashan's cartoons typically included small pen-and-ink figures drawn over a fabulous backdrop often featuring fantastic Gothic or imaginary architecture, surreal landscapes or gloriously impractical ingenious-looking machines.

==Life and work==

Born in Glasgow and the son of a portrait painter, McGlashan studied painting at the Glasgow School of Art after national service in the army.  He moved to London with the intention of making a living from painting portraits, but was unable to do so.  After switching to cartooning and illustrating he curtailed his name to "Glashan".
Glashan's cartoons appeared in Lilliput, Harpers & Queen, Private Eye, Punch, and various London newspapers, as well as Holiday and the New Yorker.
A series of humorous guidebooks created with Jonathan Routh in the late 1960s allowed extensive expression of Glashan's graffiti-like style, combining small figures (often bearded men) with scrawled text - but, even here, often with elaborate backdrops.
The "Genius" cartoons, which allowed Glashan to use colour and a great expanse of space, ran in the Observer Magazine from 1978 to 1983, whereupon he concentrated on landscape painting.  His cartoons reappeared from 1988 in the Spectator.
