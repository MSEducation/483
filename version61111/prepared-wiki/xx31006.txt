The 2008 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad ([tpl]lang-zh|第二十九届夏季奥林匹克运动会[/tpl]), was a major international multi-sport event that took place in Beijing, China, from August 8 to 24, 2008.[tpl]Ref label|A|a|a[/tpl] A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events (a total of one event more than the schedule of the 2004 Games). China became the 22nd nation to host the Olympic Games and the 18th to hold a Summer Olympic Games.  It was the third time that the Summer Olympic Games were held in Asia, after Tokyo, Japan, in 1964 and Seoul, South Korea, in 1988. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making it the third time the events of the same Olympics were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs[tpl]Ref label|B|b|b[/tpl], while sailing was contested in Qingdao, and football events took place in several different cities.
Beijing was awarded the Games over four competitors on July 13, 2001, having won an absolute majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html | work=New York Times | title=OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games | first=Jere | last=Longman | date=July 14, 2001| accessdate= February 4, 2011 [/tpl] The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transportation systems. A total of 37 venues were used to host the events, including 12 constructed specifically for use at the Games. The official logo of these Olympic Games, titled "Dancing Beijing", featured a stylised calligraphic character jīng (京, meaning capital), referring to the host city. Media outlets reported unprecedented audience interest in the Games, and these Olympics had the largest television audience in Olympic history to date,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&refer=conews&tkr=62553Q:US&sid=aT3QhOOTmtmQ | work=Bloomberg | title=Beijing Olympics Attracted Most Viewers, Nielsen Says | first=Andy | last=Fixmer | date=September 5, 2008| accessdate= February 4, 2011 [/tpl] an achievement later surpassed by the 2012 Games.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/london-olympics-2012/articles/2012/08/13/london-olympics-biggest-us-tv-history-despite-gripes |title= London Olympics biggest in U.S. TV history, despite gripes |date=August 13, 2012 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=November 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Some politicians and non-governmental organizations criticized the choice of China as Olympic host because of the country's human rights record,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/07/13/olympicvote010713.html |title=Beijing triumphs with 2008 Olympic bid |publisher=CBC |date=July 13, 2001 | accessdate=February 5, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/29/world/main4302232.shtml | title="Amnesty: China "Tarnishing" Olympics"" | publisher=CBS News | date=July 29, 2008 | accessdate=February 5, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110202221127/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/29/world/main4302232.shtml| archivedate= February 2, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and protests by pro-Tibetan independence activists and critics of China's human rights record marred the international portion of the Olympic torch relay.

==Organization==

===Bid===

Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on July 13, 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by an absolute majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp |title = Beijing 2008: Election |publisher = International Olympic Committee |accessdate =December 18, 2006| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20061205234608/http://olympic.org/uk/games/beijing/election_uk.asp| archivedate= December 5, 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Members of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations who had received assistance from China in the construction of stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[tpl]Cite news|last=Longman|first=Jere|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/14/sports/olympics-beijing-wins-bid-for-2008-olympic-games.html|title=OLYMPICS; Beijing Wins Bid for 2008 Olympic Games|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 11, 2009|date=July 14, 2001[/tpl] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/24/sports/olympics-2000-olympics-go-to-sydney-in-surprise-setback-for-china.html|title=Olympics; 2000 Olympics Go to Sydney In Surprise Setback for China|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 5, 2009|author=Riding, Alan|date=September 24, 1993[/tpl]
Human rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.

===Costs===

On March 6, 2009 the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the games was "generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million.[tpl]cite web|title=Surplus of Beijing Olympic Games exceeds 16 million USD|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90884/6608035.html|publisher=People's Daily Online|date=March 6, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl]  Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 billion to $44 billion, which would make the Games "far and away the most expensive ever".[tpl]cite news|author=Rabinovitch, Simon|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Olympics/idUSPEK25823820080805|title=Beijing Games to be costliest, but no debt legacy|date=August 5, 2008|agency=Reuters|accessdate=June 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://english.pravda.ru/sports/games/06-08-2008/106003-beijing_olympics-0/|title=Beijing Olympics to cost China 44 billion dollars|work=Pravda|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=July 295, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/jul/28/olympicgames2008.china1|title=The cost of the Beijing Olympics|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=June 5, 2009 [/tpl]

===Venues===

By May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[tpl]cite news |publisher=BOCOG |date=May 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 11, 2007 |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/01/32/article214073201.shtml |title=All Beijing-based Olympic venues under construction[/tpl] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing as well as 59 training centres. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics.[tpl]cite web | title = Beijing Olympics funding exceeds $43 bn | publisher = NDTV.com | date = August 4, 2008 | url = http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/showsports.aspx?id=SPOEN20080060086&ch=8/4/2008%209:09:00%20PM | accessdate =August 10, 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the "uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.[tpl]cite web | title = Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Venue | publisher = Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad | url = http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/equ/index.shtml | accessdate =August 10, 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080809223815/http://en.beijing2008.cn/venues/equ/index.shtml| archivedate= August 9, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The centrepiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed "The Bird's Nest" because of its nest-like skeletal structure.  The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics competition.[tpl]cite news|title=Supporters, protesters greet Olympic torch's arrival in Beijing |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/08/06/beijing-protesters.html|publisher=CBC News|date=August 6, 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2009[/tpl] Construction of the venue began on December 24, 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0501/design_1-1.html|title=China's Banner Stadium|author=Libby, Brian|date=May 1, 2002|work=Architecture Week|accessdate=June 5, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090423073050/http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0501/design_1-1.html| archivedate= April 23, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design.

The selection of the design became official in April 2003. Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423 million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.[tpl]cite journal |last= Pasternack|first= Alex|author2= Clifford A.

The 2008 Beijing Olympics caused traditional Hutong neighborhoods to be cleared for the construction of modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: “They government don’t want foreigners to see this scarred old face”. Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).

===Transport===

To prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.architectureweek.com/2008/0730/design_1-1.html| title=Beijing Terminal 3 by Foster| author=Jo Baker| work=Architecture Week|accessdate=August 16, 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080815025557/http://www.architectureweek.com/2008/0730/design_1-1.html| archivedate= August 15, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of 7 lines and 80 stations to the previously existing 4 lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[tpl]cite news |url = http://en.beijing2008.cn/05/25/article214012505.shtml |title = 38 public transit routes to the Olympic venues |publisher = BOCOG |date = January 22, 2007 |accessdate =January 29, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2008/08/02/volkswagen-claims-green-medal-at-2008-olympic-games-in-beijing.html|title=Volkswagen claims ‘Green’ medal at 2008 Olympic Games | author= AUSmotive.com | date=August 2, 2008 | accessdate=August 2, 2008 | archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080819044237/http://www.ausmotive.com/2008/08/02/volkswagen-claims-green-medal-at-2008-olympic-games-in-beijing.html| archivedate= August 19, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/world/asia/15china.html?hp|title=Traffic Beijing Stops Construction for Olympics | author= Andrew Jacobs | date=April 14, 2008 |work=New York Times | accessdate=April 14, 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080420095239/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/world/asia/15china.html?hp| archivedate= April 20, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] From June 20 through September 20, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/23/2282484.htm?site=olympics/2008 |title=Beijing to launch Olympic 'odd-even' car ban | author= Reuters | date=June 23, 2008 | publisher=ABC news | accessdate=June 23, 2008 | archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080625095341/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/23/2282484.htm?site=olympics/2008| archivedate= June 25, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character jīng (京, "national capital", also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolised the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was very happy with the emblem, saying, "Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people."[tpl]cite news |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200308/03/eng20030803_121618.shtml |title = Rogge's Message for Beijing Olympics Emblem Unveiling |publisher = People's Daily Online |date = August 3, 2003 |accessdate =December 19, 2006[/tpl]

The mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each representing both a colour of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture.  In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (for some multi-discipline sports, such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[tpl]cite web |url = http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/pictograms/ |title = Pictograms of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games |publisher = BOCOG |year = 2006 |accessdate =August 22, 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080822030710/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/pictograms/| archivedate= August 22, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url = http://en.beijing2008.cn/37/34/article212033437.shtml |title = Pictograms of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games unveiled |publisher = BOCOG |date = August 7, 2006 |accessdate =July 12, 2012[/tpl]  This set of sport icons was named the beauty of seal characters, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.

According to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7 billion viewers worldwide tuned into some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger than the 3.9 billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.  American broadcaster NBC produced only 2 hours of online streaming video for the 2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200 hours of coverage for the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, "live online video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, not part of the overall 'broadcast rights.'"

The design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the "Propitious Clouds" (祥云).

The relay began March 24, 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on March 31. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[tpl]cite news |publisher=BOCOG |url=http://torchrelay.beijing2008.cn/en/news/headlines/n214042288.shtml |title=Beijing 2008 Olympic Torch Relay Planned Route and Torch Design unveiled |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2007[/tpl]

The originally proposed route would have taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong.

===National participation changes===

Athletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and using the National Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the games as "Chinese Taipei," rather than "China-Taipei," as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.[tpl]cite news | last = Callick | first = Rowan | title = Taiwan clears Games hurdle |work=The Australian | date = August 4, 2008 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24123163-5013406,00.html | accessdate =June 15, 2009[/tpl]

A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.[tpl]cite news | last = Wilson | first = Stephen | title = North, South Korea Fail To Broker Joint Olympics March | agency = Associated Press | date = August 7, 2008 | url = http://www.nysun.com/foreign/north-south-korea-fail-to-broker-joint-olympics/83398/ | accessdate =June 15, 2009[/tpl]

===Participation of athletes with disabilities===

South African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.[tpl]cite news | last = Hart | first = Simon | title = Dreams carry Natalie Du Toit to Beijing | publisher = The Telegraph | date = May 4, 2008 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/swimming/2299269/Dreams-carry-Natalie-Du-Toit-to-Beijing.html | accessdate =June 15, 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090530170103/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/swimming/2299269/Dreams-carry-Natalie-Du-Toit-to-Beijing.html| archivedate= May 30, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, who was born without a right forearm,  competed in Table Tennis in both the 2008 Olympic Games and 2008 Paralympic Games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/blog/2008/06/18/natalia-paralympic-and-olympic-athlete.php |title=Natalia: Paralympic AND Olympic athlete |accessdate=June 15, 2009[/tpl]

In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the games were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as "cancer-causing mineral water."Stephen Hutcheon, Was China's milk scandal hushed up?, "The full list of edicts", New Zealand Herald (September 15, 2008) As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.China accused over contaminated baby milk, The Daily Telegraph (September 15, 2008)China Says Complaints About Milk Began in 2007, The New York Times (September 23, 2008) "

The long-term economic impact of the games on China and Beijing in particular is not yet clear.
