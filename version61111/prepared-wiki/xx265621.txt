Talk That Talk is the sixth studio album by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna, first released on November 18, 2011, by Def Jam Recordings. In 2011, Rihanna decided to re-release her previous studio album Loud (2010), however she revealed that the idea had been scrapped and she would instead release her sixth studio album. The album was recorded between February and November 2011, predominantly during Rihanna's Loud Tour.
As executive producer, Rihanna enlisted a wide range of producers including Alex da Kid, Mr. Bangladesh, Calvin Harris, Chase & Status, Cirkut, Da Internz, Dr. Luke, Ester Dean, Gareth McGrillen, Hit-Boy, No I.D., Priscilla Renea, Rob Swire, StarGate, The-Dream. Musically, Talk That Talk follows in the same vein as Loud. The album is predominantly  dance-oriented pop and R&B, that incorporates elements of hip hop, dubstep and house music. The album also continues to have subtle dancehall genres, whilst "Talk That Talk"'s lyrical content and themes revolve around a nihilist romantic and lascivious lover.
Upon its release, Talk That Talk received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 198,000 copies in the United States. As of November 2013, the album has sold 1.12 million copies in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5793204/rihanna-hits-10-million-in-us-album-sales|title=Rihanna Hits 10 Million in U.S. Album Sale|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013[/tpl] The album peaked at number one in Austria, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 163,000 copies in its first week.

Singer-songwriters and producers Jay-Z, Alex da Kid, Ester Dean, Calvin Harris, Sean Combs, Dr. Luke and The-Dream contributed to the album. Kuk Harrell, one of the producers of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before we went on the European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am."http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/10/13/rihanna_recording_new_album_talk_that_ In May 2012, Rihanna revealed that whilst she was recording the album, she suffered from exhaustion, saying in part: "It was the best s**t ever, it was some rock star s**t. This is the craziest schedule I've ever been on in my entire life. One morning I woke up and started crying so hard. I finally just got to my bed from the IV drip and I was just like, 'Good I can actually get to sleep tonight', because we stayed up all night' and I finished album at 5 pm the day before..."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/rihanna/354661-rihanna-talk-that-talk-breakdown|accessdate=February 13, 2014|date=May 11, 2012|title=Rihanna 'Suffered A Breakdown' While Making LP|publisher=MTV UK[/tpl]

==Music and lyrics==

Talk That Talk is a danceable pop album, comprising uptempo club tracks, raunchy pop songs, and mid-tempo inspirational ballads. It also incorporates elements of R&B, hip hop, and house. Most of the songs feature heavy bass and coarse sounds, including electro beats and imposing synthesizers. James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph cites Talk That Talk as Rihanna's "most club-ready album to date", while Robert Christgau calls it "pop without shame—her hookiest and most dance-targeted album, decorated with a thoughtful assortment of suitably titillating blats, noodles, dubs, groans, hiccups, boom-booms, cut-ups, speed-ups, xx samples, and spoken-word bits." Jon Caramanica of The New York Times writes that Rihanna's version of dance music on the album draws on "the club music of the early 1990s". The album's lyrics posit Rihanna as a nihilist romantic and lascivious lover.[tpl]cite news|last=Ferrier|first=Morwenna|date=November 19, 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/nov/20/rihanna-talk-that-talk-review|title=Rihanna: Talk That Talk – review|newspaper=The Observer|location=London|at=The New Review section, p. 33|accessdate=March 1, 2013[/tpl]
The album also has subtle dancehall influences, with slower songs that have double-snare riddims. Music journalist Greg Kot observes that, along with droning electronic sounds, "Caribbean and Eastern touches from past Rihanna albums get recycled into bombastic dance tunes."[tpl]cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|date=November 21, 2011|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-rihanna-album-review-talk-that-talk-reviewed-20111121,0,4041412.column|title=Album review: Rihanna, 'Talk That Talk'|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=March 1, 2013[/tpl] Apart from its sexual innuendo, Talk That Talk features odes to dysfunctional love and universal love. Christgau interprets the lyrics to be "associating carnality with love" and writes that the album "celebrates the relationship of sex to love rather than pain," before leaning on "heart songs and theme statements" in the second half."

The opening track, "You Da One", which was produced by Dr. Luke, is a bouncy mid-tempo song with a Caribbean flavor, and features a dubstep influenced breakdown towards the middle of the song.[tpl]cite web|last=Copsey|first=Robert|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/thesound/a350264/rihannas-new-album-talk-that-talk-first-listen.html|title=Rihanna's new album 'Talk That Talk': First listen – Music Blog – Digital Spy|publisher=Digital Spy.

The title track features rapper Jay-Z and samples The Notorious B.I.G.'s "I Got a Story to Tell". "Roc Me Out" is set in "chugging" tempo and features heavy synths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2011/11/14/rihanna-talk-that-talk-watch-n-learn-leak-new/|title= Rihanna's Talk That Talk – Reviewed: Watch n' Learn|publisher= Popdust.

In a mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times expressed dissatisfaction with the themes of the album and stated, "The singer works that NC-17 territory, but the sauciness sometimes borders on shtick.

Her pop songs are always danceable, often catchy and consistently awesome – sometimes they even have some substance to them.

The performance of the medley with the original interlude version of "Birthday Cake" and "Talk That Talk" started with the singer performing "Birthday Cake" and featured Rihanna in an all black outfit with a giant spiders web as the backdrop behind her. After she performed a short section of the song, it transitioned into "Talk That Talk", where she performed her part of the song in full, without the rap vocal by Jay-Z.
