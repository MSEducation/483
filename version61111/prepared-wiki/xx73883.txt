The Lady's Magazine or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex, Appropriated Solely to Their Use and Amusement, was a British fashion magazine produced every month from 1770 until 1837 and cost six pence per copy. It was started in August 1770 by London bookseller John Coote and publisher John Wheble. This was by no means the first women's magazine, as The Ladies' Mercury had been published in 1693.
It is sometimes confused with the Ladies' Magazine published in Boston, Massachusetts.
