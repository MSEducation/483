CATEGORIES: 2011 greatest hits albums, Steps albums, Jive Records compilation albums

The Ultimate Collection is the second greatest hits album released by pop group Steps, released in October 2011, by Sony Music Entertainment. The album was released to mark the tenth anniversary of the group's split back in 2001, it was also ten years since the group released their first greatest hits album Gold: Greatest Hits and was Steps' first release since the release of their 2002 compilation, The Last Dance. The Ultimate Collection was going to be released with out without Steps and they thought it was the right time to get back together to support the album release. 
By Steps re-forming it spawned a TV show Steps Reunion on Sky Living documenting the groups journey in Steps, how they split, what they have done since and how they would work as a group this time around. The show was a huge success, leading the album to peak at number 1 in the UK albums chart and for the group to go on tour in 2012. The album features Steps' first recording in ten years, a cover of the ABBA hit "Dancing Queen". 

==Album information==

The track listing places the singles in chronological order and is similar to the 2001 Gold: Greatest Hits compilation. However, The Ultimate Collection includes the singles "I Know Him So Well" and "You'll Be Sorry", not featured on Gold but excludes the single "Words Are Not Enough" (although the music video is included on the DVD edition). 
The release features a version of ABBA's "Dancing Queen" featured as a bonus track. The deluxe edition of the album includes a DVD containing all of Steps' music videos and a live recording of "I Know Him So Well" from the Abbamania TV Special. The standard version of the album featured a black cover  while the deluxe edition has a white cover and both have a cardboard sleeve surrounding the jewel case. Steps have signed the booklets on both CD and deluxe editions. In its first week of release The Ultimate Collection sold 34,200 copies entering the UK Albums chart at No. 1 where it took the top spot for a week and spent 18 weeks within the chart.

The Ultimate Collection: Tour Edition was released on 30 April 2012http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=280;0;-1;-1;-1&sku=633718 to coincide with their first arena tour in ten years since their Gold Tour. The release includes a bonus disc of karaoke versions of the singles. During the Steps Reunion TV show plans for a tour started to develop with each member of the group having mixed feeling weather or not to release tickets, they sold out all of their initial dates which led to adding more dates. The group filmed another TV documentary entitled Steps: On The Road Again which followed the group on tour and showed the issues they faced whilst touring together as a band.
