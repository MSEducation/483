Reid Hall, also known as "The Castle," is a historic academic building located on the campus of Manhattanville College at Purchase, Westchester County, New York. It is a four story, "L" shaped building built of granite blocks in the Renaissance Revival style.  It features a five story tower and a corbelled battlement parapet that conceals a flat roof.  It was designed by Stanford White and built in 1892 as a dwelling for Whitelaw Reid. Frederick Law Olmsted was hired to landscape his estate.  Reid Hall occupies the footprint of the previous property owner Ben Holladay's Ophir Hall, which burnt down and was rebuilt by Reid with the massive granite crenellated mansion. The building was expanded in 1912 by McKim, Mead & White with a large library wing and guest cottage.  Reid Hall was at one time a potential site for the United Nations.  The property was purchased by Manhattanville College in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10683|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Reid Hall, Manhattanville College|date=March 1973|accessdate=2010-12-30 |author=Edna Hibbs, Joan M.
