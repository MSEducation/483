A Snakebite is an alcoholic drink made with equal parts of lager or stouthttp://brooklynbrewshop.com/themash/beer-cocktail-snakebite/ and (hard) cider.[tpl]cite news |title=Spirits: Beer cocktails |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2010/04/13/ST2010041302652.html |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2010-04-14 |accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Jason | last=Wilson[/tpl]
Snakebite is a popular drink in the United Kingdom where it is made with lager and may be served with a dash of blackcurrant squash, which is referred to as a snakebite and black.http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink2081.html Stout may be used instead of lager when the drink is served in the United States.
Snakebite and black (with blackcurrant) is also known by the name Diesel.http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink250.html This drink is historically popular in student union bars. A particularly strong variant involves a double measure of vodka poured into the drink; this is known as a turbo diesel.
Though Snakebites are usually served mixed, some drinkers prefer to float the beer on top of the cider.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Even if the beer and the cider are perfectly clear before being mixed, the resulting drink will often be cloudy unless it was made with a dry cider.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Availability in the UK==

A Snakebite is typically served in pint servings. UK licensing laws make half-pint servings difficult, as the two main ingredients would have to be dispensed in strictly controlled quarter-pint servings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] In June 2001, former US President Bill Clinton was refused a Snakebite when he ordered one at the Old Bell Tavern in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. A manager of the pub, Jamie Allen, stated: "It's illegal to serve it here in the UK, you see."
Serving a Snakebite from separate cider and lager taps or bottles is not illegal in the UK,http://www.delavals.com/blog-loz-horan/1-the-snakebite-myth/ despite sources which suggest otherwise. It is often said that the illegality arises due to mixing two drinks with differing alcohol contents, but this makes the Snakebite no different from a cocktail.
