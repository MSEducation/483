The eventual winners were Nico and Vlad Miriţă with the dual-language Romanian/Italian "Pe-o margine de lume". Romania took part in the first semi-final on 20 May 2008, and qualified to compete in the final.

==National final==

The road to Romania's Eurovision entry commenced when the competition was opened in December 2007, allowing artists of any nationality to submit songs that would then be judged by an internal panel of experts.[tpl] cite web | title = Romania: TVR confirms 23rd February for final | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/9946[/tpl] Esctoday [tpl]En icon[/tpl] The panel shortlisted 24 songs, out of 282 submitted compositions, to compete in the national final. Four reserve songs were also chosen in case of any disqualifications or withdrawals before the first semifinal.[tpl] cite web | title = TVR announced the 24 songs | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10148[/tpl] Esctoday [tpl]En icon[/tpl] The songs where then equally divided into two semi-finals in which the top 6 songs voted by a 50/50 jury-televote combination would proceed to the final evening on February 23, 2008.
The selection was notable for the number of foreign acts taking part. In particular, LaGaylia Frazier, Biondo, and Rednex were Swedish artists present in the competition. Also, Maya Slatinsek from Slovenia was originally selected to be part of the national final, however, she withdrew her song after being accepted to compete in the Irish national selection.[tpl] cite web | title = Maja drops Romania for Ireland | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10257[/tpl] Esctoday [tpl]En icon[/tpl] In addition to foreign acts, former Eurovision participant Nicola entered once again with the prospect of representing Romania for a second time at Eurovision.
After two semi-finals on February 9 and February 16, 2008, twelve songs had qualified to the final round. However, some changes to the running order did occur. Cătălin Josan qualified both of his song to the final but decided to withdraw "When We're Together" from the contest in order to achieve a better result and not split his vote amongst both of his songs. TVR decided to enter Rednex feat. Ro-mania with "Railroad, railroad" into the contest as a replacement.[tpl] cite web | title = Romania: Catalin withdraws song, Rednex in final | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10560[/tpl] Esctoday [tpl]En icon[/tpl] Furthermore, VH2 also withdrew their song, "Follow Me" because of a possible plagiarism claim.[tpl] cite web | title = VH2 replaced by New Effect feat.
