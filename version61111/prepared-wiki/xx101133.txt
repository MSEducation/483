[[Bravo-class submarine]]

CATEGORIES: Russian and Soviet navy submarine classes

The Project 690 Kefal ("Mullet") class (known in the West by its NATO reporting name Bravo class) was a design of military submarines that were built in the Soviet Union. The boats were designed for use in ASW exercises, but could also be employed in a combat role. Four vessels were built, which were commissioned into the Soviet Navy between 1967 and 1970. All four boats were stricken in the 1990s.
