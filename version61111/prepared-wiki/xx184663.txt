[[Wucharia]]

CATEGORIES: Carnivorous cryptids, Jackals

Wucharia or Wucharia jackal is an unrecognized canid species or subspecies (Canis aureus lupaster or Canis lupus arabs), reported from the very dry Danakil Depression desert on the coast of Eritrea in December 2002. The animal was seen by Mr. Jugal Kishore Tiwari and reported to the Canids SG by Satish Kumar. Some authors suppose that the animals were individuals of the Arabian wolf, an isolated form of the Egyptian jackal, or a totally new species related to both of them.
