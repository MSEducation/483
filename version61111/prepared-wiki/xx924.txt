Since World War II there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty. In 1977, 16 countries were abolitionist. According to information published by Amnesty International in 2012, 97 countries had abolished capital punishment altogether, 8 had done so for all offences except under special circumstances, and 36 had not used it for at least 10 years or were under a moratorium. The other 57 retained the death penalty in active use.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries|title=Abolitionist and Retentionist Countries|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2008-06-10[/tpl]
According to Amnesty International, only 21 countries were known to have had executions carried out in 2012.http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2013/en/bbfea0d6-39b2-4e5f-a1ad-885a8eb5c607/act500012013en.pdf In addition, there are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly China.http://www.eai.nus.edu.sg/BB412.pdf At least 18,750 people worldwide were under sentence of death at the beginning of 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/n/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2011|title=THE DEATH PENALTY IN 2011|publisher=Amnesty.org|accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl]
The use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in some retentionist countries including Taiwan and Singapore.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin Luther King, Jr|url=http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/3493-heroin-smuggler-challenges-singapore-death-sentence|title=Heroin smuggler challenges Singapore death sentence|publisher=Yoursdp.org|date=16 March 2010|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl] Indonesia carried out no executions between November 2008 and March 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Indonesia: First Execution in 4 Years a Major Setback|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/21/indonesia-first-execution-4-years-major-setback|work=Human Rights Watch|publisher=http://www.hrw.org|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl] Japan and 32 out of 50 states in the United States are the only OECD members that are classified by Amnesty International as 'retentionist' (South Korea is classified as 'abolitionist in practice'). Nearly all of retentionist countries are situated in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. The only retentionist country in Europe is Belarus. The death penalty was overwhelmingly practised in poor and authoritarian states, which often employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. During the 1980s, the democratisation of Latin America swelled the rank of abolitionist countries.
This was soon followed by the fall of communism in Europe. Many of the countries which restored democracy aspired to enter the EU. The European Union and the Council of Europe both strictly require member states not to practise the death penalty (see Capital punishment in Europe). Public support for the death penalty in the EU varies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=2165|title=International Polls & Studies|publisher=The Death Penalty Information Center|accessdate=2008-04-01[/tpl] The last execution on the present day territory of the Council of Europe has taken place in 1997 in Ukraine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |title=Death Penalty - Council of Europe |publisher=Hub.coe.int |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&nome=ukraine |title=HANDS OFF CAIN against death penalty in the world |publisher=Handsoffcain.info |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl] On the other hand, rapid industrialisation in Asia has been increasing the number of developed retentionist countries. In these countries, the death penalty enjoys strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media; in China there is a small but growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cadpnet.com/show.asp?id=689|title=China Against Death Penalty ( CADP)|publisher=Cadpnet.com|date=2012-03-31|accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl] This trend has been followed by some African and Middle Eastern countries where support for the death penalty is high.
Some countries have resumed practicing the death penalty after having suspended executions for long periods. The United States suspended executions in 1972 but resumed them in 1976, then again on 25 September 2007 to 16 April 2008; there was no execution in India between 1995 and 2004; and Sri Lanka declared an end to its moratorium on the death penalty on 20 November 2004,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details_p.asp?NewsID=16269|title=AIUK : Sri Lanka: President urged to prevent return to death penalty after 29-year moratorium|publisher=Amnesty.org.uk|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] although it has not yet performed any executions. The Philippines re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but abolished it again in 2006.
In May 2013, Papua New Guinea lawmakers voted to introduce the death penalty for crimes such as rape, robbery and sorcery-related murder, and introduce punishments such as electrocution, firing squad and suffocation.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In 2012, Japan and the US were the only countries in the G8 to have carried out executions; and the US was the only country to have carried out executions in the Americas. In 2012, there were 43 executions in the US, which have taken place in nine states: Arizona (6), Delaware (1), Florida (3), Idaho (1), Mississippi (6), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (6), South Dakota (2), Texas (15).
The latest country to move towards abolition is Mongolia. In January 2012, its Parliament adopted a bill providing for the death penalty to be abolished."Mongolia takes ‘vital step forward’ in abolishing the death penalty", Amnesty International, 5 January 2011

===Offenses other than murder===

====Drug related offenses====

Some countries that retain the death penalty for murder and other violent crimes do not execute offenders for drug-related crimes. Countries that have statutory provisions for the death penalty for drug-related offences [tpl]as of | 2012 | lc = on[/tpl] include:

====Non-drug related offenses====

Non-fatal crimes, other than those related to drugs, that are punishable by death include "adultery" and "sodomy" (Saudi Arabia, Iran), religious offences such as "apostasy" (Saudi Arabia, Iran) and "blasphemy" (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan), "sorcery" (Saudi Arabia), economic crimes (China), rape (Saudi Arabia), forms of "aggravated" robbery (Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Zambia), "treason", "acts against national security" and other "crimes against the state" (Iran, Gambia, Kuwait, Lebanon, North Korea, Palestinian Authority, Somalia).

===Juvenile offenders===

The death penalty for juvenile offenders (criminals aged under 18 years at the time of their crime) has become increasingly rare. Considering the Age of Majority is still not 18 in some countries, since 1990 nine countries have executed offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes: The People's Republic of China (PRC), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United States (see List of juvenile offenders executed in the United States), and Yemen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/juvWorld.cfm|title=Juvenile executions (except US)|publisher=Internationaljusticeproject.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] The PRC, Pakistan, the United States, Yemen and Iran have since raised the minimum age to 18.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranwpd.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=3066:iran-changes-law-for-execution-of-juveniles&Itemid=64|title=Iran changes law for execution of juveniles|publisher=Iranwpd.com|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ghanoononline.ir/NSite/FullStory/News/?Serv=19&Id=16270|title=مجازات قصاص برای افراد زیر 18 سال ممنوع شد|publisher=Ghanoononline.ir|accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl] Amnesty International has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offenses as juveniles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/executions-of-child-offenders-since-1990|title=Executions of juveniles since 1990|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl] The PRC does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT500152004|title=Stop Child Executions!

Virginia.Supreme Court bars executing mentally retarded CNN.com Law Center. 25 June 2002

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37(a), has been signed by all countries and ratified, except for Somalia and the United States (notwithstanding the latter's Supreme Court decisions abolishing the practice).UNICEF, Convention of the Rights of the Child – FAQ: "The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely and rapidly ratified human rights treaty in history. Only two countries, Somalia and the United States, have not ratified this celebrated agreement. Somalia is currently unable to proceed to ratification as it has no recognised government. By signing the Convention, the United States has signaled its intention to ratify, but has yet to do so." The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. A majority of countries are also party to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (whose Article 6.5 also states that "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age...").
In Japan, the minimum age for the death penalty is 18 as mandated by the internationals standards. But under Japanese law, anyone under 20 is considered a juvenile. There are three men currently on death row for crimes they committed at age 18 or 19.

====Iran====

Iran, despite its ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was the world's biggest executioner of juvenile offenders, for which it has received international condemnation; the country's record is the focus of the Stop Child Executions Campaign. But on 10 February 2012 Iran's parliament changed the controversial law of executing juveniles. In the new law, the age of 18 (solar year) would be for both genders considered and juvenile offenders will be sentenced on a separate law than of adults. Based on the Islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year (11 days shorter than a solar year) were fully responsible for their crimes.
Iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently has roughly 140 people on death row for crimes committed as juveniles (up from 71 in 2007).Iranian activists fight child executions[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl], Ali Akbar Dareini, Associated Press, 17 September 2008.

====Somalia====

There is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of Somalia controlled by the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). In October 2008, a girl, Aisho Ibrahim Dhuhulow was buried up to her neck at a football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a shariah court in Kismayo, a city controlled by the ICU. According to a local leader associated with the ICU, she had stated that she wanted shariah law to apply.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7694397.stm|title=Somali woman executed by stoning|date=27 October 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-10-31[/tpl] However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, that she begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7708169.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Stoning victim 'begged for mercy'|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=2010-04-14[/tpl] Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by the al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/somalia-girl-stoned-was-child-13-20081031|title=Somalia: Girl stoned was a child of 13|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2008-10-31[/tpl]

==Controversy and debate==

There are many organizations worldwide, such as Amnesty International, and country-specific, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), that have abolition of the death penalty as a fundamental purpose.Brian Evans, "The Death Penalty In 2011: Three Things You Should Know", Amnesty International, March 26, 2012, in particular the map, "Executions and Death Sentences in 2011"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aclu.org/capital-punishment |title=ACLU Capital Punishment Project (CPP) |publisher=Aclu.org |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl]

===Human rights===

Abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and judicial execution violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. Albert Camus wrote in a 1956 book called Reflections on the Guillotine, Resistance, Rebellion & Death:
[tpl]Quote|An execution is not simply death. It is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison. ... For there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.smu.edu/rhalperi/ |title=Death Penalty News & Updates |publisher=People.smu.edu |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl][/tpl]
In the classic doctrine of natural rights as expounded by for instance Locke and Blackstone, on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited.Joel Feinberg: Voluntary Euthanasia and the Inalienable Right to Life The Tanner Lecture on Human Values, 1 April 1977.

===Wrongful execution===

It is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to miscarriage of justice through the wrongful execution of innocent persons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=412&scid=6|title=Innocence and the Death Penalty|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] Many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.Capital Defense Weekly[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/innocent.html|date=20070804222621|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justicedenied.org/executed.htm|title=Executed Innocents|publisher=Justicedenied.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://mitglied.lycos.de/PeterWill/penal9.htm|title=Wrongful executions|publisher=Mitglied.lycos.de|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl]
Some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt from in the US from 1992 through 2004. Newly available DNA evidence prevented the pending execution of more than 15 death row inmates during the same period in the US,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/575.php|title=The Innocence Project – News and Information: Press Releases|publisher=Innoccenceproject.org|accessdate=2010-08-23[/tpl] but DNA evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases.[tpl]cite web|last=Lundin|first=Leigh|title=Casey Anthony Trial– Aftermath|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=17459|work=Capital Punishment|publisher=Criminal Brief|location=Orlando|date=10 July 2011|quote=With 400 condemned on death row, Florida is an extremely aggressive death penalty state, a state that will even execute for drug trafficking.[/tpl] However, since the death penalty reinstatement in the United States during the 1970s, no inmate executed has been granted posthumous pardon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/executed-possibly-innocent#also|title=Executed But Possibly Innocent | Death Penalty Information Center|publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org|accessdate=2012-04-30[/tpl]
Also improper procedure may result in unfair executions. For example, Amnesty International argues that in Singapore "the Misuse of Drugs Act contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. This conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty".Amnesty International, "Singapore – The death penalty: A hidden toll of executions" (January 2004) This refers to a situation when someone is being caught with drugs. In this situation, in almost any jurisdiction, the prosecution has a prima facie case.

===Retribution===

Supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as multiple homicide, child murder, torture murder and mass killing such as terrorism, massacre, or genocide. Some even argue that not applying death penalty in latter cases is patently unjust. This argument is strongly defended by New York law professor Robert Blecker,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty_profiles/robert_blecker/ |title=New York Law School :: Robert Blecker |publisher=Nyls.edu |accessdate=2013-04-14[/tpl] who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. It would be unfair that those who have committed these horrible crimes stay alive, even incarcerated.
Abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. Others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that life without parole is a sufficient substitute. It is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another killing is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act (e.g. rapists are not punished by being sexually assaulted).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/capitalpunishment/against_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Ethics - Capital punishment: Arguments against capital punishment |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]

===Racial, ethic and social class bias===

Opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-race |title=Death Penalty and Race | Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eji.org/deathpenalty/racialbias |title=Racial Bias | Equal Justice Initiative |publisher=Eji.org |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]http://www.ncadp.org/pages/racial-bias

Again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted a second resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in the UN General Assembly (Third Committee) on 20 November. 105 countries voted in favour of the draft resolution, 48 voted against and 31 abstained.
A range of amendments proposed by a small minority of pro-death penalty countries were overwhelmingly defeated. It had in 2007 passed a non-binding resolution (by 104 to 54, with 29 abstentions) by asking its member states for "a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1849885920071218|title=U.N.

A number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the Sixth Protocol (abolition in time of peace) and the 13th Protocol (abolition in all circumstances) to the European Convention on Human Rights. The same is also stated under the Second Protocol in the American Convention on Human Rights, which, however has not been ratified by all countries in the Americas, most notably Canada and the United States. Most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-death.htm|title=Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR|accessdate=2007-12-08|publisher=Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights[/tpl]
Several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty (during time of peace) a requirement of membership, most notably the European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe. The EU and the Council of Europe are willing to accept a moratorium as an interim measure. Thus, while Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and the death penalty remains codified in its law, it has not made use of it since becoming a member of the Council - Russia has not executed anyone since 1996. With the exception of Russia (abolitionist in practice), Kazakhstan (abolitionist for ordinary crimes only), and Belarus (retentionist), all European countries are classified as abolitionist.
Latvia abolished de jure the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last EU member to do so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/death-sentences-and-executions-in-2012 |title=The Death Penalty in 2012 | Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]
The Protocol no.13 calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes). The majority of European countries have signed and ratified it. Some European countries have not done this, but all of them except Belarus and Kazakhstan have now abolished the death penalty in all circumstances (de jure, and Russia de facto). Poland is the most recent country to ratify the protocol, on 28 August 2013.
