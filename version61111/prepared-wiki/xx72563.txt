==History==

===Foundations===

The company was founded by Gottlob Auwärter in Stuttgart in 1935,[tpl]cite web|title=Locations – The plants of NEOPLAN Bus GmbH|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/Locations/Locations.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1935 to 1953|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1935_to_1953.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514155630/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1935_to_1953.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] and manufactured bodywork for bus and truck chassis.  From the very beginning, the designs of the buses produced were considered stylish.  After World War II, an all-steel body design was developed, a rarity at that time.  By 1953, the company had moved away from manufacturing buses on truck chassis, to a partial monocoque design with a steel tube skeleton, providing the structural support,[tpl]cite web|title=History – The story of NEOPLAN Bus GmbH|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/History.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514155625/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/History.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] enhanced by welded side panels.  The engine was moved to the rear, and the running gear and body functioned as one. In 1957, air suspension was made available, improving the ride of the bus for passengers.

===1960s===

In 1961, a new bus design, the Hamburg,[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1961 to 1964|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1961_to_1964.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514190829/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1961_to_1964.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. At a time when most coaches were rounded, bulbous or streamlined, the new design had clear-cut lines with edges and large windows. Developed by the founder's eldest son, Albrecht Auwärter, and another student, Swiss national Bob Lee, as part of their dissertation at Hamburg University. The design also allowed every passenger to regulate their fresh air supply through a nozzle from two air ducts, commonly seen today.
Both Albrecht and Lee joined NEOPLAN after graduating from the university.  Albrecht took over management of the company in 1965, and Bob Lee later became head of Engineering and Design.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
In 1964, the founder's second son, Konrad Auwärter, developed a double-deck bus design for a service bus as part of his dissertation.  The 'Do-Bus' design had low weight, and could carry over 100 passengers. It also featured a low-frame front axle with forward-mounted steering gear that permitted a low flat floor. The double-deck principle was applied to the coach design, creating a high-capacity comfortable touring vehicle. This vehicle was known as the Skyliner.[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1965 to 1971|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1966_to_1971.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===1970s===

In 1971, the Cityliner was introduced to the public. This design had a passenger platform above the driver's cab, and included an onboard toilet. The vehicle also made use, of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body, this was the first instance when this technique was used. In 1973, the Jetliner was introduced,[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1972 to 1975|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1972_to_1975.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514190844/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1972_to_1975.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] featuring a large one-piece windshield, with the driver and door windows sloping from the passenger window line down to the bottom of the windshield level.
A second manufacturing facility opened in Pilsting in 1973, and a third opened in Kumasi, Ghana in December 1974 to support increasing orders.
In 1975, the Jumbocruiser was launched, a double-deck articulated coach [tpl]convert|18|m|ftin|0[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|4|m|ftin|0[/tpl] high. The Spaceliner,[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1976 to 1981|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1976_to_1981.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514190849/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1976_to_1981.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] introduced in 1979 took the Cityliner concept of passenger floor level above the driver, and extended the actual floor above the cab. This kept the height of the vehicle lower than a double-decker, at [tpl]convert|3.65|m|0[/tpl], but still allowed installation of toilets, kitchens or sleep cabins below the passenger compartment.

===1980s===

A new fourth plant was added in 1981 in Berlin, and Bob Lee led the establishment of a fifth plant in Lamar, Colorado.  In 1984, a further plant was added in Honey Brook, Pennsylvania.  The United States plants were later spun off into a separate, and now defunct, independent company (Neoplan USA) that used the NEOPLAN name under licence.
In 1980, the United Kingdom deregulated services over [tpl]convert|35|mi|0[/tpl] in length. This led to intense competition on a variety of long-distance services, with operators looking to differentiate their service. NEOPLAN vehicles, with their futuristic design and high quality construction,[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] began to be imported in greater numbers.
The Metroliner was introduced in 1988.[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1982 to 1991|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1982_to_1991.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602003132/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1982_to_1991.jsp |archivedate = 2 June 2008[/tpl]  This vehicle was the first full monocoque bus in the world, requiring no separate chassis or skeleton.

===1990s===

A manufacturing facility was opened in Ehrenhain in 1990.
In 1992, the [tpl]convert|15|m|ftin|0[/tpl] four-axle Megaliner was introduced,[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1992 to 1996|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1992_to_1996.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] prompting a change in European Union regulations to allow non-articulated vehicles greater than [tpl]convert|12|m|ftin|0[/tpl] in length.  The Starliner was introduced in 1996, and would go on to win the Bus of the Year award for two consecutive years – in 1998 and 1999.[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 1997 to 1999|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1997_to_1999.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602003151/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/1997_to_1999.jsp |archivedate = 2 June 2008[/tpl]

===2000s===

In 2001, NEOPLAN, or correctly, "Gottlob Auwärter GmbH & Co KG" was acquired by MAN AG subsidy MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 2000 to 2002|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2000_to_2002.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514155635/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2000_to_2002.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] to form NEOMAN Bus GmbH.  The Starliner won the Bus of the Year award for two more consecutive years in 2001 and 2002.
A new coach designed for touring was introduced in 2003 under the name Tourliner,[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 2003 to 2004|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2003_to_2004.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514155640/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2003_to_2004.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl] and the Starliner was redesigned in 2004 and included the Electronic Stability Programme (ESP). The Trendliner was released in 2004, as a 'dual purpose' intercity and combination bus – which is designed to be used seven days a week.
In 2005, two new shorter [tpl]convert|13|m|ftin|0[/tpl] versions of the Tourliner and Trendliner were released.[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones – History from 2005 to 2007|url=http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2005_to_2007.jsp|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=NEOPLAN.de|accessdate=24 November 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080514122135/http://www.neoplan.de/en/The_fascination_of_NEOPLAN/History/Milestones/2005_to_2007.jsp |archivedate = 14 May 2008[/tpl]  From 2006, Euro4 compliant engines from MAN began being fitted in the new generation Cityliner.
In 2007, a new Auwärter Museum was opened in Landau/Isar.
On 1 February 2008, NEOMAN Bus GmbH was fully integrated into the Bus Division of the larger MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group, and ceased to exist in its own right.  NEOPLAN and MAN AG Buses now operate as two separate but integrated marques of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group.[tpl]cite web|title=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge integrates the Bus Division|url=http://www.man-mn.com/en/media/Press_releases/show_press.jsp?id=150102|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=MAN-mn.de|date=30 January 2008|accessdate=2 December 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] As a result of the reorganisation and restructuring of the Bus Division, NEOPLAN will concentrate on production at its Plauen and Pilsting sites, with Plauen being used for luxury coaches, whilst Pilsting will concentrate on customisations.[tpl]cite web|title=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge plans to concentrate the NEOPLAN coach production in Plauen|url=http://www.man-mn.com/en/media/Press_releases/show_press.jsp?id=154669|work=MAN Nutzfahrzeuge Group|publisher=MAN-mn.de|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=2 December 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080617212524/http://www.man-mn.com/en/media/Press_releases/show_press.jsp?id=154669 |archivedate = 17 June 2008[/tpl]
