Wound In Wall  is the debut album of the dark wave/post-punk band Feeding Fingers, released [tpl]start date|2007|8|28[/tpl]. Wound In Wall was the result of the purging of a large back-catalog of music that was written by Justin Curfman from aged 16 onward from 1996 to 2005 that never found a home in any of his film projects. The decision was made to re-arrange the music in such a way so as to be performed by a trio for the public during a lull between two of Curfman's film projects, Platelets: Lepidopteraphage and TICKS. But, the decision was made to carry on with Feeding Fingers beyond the initial release and to become something more than a short lived creative vacation from Curfman's film work.http://gothicrock.ru/din/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.217
Their first album was well received and found an audience most prominently in Middle- and Eastern-Europe.  Criticism of Justin Curfman's vocal likeness to Robert Smith has been disputed by Curfman himself, stating that "The similarity is not intentional. The quality and tone of my voice is what it is and I am not going to alter my delivery, tip toe around the association, or apologize... I donâ€™t know that I can go through puberty twice, so for the time being, this is my voice."http://www.justincurfman.com/treffpunkt_schwarz_transcript_interview_with_justin_curfman.htm
More than often, Wound In Wall is compared to that of Joy Division, Cocteau Twins, Echo and The Bunnymen, and early-Cure albums, like Seventeen Seconds, Faith, Pornography.http://gothicrock.ru/din/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.217http://www.treffpunkt-schwarz.de/interview-mit-feeding-fingers
