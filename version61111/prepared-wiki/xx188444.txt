The 1991 U.S. Open was the 91st U.S. Open, held June 13â€“17 at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, a suburb southwest of Minneapolis. Payne Stewart defeated 1987 champion Scott Simpson in an 18-hole Monday playoff to win the first of his two U.S. Open titles.[tpl]cite magazine|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1139895/index.htm|magazine=Sports Illustrated|title=Payne free at last|last=Reilly|first=Rick|date=June 24, 1991|page=24[/tpl] It was the second of Stewart's three major championships.
Stewart held the lead through each of the first three rounds, but in the final round he found himself trailing Simpson by a stroke heading to the 18th. Simpson hit his drive into the rough and could only manage a bogey to Stewart's par, forcing an 18-hole playoff. Both players shot a final-round 72 to finish at 282 total, three shots clear of Larry Nelson and Fred Couples. In the playoff, Simpson led by two-strokes heading to the 16th. He then bogeyed the hole, however, while Stewart made birdie to even up the contest. At the par-3 17th, Simpson found the water on his tee shot and recorded another bogey, giving Stewart an one-shot advantage. Simpson then made bogey on the 18th while Stewart made a par, giving Stewart a two-stroke win and the championship.GOLF; Stewart Captures Open as Simpson Falters Again Stewart's winning score in the playoff of 75 was the highest since Tommy Armour won with a 76 in 1927.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-18/sports/sp-806_1_18-hole-playoff|publisher=Los Angeles Times|title=U.S. Open: Stewart shows the finishing touch|last=Florence|first=Mal|date=June 18, 1991[/tpl]
