==Conservation status==

This species is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with the following criteria: B1ab(iii) (v3.1, 2001).[tpl]Redlist species|no=64340|genus=Ophryacus|species=melanurus|date=27 July|year=2008[/tpl] A species is listed as such when the best available evidence indicates that the geographic range, in the form of extent of occurrence, is estimated to be less than 5,000 km² (1,931 mi²), that estimates indicate it to be severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than 5 locations, and that a continuing decline has been observed, inferred or projected, in area, extent and/or quality of habitat. It is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. In 2007 when it was last assessed, the population trend was down.[tpl]Redlist CC2001|date=27 July|year=2008[/tpl]
