Clinton Rosemond (November 1, 1882 â€“ March 10, 1966) was an American actor in films from the 1930s and 40s. Often typecast as a butler or servant, and often uncredited due to a lack of film roles for African-American actors, Rosemond was frequently relegated to playing demeaning parts, such as a stereotypical "scared Negro."  He died in 1966 from a stroke.
