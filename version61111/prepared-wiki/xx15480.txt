The Boeing AH-64 Apache is a four-blade, twin-engine attack helicopter with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement, and a tandem cockpit for a two-man crew. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is armed with a [tpl]convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on[/tpl] M230 Chain Gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage. It has four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons, typically carrying a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has a large amount of systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.
The Apache originally started as the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced Attack Helicopter program to replace the AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D Apache Longbow, an upgraded Apache variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 1,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.
The U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64; it has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including Greece, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands and Singapore; as well as being produced under license in the United Kingdom as the AgustaWestland Apache. U.S. AH-64s have served in conflicts in Panama, the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip; British and Dutch Apaches have seen deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq.

===Advanced Attack Helicopter===

Following the cancellation of the AH-56 Cheyenne in 1972, in favor of U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps projects like the A-10 Thunderbolt II and Harrier, the United States Army sought an aircraft to fill an anti-armor attack role that would still be under Army command;[tpl]cite news |title= Army Cancels Helicopter Contract |publisher=Victoria Advocate |date= 10 August 1972[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=j8kPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=No0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5294,127450&dq=advanced+attack+helicopter&hl=en |title= Army Decides To Scrap Cheyenne Helicopter Gunship |publisher=Boca Raton News |date= 3 September 1972[/tpl] the 1948 Key West Agreement forbade the Army from owning combat fixed-wing aircraft. The Army wanted an aircraft better than the AH-1 Cobra in firepower, performance and range. It would have the maneuverability for terrain following nap-of-the-earth (NoE) flying.Bishop 2005, pp. 5–6.  To this end, the U.S. Army issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 15 November 1972.OAVCSA 1973, p. 10.[tpl]cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0091FFD3D55137B93C4A8178AD95F468785F9 |title= Army Seeking Bids On New Helicopter |work=New York Times |date= 16 November 1972[/tpl] As a sign of the importance of this project, in September 1973 the Army designated its five most important projects, the "Big Five" with AAH included.[tpl]cite web |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=H64hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hpoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1762,200656&dq=advanced+attack+helicopter&hl=en |title= New Army Tactic |publisher=Reading Eagle |date= 11 September 1973[/tpl]
Proposals were submitted by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition.Bishop 2005, p. 7. Each company built prototype helicopters and went through a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.Richardson and Peacock 1992, p. 8.Donald 2004, p. 114.
The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program under which three pre-production AH-64s would be built, additionally, the two YAH-64A flight prototypes and the ground test unit were upgraded to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missile.Bishop 2005, p. 8. Development of the Hellfire missile had began in 1974, originally known by the name of Helicopter Launched, Fire and Forget Missile ('Hellfire' being a shortened acronym),[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/history/bna/hellfire.htm |title= AGM-114 Hellfire missile |publisher= Boeing |accessdate=30 July 2011[/tpl] for the purpose of arming helicopter platforms with an effective anti-tank missile.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/agm-114-var.htm |title= AGM-114 Hellfire Variants |accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/agm-114-chron.htm |title= AGM-114 Hellfire Chronology |accessdate=27 September 2011[/tpl]

===Into production===

In 1981, three pre-production AH-64As were handed over to the U.S. Army for Operational Test II. The Army testing was successful, but afterward it was decided to upgrade to the more powerful T700-GE-701 version of engine, rated at [tpl]convert|1,690|shp|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl]. The AH-64 was named the Apache in late 1981, keeping with the Army's traditional use of American Indian tribal names for its helicopters and it was approved for full scale production in 1982.Bishop 2005, pp. 8–9. In 1983, the first production helicopter was rolled out at Hughes Helicopter's facility at Mesa, Arizona. Hughes Helicopters was purchased by McDonnell Douglas for $470 million in 1984.Donald 2004, p. 119. The helicopter unit later became part of The Boeing Company with the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in August 1997.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/pd125.nsf/0/0EC17704770E83BF86256E04006C5943?OpenDocument |title= McDonnell-Boeing Merger |publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |first= Cynthia |last= Wilson |author2=Dale Singer |date= 13 January 2004[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] In 1986, the incremental or flyaway cost for the AH-64A was $7M and the average unit cost was approximately $13.9M based on total costs.
During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas was studying an AH-64B, featuring an updated cockpit, new fire control system and other upgrades. In 1988, funding was approved for a multi-stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon avionic systems.[tpl]cite news |title= Helicopter Contract Awarded |publisher=Prescott Courier |date= 17 August 1988[/tpl] However, rapidly improving technology led to the program being canceled in favor of more ambitious changes. In August 1990, development of the advanced AH-64D Apache Longbow was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board. The first AH-64D prototype flew on 15 April 1992,Donald 2004, pp. 150–153. prototype testing ended in April 1995. During testing, six AH-64D helicopters were pitted against a numerically superior group of AH-64A helicopters; the results demonstrated that AH-64D has a seven times increase in survivability and four times increase in lethality compared to the AH-64A."Great Planes: Apache Helicopter".

===Overview===

The AH-64 Apache has a four-blade main rotor and a four-blade tail rotor.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/1-112.pdf |title= Attack Helicopter Operations |first= Joel B. |last= Hudson |date= 2 April 1997 |format= PDF |publisher=Department of the Army |page= 166[/tpl] The crew sits in tandem, with the pilot sitting behind and above the copilot/gunner.Donald 2004, pp. 110–11. Both crew members are capable of flying the aircraft and performing methods of weapon engagements independently.[tpl]cite web |title=How Apache Helicopters Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/apache-helicopter4.htm |publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=10 October 2013[/tpl] The AH-64 is powered by two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines with high-mounted exhausts on either side of the fuselage.Donald 2004, pp. 111–112.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-9295562/ge-says-t700-operating.html |title= GE Says T700 Operating Well in Gulf |publisher=Defense Daily |date= 20 December 1990[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Various models of engines have been used on the Apache; those in British service use engines from Rolls-Royce instead of General Electric. In 2004, General Electric Aviation began producing more powerful T700-GE-701D engines, rated at [tpl]convert|2000|shp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] for AH-64Ds.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.geae.com/aboutgeae/presscenter/military/military_20041104.html |title= T700-GE-701D Engine Awarded U.S. Army Qualification |publisher=GE Aviation |date= 4 November 2004[/tpl]
The crew compartment has shielding between the cockpits, such that at least one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from [tpl]convert|23|mm|in|abbr=on|2[/tpl] rounds. The airframe includes some [tpl]convert|2500|lb|kg|abbr=on|-2[/tpl] of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 16–17. The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290,The History of Helicopter Safety.  which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, crashworthy landing gear, seats and fuel system.

===Avionics and targeting===

One of the revolutionary features of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS);[tpl]cite journal |url= http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA202984 |title= The Impact of the U.S. Army's AH-64 Helmet Mounted Display on Future Aviation Helmet Design |publisher=Army Aeromedical Research Lab Fort Rucker |first= Clarence E. |last= Rash |author2=Martin, John S. |date= August 1988[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |url= http://spie.org/x648.html?product_id=478896 |title= Emergence Of Solid State Helmet-Mounted Displays In Military Applications |publisher=SPIE |first= Curtis J. |last= Casey |date= 5 August 2002[/tpl] among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30 mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jawa/jawa001013_1_n.shtml |title= Boeing AH-64 Apache |publisher=Jane's Information Group |date= 13 October 2000 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080225163847/http://www.janes.com/defence/air_forces/news/jawa/jawa001013_1_n.shtml |archivedate= 25 February 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1999/news_release_990504n.htm |title= Boeing To Develop Electric Gun Turret For The AH-64D |publisher=Boeing |date= 5 May 1999[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] The AH-64's standard of performance for aerial gunnery is to achieve at least 1 hit for every 30 shots fired at a wheeled vehicle at a range of [tpl]convert|800|–|1200|m|yd|abbr=on[/tpl]."ASP Motion Base for Stabilized Mounts".

In August 2012, 24 AH-64D were equipped with the Ground Fire Acquisition System (GFAS), which detects and targets ground-based weapons fire sources in all-light conditions and with a 120° field of vision. The GFAS consists of two sensor pods working with the AH-64's other sensors, an infrared camera precisely locates ground-based threats.Ground Fire Acquisition System - Armedforces-int.com, 26 October 2012. In 2014, it was announced that new targeting and surveillance sensors were under development to provide high-resolution color imagery to crews, instead of the Apache's current low definition black and white picture quality.Shalal-Esa, Andrea. "Lockheed tech lets U.S. Apache helicopter pilots aim in color." Reuters, 19 February 2014.

===Armaments and configurations===

The AH-64 is adaptable to numerous different roles within its context as Close Combat Attack (CCA), it has a customizable weapons loadout mounted on stub-wings for the role desired. In addition to the 30 mm M230E1 Chain Gun, the Apache carries a range of external stores on its stub-wing pylons, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles, and Hydra 70 general-purpose unguided [tpl]convert|70|mm|in|abbr=on|3[/tpl] rockets.Donald 2004, pp. 124–127.
Starting in the late 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missile were evaluated for use upon the AH-64.Donald 2004, pp. 134–135.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 40–41, 60. The Stinger was initially selected over the AIM-9, but the U.S. Army is considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile instead."Boeing AH-64 Apache". Jane's All the World's Aircraft. Jane's Information Group, 2010. subscription article, 1 February 2010[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]. External fuel tanks can also be carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points which make maintenance easier; these mountings can be used to secure personnel to the wings for transport for emergencies.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6269613.stm |title= Helicopter rescue bid for Marine |publisher=BBC News |date= 17 January 2007[/tpl] Stinger missiles are more used by non-U.S. Apaches because foreign forces don't have as many other aircraft for air superiority to control the skies.Raytheon Sells Stingers for Apaches Abroad - DoDBuzz.com, 23 October 2013

==Operational history==

===United States Army===

The U.S. Army formally accepted its first production AH-64A in January 1984 and training of the first pilots began later that year.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 14–15.Apache news 2004[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl], pp. 33–34. Boeing, 2004. The first operational Apache unit, 7th Battalion, 17th Cavalry Brigade, began training on the AH-64A in April 1986 at Fort Hood, Texas.Bernsteein 2005, p. 6. Two operational units with 68 AH-64s first deployed to Europe in September 1987 and took part in large military exercises there.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 47–48.Donald 2004, p. 121. The Apache was first used in combat in 1989, during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. The AH-64 participated in over 240 hours of combat attacking various targets, mostly at night.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 51–52.Bishop 2005, pp. 16–17. General Carl Stiner, the commander of the operation, commented that: "You could fire that Hellfire missile through a window from four miles away at night".Bernstein 2005, p. 7.
Upon fielding the Apache, capabilities such as using the FLIR for extensive night operations made it clear that the AH-64 was capable of operating beyond the forward line of own troops (FLOT) that previous attack helicopters were normally restricted to.Williams 2005, pp. 212–213. It was discovered that the Apache was coincidentally fitted with the same Have Quick UHF radio system used by the U.S. Air Force; once recognized, inter-service coordination and joint operations such as the joint air attack teams (JAAT) were encouraged and inserted into standard training. The Apache have operated extensively with close air support (CAS) aircraft such as the USAF's Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the USMC's McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, often acting as a target designator to conserve the Apache's own munitions.Williams 2005, pp. 215–218.
Nearly half of all U.S. Apaches were deployed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack,Bishop 2005, pp. 17–18. allowing aircraft to evade detection.Donald 2004, pp. 144–145. The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one auxiliary fuel tank.Taylor, Thomas. Lightning in the Storm. Hippocrene Books, 2003. ISBN 0-7818-1017-5.

In FY 2015 budgets, the Army considered moving all Apaches from the Army Reserve and National Guard to the active Army to serve as scout helicopters to replace the OH-58 Kiowa. Using the AH-64 in the scouting role is considered less expensive than Kiowa upgrades or purchasing a new scouting type. AH-64E Apaches can control unmanned aerial vehicles like the MQ-1C Grey Eagle to perform aerial scouting missions; a 2010 study found that manned-unmanned teaming of Apaches and UAVs was the most cost-effective alternative to a new scout helicopter and would meet 80% of reconnaissance requirements, compared to 20% with existing OH-58s and 50% with upgraded OH-58s. Reserve and Guard units criticized the proposal, who would lose their attack helicopters.Budgets & ‘Betrayal’: National Guard Fights To Keep Apache Gunships - Breakingdefense.com, 23 January 2014

===AH-64B===

In 1991 after Operation Desert Storm, the AH-64B was a proposed upgrade to 254 AH-64As. The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade. The B program was canceled in 1992.Bishop 2005, p. 10. The radio, navigation, and GPS modifications, were later installed on most A-model Apaches through other upgrades.

===AH-64C===

Additional funding from Congress in late 1991 resulted in a program to upgrade AH-64As to an AH-64B+ version. More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer −700C engine versions. However, the C designation was dropped after 1993.Donald 2004, p. 153. With AH-64As receiving the newer engine from 1990, the only difference between the C model and the radar-equipped D model was the radar, which could be moved from one aircraft to another; thus the decision was made to simply designate both versions AH-64D.

===AH-64D===

The AH-64D Apache Longbow, is equipped with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-8202632/mcdonnell-bell-plan-longbow.html |title= McDonnell-Bell plan Longbow-radar for LHX |publisher=Defense Daily |date= 22 February 1990[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author= |title=AN/APR-48A Radar Frequency Interferometer |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/12432.pdf |publisher= Lockheed Martin |accessdate=20 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] The radome's raised position enables targets detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings).

The aircraft is powered by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles for self-defense.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-62774999/apache-stinger-testing-holding.html |title= Apache Stinger Testing in Holding Pattern until Starstreak Integration Finished |publisher=Defense Daily |date= 15 June 2000[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Japan to get first Boeing copter |publisher=East Valley Tribune |first= Ed |last= Taylor |date= 21 December 2005[/tpl]

===Sea Apache===

During the 1980s Naval versions of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined.Richardson and Peacock 1992, pp. 60–61.Donald 2004, p. 150. Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons. Funding for a naval version was not provided, the Marine Corps continued to use the AH-1.Donald 2004, p. 170. The Canadian Forces Maritime Command also examined a naval Apache.[tpl]cite news |title= Local firms hope for spin-offs from big naval aircraft project |publisher=Montreal Gazette |first= Peggy |last= Curran |date= 6 August 1986[/tpl] In 2004, British Army AgustaWestland Apaches were deployed upon the Royal Navy's [tpl]HMS|Ocean|L12|6[/tpl], a Landing Platform Helicopter,  for suitability testing; there was U.S. interest in the trials.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2004/0405/0004051101.asp |title= Apache Moves Closer To Front Line |publisher=Navy News |date= 11 May 2004[/tpl] During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, the British Army extensively used Apaches from HMS Ocean.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Assault-Ships/HMS-Ocean/ |title= HMS Ocean |publisher=Royal Navy/MOD[/tpl] In 2013, U.S. 36th Combat Aviation Brigade AH-64Ds were tested on a variety of U.S. Navy ships.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20130905/NEWS/309050004 |title=Army helicopters fly from Navy ships, test joint ops |date=5 September |first=Meghann |last= Myers |publisher=Army Times[/tpl]

===Export Apaches===

Several models have been derived from both AH-64A and AH-64D for export. The British-built AgustaWestland Apache (assembled from kits purchased from Boeing) is based on the AH-64D Block I with several different systems, including more powerful engines, folding rotor blades, and other modifications for operation from Royal Navy vessels.

===Block modification===

While a major change in design or role will cause the type designator suffix to change, for example from AH-64D to AH-64E the helicopters are also subject to Block modification. Block modification is the combining of equipment changes into blocks of modification work orders, the modifications in the block (sometimes called a block package) are all done to the helicopter at the same time.Army Regulation 750-10 Army Modification Program
