[[Succussion splash]]

CATEGORIES: Audible medical signs

Succussion splash is a sloshing sound heard through the stethoscope during sudden movement of the patient on abdominal auscultation. It reflects the presence of gas and fluid in an obstructed organ, as in gastric outlet obstruction.
Physical examination can show an abdominal succussion splash, which is elicited by placing the stethoscope over the upper abdomen and rocking the patient back and forth at the hips. Retained gastric material up to three hours after a meal will generate a splash sound and indicate the presence of a hollow viscus filled with both fluid and gas.
An example would be a gastric outflow obstruction with abdominal succussion splash.Valle JD. Chapter 293. Peptic Ulcer Disease and Related Disorders.
