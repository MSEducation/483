The Reese-Johnson-Virgin House is a historic Gothic Revival-style house at 193 Genoa Ln. in Genoa, Nevada.  Also known as The Pink House, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
Deemed significant for its role in Genoa's history, it was built in approximately 1855 in carpenter Gothic style by carpenter Mark Gaige for John Reese, then later bought and moved (in 1870) by merchant J.R. Johnson, who painted it pink.  It was later owned by judge D.W. Virgin.  It has decorative bargeboards under its eaves and is topped by finials and other ornamentation.[tpl]rp|5[/tpl]
The house's architecture — both original and later modifications — demonstrates historical trends in the community, depicting the growing prosperity both of its owners and of the community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/04000728.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: The Reese-Johnson-Virgin House / The Pink House |author=Mella Rothwell Harmon |date=January 15, 2003 |publisher=National Park Service[/tpl] and accompanying two photos[tpl]rp|6[/tpl]
