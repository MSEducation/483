Sir Edmund Barton, [tpl]post-nominals|country=AUS|GCMG|KC[/tpl] (18 January 1849[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]7 January 1920) was an Australian politician and judge. He served as the first Prime Minister of Australia and became a founding justice of the High Court of Australia.
Barton first became an MP in 1879, in the Parliament of New South Wales. He contributed solidly to the federation movement through the 1890s, eventually contesting the inaugural 1901 federal election as head of a caretaker Protectionist Party federal government. No party won a majority; however, the government was supported by the Australian Labor Party, against the opposition Free Trade Party.
Barton resigned as Prime Minister in 1903 to become a judge of the High Court of Australia, serving for 17 years until his death in 1920.

==Early life==

Barton was born in Glebe, New South Wales, the ninth child of English parents William Barton, a stockbroker, and Mary Louise Barton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education/school_resources/websites_and_interactives/primeministers/edmund_barton/ |title=Edmund Barton |publisher=Nma.gov.au |accessdate=4 November 2011[/tpl] He was educated at Fort Street High School and Sydney Grammar School, where he was twice dux and School Captain and met his life-long friend and later fellow Justice of the High Court of Australia, Richard O'Connor. He graduated with first-class honours and the University Medal in classics from the University of Sydney, where he also demonstrated considerable skill at batting (but not in fielding) in cricket. He was a founder and active member of the Sydney Rowing Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sydneyrowingclub.com.au/Rowing/about-history.php |title=History of the Sydney Rowing Club |publisher=Sydneyrowingclub.com.au |accessdate=24 September 2012[/tpl] Barton became a barrister in 1871. On a cricket trip to Newcastle in 1870, he met Jane Mason Ross, whom he married in 1877.[ref]

In 1879, Barton umpired a cricket game at Sydney Cricket Ground between New South Wales and an English touring side captained by Lord Harris. After a controversial decision by Barton's colleague George Coulthard against the home side, the crowd spilled onto the pitch and assaulted some of the English players, leading to international cricket's first riot. The publicity that attended the young Barton's presence of mind in defusing that situation reputedly helped him take his first step towards becoming Australia's first prime minister, winning a state lower house seat later that year.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/12/27/1198345162006.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=For our PMs, there's just no avoiding the follow-on | date=28 December 2007[/tpl]

===State political career===

In 1876 Barton stood for the Legislative Assembly in the poll of the graduates of the University of Sydney (who were required to wear gowns for the occasion), but was beaten by William Charles Windeyer 49 votes to 43.[ref]
