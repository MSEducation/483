Rollen Frederick Stewart (born February 23, 1944), also known as Rock 'n' Rollen and Rainbow Man, was a fixture in American sports culture best known for wearing a rainbow-colored afro-style wig and, later, holding up signs reading "John 3:16" at stadium sporting events around the United States and overseas in the 1970s and 1980s.What's with those "John 3:16" signs, The Straight Dope

==Publicity==

Apparently at first just in it for the publicity, Stewart became a born-again Christian determined to "get the message out" via television.  His first major appearance was at the 1977 NBA Finals; by the time of the 1979 MLB All-Star Game, broadcasters actively tried to avoid showing him.[ref]
 Note: Article refers to 1984 Olympics, which were in Los Angeles, not Moscow.[/ref] He "appeared behind NFL goal posts, near Olympic medal stands, and even at the Augusta National Golf Club." At the 1982 Indianapolis 500, he was behind the pits of race winner Gordon Johncock.1982 Indianapolis 500 television broadcast, ABC Sports, May 30, 1982 Stewart would strategically position himself for key shots of plays or athletes. Stewart's fame led to a Budweiser beer commercial and a Saturday Night Live parody sketch, where he was portrayed by Christopher Walken.
Stewart was briefly jailed by Moscow police at the 1980 Summer Olympics.  In the late 1980s, he began a string of stink bomb attacks. Targets included Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral, the Orange County Register, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and a Christian bookstore. The stated intent of an attempted attack at the American Music Awards was to show the public that "God thinks this stinks."Gorightly, Adam (1999).

==Arrest==

Stewart was arrested in 1992 after a standoff in a California hotel during which he entered a vacant room with two men he was attempting to kidnap and surprised a maid who then locked herself in the bathroom. Reportedly, Stewart believed that the Rapture was due to arrive in six days. During the standoff, he threatened to shoot at airplanes taking off from nearby Los Angeles International Airport, and covered the hotel room windows with "John 3:16" placards.
Stewart is currently serving three consecutive life sentences in prison on kidnapping charges, having rejected a plea deal of 12 years in order to spread his message in open court.  After being sentenced, he began a religious tirade and had to be restrained by bailiffs.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot7J025JS5U | title=Rollen Stewart: A Colorful Testimony | publisher=ESPN | date=2004-07-23 | accessdate=2009-02-18[/tpl] He became eligible for parole in 2002, but was denied as recently as March 2010; his next parole review will be in 2017.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazette.com/sports/stewart-1836-john-hotel.html | title=What he preached, he didn't practice | publisher=Colorado Springs Gazette | date=2005-12-14 | accessdate=2012-06-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://john3-16signs.com/Gino_s_news.html | title=Gino's News | work=John 3:16 Sign Ministry | date=March 19, 2010 | accessdate=May 17, 2012 | author=Emmerich, Gino[/tpl] After this conviction, he was found guilty of four stink bomb attacks.

==Personal life==

He was married four times, most notably to Margaret Hockridge.  The two met at a church in Virginia in 1984.  They began traveling across the country together in 1985.  While on the road, they married in St. Louis in 1986.  However, the marriage was somewhat rocky, in part due to his violent mood swings.  During the 1986 World Series, Hockridge said that Stewart tried to choke her for standing in the wrong spot with a John 3:16 sign.  They divorced in 1990, but they kept in touch for many years.Rich, Katherine Russell. End of the Rainbow.  People, 1992-11-30.
