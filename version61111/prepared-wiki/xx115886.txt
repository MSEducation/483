Online pharmacies,  Internet pharmacies, or Mail Order Pharmacies are pharmacies that operate over the Internet and send the orders to customers through the mail or shipping companies.
Online or internet pharmacies might include:

==Home delivery==

Conventional stationary pharmacies usually have controlled distribution systems from the manufacturer. Validation (drug manufacture) and Good distribution practices are followed.   Home delivery of pharmaceuticals can be a desirable convenience but sometimes there can be problems.
The shipment of drugs through the mail and parcel post is sometimes a concern for temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals.  Uncontrolled shipping conditions can include high and low temperatures outside of the listed storage conditions for a drug.  For example, the US FDA found the temperature in a mail box in the sun could reach 136 °F (58 °C) while the ambient air temperature was 101 °F (38 °C)[ref]

Shipment by express mail and couriers reduces transit time and often involves delivery to the door, rather than a mail box.  The use of insulated shipping containers also helps control drug temperatures, reducing risks to drug safety and efficacy.

==Discussion==

Legitimate mail-order pharmacies are somewhat similar to community pharmacies; one primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient than traveling to a community drugstore, in the same way as ordering goods online rather than going to a shop.Internet pharmacies get go-ahead
While many internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs only with a prescription, some do not require a pre-written prescription. In some countries, this is because prescriptions are not required. Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the cost and inconvenience of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. People living in the United States and other countries where prescription medications are very expensive may turn to online pharmacies to save money. Many of the reputable websites employ their own in-house physicians to review the medication request and write a prescription accordingly.  Some websites offer medications without a prescription or a doctor review.  This practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and the suitability of a medication for a specific individual.Online pharmacy warning Pharmacies offering medication without requiring a prescription and doctor review or supervision are sometimes fraudulent and may supply counterfeit—and ineffective and possibly dangerous—medicines.

==International consumers==

International consumers sometimes purchase drugs online from online pharmacies in their own countries, or those located in other countries.  Some of these pharmacies require prescriptions, while others do not.  Of those that do not require prescriptions, some ask the customer to fill in a health questionnaire with their order.  Many drugs available online are produced by well-known manufacturers such as Pfizer,  Wyeth, Roche, and generic drugmakers Cipla and Ranbaxy of India and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel.

==U.S. consumers==

An attraction of online pharmacies is drug prices. Shoppers can sometimes obtain 50 to 80 percent or more savings on U.S. prices at foreign pharmaciesWith Record Number of Uninsured, Americans Turn to Foreign Pharmacies, Yahoo News, June 11, 2008
The Washington Post reported that "...millions of Americans have turned to Mexico and other countries in search of bargain drugs...U.S. Customs estimates 10 million U.S. citizens bring in medications at land borders each year. An additional 2 million packages of pharmaceuticals arrive annually by international mail from Thailand, India, South Africa and other points. Still more packages come from online pharmacies in Canada."Millions of Americans Look Outside U.S. For Drugs, Washington Post, Oct. 23, 2003 According to a Wall Street Journal/Harris Online poll in 2006, 80 percent of Americans favor importing drugs from Canada and other countries.http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1092 Harris Interactive, Sept 16 2006 President Obama’s budget supports a plan to allow people to buy cheaper drugs from other countries.http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE51P53920090226 Reuters, Obama’s budget supports drug import plana, Feb 26 2009 A report in the journal Clinical Therapeutics found that U.S. consumers face a risk of getting counterfeit drugs because of the rising Internet sales of drugs, with worldwide counterfeit drug sales, offline and online, projected to reach $75 billion by 2010.Risks in Ordering Drugs by Internet on the Rise Newswise, Retrieved on July 20, 2008.
Independent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research demonstrates that online pharmacies, U.S. and foreign, verified by certain credentialing entities, sell genuine medication and require a prescription.http://www.nber.org/papers/w17955 “In Whom We Trust: The Role of Certification Agencies in Online Drug Markets.” Bate, Roger and Ginger Zhe Jin and Amarna Mathur. National Bureau of Economic Research. NBER Working Paper No. 17955. Issued in March 2012. In that study, all tested prescription drug orders were found to be authentic when ordered from online pharmacies, international and U.S.-only, approved by PharmacyChecker.com, as well as U.S. online pharmacies approved by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) program or LegitScript, and Canadian-based online pharmacies approved by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association. Nine percent of tested products ordered from non-credentialed online pharmacies were counterfeit.Ibid
There are two verification programs for online pharmacies that are recognized by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). One is VIPPS, which is operated by the NABP and was created in 1999.http://www.vipps.info The Food and Drug Administration refers Internet users interested in using an online pharmacy to the VIPPS program.http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm080588.htm The other is LegitScript, which as of September 2010 had approved over 340 Internet pharmacies as legitimate and identified over 47,000 "rogue" Internet pharmacies.http://www.legitscript.com Canadian and all non-U.S. online pharmacies that sell prescription medication to Americans, regardless of credentials, are not eligible for approval in the VIPPS and LegitScript programs.For VIPPS U.S. only standard see http://www.nabp.net/programs/accreditation/vipps/standards.

==Bulgarian consumers==

All Bulgarian online pharmacies must be registered with the Bulgarian drug agency (BDA). BDA controls the trade with medicines and makes analysis when doubting the quality and safety of drugs. A special BDA logo and a Certificate for registration of pharmacy proves the accreditation and the legitimacy of the store. When clicking on the logo, the consumer will be taken to the official page of the Bulgarian drug agency. The web page must deliver an information about the pharmacy's name, address, registration number and it's manager.

==UK consumers==

In the UK more than 2 million people buy drugs regularly over the internet from online pharmacies; some are legitimate but others  have "dangerous practices" that could endanger children."eBay medicines 'a risk to child health': Study warns of danger from drugs bought on net" "The Observer", June 21, 2009 In 2008, the RPSGB introduced a green cross logo to help identify accredited online pharmacies (from 2010 the internet pharmacy logo scheme is run by the GPhC)."Internet pharmacy logo"GPhC
European registered pharmacists have reciprocal agreements allowing them to practice in the UK by simply getting registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council.
The first internet pharmacy in the UK was Pharmacy2U, which started operating in 1999.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/537928.stm |title=UK's first online pharmacy opens |date=November 27, 1999 |accessdate=July 15, 2013 |publisher=BBC[/tpl] The UK is a frontline leader in internet pharmacy since a change to NHS pharmacy regulations in 2005 that made it legal for pharmacies to fill NHS prescriptions over the internet.http://www.psnc.org.uk/pages/internet_pharmacy_faqs.html Drugs supplied in this way tend to be medicines which doctors refuse to prescribe for patients, or would charge a private prescription fee, as all patients treated under the National Health Service pay either a flat price or nothing for prescribed medicine (except for medicine classed as lifestyle medicine, e.g. anti-malarials for travel), and medical equipment.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In the UK, online pharmacies often link up with online clinic doctors. Doctors carry out online consultations and issue prescriptions.http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/aug/6/british-patients-click-online-to-see-doctor/ The company employing the doctors must be registered with the Care Quality Commission. Online clinics only prescribe a limited number of medicines and do not replace regular doctors working from surgeries. There are various ways the doctors carry out the online consultations; sometimes it is done almost entirely by questionnaire. Customers usually pay one fee which includes the price of the consultation, prescription and the price of the medicine.
