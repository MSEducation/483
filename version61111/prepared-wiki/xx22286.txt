The Arena Football League (AFL) is the highest level of professional indoor American football in the United States. It is currently the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster. It is played indoors on a smaller field than American football, resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League.
The league currently consists of fourteen teams from the United States. The AFL is divided into two conferences [tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] the American Conference and National Conference. Each conference has two divisions. The American Conference's Pacific and West Divisions consist of three teams each, while the National Conference's South and East Divisions have four teams each.
The regular-season is a 20-week schedule during which each team plays 18 games and has two bye weeks. The season currently starts during the second week of March and runs weekly to late August. At the end of each regular season, four teams from each conference (the division winners and two wild card teams) play in the AFL playoffs, an eight-team single-elimination tournament that culminates with the championship game, known as the ArenaBowl. From 1987 to 2004 and 2010 and 2011, the game was played at the site of the higher seeded team. From 2005 to 2008, the game was at a neutral site, Las Vegas and New Orleans. In 2012, the league championship returned to a neutral site and ArenaBowl XXV was held at the New Orleans Arena; ArenaBowl XXVI will be held in Orlando.
From 2000 to 2009, the AFL had its own developmental league, the af2. The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season, though the af2 did play. Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues, and the AFL returned in 2010. The Arena Football League has its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arenafootball.com/content/contact-us |title=Contact Us |publisher=www.arenafootball.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl]
The league's average game attendance since returning in 2010 has been approximately 8,000 per game.
It was announced on December 12, 2012, that the AFL reached a partnership agreement with NET10 Wireless to be the first non-motorsports-related professional sports league in the United States to have a title sponsor, calling it the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League.Arena Football League to incorporate NET10 in its name, W.

==History==

===Creation===

Jim Foster, a promotions manager with the National Football League, conceived the idea of indoor football while watching an indoor soccer match at Madison Square Garden in 1981. While at the game, he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope from his briefcase with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay. He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices, where he received praise and encouragement for his concept. After solidifying the rules and business plan, supplemented with sketches by a professional artist, Foster presented his idea to various television networks. He reached an agreement with NBC for a "test game".[tpl]cite news |title=A good idea...on paper |publisher=The Florida Times-Union |date=May 12, 2001 |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/051201/spo_6156030.html |accessdate=2009-08-06[/tpl]
Plans for arena football were put on hold in 1982 as the United States Football League was launched. Foster left the NFL to accept a position in the USFL. He eventually became executive vice-president with the Chicago Blitz, where he returned to his concept of arena football. In 1983, he began organizing the test game in his spare time around his job with the Blitz. By 1985, the USFL had ceased football operations and he devoted all his time to arena football, and on April 27, 1986, his concept was realized when finally staged the test game.ArenaFan Rewriting The History Books: Test Game Date Revealed To Be Wrong (30 April 2012). ArenaFan.com quoting Chicago Sun-Times and other sources.

===="Test game"====

The test game was played in Rockford, Illinois at the Rockford MetroCentre.[tpl]cite news |title=Arena Football League: A history of playing rough indoors |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=January 23, 2006 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/49001 |accessdate=2009-08-06[/tpl] Sponsors were secured, and players and coaches from local colleges were recruited to volunteer to play for the teams, the Chicago Politicians and Rockford Metros, with the guarantee of a tryout should the league take off. Interest was high enough following the initial test game that Foster decided to put on a second "showcase" game. The second game was held on February 26, 1987 at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago with a budget of $20,000, up from $4,000 in the original test game. Foster also invited ESPN to send a film crew to the game; a highlights package aired on SportsCenter.

====Inaugural season====

Following the successes of his trial-run games, Foster moved ahead with his idea for arena football.  He founded the Arena Football League with four teams: the Pittsburgh Gladiators, Denver Dynamite, Washington Commandos, and Chicago Bruisers. Foster appointed legendary Darrel "Mouse" Davis, godfather of the Run 'n' Shoot and modern pro offense, as executive director of football operations. Davis hired the original coaches and was the architect of the league's original wide-open offensive playbooks.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-03/sports/sp-834_1_arena-football-teams | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bruce | last=Pascoe | title=Arena Football's Growing Pains : Rash of Injuries Prompts Fledgling League to Study Safety | date=July 3, 1987[/tpl]
The first game in Arena Football League history was played on June 19, 1987, between the Gladiators and Commandos at Pittsburgh Civic Arena in front of 12,117 fans.[tpl]cite news |title=It was 21 years ago today... |publisher=ArenaFootball.com |date=June 19, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=1481665&DB_OEM_ID=3500 |accessdate=2009-08-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  The game was deliberately not televised so that it could be analyzed and any follies and failures would not be subject to national public scrutiny.  Following the inaugural game, tweaks and adjustments were made, and the first season continued.  The Dynamite and Bruisers played in the first-ever televised game on June 20, 1987, at the Rosemont Horizon in suburban Chicago on ESPN with Bob Rathbun and Lee Corso on the call.  The broadcast showed a short clip of the Commandos-Gladiators game.[tpl]YouTube|hzBobvynM74|Arena Football - 1987 Season - Denver Dynamite vs. Chicago Bruisers[/tpl]  Each team played six games, two against each other team.  The top two teams, Denver and Pittsburgh, then competed in the first-ever AFL championship game, ArenaBowl I.

====Patenting the game====

On September 30, 1987, Foster filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to patent his invented sport.  The patent application covered the rules of the game, specifically detailing the goalposts and rebound netting and their impact on gameplay.  Foster's application was granted on March 27, 1990.[ref]
</ref>  The patent expired on September 30, 2007.

===Early years (1987â€“1999)===

From its inception, the AFL operated in a state of semi-obscurity; many Americans had heard the term "arena football" but knew little to nothing about the league itself.
From the 1987 season until the late 1990s, the most exposure the league would receive was on ESPN, which aired tape-delayed games, often well after midnight. The league received its first taste of wide exposure in 1998, when Arena Bowl XII was televised nationally as part of ABC's Wide World of Sports.
On Saturday, July 23, 1989, much of America learned of the AFL for the wrong reason, when Pittsburgh Gladiators head coach Joe Haering made football history by decking Commissioner Jim Foster with a punch during a game with the Chicago Bruisers.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-28/sports/8902210657_1_ray-jauch-joe-haering-league-operations-manager | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Gladiators' Coach Asks For A Thumbs Up | date=July 28, 1989[/tpl] The mainstream media ran wild with the story, including a photo in USA Today. Oddly, the game was played between the two teams in Sacramento's Arco Arena, as part of the AFL's 'Barnstorming America' tour. Foster had walked onto the field of play to mediate an altercation between the two teams when Haering, a former NFL assistant, punched him in the jaw. Haering was suspended without pay.[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-28/sports/8902210657_1_ray-jauch-joe-haering-league-operations-manager | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Gladiators' Coach Asks For A Thumbs Up | date=July 28, 1989[/tpl] 
One of the league's early success stories was the Detroit Drive. A primary team for some of the AFL's most highly regarded players, including George LaFrance, Gary and Alvin Rettig, as well as being a second career chance for quarterback Art Schlichter, the Drive regularly played before sold out crowds at Joe Louis Arena, and went to the ArenaBowl every year of their existence (1988â€“1993). The AFL's first dynasty came to an end when their owner, Mike Ilitch (who also owned Little Caesars Pizza and the Detroit Red Wings) bought the Detroit Tigers baseball team and sold the AFL team.
Although the Drive left the league, the AFL had a number of other teams which it considered "dynasties", including the Tampa Bay Storm (the only team that has existed in some form for all twenty-five seasons), their arch-rival the Orlando Predators, the San Jose SaberCats of the present decade, and their rivals the Arizona Rattlers.
In 1993, the league staged its only All-Star Game in Des Moines, Iowa, the future home of the Iowa Barnstormers, as a fundraiser for flood victims in the area. The National Conference defeated the American Conference 64â€“40 in front of a crowd of 7,189.
While the aforementioned teams have enjoyed considerable on-field and even financial success, many teams in the history of the league have enjoyed little to no success either on or off of the field of play. There are a number of franchises which existed in the form of a number of unrelated teams under numerous management groups until they folded (an example is the New York CityHawks whose owners transferred the team from New York to Hartford to become the New England Sea Wolves after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the Toronto Phantoms, who lasted another two seasons until folding). There are a number of reasons why these teams failed, including financially-weak ownership groups, lack of deep financial support from some owners otherwise capable of providing it, lack of media exposure, or the host city's evident lack of interest in the team or the sport as a whole.

===The new millennium (2000â€“2008)===

The year 2000 brought a heightened interest in the AFL. Then-St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who was MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV, was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, which, unlike ESPN, would televise regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the af2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League's NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the Austin Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush, Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans VooDoo, Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York Dragons and Utah Blaze. The Wranglers, Cobras, Fury, Kats, Dragons, Brigade, and Avengers no longer compete in the AFL, however.
In 2003, the season expanded to 16 games. There were also several rule changes. In 2005, players were no longer allowed to run out of bounds. The only way for a player to go out of bounds is if a player is tackled into the side boards. 2005 also marked the first year the ArenaBowl was played at a neutral site. In 2007, free substitution was allowed. And in 2008, the "Jack" linebacker was allowed to go sideboard to sideboard.[tpl]cite web | title=ESPN - New rules make big impact - AFL | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3278531 | date=2008-03-05 | accessdate=2008-12-29 [/tpl]

===Decline (2008â€“2009)===

After 12 years as commissioner of the AFL, David Baker resigned unexpectedly on July 25, 2008, just two days before ArenaBowl XXII; Deputy Commissioner Ed Policy was named interim commissioner until Baker's replacement was found.  Baker explained, "When I took over as commissioner, I thought it would be for one year.  It turned into 12. But now it's time."[tpl]cite news |title=Baker resigns as AFL commissioner after successful 12 years |publisher=ESPN |date=July 26, 2008 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3505580 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]
Three months later, "based on circumstances currently affecting the league and the team", Tom Benson startlingly announced that the New Orleans VooDoo were ceasing operations and folding.[tpl]cite news |title=VooDoo terminates operations |publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune |date=October 14, 2008 |url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/t-p/?/base/sports-0/1223961679147170.xml&coll=1 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]  Shortly thereafter, an article in Sports Business Journal announced that the AFL had a tentative agreement to sell a $100 million stake in the league to Platinum Equity; in exchange, Platinum Equity would create a centralized, single-entity business model that would streamline league and team operations and allow the league to be more profitable.  Benson's move to shut down the VooDoo came during the Platinum Equity conference call, leading to speculation that he had folded because of the deal.[tpl]cite news |title=AFL owners OK sale of $100 million stake |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=October 22, 2008 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/60311 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]
Because of the sudden loss of the New Orleans franchise, the league announced in October that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a dispersal draft.  Dates were eventually announced as December 2 for the dispersal draft and December 4 for free agency, but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to December 3.  Shortly thereafter, another press release announced that the draft would be held on December 9 and free agency would commence on December 11.[tpl]cite news |title=AFL dispersal draft and free agency dates set (UPDATED 12/3) |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 3, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9493 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]  However, the draft still never took place, and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely.[tpl]cite news |title=Dispersal draft and free agency dates postponed |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 9, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9495 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]  Rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding, but owners were quick to deny those claims.  It was soon revealed the players' union had agreed to cut the salary cap for the 2009 season in order to prevent a total cessation of operations.[tpl]cite news |title=AFL players agree to salary cut to help league |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=December 10, 2008 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2008/12/afl_players_agree_to_salary_cu.html |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl]  However, the announced Platinum Equity investment never materialized.  

====Cancelling the 2009 season====

Although the Arenafootball2 league played its tenth season in 2009, a conference call in December 2008 resulted in enough votes from owners and cooperation from the AFLPA for the AFL to suspend the entire 2009 season in order to create "a long-term plan to improve its economic model".[tpl]cite news |title=AFL suspends 2009 season |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 15, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9497 |accessdate=2009-08-08[/tpl] In doing so, the AFL became the second sports league to cancel an entire season, after the National Hockey League cancelled the 2004â€“05 season because of a lockout. Efforts to reformat the league's business model were placed under the leadership of Columbus Destroyers owner Jim Renacci and interim commissioner Policy.[tpl]cite news |title=AFL extends health insurance of Rampage, others |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=March 2, 2009 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2009/03/arena_football_league_extends.html |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl]
High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation, citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league.[tpl]cite news |title=Acting head Policy steps aside at AFL |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=April 6, 2009 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/62184 |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] Two weeks later, the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise. One month later, the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new CBA and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players.[tpl]cite news |title=AFL axing players' health insurance; Rampage's Gowins 'less optimistic' about league's return |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=May 28, 2009 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2009/05/afl_axing_players_health_insur.html |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] Progress on the return stalled, and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league.
On July 20, 2009, Sports Business Journal reported that the AFL owed approximately $14 million to its creditors and were considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[tpl]cite news |title=Chapter 11 a possibility as AFL tries to keep hopes alive for 2010 season |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=July 20, 2009 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/63039 |accessdate=2009-08-09[/tpl] In early August 2009, numerous media outlets began reporting that the AFL was folding permanently and would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The league released a statement on August 4 to the effect that while the league was not folding, it was suspending league operations indefinitely. Despite this, several of the league's creditors filed papers to force a Chapter 7 liquidation if the league did not do so voluntarily.Yerak, Becky (2009-08-11).

===Relaunch (2010â€“)===

Following the suspension of the AFL's 2009 season, league officials and owners of af2 (which had played its season as scheduled) began discussing the future of arena football and the two leagues. With its 50.1 percent ownership of af2, the AFL's bankruptcy and dissolution prompted the dissolution of af2 as well.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/sports/ci_13413142?nclick_check=1 |title=New arena football league in the works |last=Latzke |first=Jeff |work=Monterey Herald |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] That league was formally considered disbanded on September 8, 2009, when no owner committed his or her team to the league's eleventh season by that deadline.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090909/SPORTS01/90909049/1023/SPORTS |title=Barnstormers hope to land in top tier of redefined league |last=Johnson |first=Dan |work=Des Moines Register |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]  For legal reasons, af2 league officials and owners agreed to form a new legal entity, Arena Football 1 (AF1), with former AFL teams the Arizona Rattlers and Orlando Predators joining the former af2.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090930_223_B8_Cmltnh762219 |title=League targets 24 teams |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=4512394&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines |title=New arena football league launching, will include 16 teams - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl]
All assets of the Arena Football League were put up for auction.

In addition to the historical teams, the league added two new expansion franchises, the Dallas Vigilantes and the Jacksonville Sharks.
For the 2011 season, the Philadelphia Soul, Kansas City Brigade, San Jose SaberCats, New Orleans VooDoo, and the Georgia Force returned to the AFL after having last played in 2008. The league added an expansion team, the Pittsburgh Power. Former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann is one of the team's owners. It was the first time the AFL returned to Pittsburgh since the Pittsburgh Gladiators were an original franchise in 1987 before becoming the Tampa Bay Storm. The Brigade changed its name to the Command, becoming the Kansas City Command.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jqNLvPZko4I2-40y-GAj4yg0TJPAD9GBR5AG0 |title=Philadelphia Soul return to AFL |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/06/ex-champion-philadelphia-soul-returning-to-arena-football-league/1 |title=Ex-champion Philadelphia Soul returning to Arena Football League |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 | work=USA Today[/tpl] Even though they were returning teams, the Bossierâ€“Shreveport Battle Wings moved to New Orleans as the Voodoo, the identity formerly owned by New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson.

In 2012, the AFL celebrated its silver anniversary for its 25th season of operations. The season kicked off on March 9, 2012. The Tulsa Talons moved to San Antonio, Texas and former Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Derrick Brooks and Jeff Gooch became owners of the Tampa Bay Storm. The Dallas Vigilantes were left off the schedule for the 2012 season with no announcement from the management, raising speculations that either the team had suspended operations for the season or was ceasing operations altogether.  (Apparently the latter was the case as the organization did not field a team for the 2013 season either.) Like the National Football League, the AFL postponed the free agency period to October 31 due to Hurricane Sandy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arenafootball.com/news/free-agency-period-delayed-due-severe-weather|title=Free Agency Period Delayed Due To Severe Weather|work=Arena Football League|date=2012-10-29|accessdate=2012-10-29[/tpl]

===China AFL Project & AFL Global===

In August 2012, the AFL announced a new project into China, known as China AFL.  The project is headed up by ESPN NFL analyst and Philadelphia Soul president and part-owner Ron Jaworski.  The plans are to establish a 6-team league that would play a 10-week schedule that is slated to start in October 2014.  AFL coaches and trainers will travel to China to help teach the rules of the sport to squads made up of Chinese and American players with the goal of starting an official Chinese arena league.Pro football is heading to China, Mike Florio, NBCSports.com,  August 28, 2012  Ganlan Media International were given exclusive rights to the new Chinese league.Ganlan Media International Receives Exclusive Rights to Establish Professional American Arena Football League in China, NASDAQ XMO GlobeNewswire, August 30, 2012
AFL Global and Ganlan Media were created in 2012 by businessman Martin E. Judge, founder and owner of The Judge Group.  The company, called AFL Global, LLC, looks to introduce and launch professional Arena Football teams and franchises in various locations throughout the world (a la NFL Europe).  After their successful trip to China to help promote the game, they formally announced plans to further develop AFL China by the fall of 2014 by starting a comprehensive training program in May 2013 with exhibition games planned for the cities of Beijing and Guangzhou in October.  This is the first time professional football of any kind will be played in China with the support of the Chinese government and the CRFA (Chinese Rugby Football Association).  Key persons involved include founder/CEO. Martin E. Judge, partner Ron Jaworski, CAFL CEO Gary Morris and president David Niu.About AFL Global page

==Postseason==

From the league's inception through ArenaBowl XVIII, the championship game was played at the home of the highest-seeded remaining team. The AFL then switched to a neutral-site championship, with ArenaBowls XIX and XX in Las Vegas. New Orleans Arena, home of the New Orleans VooDoo, served as the site of ArenaBowl XXI on July 29, 2007. This was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=3550&ATCLID=698707 |title=ArenaBowl XXI - New Orleans |date=2006-11-30[/tpl] The San Jose SaberCats earned their third championship in six years by defeating the Columbus Destroyers 55-33.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=1139209&DB_OEM_ID=3550 |title=SaberCats are ArenaBowl XXI Champions! |date=2007-12-13[/tpl] Arena Bowl XXI in New Orleans was deemed a success, and the city was chosen to host Arena Bowl XXII, in which the Philadelphia Soul defeated the defending champs San Jose Sabercats.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3550&ATCLID=1351141 |title=ArenaBowl Returns to New Orleans |date=2008-03-08[/tpl] In 2010, the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher. In ArenaBowl XXIII, the Spokane Shock defeated the Tampa Bay Storm at their home arena, Spokane Arena, in Spokane, Washington. In ArenaBowl XXIV, the Jacksonville Sharks, coming off of a victory in their Conference Final win 4 nights earlier, traveled to US Airways Center in Phoenix and defeated the Arizona Rattlers 73-70. ArenaBowl XXV returned to a neutral site and was once again played in New Orleans, where the Rattlers returned and defeated the Philadelphia Soul.

==Rules==

==Growth of the league==

Average attendance for AFL games were around 10,000â€“11,000 per game in the 1990s, though during the recession connected to the dot-com bubble and the September 11, 2001 attacks average attendance dropped below 10,000 for several years. Since the start of the 2004 season, average attendance has been above 12,000, with 12,392 in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arenafan.com/statistics/?page=attendance&league=1 |title=ArenaFan Online : AFL Attendance |publisher=Arenafan.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl] Eleven of the seventeen teams in operation in 2007 had average attendance figures over 13,000.

===Expanding the season===

The practice of playing one or two preseason exhibition games by each team before the start of the regular season was discontinued when the NBC contract was initiated, and the regular season was extended from 14 games, the length that it had been since 1996, to 16. Since 2011, the regular season league expanded to 18 games, with each team having two bye weeks and the option of two preseason games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=292 |title=AFL Moves To 18-Game Regular Season Schedule For 2011 |date=August 30, 2010 |work=Arena Football League |accessdate=September 1, 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100905054805/http://www.arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=292| archivedate= 5 September 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Media==

===Television===

====2000s====

Beginning with the 2003 season, the AFL made a deal with NBC to televise league games, which was renewed for another two years in 2005. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL's Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a deal failed is because ESPN refused to show highlights or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.
For the 2006 season only, the AFL added a national cable deal with OLN (now NBC Sports Network) for eleven regular-season games and one playoff game.
On December 19, 2006, ESPN announced the purchase of a minority stake in the AFL. This deal included television rights for the ESPN family of networks. ESPN would televise a minimum of 17 regular season games, most on Monday nights, and nine playoff games, including ArenaBowl XXI on ABC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3500&ATCLID=727455&SPID=1563 |title=AFL, ESPN enter into five-year agreement |work=ArenaFootball.com[/tpl] The deal resulted in added exposure on ESPN's SportsCenter. However, after the original AFL filed for bankruptcy, this arrangement did not carry over to the new AFL, which is a separate legal entity.
The AFL also had a regional-cable deal with FSN, where FSN regional affiliates in AFL markets carried local team games. In some areas, such as with the Arizona Rattlers, Fox Sports affiliates still carry the games.

====2010s====

After its return in 2010, the AFL had its national television deal with the NFL Network for a weekly Friday night game.[tpl]cite web|last=Lombardo |first=John |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64774 |title=NFL Network to broadcast new arena league's games |publisher=Sportsbusinessjournal.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=49 |title=NFL Network Names Announcers For Arena Football League Debut |work=Arena Football League |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010[/tpl] All AFL games not on the NFL Network could be seen for free online, provided by Ustream.NFL Network Schedule News Release
NFL Network ceased airing Arena Football League games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. Briefly, the games were broadcast on a tape delay to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast.  (In at least once incidence this actually happened, resulting in a non-competitive game being played with replacement players, and further such incidents were threatened.)  Once the labor issues were resolved, the NFL Network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live Friday night game.  NFL Network dropped the league at the end of the 2012 season.
For the 2013 season, the league's new national broadcast partner was the CBS Sports Network. CBSSN would air 19 regular season games[tpl]cite news |title=CBS Sports Net to air Arena Football League |author=McMillan, Ken |url=http://blogs.hudsonvalley.com/hudson-valley-sports-tv/2013/02/14/cbs-sports-net-to-air-arena-football-league/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hudson-valley-sports-tv+%28Coming+to+you+from+WKEN%3A+Sports+Television+and+Radio+Happenings%29 |newspaper= |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2013[/tpl] and two playoff games. CBS would also air the ArenaBowl, marking the first time since 2008 that the league's finale aired on network television.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/arena-football-league-moving-to-cbs-sports-network-cable-channel-in-2013/2012/11/13/0d5ad8ae-2dcd-11e2-b631-2aad9d9c73ac_story.html | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Regular season CBSSN broadcast games are usually on Saturday nights.  As the games are being shown live, the start times are not uniform as with most football broadcast packages, but vary with the time zone in which the home team is located.  This means that the AFL may appear either prior to or following the CBSSN's featured Major League Lacrosse game.
In 2014, ESPN will be returning to AFL as broadcast partners, with weekly games being shown on ESPN2 and ESPNEWS.  Arena Bowl XXVII will be broadcast on ESPN.

===Literature===

In 2001, Jeff Foley published War on the Floor: An Average Guy Plays in the Arena Football League and Lives to Write About It. The book details a journalist's two preseasons (1999 and 2000) as an offensive specialist/writer with the now-defunct Albany Firebirds. The 5-foot-6 (170Â cm), self-described "unathletic writer" played in three preseason games and had one catch for -2 yards.

The AFL currently runs as under the single-entity model, with the league owning the rights to the teams, players, and coaches.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090927_223_B1_Howcan164403 |title=Caution is new league's strength |last=Brown |first=Mike |work=Tulsa World |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20091002093753/http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090927_223_B1_Howcan164403| archivedate= 2 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The single-entity model was adopted in 2010 when the league emerged from bankruptcy. Prior to that, the league followed the franchise model more common in North American professional sports leagues; each team essentially operated as its own business and the league itself was a separate entity which in exchange for franchise fees paid by the team owners provided rules, officials, scheduling and the other elements of organizational structure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20110330_223_B2_TulsaT505747 |title=Co-owner: Talons couldn't keep vets |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl] A pool of money is allotted to teams to aid in travel costs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.themonitor.com/sports/new-31038-costs-rgv.html |title=Travel costs, geography keeps RGV from new league |last=Sandalow |first=Brian |work=The Monitor |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009[/tpl]
