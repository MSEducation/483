Vela is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three or four parts, the others being Carina, Puppis and, according to some authorities, Pyxis.John Scalzi (2008) Rough Guide to the Universe, p. 240 (ISBN 9781405383707).David H. Kelley, et al. (2011) Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy , p. 12  (9781441976246).Emily Winterburn (2009) The Stargazer's Guide, p. 124 (ISBN 9780061976377). With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system.

==History==

Argo Navis was one of the 48 classical constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and represented the ship Argo, used by Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece in Greek mythology. German cartographer Johann Bayer depicted the constellation on his  Uranometria of 1603, and gave the stars Bayer designations from Alpha to Omega. However, his chart was inaccurate as the constellation was not visible from the Northern Hemisphere.[tpl]cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, VA  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=83, 315–19[/tpl]
Argo was more accurately charted and subdivided in 1752 by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, forming Carina, Vela, Puppis and Pyxis. Despite the division, Lacaille kept Argo's Bayer designations. Therefore Carina has the Alpha, Beta and Epsilon, Vela has Gamma and Delta, and Puppis has Zeta, and so on.

==Characteristics==

Vela is bordered by Antlia and Pyxis to the north, Puppis to the northwest, Carina to the south and southwest, and Centaurus to the east. Covering 500 square degrees, it ranks 32nd of the 88 modern constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is "Vel".[tpl]cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 [/tpl]

==Notable features==

===Stars===

The brightest star in the constellation, Gamma Velorum, is a complex multiple star system. The brighter component, known as Gamma2 Velorum or Regor, shines as a blue-white star of apparent magnitude 1.81.[tpl]cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Gamma+velorum&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id |title = Gamma Velorum - Wolf-Rayet Stari |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 10 October 2013[/tpl] It is a spectroscopic binary made up of two very hot blue stars orbiting each other every 78.5 days and separated by somewhere between 0.8 and 1.2 Astronomical Units (AU). The brighter component is a hot blue main-sequence star of spectral type O7.5 and is around 180,000 times as luminous,  is around 30 times as massive and is 13 times the diameter of our Sun with a surface temperature of 32500 K. The second component is an extremely rare hot star known as a Wolf–Rayet star, and is the brightest example in the sky. It has a surface temperature of 57,000 to 70,000 K, and is around 100,000 times as luminous as our sun, though radiates most of its energy in the ultraviolet spectrum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/regor.html |title=Regor |last=Kaler|first=Jim|authorlink= James B.

Parallax measurements give a distance of 1116 light years. Further afield are 7.3-magnitude Gamma Velorum C and 9.4 magnitude Gamma Velorum D, lying 62 and 93 arcseconds southsoutheast from Gamma2. All four stars have a bluish hue.
The next brightest star is Delta Velorum, also a multiple star system and one of the brightest eclipsing binaries in the sky. Together with Kappa Velorum, Iota and Epsilon Carinae, it forms the diamond-shaped asterism known as the False Cross—so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. Like the Southern Cross, three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange, but it is larger and fainter.[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=Patrick|title=Patrick Moore's Astronomy: Teach Yourself|publisher=Hachette |year=2010|isbn=1444129775|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=D7M0Rgc1ONAC&pg=PT127&dq=false+cross+vela&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OUNXUvGZNYSMiALn9ICoCQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=false%20cross%20vela&f=false[/tpl] Appearing as a white star of magnitude 1.95,[tpl]cite web |url =http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=HD+74956 |title = V* Delta Velorum -- Eclipsing binary of Algol type (detached) |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 11 October 2013[/tpl] Delta is actually a triple or possibly quintuple star system located around 80 light-years from our Solar System.

===Brown dwarfs===

The discovery of a binary brown dwarf system named Luhman 16 only 6.6 light years away, the third closest system to Sol, was announced on 11 March 2013.

===Deep-sky objects===

Of the deep-sky objects of interest in Vela is a planetary nebula known as the NGC 3132, nicknamed the 'Eight-Burst Nebula' or 'Southern Ring Nebula' (see accompanying photo). It lies on the border of the constellation with Antlia. NGC 2899 is an unusual red-hued example. This constellation has 32 more planetary nebulae.
The Gum Nebula is a faint emission nebula, believed to be the remains of a million-year-old supernova. Within it lie the smaller and younger Vela Supernova Remnant. This is the nebula of a supernova explosion that is believed to have been visible from Earth around 10,000 years ago.  The remnant contains the Vela Pulsar, the first pulsar to be identified optically. Nearby is NGC 2736, also known as the Pencil Nebula.
HH-47 is a Herbig-Haro Object; a young star around 1400 light-years from our Sun that is ejecting material at tremendous speed (up to a million kilometres per hour) into its surrounds. This material glows as it hits surrounding gas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/632-alma-takes-close-look-at-drama-of-starbirth|title=ALMA Takes Close Look at Drama of Starbirth |last=Foncea |first=Valeria |coauthors=Arce; Héctor |date=20 August 2013|work=Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array|accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl]
NGC 2670 is an open cluster located in Vela. It has an overall magnitude of 7.8 and is 3200 light-years from Earth. The stars of NGC 2670, a Trumpler class II 2 p and Shapley class d cluster, are in a conformation suggesting a bow and arrow. Its class indicates that it is a poor, loose cluster, though detached from the star field. It is somewhat concentrated at its center, and its less than 50 stars range moderately in brightness.[tpl]sfn|Levy|2005|p=87[/tpl]

NGC 3201 is a globular cluster that was discovered by James Dunlop on May 28, 1826. Its stellar population is inhomogeneous, varying with distance from the core. The effective temperature of the stars shows an increase with greater distance, with the redder and cooler stars tending to be located closer to the core. As of 2010, is one of only two clusters (including Messier 4) that shows a definite inhomogeneous population.[tpl]citation | display-authors=1 | last1=Kravtsov | first1=V. | last2=Alcaíno | first2=G. | last3=Marconi | first3=G. | last4=Alvarado | first4=F. | title=Evidence of the inhomogeneity of the stellar population in the differentially reddened globular cluster NGC 3201 | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=512 | page=L6 |date=March 2010 | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200913749 | bibcode=2010A&A...512L...6K | postscript=. |arxiv = 1004.5583 [/tpl]
