[[Acid Cryptofiler]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptographic software

Acid Cryptofiler is a program designed by the "control of information" department of the French General Directorate of Armament (Direction générale de l'armement) http://www.dgdr.cnrs.fr/fsd/securite-systemes/revues-pdf/Si11.pdf CNRS Sécurité informatique n°11 march 2011
It is based on the integration of cryptographic government libraries including a CCSD Application programming interface. CCSD means "Defense Security Cryptographic Layers"
It offers the following functions:
Acid Cryptofiler is delivered with a directory function to file public keys, that is compliant with LDAP and Active Directory.
A bunch file contains all public keys held by a user. A user can belong to different cryptographic domains (a domain is a CCSD library and a set of cryptographic parameters). Private keys are also stored in a bunch file.
The keys are generated by a centralized office under the responsibility of a Chief Information Security Officer. Before he is given a key (or a pair of keys), the user must be trusted by the centralized office. In France, Acid Cryptofiler does not fit for Defense classified informations.
This software was designed and developed by two military engineers of the Direction générale de l'armement. It has been delivered since 1999 (Version 4, 5, and 7).
It runs on a Windows PC.
