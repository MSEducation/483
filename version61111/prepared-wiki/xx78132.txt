==History==

Before the 19th century, the region was inhabited by the Kaingang, an indigenous people, that was gradually reduced or assimilitated, due to migration, the bandeiras and miscegenation.[tpl]cite web|title=The advance in Kaingang lands of São Paulo's West.|url=http://www.portalkaingang.org/index_historia_5.htm|publisher=Portal Kaingang|accessdate=8 July 2011|language=Portuguese[/tpl] In the 19th century, farmers from Minas Gerais settled in the region.
The city was founded on March 19, 1852, by João Bernardino de Seixas Ribeiro, after Luis Antônio da Silveira donated part of his lands to the Catholic Church, in tribute to Saint Joseph, aiming the creation of a city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riopreto.sp.gov.br/PortalGOV/do/conhecendoCidade?op=viewForm&coConteudo=11166&coEstruturaPai=12|title=History on the Prefecture's Official Site|publisher=Riopreto.sp.gov.br|language=Portuguese|accessdate=14 June 2011[/tpl] These lands from the farm gave birth to the city.
In 1894, São José do Rio Preto was officially established as a municipality, with the emancipation from Jaboticabal. The newly created city had around 26,000 km².
With the arrival of the railroad, the Estrada de Ferro Araraquarense, in 1912, the city became the commercial center of the region, stocking and radiating the goods from the region and the state capital.

===Origin of the Name===

The literal translation is "Saint Joseph of the Black River". The city's name origin comes from the fact that Saint Joseph (São José) is the patron saint of the city, and the Rio Preto (Black river) cuts the city lands. A wooden sculpture of Saint Joseph wearing boots belongs to the city cathedral and no one knows for sure where it came from, but is in the city since it was a village in the 19th century, part of the city of Araraquara.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riopreto.sp.gov.br/PortalGOV/do/conhecendoCidade?op=viewForm&coConteudo=4174&coSeqEstrutura=327&coEstruturaPai=12|title=Historical Patrimony > Catedral de São José|publisher=Prefecture of São José do Rio Preto|accessdate=18 August 2012|language=portuguese[/tpl]
People believe that migrants from the state of Minas Gerais brought the sculpture with them in the 19th century, and that is the origin of part of the name. The river was believed black because there was a dense forest in the area, and even though the water was clear, the darkness made the river looks black. March 19, Rio Preto's birthday, is Saint Joseph's Day and a holiday in the city.
Between 1906 and 1944, the name was shortened to "Rio Preto" and in 1944 there was a proposal for changing the city's name to "Iboruna" (Black river in Tupi language), but the name returned to the current form.[tpl]cite web|title=Iboruna, 158 years|url=http://www.diariodaregiao.com.br/novoportal/Opiniao/Artigos/6832,,Iboruna,+158+anos.aspx|publisher=Diarioweb|accessdate=10 July 2011|language=pt|date=21 March 2010[/tpl]
