The Human Genome Organization (HUGO) is an organization involved in the Human Genome Project, a project about mapping the human genome.  HUGO was established in 1989 as an international organization, primarily to foster collaboration between genome scientists around the world.  The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), sometimes referred to as "HUGO", is one of HUGO's most active committees and aims to assign a unique gene name and symbol to each human gene.
