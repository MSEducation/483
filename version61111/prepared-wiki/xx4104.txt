In parts of Britain, these customs came under attack during the Reformation as some Protestants berated purgatory as a "popish" doctrine incompatible with the notion of predestination. Thus, for some Nonconformist Protestants, the theology of All Hallows’ Eve was redefined; without the doctrine of purgatory, "the returning souls cannot be journeying from Purgatory on their way to Heaven, as Catholics frequently believe and assert. Instead, the so-called ghosts are thought to be in actuality evil spirits. As such they are threatening." Other Protestants maintained belief in an intermediate state, known as Hades (Bosom of Abraham),The Episcopal Church, its teaching and worship (Latta Griswold), E.S. Gorham, page 110 and continued to observe the original customs, especially candlelit processions and the ringing of church bells in memory of the dead. With regard to the evil spirits, on Halloween, "barns and homes were blessed to protect people and livestock from the effect of witches, who were believed to accompany the malignant spirits as they traveled the earth." In the 19th century, in some rural parts of England, families gathered on hills on the night of All Hallows' Eve. One held a bunch of burning straw on a pitchfork while the rest knelt around him in a circle, praying for the souls of relatives and friends until the flames went out. This was known as teen'lay, derived either from the Old English tendan (meaning to kindle) or a word related to Old Irish tenlach (meaning hearth).Hutton, Ronald. The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain. Oxford University Press, 1996. page 373.  Note, however, that this custom was a survival of ancient pagan practice, and was not recognized or encouraged by the Church of England. The rising popularity of Guy Fawkes Night (5 November) from 1605 onward, saw many Halloween traditions appropriated by that holiday instead, and Halloween's popularity waned in Britain, with the noteworthy exception of Scotland.Rogers, Nicholas (2002). Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, pp. 37–38. New York: Oxford Univ. Press. ISBN 0-19-516896-8. There and in Ireland, they had been celebrating Samhain and Halloween since at least the early Middle Ages, and the Scottish kirk took a more pragmatic approach to Halloween, seeing it as important to the life cycle and rites of passage of communities and thus ensuring its survival in the country.
In France, some Christian families, on the night of All Hallows' Eve, prayed beside the graves of their loved ones, setting down dishes full of milk for them. On Halloween, in Italy, some families left a large meal out for ghosts of their passed relatives, before they departed for church services.Trick or Treat: A History of Halloween (Lisa Morton), Reaktion Books, Page 129 In Spain, on this night, special pastries are baked, known as “bones of the holy” (Spanish: Huesos de Santo) and put them on the graves of the churchyard, a practice that continues to this day.The Halloween Encyclopedia (Lisa Morton), McFarland, page 9

Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, pp. 49–50. New York: Oxford Univ. Press. ISBN 0-19-516896-8. Confined to the immigrant communities during the mid-19th century, it was gradually assimilated into mainstream society and by the first decade of the 20th century it was being celebrated coast to coast by people of all social, racial and religious backgrounds.Rogers, Nicholas (2002).

==Symbols==

Development of artifacts and symbols associated with Halloween formed over time. Jack-o'-lanterns are traditionally carried by guisers on All Hallows' Eve in order to frighten evil spirits.Rogers, p.57The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca, Infobase Publishing, page 183 There is a popular Irish Christian folktale associated with the jack-o'-lantern,Dante's "Commedia" and the Poetics of Christian Catabasis (Lee Foust), ProQuest, page 15 which in lore, is said to represent a "soul who has been denied entry into both heaven and hell":The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits (Rosemary Guiley), Guinness World Records Limited, page 178
[tpl]Quotation|On route home after a night's drinking, Jack encounters the Devil and tricks him into climbing a tree. A quick-thinking Jack etches the sign of the cross into the bark, thus trapping the Devil. Jack strikes a bargain that Satan can never claim his soul. After a life of sin, drink, and mendacity, Jack is refused entry to heaven when he dies. Keeping his promise, the Devil refuses to let Jack into hell and throws a live coal straight from the fires of hell at him. It was a cold night, so Jack places the coal in a hollowed out turnip to stop it from going out, since which time Jack and his lantern have been roaming looking for a place to rest.Encyclopedia of Death and Dying (Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman), Taylor & Francis, page 320[/tpl] In Ireland and Scotland, the turnip has traditionally been carved during Halloween,The Oxford companion to American food and drink p.269. Oxford University Press, 2007. Retrieved 17 February 2011 but immigrants to North America used the native pumpkin, which is both much softer and much larger – making it easier to carve than a turnip. Subsequently, the mass marketing of various size pumpkins in autumn, in both the corporate and local markets, has made pumpkins universally available for this purpose. The American tradition of carving pumpkins is recorded in 1837Nathaniel Hawthorne, "The Great Carbuncle," in Twice-Told Tales, 1837: Hide it great carbuncle under thy cloak, say'st thou? Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make thee look like a jack-o'-lantern! and was originally associated with harvest time in general, not becoming specifically associated with Halloween until the mid-to-late 19th century.As late as 1900, an article on Thanksgiving entertaining recommended a lit jack-o'-lantern as part of the festivities. "The Day We Celebrate: Thanksgiving Treated Gastronomically and Socially," The New York Times, 24 November 1895, p. 27. "Odd Ornaments for Table," The New York Times, 21 October 1900, p. 12.
The modern imagery of Halloween comes from many sources, including Christian eschatology, national customs, works of Gothic and horror literature (such as the novels Frankenstein and Dracula) and classic horror films (such as Frankenstein and The Mummy).The Rhetoric of Vision: Essays on Charles Williams (Charles Adolph Huttar, Peter J. Schakel), Bucknell University Press, page 155Rogers, Nicholas (2002). "Halloween Goes to Hollywood". Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, pp. 103–124. New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-516896-8. Imagery of the skull, a reference to Golgotha, in the Christian tradition, serves as "a reminder of death and the transitory quality of human life" and is consequently found in memento mori and vanitas compositions;A Handbook of Symbols in Christian Art (Gertrude Grace Sill), Simon and Schuster, page 64 skulls have therefore been commonplace in Halloween, which touches on this theme.In flagrante collecto (Marilynn Gelfman Karp), Abrams, page 299 Traditionally, the back walls of churches are "decorated with a depiction of the Last Judgment, complete with graves opening and the dead rising, with a heaven filled with angels and a hell filled with devils," a motif that has permeated the observance of this triduum.School Year, Church Year (Peter Mazar), Liturgy Training Publications, page 115 One of the earliest works on the subject of Halloween is from Scottish poet John Mayne, who, in 1780, made note of pranks at Halloween; "What fearfu' pranks ensue!", as well as the supernatural associated with the night, "Bogies" (ghosts), influencing Robert Burns' "Halloween" (1785).Thomas Crawford Burns: a study of the poems and songs Stanford University Press, 1960 Elements of the autumn season, such as pumpkins, corn husks and scarecrows, are also prevalent. Homes are often decorated with these types of symbols around Halloween. Halloween imagery includes themes of death, evil, and mythical monsters.Simpson, Jacqueline "All Saints' Day" in Encyclopedia of Death and Dying, Howarth, G. and Leeman, O. (2001)London Routledge ISBN 0-415-18825-3, p.14 "Halloween is closely associated in folklore with death and the supernatural". Black, orange, and sometimes purple are Halloween's traditional colors.

==Trick-or-treating and guising==

Trick-or-treating is a customary celebration for children on Halloween. Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as candy or sometimes money, with the question, "Trick or treat?" The word "trick" refers to "threat" to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given.[tpl]cite web|title=Halloween|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/252875/Halloween|work=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 October 2012[/tpl] The practice is said to have roots in the medieval practice of mumming, which is closely related to souling (discussed above).Faces Around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the Human Face (Margo DeMello), ABC-CLIO, page 225 John Pymm writes that "many of the feast days associated with the presentation of mumming plays were celebrated by the Christian Church."A Student's Guide to A2 Performance Studies for the OCR Specification (John Pymm), Rhinegold Publishing Ltd, page 28 These feast days included All Hallows' Eve, Christmas, Twelfth Night and Shrove Tuesday.Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art, Volume 1 (Thomas Green), ABC-CLIO page 566Interacting communities: studies on some aspects of migration and urban ethnology (Zsuzsa Szarvas), Hungarian Ethnographic Society, page 314 Mumming, practised in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe,The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature (David Scott Kastan), Oxford University Press, page 47 involved masked persons in fancy dress who "paraded the streets and entered houses to dance or play dice in silence." Their "basic narrative framework is the story of St. George and the Seven Champions of Christendom.""Mumming Play", Encyclopaedia Britannica
In Scotland and Ireland, guising – children disguised in costume going from door to door for food or coins  – is a traditional Halloween custom, and is recorded in Scotland at Halloween in 1895 where masqueraders in disguise carrying lanterns made out of scooped out turnips, visit homes to be rewarded with cakes, fruit and money.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x7_QAAAAMAAJ&dq=Frank%20Leslie's%20popular%20monthly%201895%20Halloween&pg=PA540#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Frank Leslie's popular monthly, Volume 40, November 1895, p. 540-543 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl] The practice of guising at Halloween in North America is first recorded in 1911, where a newspaper in Kingston, Ontario reported children going "guising" around the neighborhood.Rogers, Nicholas. (2002) "Coming Over:Halloween in North America". Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night. p.76. Oxford University Press, 2002, ISBN 0-19-514691-3
American historian and author Ruth Edna Kelley of Massachusetts wrote the first book length history of Halloween in the US; The Book of Hallowe'en (1919), and references souling in the chapter "Hallowe'en in America":
 The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using Burns' poem Hallowe'en as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now.Ruth Edna Kelley, The Book of Hallowe'en, Boston: Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Co., 1919, chapter 15, p.127. "Hallowe'en in America." 
In her book, Kelley touches on customs that arrived from across the Atlantic;  "Americans have fostered them, and are making this an occasion something like what it must have been in its best days overseas. All Halloween customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries".[tpl]cite web |last=Kelley |first=Ruth Edna |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/boh/boh17.htm |title=Hallowe'en in America[/tpl] While the first reference to "guising" in North America occurs in 1911, another reference to ritual begging on Halloween appears, place unknown, in 1915, with a third reference in Chicago in 1920.Theo. E. Wright, "A Halloween Story," St. Nicholas, October 1915, p. 1144. Mae McGuire Telford, "What Shall We Do Halloween?" Ladies Home Journal, October 1920, p. 135.
The earliest known use in print of the term "trick or treat" appears in 1927, from Blackie, Alberta, Canada: Hallowe'en provided an opportunity for real strenuous fun. No real damage was done except to the temper of some who had to hunt for wagon wheels, gates, wagons, barrels, etc., much of which decorated the front street. The youthful tormentors were at back door and front demanding edible plunder by the word “trick or treat” to which the inmates gladly responded and sent the robbers away rejoicing."'Trick or Treat' Is Demand," Herald (Lethbridge, Alberta), November 4, 1927, p. 5, dateline Blackie, Alberta, Nov. 3. 
The thousands of Halloween postcards produced between the turn of the 20th century and the 1920s commonly show children but not trick-or-treating.For examples, see the websites Postcard & Greeting Card Museum: Halloween Gallery, Antique Hallowe'en Postcards, Vintage Halloween Postcards, and Morticia's Morgue Antique Halloween Postcards. The editor of a collection of over 3,000 vintage Halloween postcards writes, "There are cards which mention the custom trick-or-treating or show children in costumes at the doors, but as far as we can tell they were printed later than the 1920s and more than likely even the 1930s. Tricksters of various sorts are shown on the early postcards, but not the means of appeasing them".E-mail from Louise and Gary Carpentier, 29 May 2007, editors of Halloween Postcards Catalog (CD-ROM), G & L Postcards. Trick-or-treating does not seem to have become a widespread practice until the 1930s, with the first U.S. appearances of the term in 1934,"Halloween Pranks Keep Police on Hop," Oregon Journal (Portland, Oregon), 1 November 1934: Other young goblins and ghosts, employing modern shakedown methods, successfully worked the "trick or treat" system in all parts of the city.  "The Gangsters of Tomorrow", The Helena Independent (Helena, Montana), 2 November 1934, p. 4: Pretty Boy John Doe rang the door bells and his gang waited his signal. It was his plan to proceed cautiously at first and give a citizen every opportunity to comply with his demands before pulling any rough stuff. "Madam, we are here for the usual purpose, 'trick or treat.'" This is the old demand of the little people who go out to have some innocent fun. Many women have some apples, cookies or doughnuts for them, but they call rather early and the "treat" is given out gladly.  The Chicago Tribune also mentioned door-to-door begging in Aurora, Illinois on Halloween in 1934, although not by the term "trick-or-treating." "Front Views and Profiles" (column), Chicago Tribune, 3 November 1934, p. 17. and the first use in a national publication occurring in 1939.Doris Hudson Moss, "A Victim of the Window-Soaping Brigade?" The American Home, November 1939, p. 48. Moss was a California-based writer.
A popular variant of trick-or-treating, known as trunk-or-treating (or Halloween tailgaiting), occurs when "children are offered treats from the trunks of cars parked in a church parking lot," or sometimes, a school parking lot.Bluff Park (Heather Jones Skaggs), Arcadia Publishing, page 117 In a trunk-or-treat event, the trunk (boot) of each automobile is decorated with a certain theme,"Trunk-or-Treat", The Chicago Tribune such as those of children's literature, movies, scripture, and job roles.Suggested Themes for “Trunks” for Trunk or Treat (Dail R. Faircloth), First Baptist Church of Royal Palm Beach Because the traditional style of trick-or-treating was made impossible after Hurricane Katrina, trunk-or-treating provided comfort to those whose homes were devastated.Culture After the Hurricanes: Rhetoric and Reinvention on the Gulf Coast (M. B. Hackler), University Press of Mississippi, page 177 Trunk-or-treating has grown in popularity due to its perception as being more safe than going door to door, a point that resonates well with parents, as well as the fact that it "solves the rural conundrum in which homes are built a half-mile apart"."Trunk or Treat focuses on fun, children's safety", Desert Valley Times"Trunk or Treat! Halloween Tailgating Grows" (Fernanda Santos), The New York Times

===Costumes===

Halloween costumes are traditionally modeled after supernatural figures such as vampires, monsters, ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. Over time, in the United States the costume selection extended to include popular characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic archetypes such as ninjas and princesses.
Dressing up in costumes and going "guising" was prevalent in Ireland and Scotland at Halloween by the late 19th century. Costuming became popular for Halloween parties in the US in the early 20th century, as often for adults as for children. The first mass-produced Halloween costumes appeared in stores in the 1930s when trick-or-treating was becoming popular in the United States.
Rev. Dr. Eddie J. Smith, in his book Halloween, Hallowed Be Thy Name, offers a religious perspective to the wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures "who at one time caused us to fear and tremble", people are able to poke fun at Satan "whose kingdom has been plundered by our Saviour." Images of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as memento mori.School Year, Church Year (Peter Mazar), Liturgy Training Publications, page 114Memento Mori, Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri

===UNICEF===

"Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF" is a fundraising program to support UNICEF, a United Nations Programme that provides humanitarian aid to children in developing countries. Started as a local event in a Northeast Philadelphia neighborhood in 1950 and expanded nationally in 1952, the program involves the distribution of small boxes by schools (or in modern times, corporate sponsors like Hallmark, at their licensed stores) to trick-or-treaters, in which they can solicit small-change donations from the houses they visit. It is estimated that children have collected more than $118 million for UNICEF since its inception. In Canada, in 2006, UNICEF decided to discontinue their Halloween collection boxes, citing safety and administrative concerns; after consultation with schools, they instead redesigned the program.[tpl]cite news |first=Genevieve |last=Beauchemin |coauthors=CTV.ca News Staff |title=UNICEF to end Halloween 'orange box' program |url= http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&no_ads= |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071016235444/http://ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060530/unicef_orange_060530?s_name=&no_ads= |archivedate= 16 October 2007 |publisher=CTV |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate=29 October 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=History of the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF Campaign |url =http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20090604032837/http://www.trickortreatforunicef.ca/tot_history.html |archivedate =4 June 2009 |publisher=UNICEF Canada |year=2008 |accessdate=25 October 2009[/tpl]

==Games and other activities==

There are several games traditionally associated with Halloween parties. One common game is dunking or apple bobbing, which may be called "dooking" in Scotland"Apple dookers make record attempt", BBC News, 2 October 2008 in which apples float in a tub or a large basin of water and the participants must use their teeth to remove an apple from the basin. The practice is thought by some to have derived from the Roman practices in celebration of Pomona. A variant of dunking involves kneeling on a chair, holding a fork between the teeth and trying to drive the fork into an apple. Another common game involves hanging up treacle or syrup-coated scones by strings; these must be eaten without using hands while they remain attached to the string, an activity that inevitably leads to a very sticky face.
Some games traditionally played at Halloween are forms of divination. In All Hallows' Eve celebrations during the Middle Ages, these activities historically occurred only in rural areas of medieval Europe and were only done by a "rare few" as these were considered to be "deadly serious" practices. A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name.McNeill, F. Marian (1961, 1990) The Silver Bough, Vol. 3. William MacLellan, Glasgow ISBN 0-948474-04-1 pp.11–46 Unmarried women were told that if they sat in a darkened room and gazed into a mirror on Halloween night, the face of their future husband would appear in the mirror. However, if they were destined to die before marriage, a skull would appear. The custom was widespread enough to be commemorated on greeting cards[tpl]cite web |url=http://vintageholidaycrafts.com/vintage-halloween-women/ |title=Vintage Halloween Cards |publisher=Vintage Holiday Crafts |accessdate=28 October 2009[/tpl] from the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Another game/superstition that was enjoyed in the early 1900s involved walnut shells. People would write fortunes in milk on white paper. After drying, the paper was folded and placed in walnut shells. When the shell was warmed, milk would turn brown therefore the writing would appear on what looked like blank paper. Folks would also play fortune teller. In order to play this game, symbols were cut out of paper and placed on a platter. Someone would enter a dark room and was ordered to put her hand on a piece of ice then lay it on a platter. Her "fortune" would stick to the hand. Paper symbols included: dollar sign-wealth, button-bachelorhood, thimble-spinsterhood, clothespin- poverty, rice-wedding, umbrella- journey, caldron-trouble, 4-leaf clover- good luck, penny-fortune, ring-early marriage, and key-fame.Green Bay Press Gazette, 27 October 1916
The telling of ghost stories and viewing of horror films are common fixtures of Halloween parties. Episodes of television series and Hallowe'en-themed specials (with the specials usually aimed at children) are commonly aired on or before Halloween, while new horror films are often released theatrically before Halloween to take advantage of the atmosphere.

==Haunted attractions==

Haunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons. Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses. Origins of these paid scare venues are difficult to pinpoint, but it is generally accepted that they were first commonly used by the Junior Chamber International (Jaycees) for fundraising.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9855272/|title=Haunted house business getting frightfully hard|last=Associated Press|date=30 October 2005|work=MSNBC.com|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=18 November 2008[/tpl] They include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/October-2008/A-Model-of-Mayhem/ |title=A Model of Mayhem |accessdate=6 October 2008 |author=Greg Ryan |date=17 September 2008 |work=Hudson Valley Magazine[/tpl] and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown. Haunted attractions in the United States bring in an estimate $300–500 million each year, and draw some 400,000 customers, although press sources writing in 2005 speculated that the industry had reached its peak at that time. This maturing and growth within the industry has led to technically more advanced special effects and costuming, comparable with that of Hollywood films.[tpl]cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-10-11-haunted-house-main_x.htm |title=Haunted houses get really scary|last=Wilson|first=Craig|date=12 October 2006 |work=USAToday.com[/tpl]

==Food==

Because in the Northern Hemisphere Halloween comes in the wake of the yearly apple harvest, candy apples (known as toffee apples outside North America), caramel or taffy apples are common Halloween treats made by rolling whole apples in a sticky sugar syrup, sometimes followed by rolling them in nuts.
At one time, candy apples were commonly given to trick-or-treating children, but the practice rapidly waned in the wake of widespread rumors that some individuals were embedding items like pins and razor blades in the apples in the United States.Rogers, Nicholas (2002). "Razor in the Apple: Struggle for Safe and Sane Halloween, c. 1920–1990," Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night, pp. 78–102. New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-516896-8. While there is evidence of such incidents,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/needles.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Pins and Needles in Halloween Candy |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=31 October 2008[/tpl] relative to the degree of reporting of such cases, actual cases involving malicious acts are extremely rare and have never resulted in serious injury. Nonetheless, many parents assumed that such heinous practices were rampant because of the mass media. At the peak of the hysteria, some hospitals offered free X-rays of children's Halloween hauls in order to find evidence of tampering. Virtually all of the few known candy poisoning incidents involved parents who poisoned their own children's candy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/8839-poisoned-halloween-candy-trick-treat-myth.html |title=Poisoned Halloween Candy: Trick, Treat or Myth? – LiveScience|last=Nixon|first=Robin|date=27 October 2010 |publisher=LiveScience.com |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl]
One custom that persists in modern-day Ireland is the baking (or more often nowadays, the purchase) of a barmbrack ([tpl]lang-gle|báirín breac[/tpl]), which is a light fruitcake, into which a plain ring, a coin and other charms are placed before baking. It is said that those who get a ring will find their true love in the ensuing year. This is similar to the tradition of king cake at the festival of Epiphany.

On Hallowe'en (All Hallows' Eve), in Poland, believers are taught to pray out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort; in Spain, Christian priests toll their church bells in order to remind their congregants to remember the dead on All Hallows' Eve.[tpl]cite book|last=Bannatyne|first=Lesley Pratt|title=Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rNAXt9jLXWwC&pg=PA12&dq=Hallowe'en+All+Hallows+Eve+Spain+church+bells&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mx-TUPOTBJTM9gTAooDwAQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2012|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=1565543467|page=12|quote=Polish Catholics taught their children to pray out loud as they walked through the woods so that the souls of the dead could hear them and be comforted.

On major feast days, they would have an extended service of readings (scriptural, patristic, and from lives of the saints) in addition to chanting the psalms.  This all would be done in the dark, of course, and was an opportunity to listen carefully to the Word of God as well as the words of the Church Fathers and great saints.

Other Protestant Christians also celebrate All Hallows' Eve as Reformation Day, a day to remember the Protestant Reformation, alongside All Hallow's Eve or independently from it.[tpl]cite web | title = Reformation Day | url = http://www.monergism.com/directory/link_category/MP3-Audio--Multimedia/Holiday-Sermons/Reformation-Sunday/ | accessdate =22 October 2009 | postscript = [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gbod.org/worship/default.asp?act=reader&item_id=15084&loc_id=9,612,32,52 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070223075856/http://www.gbod.org/worship/default.asp?act=reader&item_id=15084&loc_id=9,612,32,52 | archivedate = 23 February 2007 | title = Reformation Day: What, Why, and Resources for Worship | accessdate =22 October 2006 |date=21 October 2005 | publisher = The General Board of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church[/tpl] This is because Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to All Saints' Church in Wittenberg on All Hallows' Eve, because hundreds of visitors would come to the church during the celebration of Hallowtide.Halloween, Hallowed Is Thy Name (Smith), page 29 Often, "Harvest Festivals" or "Reformation Festivals" are held on All Hallows' Eve, in which children dress up as Bible characters or Reformers.[tpl]cite web|title=Christians and Halloween|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/Articles/A123#.TrBJnPSa9GU|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|quote=Other Christians will opt for Halloween alternatives called "Harvest Festivals", "Hallelujah Night" or "Reformation Festivals"--the kids dress up as farmers, Bible characters, or Reformation heroes.|publisher=John F.

Some Christians feel concerned about the modern celebration of Halloween because they feel it trivializes – or celebrates – paganism, the occult, or other practices and cultural phenomena deemed incompatible with their beliefs.Halloween: What's a Christian to Do? (1998) by Steve Russo. Father Gabriele Amorth, an exorcist in Rome, has said, "if English and American children like to dress up as witches and devils on one night of the year that is not a problem. If it is just a game, there is no harm in that."Gyles Brandreth, "The Devil is gaining ground" Sunday Telegraph (London), 11 March 2000. In more recent years, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has organized a "Saint Fest" on Halloween. Similarly, many contemporary Protestant churches view Halloween as a fun event for children, holding events in their churches where children and their parents can dress up, play games, and get candy for free. Many Christians ascribe no negative significance to Halloween, treating it as a fun event devoted to "imaginary spooks" and handing out candy. To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage.[tpl]cite web | url = http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic/samhain.html | title = Feast of Samhain/Celtic New Year/Celebration of All Celtic Saints 1 November | accessdate =22 November 2006 | date = n.d. | publisher = All Saints Parish[/tpl]

====Other religions====

The reaction of non-Christian religions towards Halloween has often been mixed, ranging from stern disapproval to the allowance of participation in it. According to Alfred J. Kolatch in the Second Jewish Book of Why, in Judaism, Halloween is not permitted by Jewish Halakha because it violates Leviticus 18:3 which forbids Jews from partaking in gentile customs. Many Jews observe Yizkor, which is equivalent to the observance of Hallowtide in Christianity, as prayers are said for both "martyrs and for one's own family."The Jewish Life Cycle: rites of passage from biblical to modern times (Ivan G. Marcus), University of Washington Press, page 232 Nevertheless many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Halloween.html |title=Jews and Halloween |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] Reform Rabbi Jeffrey Goldwasser has said that “There is no religious reason why contemporary Jews should not celebrate Halloween" while Orthodox Rabbi Michael Broyde has argued against Jews observing the holiday.[tpl]cite web |url=http://haamnews.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/halloween-and-judaism-a-contradiction-or-a-coalition/ |title=Halloween and Judaism: a contradiction or a coalition? |publisher=Haamnews.wordpress.com |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2013[/tpl] Sheikh Idris Palmer, author of A Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam , has argued that Muslims should not participate in Halloween, stating that "participation in it is similar to one commemorating Christmas or Easter, or congratulating the Christians upon their prostration to the crucifix".On Halloween (Idris Palmer), Fataawaa Javed Memon, a Muslim writer, has disagreed, saying that his "daughter dressing up like a British telephone booth will not destroy her faith".Why Can't Muslims Enjoy Halloween?
