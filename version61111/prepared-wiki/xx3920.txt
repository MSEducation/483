===As a nucleophilic reagent===

The hydroxide ion is intermediate in nucleophilicity between the fluoride ion F−, and the amide ion NH2−.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mullins|first=J.J.|year=2008|title=Six Pillars of Organic Chemistry|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|volume=85|issue=1|page=83|doi=10.1021/ed085p83|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85...83M [/tpl]pdf The hydrolysis of an ester
also known as saponification is an example of a nucleophilic acyl substitution with the hydroxide ion acting as a nucleophile. In this case the leaving group is an alkoxide ion, which immediately removes a proton from a water molecule to form an alcohol. In the manufacture of soap, sodium chloride is added to salt out the sodium salt of the carboxylic acid; this is an example of the application of the common-ion effect.
Other cases where hydroxide can act as a nucleophilic reagent are amide hydrolysis, the Cannizzaro reaction, nucleophilic aliphatic substitution, nucleophilic aromatic substitution and in elimination reactions. The reaction medium for KOH and NaOH is usually water but with a phase-transfer catalyst the hydroxide anion can be shuttled into an organic solvent as well, for example in the generation of dichlorocarbene.
