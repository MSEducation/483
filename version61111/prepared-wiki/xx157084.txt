Pubic Fruit is a compilation album by Curve, containing the band's first three EPs and an extended mix of 'Faît Accompli'.
Curve released three critically acclaimed and increasingly successful EPs, The Blindfold EP, The Frozen EP and The Cherry EP, in the UK throughout 1991. None of these EPs' songs were included on the band's début, Doppelgänger, except for 'Clipped' which was included on the US pressing only. Pubic Fruit was  released shortly after Doppelgänger to collect together the early EPs. The album also included an extended version of hit single 'Faît Accompli'.
Pubic Fruit was only officially released in the USA, though it has been widely exported and is now the easiest way to acquire Curve's earliest releases.
