In his early adulthood, Norwood worked as a printer, and studied science and medicine. In 1836, upon completion of a thesis on spinal diseases, he graduated from  Transylvania Medical College in  Lexington.  In 1840 he was appointed chair of the surgery department of the Madison Medical Institute in Indiana, and from 1843-1847 he was chair of the medical school at St. Louis University.[tpl]cite book |title=History of Boone County, Missouri |url=http://archive.org/details/historyofbooneco01stlo |accessdate=August 13, 2013 |year=1882 |publisher=Western Historical Company |location=St. Louis  |pages=917-920[/tpl]

Beginning in 1847, he shifted careers to geology.  From 1847-1851 he worked for David Dale Owen performing field survey throughout Wisconsin Territory and Iowa.  In 1851 he was appointed Illinois State Geologist.  During this period, he was a middleman in the discovery of the first dire wolf specimen.  In 1858 he was dismissed from the Illinois job under acrimonious and politically motivated circumstances.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kimberling |first=Clark |year=1996 |title=David Dale Owen and Joseph Granville Norwood: Pioneer Geologists in Indiana and Illinois |journal=Indiana Magazine of History |volume=XCII |issue=March |pages= |publisher=Trustees of Indiana University  |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/imh/view.do?docId=VAA4025-092-1-a01 |accessdate=August 13, 2013[/tpl]  He was immediately offered and accepted the same position for the State of Missouri.

In 1872 he was appointed dean of the new School of Medicine, the first public school of medicine west of the Mississippi.  In 1880 his health declined after a fall, and until his death in 1895 he held the title of professor emeritus in physics.
