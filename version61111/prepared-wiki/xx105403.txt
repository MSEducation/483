==Use in  Control Design==

Given a transfer function,
with the closed-loop transfer function defined as,
In  feedback control design, the plot is useful for assessing the stability and robustness of a linear system.  This application of the Nichols plot is central to the Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) of Horowitz and Sidi, which is a well known method for robust control system design.
