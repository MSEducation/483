These are the results of the women's uneven bars competition, one of six events for female competitors of the artistic gymnastics discipline contested in the gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The qualification and final rounds were supposed to take place on August 15 but were moved back to August 22 at the Olympic Indoor Hall. This was due to the "over uneven-ness" of the bars.
