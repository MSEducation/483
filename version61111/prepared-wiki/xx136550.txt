Killa Season is a 2006 direct to video film about a rapper's early life as a hustler.

==Overview==

Cam'ron's debut into the film world chronicles a loosely autobiographical plot of his own transformation from a high school basketball star to a full-time coke dealer. Cam'ron's character is named "Flea."
The movie also starred Juelz Santana as "Bandana" and Hell Rell as Hell.
Other members of the Diplomats who made appearances in the film included 40 Cal, Un Kasa, J. R. Writer and "Chubbie Baby," who served as Flea's supplier of firearms. However, these three members played minor roles and their parts did not involve much dialogue. Jim Jones, The Diplomats co-founder, is seen only briefly in the beginning of the film. However, near the end of the scene in which the Diplomats go to Atlanta, Jim Jones is blurred out but can be identified by one of his slogans.
The movie was released in 2006, nearly simultaneously with the Killa Season album. It was shown at a few theaters in New York City and is available on DVD.
In one scene, female Colombian drug mules defecate onto newspaper in an abandoned apartment. They are then made to clean off the "fingers" of heroin they've smuggled in.
Many viewers mistake the powder in the movie as cocaine instead of heroin. Flea actually sells 'china white,' which is a white powder form of heroin. In the scene where Flea watches a 'drug fiend' snort the powder and fall on the ground because the powder's so potent, many mistakenly assume the powder is cocaine since the fiend snorts it.
