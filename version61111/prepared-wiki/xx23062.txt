Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American recording artist and actress. Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television appearances, and film roles, she is a prominent figure in popular culture.
After signing a recording contract with A&M, she came to prominence following the release of her third studio album, Control (1986). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated pop with elements of rhythm and blues, dance, funk, rock, and industrial overtones, leading to appeal in popular music. Her fourth album, Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), focused on socially conscious themes and various musical styles, and made Jackson the only artist in history to garner seven top five singles from the same album. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation of her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio and music channels, she was acknowledged as a role model for her lyrical substance.
Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking, multimillion dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the industry's highest paid artists. Her debut album under the label, janet. (1993), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol as she began to explore carnality in her work. Upon its release, she played the starring role in the film Poetic Justice; and has continued to act in feature films, including The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and the Why Did I Get Married? franchise. Her following album, The Velvet Rope (1997), discussed themes of depression and sadomasochism, spawning the biggest hit of her career, "Together Again". By the end of the nineties, Billboard named her the second most successful recording artist of the decade, following Mariah Carey. Jackson's seventh album, All for You (2001), returned to an upbeat, optimistic sound. It was succeeded by Damita Jo (2004), 20 Y.O. (2006), and Discipline (2008).
Having sold over 140 million records, she is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/18731/20140422/janet-jackson-celebrity-style-evolution.htm |title=Janet Jackson's Celebrity style evolution|publisher=Ashley Joy parker |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/nation/10-most-popular-female-soloists-of-all-time/2/ |title=Janet Jackson - The Richest |publisher=TheRichest.com |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-18[/tpl] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists her as the eleventh best-selling female artist in the United States, with 26 million certified albums.[tpl]Citation | title = Top Selling Artists | publisher=Recording Industry Association of America | url = http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt | accessdate = September 3, 2008[/tpl] In 2012, Billboard declared Jackson the seventh most successful female artist of the past twenty years, the ninth most successful overall, and was previously ranked second during the mid-decade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a429429/rihanna-named-billboards-top-pop-chart-artist.html|title=Rihanna named Billboard's top Pop Chart artist - | work = Music News|publisher=Digital Spy|work=Corner, Lewis|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2004/toppop1.htm|title=Rock On The Net: The ARC Archive: Top Pop Artists of the Past 25 Years: 1-50|publisher=Rock on the Net|date=December 2004|accessdate=14-02-14[/tpl] In 2010, the publication declared her as the fifth most successful R&B artist of the past twenty-five years.

==Life and career==

===1966–82: Early life and career beginnings===

Janet Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, the youngest of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson.[tpl]Citation | last = Cornwell | first = Jane| title = Janet Jackson | publisher=Carlton Books | year = 2002 | pages = 2, 10, 24 | isbn = 1-84222-464-6[/tpl] The Jacksons were lower-middle class and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion.[tpl]citation|last=Norment|first=Lynn|title=Janet: On her sexuality, spirituality, failed marriages, and lessons learned|newspaper=Jet|volume=57|issue=1|page=104|date=November 2001|issn=0012-9011[/tpl] At a young age, her brothers began performing as The Jackson 5. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey for two years. Jackson also played the recurring role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series.[tpl]Citation | last = Fox | first = Norman | title = Indian Summer | publisher=tv.com | url = http://www.tv.com/fame/indian-summer/episode/77620/summary.html | accessdate = September 3, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Citation |last= Saunders |first= Michael | title=The 3 Divas Janet Jackson turns her focus inward | newspaper=The Boston Globe | page=D13 | date=October 3, 1996[/tpl]

Jackson's "chiseled abs" and "willingness to work ensemble-style" were also commended, in addition to Jackson involving "jubilant entertainment over somber art" and having "embraced the past instead of avoiding it".

===2004–05: Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy and Damita Jo===

Jackson was chosen by the National Football League and MTV to perform at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February 2004. Jackson performed a medley of "All for You", "Rhythm Nation", and an excerpt of "The Knowledge" before performing "Rock Your Body" alongside surprise guest Justin Timberlake. As Timberlake sang the lyric "I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song", he tore open her costume, exposing her right breast to 140 million viewers. Jackson issued an apology after the performance, saying the incident was accidental and unintended, explaining that Timberlake was only meant to pull away a bustier and leave the red-lace bra intact.[tpl]Citation | title = Apologetic Jackson says 'costume reveal' went awry |publisher=CNN | date = February 3, 2004 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson/ | accessdate = May 20, 2006[/tpl] She commented, "I am really sorry if I offended anyone.

Following the incident, Jackson's singles and music videos were blacklisted on many radio formats and music channels worldwide, enforced by conglomerates involved with producing the Halftime show who were heavily fined by the FCC and taken to Supreme Court. Conglomerates involved in the boycott include Viacom and CBS, and subsidiaries MTV, Clear Channel Communications, and Infinity Broadcasting, the latter two among the largest radio broadcasters.[tpl]Citation | title = Blackballed - Panache Report | publisher=Panach Report | year = 2004 | url = http://panachereport.com/channels/old_school_update/Blackballed.htm | accessdate = June 18, 2013[/tpl] The blacklist was placed into effect preceding the release of Jackson's eighth studio album Damita Jo, and continued throughout the course of Jackson's following two albums. Timberlake, who also performed with Jackson during the incident, did not receive the same treatment. Rolling Stone disclosed "CBS and MTV’s parent company Viacom, angered that an unannounced addition to the Super Bowl performance has now cost them all future halftime shows, hits back at Janet by essentially blacklisting her, keeping her music videos off their properties MTV, VH1, and radio stations under their umbrella. The blacklist spreads to include non-Viacom media entities as well", adding "Thanks to the radio and music television blacklist, the LP underperforms compared to Janet’s previous releases ... Despite the backlash, the album eventually goes platinum several times over."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/nipple-ripples-10-years-of-fallout-from-janet-jacksons-halftime-show-20140130|title=Nipple Ripples: 10 Years of Fallout From Janet Jackson's Halftime Show|work=Rolling Stone |publisher=Kreps, Daniel|accessdate=30-01-14 |date=30-01-14[/tpl] Newsweek also commented, "Unfortunately, it's not clear whether these songs will get heard," saying after the incident, "Jackson has been put in the pop culture penalty box. The result is that despite some initial backing for "Just a Little While", radio and TV support for her music has withered, as the conglomerates worry about angering the FCC and Congress," in fear of receiving fines for supporting Jackson. Additionally, a senior executive for entertainment conglomerate Viacom, which owns MTV, VH1, and many radio formats, commented they were "absolutely bailing on the record. The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure."[tpl]cite book |last=Tannenbaum |first=Robert |year=2004 |title=America's Most Wanted | publisher = Blender Magazine| page=128[/tpl] Several critics provided commentary on the boycott. Billboard reported Damita Jo "was largely overshadowed by the Super Bowl fiasco," saying "The three singles it spawned were blacklisted by pop radio—they were also the albums biggest highlights—the electronic guitar studded "Just a Little While", Motown-influenced "I Want You" and the funky, heavily dance orientated "All Nite (Don't Stop)".[tpl]Citation| last = Hope | first = Clover | title = Together Again: Janet Jackson |work=Billboard | date = February 4, 2008 | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046632/together-again-janet-jackson | accessdate = March 23, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://thebillboardfiles.blogspot.com/2008/11/janet-jackson-discography.html|title=The Billboard Files: Janet Jackson discography|date=November 14, 2009|accessdate=September 30, 2013|publisher=Billboard[/tpl] Langston Wertz Jr. of The Charlotte Observer said Jackson became one of the "most villified female artists of all time" in the media, stating due to the blacklist, "radio wouldn't play it and MTV wouldn't play her videos for "I Want You" and "All Nite", two songs that would've been out-of-the-park hits at any other point in Jackson's career."[tpl]cite web|url=http://langstonwertz.blogspot.com/2006/10/near-wardrobe-malfunction-great-music.html|title=Games N Gadgets: Near Wardrobe Malfunction, Great Music for Janet Jackson in "20 YO"|work=Charlotte Observer|publisher=Charlotte Observer|date=October 4, 2006|accessdate=13-20-10[/tpl]

Eric Henderson of Slant magazine claimed critics opposing her voice "somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty' ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'."[tpl]Citation| last=Henderson | first=Eric | title = Slant Magazine Music Review: Janet Jackson: Control |work=Slant | year = 2003 | url = http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=367 | accessdate = June 30, 2008[/tpl] Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her "rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice."[tpl]citation|last=Andriessen|first=Louis|coauthors=Maja Trochimczyk|title=The music of Louis Andriessen|publisher=Routledge|page=61|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8153-3789-8[/tpl] Several critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Biographer David Ritz commented, "on Janet's albums—and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique ... singing wasn't the point," saying emphasis was placed on "her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values." Music critic J. D. Considine noted "on albums, Jackson's sound isn't defined by her voice so much as by the way her voice is framed by the lush, propulsive production."[tpl]citation|author=J.D.

She doesn’t blow, she whispers, yet consistently delivers a musical message that hits home with her loyal fan base. ...

Perpetus added, "her presence is essential to the success of the piece. Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance, ... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a [tpl]Sic|hide=y|fully|-[/tpl]formed human being with contradictions and complexities."[tpl]Citation |url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081012061052/http://www.fluxblog.org/2008/07/your-new-influences-1.html|title = FLUXBLOG: New, Unusual, Trendy, and Zany|work=Fluxblog|publisher=Perpelus, Matthew|date = 02-07-08|accessdate=20-02-14[/tpl]
Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres with contemporary pop, including R&B, dance, rock, hip-hop, soul, house, and industrial music.

Her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince, as her producers are ex-members of The Time.[tpl]Citation|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Pop and Jazz Guide|pages=C.23|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 1986|issn=0362-4331[/tpl] Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining Top 40 radio, she "gave Prince's Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine—and, with songs like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately?,' 'Nasty,' 'Control,' and 'Let's Wait Awhile,' a distinctly feminist—spin."[tpl]citation|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=Janet Jackson: Number Ones |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=1921 |publisher=Slant Magazine|date=November 19, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2009[/tpl] On Control, Richard J. Ripani documented Jam and Lewis and Jackson collaborating to "crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility."

Jackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years, becoming the subject of analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies.[tpl]Citation|last=Smith|first=Jessie Carney|title = Notable Black American Women, Volume 2 | publisher=Gale|year=1996|page=324|isbn=978-0-8103-9177-2[/tpl][tpl]citation|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|coauthors=Joy Press|title=The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=297|year=1996|isbn=978-0-674-80273-5[/tpl] David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, "like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain." Much of her success has been attributed to "a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge."[tpl]citation|last=MacCambridge|first=Michael|title=Worth a note|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|page=G.2|date=October 19, 1989[/tpl] Ritz also stated, "The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear." During the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization, feminist principles, and politically driven ideology.[tpl]citation|last=Goren|first=Lilly|title=You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=61|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8131-2544-2[/tpl] Gillian G. Gaar, author of She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock & Roll (2002), described Control as "an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free." Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture (2010) author Jessie Carney Smith wrote "with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ingénue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity."[tpl]citation|author=Jessie Carney Smith|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|pages=738, 739|isbn=9780313357978[/tpl] Referring to Rhythm Nation 1814 as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer, author of Born in the USA: The Myth of America in Popular Music from Colonial Times to the Present (2007) wrote "It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people."[tpl]citation | author=Timothy E.

Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music over the following decade "branded her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s."[tpl]citation|author=Shayne Lee|title=Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture|publisher=Government Institutes|year=2010|pages=12–16|isbn=978-0-7618-5228-5[/tpl] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust."[tpl]Citation | last= Klein| first=Joshua | title=Janet Jackson's Lighthearted Lament About Lost Love | newspaper=The Washington Post | page= C01 | date=April 25, 2001[/tpl] The song "Free Xone" from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." During promotion for janet., she stated "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring - and liberating - my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," adding "As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation."[tpl]cite book |first=David |last=Ritz |year=2004 |title=The Naked Truth |page=64| publisher = Upscale[/tpl] The sexual explicit content of her latter albums have drawn mixed reactions—ranging from acclaim to abhorrence—often in juxtaposition to Madonna, who is known as her counterpart.[tpl]citation|last=Jordan|first=Emma|coauthors=Angela Harris|title=When Markets Fail: Race And Economics : Cases And Materials|publisher=Foundation Press|page=433|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58778-955-7[/tpl] Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it all depends on the artist."[tpl]Citation |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas | title = Damita Jo |publisher=Allmusic | year = 2004| url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r680820|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | accessdate = February 8, 2009[/tpl]

Jackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others.[tpl]Citation| last = Mitoma | first = Judy| title = Envisioning dance on film and video | publisher=Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 16 | isbn = 0-415-94171-7 | coauthors= Judith Mitoma, Elizabeth Zimmer, Dale Ann Stieber, Nelli Heinonen, Norah Zuniga Shaw[/tpl] Throughout her career, she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence, such as Tina Landon, Paula Abdul, and Michael Kidd.[tpl]Citation| last = Cutcher | first = Jenai | title = Feel the Beat: Dancing in Music Videos | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | year = 2003 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8239-4558-8[/tpl] Janine Coveney of Billboard observed that "Jackson's musical declaration of independence Control launched a string of hits, an indelible production sound, and an enduring image cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still emulate."

Beretta E. Smith-Shomade, author of Shaded Lives: African-American Women and Television (2002), wrote that "Jackson's impact on the music video sphere came largely through music sales successes, which afforded her more visual liberties and control. This assuming of control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos, giving Jackson an agency not assumed by many other artists—male or female, Black or White."[tpl]citation|author=Beretta E.

Her music videos have contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007), wrote "In Alfred Kinsey's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had received oral sex from a man. By the mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend," with Jackson "heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position."[tpl]citation|author=Jean M. Twenge|title=Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2007|page=167[/tpl] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that "in the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," citing Jackson as a prime example of a female artist simulating cunnilingus in her videos.[tpl]citation|author=Paula Kamen|title=Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution|publisher=NYU Press|year=2000|page=76[/tpl] However, accusations of cosmetic surgery, skin lightening, and increasingly hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white, male-dominated view of sexuality, rather than liberating herself or others.
The Independent writer Nicholas Barber stated "Janet's concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies."[tpl]Citation |last=Barber | first=Nicholas | title=Rock music: Janet Jackson gets lost in her own limelight | newspaper=The Independent | page=6 | date=June 7, 1998[/tpl]

That's what I grew up on." Her "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production ...

Similarly, Chris Willman commented, "even a classically trained vocalist would be hard-pressed to maintain any sort of level of volume—or, more appropriately, 'Control'—while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck speed."

===Influences===

Jackson describes Lena Horne as a profound inspiration, for entertainers of several generations as well as herself.

==Legacy==

Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and her family, standing on her own as an individual artist. Steve Dollar of Newsday stated "she projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys."[tpl]citation|author=Steve Dollar|title=A Little Help From Her Friends|newspaper=Newsday|date=July 23, 2000|page=D.07[/tpl] Phillip McCarthy of The Sydney Morning Herald noted that throughout her career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael.[tpl]Citation |url=http://newsstore.smh.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=smh&kw=%22don%27t+mention+michael%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SHD0802241O77H3LSPMD |title=The Sun Herald - Don't mention Michael |last=McCarthy |first=Phillip |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2010[/tpl] Joshua Klein wrote, "for the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'." Steve Huey of Allmusic asserted that Jackson managed to emerge a "superstar" in her own right, rivaling not only Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while "successfully shifting her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult."[tpl]Citation| last = Huey | first = Steve | title = Janet Jackson > Biography |publisher=Allmusic | year = 2008 | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4572|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | accessdate = June 7, 2008[/tpl] By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and business ventures, she has been esteemed as the "Queen of Pop".She confirmed her status as today's Queen of Pop when, not long ago, she signed a $35-$40 million recording contract with Virgin Records.

So little is she trading off the fame of her brother, so completely has she become her own thing, she has all but abandoned the family name.

Her business savvy has been thought to rival Madonna's, gaining a level of autonomy which enables "creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution."[tpl]citation|last=Millner|first=Denene|title=Dueling Divas Top Five Singers Slug It Out To See Who's The Real Queen Of Pop|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/01/21/1996-01-21_dueling_divas_top_five_singe.html|newspaper=Daily News|date=January 12, 1996|accessdate=October 15, 2009|location=New York[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]citation|last=DeCurtis|first=Anthony|title=Present tense: rock & roll and culture|publisher=Duke University Press|page=257|year=1992|isbn=978-0-8223-1265-9[/tpl] A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that "Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power," receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career. She has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where black artists were once considered substandard.Over the next few years, a significant proportion of music industry revenues were generated by a handful of superstar artists; in addition to Michael Jackson, there were Lionel Richie, Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Wham!, Phil Collins, Steve Winwood, Huey Lewis and the News, the Pointer Sisters, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, and a handful of others. A surprising number of the new superstars were black. This was perhaps the first hint that the greater cosmopolitanism of a world market might produce some changes in the complexion of popular music.

Ripani identified Jackson as a leader in the development of contemporary R&B, as album Control and its successor Rhythm Nation 1814 created a unique blend of genre and sound effects, which ushered in the usage of rap vocals into mainstream R&B and pop. Ripani also argues the popularity of Jackson's signature song "Nasty" influenced the new jack swing genre developed by Teddy Riley. Leon McDermott of the Sunday Herald wrote: "Her million-selling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary R&B through Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's muscular, lean production; the sinuous grooves threaded through 1986's Control and 1989's Rhythm Nation 1814 are the foundation upon which today's hot shot producers and singers rely."[tpl]Citation | last= McDermott | first= Leon | title= Going bust?; Damita Jo ought to have been Janet Jackson's big comeback album, says Leon McDermott, but after that incident at the Super Bowl will America forgive her? | newspaper=Sunday Herald | page=3 | date= March 28, 2004[/tpl]

Sherri Winston of The Sun Sentinel observed "No one can witness the militaristic precision of Rhythm Nation, ... and not see how Janet's style has been sampled, borrowed and stolen over and over ... and over." Winston also noted the impact of Jackson's image and trademark midriff-baring style, writing "And if Janet forever touched a generation with her tight choreography, her tight abs touched wannabes in a whole other way.

While it’s a conditioned reflex for mainstream critics to heap praise upon Madonna as the mold from which MTV’s pop brigade is stamped, the truth is a bit more complicated." Using Britney Spears as an example, Hardy stated "Britney’s career, like those of her countless clones, rather than being a youthful updating of Madonna’s blueprint, is actually the Clorox remix of Janet’s. Brit’s every head snap, pelvic thrust and shoulder jerk was first executed by Miss Jackson, with many of her videos being almost frame-for-frame replications of past Janet clips.

Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style."[tpl]citation|author=Elysa Gardner|title=Luscious Jackson|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 28, 2000|page=1.E|issn=0734-7456[/tpl] Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps, including Spears, have been referred to as "Janet-come-lately's".While her vocal skills are at least as decent as Britney Spears and the other Janet-come-latelys, it's Jackson's skills as an entertainer—and commanding stage presence—that make her so deserving of the spotlight. [tpl]citation|author=Gemma Tarlach|title=Janet Jackson takes her place as Queen of Pop|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 17, 2001|page=12.B[/tpl]Most disappointing was crunk princess Ciara.

Hillary Crosley of Rolling Stone also regarded Jackson as "the woman who helped build the very throne that Beyoncé is surfboarding upon."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-nipple-and-the-damage-done-janet-jacksons-post-super-bowl-fall-20140131|title=The Nipple and the Damage Done: Janet Jackson's Post-Super Bowl Fall - Music News - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Crosley, Hillary|date=31-01-14|accessdate=04-01-14[/tpl] Britney Spears has also been thought to be "the icon of the post-Janet Jackson generation", with Anders Christian Madsen of i-D Magazine saying "like Janet before her, the gilded birdcage became too much for Britney, who decided to take control and, well, lose control all at once."[tpl]cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020163013/http://i-donline.com/magazine/the-street-issue-2/selena-gomez-18-00-hrs-e8/|title=Selena Gomez. 18.00 hrs.
