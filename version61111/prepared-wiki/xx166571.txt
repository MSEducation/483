The 29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Italian) or Legione SS Italiana was created on 10 February 1945 as the second SS-Division numbered 29. The first on the 29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Russian), was disbanded.  The new unit created in November 1943, was based on the Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS (italienische Nr. 1). The division is also called "Italia".

==Background==

The Kingdom of Italy on 8 September 1943 signed an armistice with the Allies.  In response, the German Army (Wehrmacht Heer) and the Waffen-SS disarmed Italian troops unless they were fighting for the German cause. The new Italian Social Republic was founded on 23 September 1943 under dictator Benito Mussolini and this allowed Italians to be recruited for fight against the Allies. On 2 October 1943, Heinrich Himmler and Gottlob Berger devised the Programm zur Aufstellung der italienischen Milizeinheiten durch die Waffen-SSRF-SS, Tgb.Nr. 35/143/43 g. vom 2. Oktober 1943 which was approved by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

==Training==

In October 15,000 volunteers started training at Truppenübungsplatz Münsingen, but 9,000 of them were unsuitable and released for training in Police units, the Black Brigades or for labor.Der Chef der OrdPol, Kdo I O (3) 1 Nr. 578/43 vom 2. Oktober 1943 The soldiers wore Sig rune (SS Runes) on red rather than black, and the left sleeve had a Reichsadler, not with a swastika, but with fasces.
On 23 November 1943, 13 Miliz-Battalions pledged their loyalty before being moved to SS-Ausbildungsstab Italien under SS-Brigadeführers Peter Hansen who led them in a "bloody war among brothers"Rolf Michaelis Die Grenadier-Divisionen der Waffen-SS, II, S.179 against partisans. The unit was commanded by  SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff and called Italienische SS-Freiwilligen-Legion, but soon renamed 1. Sturmbrigade Italienische Freiwilligen-Legion.
Soon the unit was called Legionari in Italy, also in official reports.

==Combat==

In April 1944 three battalions fought against Allied bridgeheads of Anzio and Nettuno with surprisingly good results, for which Heinrich Himmler on 3 May 1944 allowed them to wear SS-Runes on black rather than red and be fully integrated into the Waffen SS.The Waffen-SS (4): 24. to 38.
