[[New Jersey Route 62]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Passaic County, New Jersey

Route 62 is a [tpl]convert|0.47|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It begins at the centerline of U.S. Route 46 along Union Boulevard (Passaic County Route 646) in the community of Totowa and continues northward to the merge of the Interstate 80 westbound off-ramp at Exit 55B, where Route 62 ends. The route continues as Passaic County Route 646 in both directions, heading northbound to Paterson and southbound to Little Falls.
Route 62 was originally an alignment of Route S6, which was designated in 1929. The route went from the Caldwells in Essex County to the West Paterson corporate line. Route S6 was decommissioned in the 1953 renumbering and replaced with Route 62, which went from Totowa to West Paterson until being truncated to its current length.

==Route description==

RouteÂ 62 begins at an intersection with the off-ramp from U.S. Route 46 eastbound and Passaic County Route 646 in the community of Totowa. The highway heads northward along Union Boulevard, intersecting with the on-ramp from Route 62 to U.S. Route 46 eastbound. The route heads across a long bridge over the eastbound and westbound divided lanes of Route 46. After crossing the bridge, Route 62 heads into a small industrial part of Totowa, where it intersects with the off-ramp from the westbound lanes of Route 46. The highway continues northward, interchanging with Furler Street and Lackawanna Avenue on a partial cloverleaf. Route 62 continues along Union Boulevard, becoming a divided highway. The highway crosses over Interstate 80 at interchange 55A, where the route's designation terminates.[tpl]cite map|title=Bing Maps - Overview map of Route 62|publisher=Microsoft Inc.|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/?FORM=Z9LH11#JnJ0cD1wb3MucXRmdDI5OHRkenYwX25lYXIrVW5pb24rQmx2ZCslMjZhbXAlM2IrUmFtcCUyYytUb3Rvd2ElMmMrTmV3K0plcnNleSswNzUxMiUyYytVbml0ZWQrU3RhdGVzX19fZV8lN2Vwb3MucXRnbjA2OHRmYnJyX25lYXIrVW5pb24rQmx2ZCUyYytUb3Rvd2ElMmMrTmV3K0plcnNleSswNzUxMiUyYytVbml0ZWQrU3RhdGVzX19fZV8mcnRvcD0wJTdlMA==|accessdate=August 24, 2009|year=2009[/tpl] The route continues into Paterson as County Route 646.
