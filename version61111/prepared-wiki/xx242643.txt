Rigby was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps on 22 May 1916. He joined 40 Squadron on 1 August, but left a month later due to illness. Subsequently, he joined 1 Squadron on 2 February 1918, being promoted to captain shortly thereafter. Piloting a Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5A, he scored his first victory on 13 March 1918, sharing it with fellow aces Percy Jack Clayson, Herbert Hamilton, William Patrick, Guy Borthwick Moore, and four other pilots. In the next two months, Rigby would singlehandedly rack up five more triumphs, the last being 11 May 1918. His final tally was one Albatros D.V set afire, two enemy planes destroyed, and three enemy fighters  sent down out of control. On 17 May, illness once again removed Rigby from duty.[tpl]cite book |title= Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915–1920 |page= 321 [/tpl]
