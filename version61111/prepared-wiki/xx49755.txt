===Michael Jackson interviews===

In 2003, Bashir conducted a series of interviews with pop singer Michael Jackson, as part of a ITV documentary Living with Michael Jackson, which Uri Geller, a friend of Jackson's, had arranged. Following the broadcast, which was viewed by 14 million in the UK and 38 million in the US, Jackson complained to the Independent Television Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Commission, accusing Bashir of yellow journalism, claiming that he deliberately doctored the recordings in order to paint Jackson in an unflattering light,[tpl]cite web|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=I was betrayed by Bashir, rages Jackson|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/07/uknews|work=Star complains to TV watchdogs over interview|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=24 November 2013|date=6 February 2003|quote= Yesterday Debbie Rowe, Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two eldest children, told GMTV that no one could be a better father. "It breaks my heart that anyone could truly believe Michael would do anything to harm our children, they are the most important thing in his life."[/tpl] as well as emphasising the allegations of child molestation made against Jackson. In an interview with Louis Theroux, Geller said that he felt betrayed by Bashir, and claimed that the ITV documentary had ruined Geller's own relationship with Michael.[tpl]cite video|people=Yapp, Will (Director); Theroux, Louis (Writer)|date=2003-11-17|title=Louis, Martin & Michael|medium=Television production|publisher=BBC[/tpl] The New York Times called Bashir's journalism style "callous self-interest masked as sympathy."[tpl]cite news |first=Alessandra |last=Stanley|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/06/arts/television-review-a-neverland-world-of-michael-jackson.html |title=TELEVISION REVIEW; A Neverland World Of Michael Jackson |accessdate=2009-06-28 |date=2003-02-06 |work=The New York Times[/tpl]
In response, Jackson and his personal cameraman released a rebuttal interview, which showed Bashir complimenting Jackson for the "spiritual" quality of the Neverland Ranch. Bashir also described Jackson as a wonderful father and said that Jackson's relationship with his children "almost makes me weep".[tpl]cite news |first=Valentine |last=Low |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6586855.ece |title=Michael Jackson: PR suicide with the help of Martin Bashir |accessdate=2009-06-28 |date=2009-06-27 |work=The Times |location=London[/tpl]
Dieter Wiesner, the pop star's manager from 1996 to 2003, said of Bashir's documentary:
[tpl]"|"It broke him. It killed him. He took a long time to die, but it started that night. Previously the drugs were a crutch, but after that they became a necessity."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/5704635/Former-manager-unveils-scale-of-Michael-Jacksons-drug-use.html |title=Former manager unveils scale of Michael Jackson's drug use |accessdate=2009-07-04 |date=2009-07-01 |work=Telegraph.co.uk |location=London[/tpl][/tpl]
Bashir later said of Jackson during ABC's coverage of his death,
[tpl]"|"When I made the documentary, there was a small part that contained a controversy concerning his relationship with young people. But the truth is that he was never convicted of any crime, and I never saw any wrongdoing myself."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2504331/Martin-Bashir-Michael-Jackson-was-the-greatest.html |title=Bashir: Jacko was the greatest |work=The Sun | location=London |date=2009-06-27[/tpl][/tpl]

===Sarah Palin comments and resignation from MSNBC===

On November 15, 2013, Bashir criticized Sarah Palin for comments that she made comparing the Federal debt to slavery."MSNBC not commenting on whether further action contemplated against Bashir", Associated Press via Washington Post (November 19, 2013). Bashir attempted to counter Palin's comparison by referencing the cruel and barbaric punishment of slaves described by slave overseer Thomas Thistlewood, specifically a punishment called "Derby's dose" which involved forcing slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave as punishment. Bashir then concluded by saying "When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn’t just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate."Williams, Rob. "Martin Bashir says Sarah Palin is an 'idiot' and suggests someone should defecate in her mouth", The Independent (November 18, 2013). 
After many complaints, Bashir apologised on November 18, stating among other things: "My words were wholly unacceptable. They were neither accurate, nor fair. They were unworthy of anyone who would claim to have an interest in politics."Coscarelli, Joe. "MSNBC Host Sorry for Saying Disgusting Thing About Sarah Palin’s Mouth", New York (November 18, 2013).

===Juju Chang comments and suspension at ABC News===

Bashir had been suspended in the past at ABC News in relation to "making comments considered crude and sexist at a dinner for Asian-American journalists."[tpl]cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |date=December 5, 2013 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/04/exclusive-martin-bashir-out-at-msnbc-over-palin-slur-was-previously-suspended/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Martin Bashir, out at MSNBC over Palin slur, was previously suspended |newspaper=FOX News |accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl]  In 2008, while working as a reporter on Nightline, Bashir gave a speech to the Asian American Journalists Association convention in Chicago where he made a "tasteless" comment on the dress being worn by one of his colleagues at ABC News, Juju Chang, a reporter for 20/20.  He said, "I’m happy to be in the midst of so many Asian babes.  I’m happy that the podium covers me from the waist down." He continued and said that a speech should be "like a dress on a a beautiful woman — long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest — like my colleague Juju’s."  ABC News suspended him.  He wrote an apology to the journalist association which stated, "Upon reflection, it was a tasteless remark that I now bitterly regret. I … hope that the continuing work of the organization will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity."
