Shakhtar Luhansk was a Ukrainian football club from the city of Luhansk.
The club was formed in 1977. After Ukrainian Independence, in the early 1990s the club played in the provincial league of Luhansk oblast.
As the club improved the club began taking part in the Ukrainian Amateur Competitions starting in 1999. In 2001 the club won the Ukrainian Football Amateur League championship which earned them the right to enter the Professional leagues.
In the next season Shakhtar Luhansk entered the Druha Liha Group C and had a successful initial season finishing second. Unfortunately, prior to the start of the next season the club's administration withdrew the club from the PFL and the club subsequently dissolved.
