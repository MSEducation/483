However, in that novel Scudder, though coming very close to gaining power, is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.
Ward Carson wrote: "In For Us, The Living, space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the Future History it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US.

Carson, "The Formative Years of Science Fiction" in Ed Woods (ed.) Round Table on Speculative Literature, London, 2008
