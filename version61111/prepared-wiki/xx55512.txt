COBUILD, an acronym for "Collins Birmingham University International Language Database," is a British research facility set up at the University of Birmingham in 1980 and funded by Collins publishers.
The facility was led by Professor John Sinclair. The most important achievement of the COBUILD project has been the creation and analysis of a corpus of contemporary text (the Bank of English), and the production of the monolingual learner's dictionary Collins COBUILD English Language Dictionary (1987, 2nd edition 1995, 3rd edition 2001, 4th edition 2003, 5th edition 2006), based on the study of the COBUILD corpus.
A number of other dictionaries and grammars have also been published, all based exclusively on evidence from the Bank of English.
