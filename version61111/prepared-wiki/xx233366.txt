==Plot==

Once again, Alfalfa and Butch are bitter rivals for the affections of Darla. The nerdish Waldo comes up with a solution: Alfalfa and Butch will compete for the title of Junior Mayor of Greenpoint during Boys' Week, and whichever one wins will earn the honor of escorting Darla to the annual Strawberry Festival. But despite the strenuous efforts of both young candidates, a "dark horse" wins not only the election, but also the girl.[tpl]cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/226184/Party Fever/overview |title=New York Times: Party Fever|accessdate=2008-10-08|work=NY Times[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Notes==

Like The Little Ranger, Party Fever was a well produced film and it was the first episode to be directed by up and coming director, George Sidney. 
This was also the fifth episode to be made without George McFarland as Spanky. He was still on loan to other studios and would stay on loan for another couple weeks. It was also the last episode in which Pete the Pup would appear. MGM's producers felt that it was time to retire him and to so called "modernize" the series.
