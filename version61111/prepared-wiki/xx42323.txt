==Plot==

Old Enough is an earnest take on the coming-of-age story, set in New York City. Karen (Rainbow Harvest) is a streetwise teen from a lower-middle-class family who pursues a friendship with 11-year-old Lonnie (Sarah Boyd).  Lonnie is from a wealthy, upper-class family who live in the area.  As the two become friends, they expose each other to the very different lifestyles they live. In the process they learn lessons each culture has to offer.
The situation becomes complicated when Karen's brother Johnny (Neill Barry) shows interest in Lonnie and Lonnie begins to develop a crush on him. Soon, a sensual new neighbor (Roxanne Hart) moves into Karen's family's apartment building, whom Johnny becomes slightly infatuated with. Circumstances arise that will test Karen and Lonnie's friendship.
