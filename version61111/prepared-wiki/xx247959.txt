[[Flow-restricted, oxygen-powered ventilation device]]

CATEGORIES: Medical pumps

A flow-restricted, oxygen-powered ventilation device (FROPVD), also referred to as a manually triggered ventilation device (MTV), is used to assist ventilation in apneic or hypoventilating patients, although these devices can also be used to provide supplemental oxygen to breathing patents. When ventilating a patient with a (FROPVD) you must ensure an adequate, constant oxygen supply is available. Once the oxygen source is depleted, the device can no longer be used because it is driven completely by an oxygen source. The device must have a pressure relief valve that opens at 60cm of water pressure to avoid over ventilation and trauma to the lungs.
