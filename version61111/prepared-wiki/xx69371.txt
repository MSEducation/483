Eola is an unincorporated community in northwestern Concho County in the U.S. state of Texas, near the larger community of San Angelo. In 1990, Eola had a recorded population of only 218.
The town was first known as Jordan, but its name changed to Eola in 1902.
The Eola School was the center of the community from 1928 until it closed in 1983. After the turn of the new century, James Mark Cannon (born circa 1967) relocated from Portland, Oregon, to purchase the abandoned school building and to turn it into a seven-day restaurant known as "Eola School Restaurant". Cannon's experience was featured on Bob Phillips' Texas Country Reporter syndicated television program in March 2007.
