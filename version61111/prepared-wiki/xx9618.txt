Osborne Earl "Ozzie" Smith (born December 26, 1954) is a retired American baseball shortstop who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and St. Louis Cardinals from 1978 to 1996. Nicknamed "The Wizard" for his defensive brilliance, Smith set major league records for career assists (8,375) and double plays (1,590) by a shortstop (the latter since broken by Omar Vizquel), as well as the National League (NL) record with 2,511 career games at the position; Smith won the NL Gold Glove Award for play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons (1980–1992). A 15-time All-Star, he accumulated 2,460 hits and 580 stolen bases during his career, and won the NL Silver Slugger Award as the best-hitting shortstop in 1987.  He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2002.  He was also elected to the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 2014.
Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama, but his family moved to Watts, Los Angeles, when he was six years old. While participating in childhood athletic activities, Smith developed quick reflexes; he went on to play baseball in high school and college, at Los Angeles' Locke High School and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo respectively. Drafted as an amateur player by the Padres, Smith made his major league debut in 1978. He quickly established himself as an outstanding fielder, and later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while taking his position at the beginning of a game. Smith won his first Gold Glove Award in 1980, and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981. When conflict with Padres' ownership developed, he was traded to the Cardinals for shortstop Garry Templeton in 1982.
Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the team win the 1982 World Series. Three years later, his game-winning home run during Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series prompted broadcaster Jack Buck's "Go crazy, folks!" play-by-play call. Despite a rotator cuff injury during the 1985 season, Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in 1987. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances on an annual basis until 1993. During 1995 season, Smith had shoulder surgery and was out nearly three months. After tension with his new manager Tony La Russa developed in 1996, Smith retired at season's end, and his uniform number (No. 1) was subsequently retired by the Cardinals. Smith also served as host of the television show This Week in Baseball from 1997 to 1999.

==Early life==

Smith was born in Mobile, Alabama, the second of Clovi and Marvella Smith's six children (five boys and one girl).[tpl]cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/07/27/ozzie_hall_ap/ |title='Wizard of Oz' on deck for enshrinement |accessdate=2008-03-19 |author=Associated Press |date=2002-07-28 |publisher=Sports Illustrated.com[/tpl] While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at Brookley Air Force Base.Smith and Rains 1988: 6 When Smith was six his family moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles, California. His father became a delivery truck driver for Safeway stores, while his mother became an aide at a nursing home. His mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.Eisenbath 1999: 284–285[tpl]cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066503/4/index.htm |last=Fimrite |first=Ron |title=No. 1 In His Field |date=1987-09-28 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |publisher=Sports Illustrated.com[/tpl]
Smith played a variety of sports in his youth, but considered baseball to be his favorite.Smith and Rains 1988: 8 He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in front of his house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw.Smith and Rains 2002: 24 When not at the local YMCA or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips).Smith and Rains 1988: 7 In 1965, at age ten, he endured the Watts Riots with his family, recalling that, "We had to sleep on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on."Smith and Rains 1988: 4
While Smith was attending junior high school, his parents divorced.Smith and Rains 1988: 9 Continuing to pursue his interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for nearly an hour to reach Dodger Stadium, cheering for the Los Angeles Dodgers at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at Locke High School, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future National Basketball Association player Marques Johnson on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player Eddie Murray on the baseball side.Smith and Rains 1988: 9–10 After high school Smith attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to walk-on to the baseball team.[tpl]cite web |url=http://polyland.calpoly.edu/topics/recreation/studentsites/2004b/Ozzie%20Smith.htm |title=Ozzie Smith |accessdate=2008-04-26 |publisher=Cal Poly Land[/tpl] In addition to his academic education, he learned to switch-hit from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr.Lang, Dave. "There is Only 1 Ozzie Smith." St. Louis Cardinals Official 1993 Yearbook. 1993. 17 When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career at bats (754) and career stolen bases (110) before graduating in 1977.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gopoly.com/index.php?p=hall_of_fame&id=166 |title=Ozzie Smith |accessdate=2009-01-04 |publisher=California Polytechnic State University[/tpl]

==Professional baseball career==

===San Diego Padres===

Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in Clarinda, Iowa, in June 1976 when he was selected in the seventh round of the amateur entry draft by the Detroit Tigers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.aol.com/moresports/story/_a/still-nothing-in-baseball-gets-past/20070731123009990001 |title=Still, Nothing in Baseball Gets Past Ozzie |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Hollander |first=Dave |date=2007-08-08 |publisher=AOL[/tpl] The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|10000|1976|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|8500|1976|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] today). Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|5000|1977|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball, 1977, with the Class A Walla Walla Padres of the Northwest League.Hummel 2007: 57–61
Smith began 1978 as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring training camp in Yuma, Arizona. Smith credited Padres manager Alvin Dark for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he proved he can't handle it.Smith and Rains 1988: 17 Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.Smith and Rains 1988: 18[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04070SFN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 3, San Francisco Giants 2 |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl]

It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-07-24/cover.htm |title=Go Crazy for the Wizard |last=Colston |first=Chris |date=2002-07-24 |accessdate=2008-05-04 |work=USA Today Baseball Weekly[/tpl] The Padres played host to the Atlanta Braves on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth inning, Atlanta's Jeff Burroughs hit a ground ball up the middle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B04200SDN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 2, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] Smith described the play by saying, "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first."Smith and Rains 1988: 21
During a roadtrip to Houston, later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the Astrodome named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium.Smith and Rains 1988: 24–25 The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, and eventually decided to marry.  It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium. Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home game of the season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1978/B10010SDN1978.htm |title=San Diego Padres 4, Los Angeles Dodgers 3 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] After conferring with veteran teammate Gene Tenace, Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular. Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing second in National League Rookie of the Year voting to Bob Horner.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1978.shtml#NLroy |title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1978 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC[/tpl]
After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at-bats of the 1979 season.Smith and Rains 1988: 28–31 Among players with enough at-bats to qualify for the 1979 National League Triple Crown, Smith finished the season last in batting average (.211), home runs (0), and RBI (27).Spatz 2007: 141 Off the field, conflict developed between Padres' ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the 1980 season, and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith's contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500Smith and Rains 1988: 34 Smith's agent told the Padres the shortstop would forgo the season to race in the Tour de France, despite the fact Smith admitted to The Break Room on 96.5 WCMF in Rochester, NY he had never heard of the Tour. Angered by the Padres' attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the San Diego Union, part of which read, "Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income."Smith and Rains 1988: 35 When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner Ray Kroc, publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb's relationship with the organization deteriorated further.Smith and Rains 1988: 35–36
Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field. In 1980, he set the single-season record for most assists by a shortstop (621), and began his string of 13 consecutive Gold Glove awards.Smith and Rains 1988: 37 Smith's fielding play prompted the Yuma Daily Sun to use the nickname "The Wizard of Oz" in a March 1981 feature article about Smith.Smith and Rains 2002: 22 While "The Wizard of Oz" nickname was an allusion to the 1939 motion picture of the same name, Smith also came to be known as simply "The Wizard" during his playing career, as Smith's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later attest.Smith and Rains 2002: 25[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=122439 |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum:Hall of Famer detail |accessdate=2008-11-21 |publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625094109/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=122439 |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In 1981, Smith made his first All-Star Game appearance as a reserve player.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1981/B08090ALS1981.htm |title=National League 5, American League 4 |accessdate=2008-11-21 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl]

====Trade====

While Smith was having problems with the Padres' owners, the St. Louis Cardinals also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop. During a game at Busch Stadium on August 26, 1981, Garry Templeton made obscene gestures at fans before being pulled off the field by manager Whitey Herzog.O'Neill 2005: 108Herzog and Horrigan 1987: 135–136 Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch, Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings.Herzog and Horrigan 1987: 119–120, 137 While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal.Herzog and Horrigan 1987: 137
McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract.Herzog and Pitts 1999: 92–93 Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say.Smith and Rains 1988: 51 While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday.Herzog and Horrigan 1987: 138 Smith later recalled that, "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be."Smith and Rains 1988: 52

===St. Louis Cardinals===

====1982–1984====

After more behind-the-scenes contract wrangling, Smith became a St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982.Smith and Rains 1988: 57 Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool designed to help Smith concentrate on that task.Smith and Rains 2002: 28–29 Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year."Smith and Rains 1988: 61 Smith agreed to the wager, and by the end of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/VSLN01982.htm |title=The 1982 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl]Leach 2008: 37 Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense."Smith and Rains 2002: 6
Smith became a father for the first time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as Nikko, on April 28.Smith and Rains 1988: 65 Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate Willie McGee during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he "helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues".Smith and Rains 1988: 66 Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the Cardinals faced the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five 1982 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a sacrifice fly that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/B10070SLN1982.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 7, Atlanta Braves 0 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl]
Just as Herzog had predicted when he told Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant with him on the team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field.Rains 2003: 105 When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1982/B10200SLN1982.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 6, Milwaukee Brewers 2 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.
After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals agreed on a new contract in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year.Smith and Rains 1988: 81 Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game for the first time in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award.Smith and Rains 1988: 87 During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres.Smith and Rains 1988: 95[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1984/B07130SLN1984.htm |title=St. Louis Cardinals 7, San Diego Padres 4 |accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.

====1985–1986====

In 1985, Smith amassed a .276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals as a team won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1985/TSLN01985.htm |title=The 1985 St. Louis Cardinals |accessdate=2008-11-08 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in the now best-of-seven NLCS, a split of the first four games set the stage for Game 5 at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda called upon closer Tom Niedenfuer to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his previous 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory.Smith and Rains 1988: 130 Smith said, "I was trying to get an extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, I was able to get the ball up." The home run not only prompted broadcaster Jack Buck's "Go crazy folks" play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050930&content_id=1231334&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl |title=Ozzie's homer tops in Busch history |last=Leach |first=Matthew |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |publisher=MLB.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20020619&content_id=56675&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null |title=Legendary voice passes away |last=Hoffman |first=Jared |date=2002-06-19 |accessdate=2008-08-17 |publisher=MLB.com[/tpl]
After Smith's teammate Jack Clark hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate.Schoor 1990: 362Schoor 1990: 418 After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).Nemec and Wisnia 2002: 433
What was not publicly known during the regular season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres.Smith and Rains 1988: 121[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1985/VSLN01985.htm |title=The 1985 St. Louis Cardinals Regular Season Game Log |accessdate=2008-11-08 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" (1.78 m), 180-pound (82 kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery."Smith and Rains 2002: 43
Because of his injury, Smith let his now four-year-old son Nikko perform his traditional Opening Day backflip before the Cardinals' first home game of the 1986 season.Rains and Reid 2002: 111 Smith made an "eye-popping" play later that season on August 5, during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning, Phillies first baseman Von Hayes hit a short fly ball to left field, which was pursued by both Smith and left fielder Curt Ford.Hummel 2007: 85–87 Running with his back to home plate, Smith dove forward, simultaneously catching the ball while parallel to the ground and flying over the diving Ford, avoiding a collision by inches.St. Louis Cardinals 2005 Media Guide. Hadler Printing, 2005. C-26.

====1987–1990====

After hitting in either the second or eighth spot in the batting order for most of his time in St. Louis, Herzog made Smith the number-two hitter full-time during the 1987 season.Herzog and Pitts 1999: 95 Over the course of the year, Smith accrued a .303 batting average, 43 stolen bases, 75 RBIs, 104 runs scored, and 40 doubles, good enough to earn him the Silver Slugger Award at shortstop. In addition to winning the Gold Glove Award at shortstop for the eighth consecutive time, Smith posted a career-high on-base percentage of .392. Smith was also the leading vote-getter in the 1987 All-Star Game.Smith and Rains 1988: 160 The Cardinals earned a postseason berth with 95 wins, and subsequently faced the San Francisco Giants in the 1987 National League Championship Series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1987/TSLN01987.htm |title=The 1987 St. Louis Cardinals |accessdate=2008-11-12 |publisher=Retrosheet.org[/tpl] Smith contributed a triple during the series, and the Cardinals won the contest in seven games.Nemec and Wisnia 2002: 441
The 1987 World Series matched the Cardinals against the American League champion Minnesota Twins. The home team won every game of the contest, as Minnesota won the series.Schoor 1990: 370–371 In 28 at-bats during the Series, Smith scored three runs and had two RBIs. Smith finished second in MVP balloting to Andre Dawson, who had played on the last-place Chicago Cubs, largely because Smith and teammate Jack Clark split the first-place vote.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1987.shtml |title=Baseball Award Voting for 1987 |accessdate=2007-12-04 |work=Baseball-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC[/tpl] Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the National League at $2,340,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL_1988_t.shtml |title=1988 National League Leader Boards |work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=2007-10-25 |publisher=Sports Reference, LLC[/tpl]
While the team did not see the postseason for the remainder of the decade, Smith continued to rack up All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of GQ magazine.Boswell, Thomas. "The Wizardry of Ozzie Smith." GQ. April 1988. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner Gussie Busch died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.[tpl]cite news |first=Robert |last=Thomas Jr. |title=August A.

====1996====

As Smith entered the 1996 season, he finalized a divorce from his wife Denise during the first half of the year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n30_v220/ai_18504134/pg_1 |title=Cardinal singe — shortstop Ozzie Smith |accessdate=2008-03-15 |last=Geffner |first=Michael |date=1996-07-22 |work=The Sporting News[/tpl]Rains and Reid 2002: 110 Meanwhile, manager Tony La Russa began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager Walt Jocketty acquired shortstop Royce Clayton during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win.Rains 2009: 183–184 When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a .288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted .190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the platoon situation that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game.Rains 2009: 187 La Russa said, "I think it's fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training...When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively and you could see him start to get better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games."Rains 2009: 185–186
Smith missed the first month of the season with a hamstring injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended.Rains 2009: 186–187 In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.Rains 2003: 252

As Smith made his final tour of the National League, he was honored by many teams, and received a standing ovation at the 1996 All-Star Game in Philadelphia.
