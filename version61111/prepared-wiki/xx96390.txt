==History==

===History of the area===

Sports meetings were frequently held on the area now occupied by Páirc Uí Chaoimh even before the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association. By the late 1890s the Cork County Board were allowed by the Cork Agricultural Company, the leaseholders of the land, to enclose a portion of the site for the playing of Gaelic Games. The county board built its own stadium on the land. The Cork Athletic Grounds opened in 1904 and hosted All-Ireland finals, Munster finals and National League games. Some developments took place over the years, however, by the 1970s the Athletic Grounds were in poor condition and a new plan was drawn up. It is now standing next to the C.A.B. Ford garage.

===Stadium built===

In 1974 the ground was completely demolished to make way for a totally new stadium. It was an ambitious plan, one that the GAA had never embarked on before. Páirc Uí Chaoimh was to be the new name for the GAA's first custom-built stadium. The modern bowl-shaped stadium features one covered stand, an open-air stand and two terraces behind each goalpost. The main stand is named after Sean Mac Carthaigh, Cork's second president of the GAA. The stadium itself is named after Pádraig Ó Caoimh, a native of Roscommon; this Irish War of Independence veteran became secretary of the Cork County Board at 21, and he began a 35-year stint as General Secretary of the GAA barely a decade later.http://www.crokepark.ie/gaa-museum/gaa-archive/gaa-museum-irish-times-articles/padraig-o-caoimh,-general-secretary-of-the-gaa,-19 Páirc Uí Chaoimh was officially opened on June 6, 1976http://munster.gaa.ie/county/cork/ by Con Murphy, then president of the GAA. On the opening day the Cork hurlers played Kilkenny while the Cork footballers took on Kerry.

===Concerts===

U2 played the final show on the European leg of the Joshua Tree Tour on Saturday August 8, 1987. On 30 and 31 July 1988, Michael Jackson performed at the stadium twice as part of his Bad World Tour, with a combined attendance of 110,000. 1995 saw the Féile Festival being transferred to Pairc Ui Chaoimh for one year, with the line-up including The Stone Roses, Paul Weller and Kylie Minogue. Oasis then performed two nights at the stadium on 14 and 15 August 1996 following their gigs at Knebworth where they had played to 250,000 people over two nights. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played at the stadium on 18 July 2013.

===Criticism===

In 2005 the Cork County Board took the decision to replace all wood bench seats with plastic bucket seats in both the covered and open stands. Due to the shape of the new bucket seats, overall legroom has been reduced substantially with many complaining of being unable to sit in the seat entirely. In response, the Cork County Board had the tops cut off the back of each seat to marginally improve the legroom.

==Future==

===Plans===

In October 2007 the Cork County Boards announced plans to redevelop Páirc Uí Chaoimh into a state-of-the-art 60,000-seat sports and concert venue in conjunction with the Cork Docklands redevelopment which is estimated to cost over €30m.http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/kfkfidmheyid/rss2/ If these plans get the go-ahead, Cork would have the second largest stadium in the country behind Croke Park, which has a capacity of 82,300. The Cork stadium would be bigger than Aviva Stadium (51,000), while also outstripping other Munster GAA venues.

===Approved redevelopment===

In June 2010, Cork City Council have voted in favour of the proposal to make [tpl]convert|6.82|acre|m2[/tpl] of land next to Páirc Uí Chaoimh available for the redevelopment of the stadium.http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/championship/2010/0615/paircuichaoimh.html As part of the Re-development a new Centre of Excellence will be built along with ancillary all-weather pitch and a 400-space car park and a dining facility.http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/1/1506100851-green-light-for-pairc-ui-chaoimh-redevelopment-plans/
The stadium is expected to have a small increase in capacity which will be 45,000 when completed.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/pairc-revamp-to-generate-12m-on-big-game-days-205931.html A planning application is expected to be lodged in the summer of 2012. The development has been subject to local opposition as residents are angry that land used for the redevelopment was earmarked for a public park.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/residents-vow-to-fight-pairc-ui-chaoimh-vote-190663.htmlhttp://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0228/1224312480684.htmlIrish Times report With Corks average attendance not breaking 20,000 in 2011 there have been questions asked of the need for such a big venue, including by the Munster Council Secretary Pat Fitzgerald.RTÉ news report
