[[La'ibum]]

CATEGORIES: Akkadian people, 3rd-millennium BC births, 3rd-millennium BC deaths

Laʻibum was an Akkadian man. He is mentioned once in the Sumerian Sargon legend as the father of Sargon of Akkad. No details about his life or historicity are known, although the Sumerian king list states that Sargon's father was a gardener, while a much later neo-Assyrian account has Sargon say "My mother was lowly, my father I knew not, and the brother of my father dwelleth in the mountain."
He was presumably an Akkadian. The neo-Assyrian text also asserts that Sargon was from Azupiranu; this may have been Laʻibum's native town. Laʻibum was a grandfather of kings Rimush and Manishtushu.
