[[Grigsby]]

Grigsby is a surname of unknown origin (possibly meaning 'of Grig's town/settlement)', stemming from a common progenitor,  John Grigsby (1623â€“1730) who originated in Kent, Maidstone, England where the name is still known. Most Grigsbys in the United States of America trace lines of descent from this 17th-century landowner, in Stafford County, Virginia.
