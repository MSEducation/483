==Products description==

The Efke films are black-and-white films with high silver content and as a result give a large exposure latitude and high quality grayscale reproduction when compared with modern films. The Efke 25, 50 and 100 products are made using the ADOX formulas that were first introduced in the 1950s. Efke also makes an infrared film sold as Efke IR820.
The Efke films are more forgiving of exposure variations than modern tabular crystal films. The nature of the product also allows large, grain free, enlargements to be made from negatives.
Efke films are coated in one layer, unlike most other films which are coated in multiple layers. This makes the film thinner and the emulsion more easily damaged, especially when still wet after development. A hardening fixer can be used to help protect the emulsion. The film base is also thinner and more transparent, making inspection of the negative easier. However it can also make the film curl more easily.
Efke is one of the last manufacturers still making the once-popular 127 film, and indeed was the only manufacturer in the world making 127 format film between 1995, when Kodak discontinued the format, and 2006, when a [tpl]cite web|title=127 film in the Frugal Photrographer caltalog|url=http://www.frugalphotographer.com/cat127.htm|work=The Frugal Fhotographer|publisher=Frugal Photographer|accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] Canadian company also began making 127.
Efke's Infrared Film, sold under the brand name Efke IR820 is currently the only infrared film manufactured that has good IR sensitivity beyond 750nm extending out to 820nm. In the past other films such as Kodak's HIE offered this but have recently been discontinued and are no longer made.
