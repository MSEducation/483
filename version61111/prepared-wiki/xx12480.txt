</ref> In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually [[tungsten]] or a more crack-resistant alloy of [[rhenium]] (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes [[molybdenum]] for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.
The maximum energy of the produced X-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80 kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80 keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:
So the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 to 150 keV.[ref]
</ref>
Both of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent, and hence, to produce a usable flux of X-rays, most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. The X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate this excess heat.
Short nanosecond bursts of X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum. This is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.[tpl]cite journal|last=Camara|first=C. G.|coauthors=Escobar, J. V.; Hird, J. R.; Putterman, S.

A specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization.[ref]

==Detectors==

X-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates or flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are used to measure the radiation dose a person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers.

==Medical uses==

Since Röntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been used for medical imaging. The first medical use was less than a month after his paper on the subject, and up until 2010 5 billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roobottom CA, Mitchell G, Morgan-Hughes G |title=Radiation-reduction strategies in cardiac computed tomographic angiography |journal=Clin Radiol |volume=65 |issue=11 |pages=859–67 |year=2010|pmid=20933639 |doi=10.1016/j.crad.2010.04.021 [/tpl] Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.

===Radiographs===

A radiograph is an X-ray image obtained by placing a part of the patient in front of an X-ray detector and then illuminating it with a short X-ray pulse. Bones contain much calcium, which due to its relatively high atomic number absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.
Radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely radiopaque) or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle.
Dental radiography is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems, such as cavities.
In medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminium, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.
To generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine if there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.

===Computed tomography===

Computed tomography (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.[tpl]Cite book|last = Herman|first = Gabor T.|authorlink=Gabor Herman|title = Fundamentals of Computerized Tomography: Image Reconstruction from Projections|year = 2009|publisher = Springer|edition=2nd|isbn=978-1-85233-617-2|postscript = [/tpl] These cross-sectional images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.

===Fluoroscopy===

Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and fluorescent screen between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).

===Radiotherapy===

The use of X-rays as a treatment is known as radiation therapy and is largely used for the management (including palliation) of cancer; it requires higher radiation energies than for imaging alone.

==Adverse effects==

Diagnostic X-rays (primarily from CT scans due to the large dose used) increase the risk of developmental problems and cancer in those exposed.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hall EJ, Brenner DJ |title=Cancer risks from diagnostic radiology |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=81 |issue=965 |pages=362–78 |year=2008|pmid=18440940 |doi=10.1259/bjr/01948454 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Brenner DJ |title=Should we be concerned about the rapid increase in CT usage? |journal=Rev Environ Health |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=63–8 |year=2010 |pmid=20429161 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.2010.25.1.63 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=De Santis M, Cesari E, Nobili E, Straface G, Cavaliere AF, Caruso A |title=Radiation effects on development |journal=Birth Defects Res.

Experimental and epidemiological data currently do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1097/00004032-200307000-00005|last1 = Upton|first1 = AC|author2 = National Coluncil on Radiation Protection Measurements Scientific Committee 1–6|year = 2003|title = The state of the art in the 1990s: NCRP report No. 136 on the scientific bases for linearity in the dose-response relationship for ionizing radiation|journal = Health Physics|volume = 85|issue = 1| pages = 15–22|pmid = 12852466[/tpl] However, this is under increasing doubt.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12610596|url=http://www.cerrie.org/committee_papers/INFO_9-F.pdf|year=2003|last1=Calabrese|first1=EJ|last2=Baldwin|first2=LA|title=Toxicology rethinks its central belief|volume=421|issue=6924|pages=691–2|doi=10.1038/421691a|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2003Natur.421..691C [/tpl] It is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6–1.8%.[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15433-0|last1 = Berrington|first1 = A| last2 = Darby|first2 = A|last3 = Darby|first3 = S|year = 2004|title = Risk of cancer from diagnostic X-rays: estimates for the UK and 14 other countries|journal = Lancet|volume = 363|issue = 9406| pages = 345–351|pmid = 15070562[/tpl] The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra072149 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra072149 |author=Brenner DJ and Hall EJ |year=2007 |title=Computed tomography- an increasing source of radiation exposure |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=357 |issue=22 |pages=2277–2284 |pmid=18046031[/tpl] CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.
To place the increased risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose a person to the same amount from background radiation that we are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a dental X-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation.Radiologyinfo.org, Radiological Society of North America and American College of Radiology Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2–3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4–5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000. This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime.[tpl]cite web|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2006/browse_csr.php?section=2&page=sect_02_table.11.html#table1 |title=National Cancer Institute: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data |publisher=Seer.cancer.gov |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl] For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the absorbed dose is about 14 mGy.[tpl]cite journal|author=Caon, M., Bibbo, G. & Pattison, J. |year=2000|title= Monte Carlo calculated effective dose to teenage girls from computed tomography examinations|journal=Radiation Protection Dosimetry|volume=90|issue=4|pages=445–448|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.rpd.a033172[/tpl] A head CT scan (1.5mSv, 64mGy)Shrimpton, P.C; Miller, H.C; Lewis, M.A; Dunn, M.

Medical X-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the United States. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of total American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.Medical Radiation Exposure Of The U.S. Population Greatly Increased Since The Early 1980s, Science Daily, March 5, 2009[ref]

Dosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A full mouth series may therefore result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.American Nuclear Society Radiation Dose ChartThe Nuclear Energy Option, Bernard Cohen, Plenum Press 1990 Ch. 5Muller, Richard.
