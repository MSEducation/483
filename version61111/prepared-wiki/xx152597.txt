Sir William James Allen (15 October 1866 – 20 December 1947) was a Northern Irish unionist politician.
The son of Joseph and Catherine Allen, he was educated at Lurgan College. 
He was elected to the British House of Commons at a by-election in 1917, as an Irish Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for North Armagh, and retained his seat at the 1918 general election.  The constituency was abolished for the 1922 general election, when he was re-elected as a member of the new Ulster Unionist Party for the new Armagh constituency.
He died in 1947 two weeks after being hit by a lorry as he left a tram on the Lisburn Road, Belfast on 5 December. He was 81 and the second oldest MP in the House of Commons.  Sir William was buried in Lurgan.  He was survived by his second wife Lillah Irene, Lady Allen.
