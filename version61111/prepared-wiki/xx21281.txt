</ref> The difficulty of teasing out the effects of any supposed biophotons amid the other numerous chemical interactions between cells makes it difficult to devise a testable hypothesis. Most organisms are bathed in relatively high-intensity light that ought to swamp any signaling effect, although biophoton signaling might manifest through temporal patterns of distinct wavelengths or could mainly be used in deep tissues hidden from daylight (such as the human brain, which contains [[OPN3|photoreceptor proteins]]). A 2010 review article<ref>[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2010.07.003 |title=Electromagnetic cellular interactions |year=2011 |last1=Cifra |first1=Michal |last2=Fields |first2=Jeremy Z. |last3=Farhadi |first3=Ashkan |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=223â€“46 |pmid=20674588[/tpl]</ref> discusses various published theories on this kind of signaling and identifies around 30 experimental scientific articles in English in the past 30 years which show evidence of electromagnetic cellular interactions.
Since 2005, the health applications of biophoton therapies created by Johan Boswinkel have been independently studied by Masters and Doctoral students at the European Union Interuniversity College of Health and Development. They report that applied biophoton therapies include reliable technologies (references needed), particularly as they are marketed by the Institute of Institute of Applied Biophoton Sciences. And papers in peer-reviewed journals show a high degree of efficacy in therapies using the technology.
Furthermore, findings related to Biophoton therapies are consistent with recent findings in the realm of Quantum Consciousnes and super-symmetric nano-sturctures.
