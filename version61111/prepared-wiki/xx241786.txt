Carlos Jorge Marques Caldas Xavier (born 26 January 1962 in Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique) is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a midfielder.

==Football career==

Xavier began his professional career with Lisbon-based Sporting Clube de Portugal, already being a regular first-team fixture at age 19. He played 23 league games as the Lions won the title in the 1981–82 season, which would be the last until 2000.
In 1991, after more than 200 official matches, Xavier moved, alongside compatriot and teammate Oceano, to Spain's Real Sociedad, where the pair was equally influential, having been reunited with former Sporting boss John Toshack at the La Liga side.
In 1994 Xavier and Oceano returned to Sporting, and the former played two more years before retiring at the age of 34. In the 2004–05 campaign he had a brief spell at coaching, assisting at another club from the capital and the top division, G.D. Estoril Praia. 
Xavier gained ten caps for Portugal, then switched successfully to its beach soccer side.

==Personal==

Xavier's twin brother, Pedro, was also a footballer. A forward, he represented several teams in the country (coinciding with Carlos at Académica), and also played three seasons in China in an 18-year professional career.
