Carlyle Javar Holiday (born October 4, 1981) is an American football wide receiver who currently is a free agent. 
Holiday attended Roosevelt High School in San Antonio, TX. In football, he was named as the top high school scrambling quarterback in the nation. After a heavy bid from Nebraska, he eventually committed to the University of Notre Dame.  Holiday was the starting quarterback for three years at the university, leading them to the Gator Bowl in his final full season at Quarterback. During that time, he broke the school's rushing record for 100 yard games in a season by a quarterback as well as most completions without an interception and touchdown passes in a game, the later two which were broken by Brady Quinn.  During his senior year at Notre Dame, Holiday was converted to a Wide Receiver and Punt Returner, due to the emergence of true freshman Quarterback Brady Quinn.  Even though Holiday never played college baseball, he was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the 44th round of the MLB amateur draft in 2002, and by the New York Mets in 2003. 
Carlyle made his first NFL start against the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football in his second season with the Arizona Cardinals when Larry Fitzgerald was out with a sprained ankle.  He was later signed out of free agency by the Green Bay Packers on December 5, 2006 after being released from the Arizona Cardinals. He caught Brett Favre's record breaking completion against the Detroit Lions, breaking Dan Marino's career completions mark. Carlyle injured his knee playing against the Philadelphia Eagles in the first game of the 2007 season, ending his year while being placed on injured reserve. In February 2008 Holiday was released by the Green Bay Packers.[tpl]cite web | last = JSOnline.com  | title = Packers release WR Carlyle Holiday | url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/archive/2008/02/29/packers-release-wr-carlyle-holiday.aspx | accessdate = 2008-02-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080304135549/http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/archive/2008/02/29/packers-release-wr-carlyle-holiday.aspx  |archivedate = 2008-03-04[/tpl]
