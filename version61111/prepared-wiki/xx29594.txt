CATEGORIES: Project management

Project planning is part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules such as Gantt charts to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment.[tpl]cite book  | author = Harold Kerzner | year = 2003 | title = Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling | edition = 8th Ed. | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-22577-0[/tpl]
Initially, the project scope is defined and the appropriate methods for completing the project are determined. Following this step, the durations for the various tasks necessary to complete the work are listed and grouped into a work breakdown structure. Project planning is often used to organize different areas of a project, including project plans, work loads and the management of teams and individuals.[tpl]cite web|title=Project Planning Online|url=http://www.projectmanat  bger.com/projectplanningonline.php|publisher=ProjectManager.com|accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl] The logical dependencies between tasks are defined using an activity network diagram that enables identification of the critical path. Project planning is inherently uncertain as it must be done before the project is actually started. Therefore the duration of the tasks is often estimated through a weighted average of optimistic, normal, and pessimistic cases. The critical chain method adds "buffers" in the planning to anticipate potential delays in project execution.[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of project planning methodologies with examples|url=http://geekly-yours.blogspot.fr/2014/04/project-planning-top-10-interview-questions-for-project-managers.html|accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl] Float or slack time in the schedule can be calculated using project management software.[tpl]cite book  | author = Richard H.

At this stage, the project schedule may be optimized to achieve the appropriate balance between resource usage and project duration to comply with the project objectives. Once established and agreed, the project schedule becomes what is known as the baseline schedule. Progress will be measured against the baseline schedule throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline schedule is known as earned value management.[tpl]cite book  | first = Quentin | last = Fleming | authorlink =  | year = 2005 | title = Earned Value Project Management | edition = Third Edition | publisher = Project Management Institute | isbn = 1-930699-89-1[/tpl]
The inputs of the project planning phase include the project charter and the concept proposal. The outputs of the project planning phase include the project requirements, the project schedule, and the project management plan.Filicetti, John, Project Planning Overview, PM Hut (Last accessed 8 November 2009).
The Project Planning can be done manually. However, when managing several projects, it is usually easier and faster to use project management software.
