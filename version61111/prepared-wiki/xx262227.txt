[[Radiodrome]]

CATEGORIES: Curves, Differential equations, Analytic geometry

In geometry, a radiodrome is the path followed by a point which is pursuing another point. The term is derived from the Latin word radius (beam) and the Greek word dromos (running). The classical (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.
It is also the name of a weekly radio show hosted by internet personality Brad Jones and Josh Hadley.
A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity.
It is illustrated by the following figure:
