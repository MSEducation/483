CATEGORIES: Battles and operations of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, History of Jerusalem

From 13–18 May 1948 Jewish forces from the Haganah and Irgun executed Operation Kilshon ("Pitchfork"). Its aim was to capture the Jewish suburbs of Jerusalem, particularly Talbiya in central Jerusalem.

==Operation==

At midnight on Friday May 14, the British declared its civil and military authority in Jerusalem to be at an end. In the morning they evacuated the city in two large convoys, one moved north towards Haifa and the other south towards Bethlehem. The Zionists managed to obtain a schedule of their withdrawal in advance and could thereafter launch the operation almost immediately.
The Yishuv forces quickly managed to take control of buildings that the British had nationalized in "Bevingrad" zones. These were heavily fortified security zones that the British had built up around key installations in the city to protect against Irgun attacks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-44702620.html |title=Emerging City|date=18 May 2001|work=The Jerusalem Post|page=10|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl] From 1946 to 1948, security zones with huge coils of barbed wire filling the streets and dragon's teeth blocking the incursion of armed vehicles began appearing around Jerusalem.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-81838994.html|title=Return to Bevingrad|first=Aviva|last=Bar-Am|date=19 September 2003|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl] (subscription)Rosenne, Shabtai.

On Friday, May 14, 1948, the Irgun forces headed for the Bevingrad on Jaffa Road. The first building they recaptured was the Generali Building, now evacuated. The Irgun forces hoisted the Israeli flag over the lion statue on the roof before continuing on to take control of the Russian Compound and the Police Academy further north.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.kotar.co.il/kotarapp/index/Chapter.aspx?nBookID=96559646&nTocEntryID=96560306|title=ירושלים: בניינים בעיר החדשה|language=Hebrew|trans_title=Jerusalem: Buildings in the New City|first=Shmuel|last=Even-Or|journal=Kardom, Bimonthly Journal of Information about the Land of Israel|date=May 1984|pages=20-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etzel.org.il/english/ac19.htm|title=The Jerusalem Battalion|first=Professor Yehuda|last=Lapidot|publisher=etzel.org.il|accessdate=3 April 2014[/tpl]
They also recaptured the Notre Dame Church, the American Colony, Sheikh Jarrah, Talbiya, German Colony, Baka, Talpiot, and the Greek Colony.
A large portion of what was captured was to become the Israeli controlled portion of Jerusalem - "West Jerusalem". But some of the heaviest battles of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war was to follow and the Jerusalem frontier was to be redrawn many times.
