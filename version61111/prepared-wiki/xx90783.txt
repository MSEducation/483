Juan d'Arienzo (December 14, 1900 – January 14, 1976) was an Argentine tango musician, also known as "El Rey del Compás" (King of the Beat). He was son of Italian immigrants and used more modern arrangements and instrumentation; his popular group produced hundreds of recordings.
His music is played often at milongas in Buenos Aires, and the instrumentals are the classic harder rhythmic tangos with a strong staccato dance rhythm.  He also recorded many great milongas and fast valses.
His recordings were accompanied by singers such as Alberto Echagüe, Armando Laborde, and Héctor Maure, among others.
Upon his death in 1976, his body was interred in the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
