While the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is often identified as the owner of the WTC site, the ownership situation is actually somewhat complex and ambiguous.[ref]
</ref>  The Port Authority indeed owns a "significant" internal portion of the site of [tpl]convert|16|acre|m2[/tpl], but has acknowledged "ambiguities over ownership of miscellaneous strips of property at the World Trade Center site" going back to the 1960s. It is unclear who owns [tpl]convert|2.5|acre|m2[/tpl] of the site, being land where streets had been before the World Trade Center was built.

==Before the World Trade Center==

The western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River, with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. It was on this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street that Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, the Tyger, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in Manhattan. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of a second ship from the eighteenth century were discovered in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 feet below the surface.CNN: Pieces of ship made in 1700s found at ground zero building site
The area that was cleared for construction of the original World Trade Center complex was previously occupied by various electronics stores in what was called Radio Row. These streets and stores were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the World Trade Center.

==Original buildings==

The original World Trade Center was  thought of as a North American cultural icon. At the time of their completion the "Twin Towers", the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at 417 metres (1,368 ft), and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower),  were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985, with a construction cost of $400 million ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|400000000|1971|[tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl]|r=-8[/tpl][/tpl] in [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl] dollars).[tpl]Inflation-fn|US[/tpl] The complex was located in New York City's Financial District and contained [tpl]convert|13400000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of office space.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4D81030F935A35752C0A9649C8B63 |title=Commercial Property; In Office Market, a Time of Uncertainty |work=The New York Times |author=Holusha, John |date=January 6, 2002 |accessdate=November 21, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_30_48/ai_83762552 |title=Ford recounts details of Sept. 11 |work=Real Estate Weekly |date=February 27, 2002 |publisher=BNET |accessdate=January 3, 2009[/tpl]

===September 11 attacks===

On the morning of September 11, 2001, two hijacked planes bound for Los Angeles were intentionally crashed into the two towers of the World Trade Center. The towers collapsed within two hours of the collisions.[ref]
