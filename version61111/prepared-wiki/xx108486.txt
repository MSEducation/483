The Johan Cruijff Schaal ([tpl]Lang-en|Johan Cruyff Shield[/tpl]) is a football trophy in the Netherlands named after legendary Dutch football player Johan Cruyff, also often referred to as the Dutch Super Cup. The winner is decided in one match only, played by the winner of the national football league (the Eredivisie) and the winner of the national KNVB Cup. In the event of a team winning both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup, the Johan Cruijff Shield will be contested between that team and the runner up in the national league. The match traditionally opens the Dutch football season in August one week before the Eredivisie starts.

==History==

===Super Cup===

The first Super Cup match was played on 25 June 1949. The league champions SVV beat cup winners Quick Nijmegen 2–0.
The Dutch FA brought back the competition in 1991 under the name PTT Telecom Cup, with the match always being played in the De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam. After three years, sponsor PTT Telecom retreated and the name Super Cup was reinstated.

===Johan Cruijff Schaal===

In 1996 the format was changed to the current set-up, and played in the Amsterdam ArenA under the name 'Johan Cruijff Schaal'.
In 2003, the supporters of both teams, namely FC Utrecht and PSV were rather unhappy with the set-up and stayed away from the stadium. The Utrecht fans complained about protocols concerning their travel to Amsterdam (strict rules imposed for the threat of hooliganism) and the PSV fans were dissatisfied with the seats assigned to them. Only 700 of the 13,000 available tickets were sold. The prize money in 2003 amounted to €135,000. The contestants in 2004 were Ajax and FC Utrecht. Utrecht won with a final score 4-2 after trailing 1-2 up until the 85th minute of the match. Thirty-three thousand spectators witnessed the most remarkable comeback in the trophy's history.
Because PSV won both the national championship and the cup in 2005, Ajax (who had finished second in the league) formed the opposition and won 2-1. It was only the fourth home-victory of Ajax over PSV in ten years.
