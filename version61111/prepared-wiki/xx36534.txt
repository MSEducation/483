He was then cast as Marcus Dixon in the short-lived sitcom, Getting By, starring Cindy Williams and Telma Hopkins.

In 1995, Santana was cast as Marcus Henry in the short-lived CBS family drama Under One Roof, co-starring with James Earl Jones, Joe Morton and Vanessa Bell Calloway. Between 1996 and 1999, he played the role of Ohagi on Moesha.

==Death==

On November 9, 2002, Santana was shot in the head and killed as he and his best friend, former child actor Brandon Quintin Adams were in a car leaving another man's home in the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Damien Andre Gates fired the shot that entered through the trunk of the vehicle that Santana was in. The bullet penetrated the right-front passenger headrest and entered directly into Santana's head, killing him instantly.  Damien was later convicted of the first-degree murder of Santana and the attempted murder of Brandon Quintin Adams and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences plus 70 years in prison. Brandon Douglas Bynes received a 23-year sentence after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon, even though none of the shots fired from his revolver ever entered the vehicle. An officer involved in the case testified that Monique King, reportedly Gates's girlfriend and aged 15 at the time of Santana's death, falsely claimed that Santana had tried to rape her, which prompted Gates and Bynes to attack the car. King received ten years in juvenile custody.[tpl]cite journal|date=2004-05-10|title=Three Sentenced in Shooting Death of TV Actor Merlin Santana|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=105|issue=19|page=18|issn=0021-5996[/tpl] Santana was 26 years old at the time of his death.
