==Political career==

In December 2006 NHS London asked Darzi to "develop a strategy to meet Londoners' health needs over the next five to ten years" and so his report Healthcare for London: A Framework for Action was published on 11 July 2007.http://www.healthcareforlondon.nhs.uk/a-framework-for-action-2/  Largely implemented, it recommended the development of academic health science centres and the introduction of more primary services in one place: polyclinics.
On 29 June 2007 Darzi was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department of Health in the House of Lords at the Department of Health by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. He was duly raised to the peerage on 12 July 2007 as Baron Darzi of Denham, of Gerrards Cross in the County of Buckinghamshire. His appointment was a small part of a political shift by government to incorporate more talents, see historical predecessors such as the Ministry of All the Talents.http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brown-completes-government-of-all-talents-with-team-of-outsiders-455341.html
Darzi was tasked with leading a national review to plan the course of the NHS over a decade, reporting back to the Prime Minister, Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Health in June 2008. He cooperated with the Department of Health to undertake the “NHS Next Stage Review”.
Darzi was quoted in The Times as saying that “...This Review should be both [tpl]Sic|?|hide=y|clinically|-[/tpl]led and evidence-based”.  The final report of the Review, High Quality Care for All, was published in June 2008 to considerable public and academic acclaim. The Financial Times stated that it was “the world’s most ambitious attempt to raise the quality and effectiveness of an entire nation’s healthcare”.NHS plans to raise quality of care - FT.com  The Lancet acknowledged that:
[tpl]quote|"Darzi has wisely thrown out regulation as the organising principle of the NHS. He has replaced it with quality...This cultural shift is a radical re-visioning of purpose for the NHS—away from the political command and control of processes and towards professional responsibility for clinical outcomes"[tpl]cite pmid| 18603140[/tpl][/tpl]
Through High Quality Care for All, academics have suggested that Darzi has updated traditional notions of professionalism and described a new accountability in clinical practice. Following publication, Darzi remained in his ministerial post. At that time a Department for Health spokesperson was quoted as saying that his revised role would “...ensure the successful implementation of the Review’s conclusions. Notably, frontline clinical staff will be given more control over budgets, and his proposals will mean that every provider of NHS services will be required to publish Quality Accounts from April 2010”.
As a government minister, Darzi found himself responsible for leading the passage of health-related legislation through the Lords.
Darzi’s leadership as a health minister was the culmination of many years of involvement in health policy. Immediately prior to joining the government, Darzi led a review of health services in London, identifying the opportunities to raise clinical quality across the capital. He was also National Advisor in Surgery to the Department of Health. Darzi’s report in this role ‘Saws and Scalpels to Lasers and Robots: Clinical case for change’ (April 2007), argued for a change to the way surgery is organised to maximise patient benefits.Saws and scalpels to lasers and robots advances in surgery : Department of Health - Publications
In June 2009 Darzi was appointed as a member of Her Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Councilhttp://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/page76.asp#d and in November 2010, under David Cameron, became a United Kingdom Global Ambassador for Health and Life Sciences; a role he continued until 2012.PM announces new Business Ambassadors Number 10
In July 2009, Darzi relinquished his post as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The Prime Minister praised his “outstanding contribution”.Lord Darzi resigns: full text of letters exchanged with Gordon Brown - Telegraph and The Guardian said that:
"Instead of waging war on the medics, as his Blairite predecessors had done, Darzi invited them to take a hand in designing their own targets and bound them into reform. He stressed the quality of care after Labour's decade-long obsession with quantity. And while the drive for private involvement continued, it took a less dogmatic turn. The NHS's morale improved, as did its public standing."In praise of ... Ara Darzi | Editorial | Comment is free | The Guardian
In September 2013, Lord Darzi was appointed by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson to lead a new clinically-led review of health and wellbeing and services in London. The London Health Commission, which is expected to report in late 2014, will conduct an evidence-based investigation into healthcare provision and resources for the capital.
In January 2014 Professor Darzi was awarded the Qatari sash of Independence by HH the Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in recognition of his contribution to the development of Qatar's health sector.

==Global Health and Innovation==

After July 2009, Lord Darzi returned to his clinical and academic work and has expanded his involvement in global health issues. In June 2010 he was appointed Chairman of the Institute for Global Health Innovation at Imperial College, a body dedicated to improving healthcare around the world and reducing health inequalities in developed and developing countries. in 2012 the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) hosted the inaugural Global Health Policy Summit in London, during the London 2012 Olympic Games. This event brought together global healthcare leaders, academics and industry to debate key topics on global health and included a keynote address by Prime Minister David Cameron.
In 2013, Lord Darzi hosted the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha, Qatar, under the Patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser al Missned and Qatar Foundation. This international event attracted over one thousand delegates from industry, academic and the healthcare sector and world renowned political and royal figures including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, His Royal Highness The Duke of York, Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco, HRH Princess Ghida Talal of Jordan and HRH Princess Dina Mired of Jordan.

He developed the virtual operating theatre to promote surgical competence; his work is transforming surgical training. More recently, Professor Darzi was tasked with leading a review to determine the future course of the National Health Service as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and has ensured this is firmly evidence-based and clinically-led.https://royalsociety.org/people/fellowship/2013/ara-darzi/[/tpl]
