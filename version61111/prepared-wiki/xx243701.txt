==Origins==

The first Gordon on record is Richard of Gordon, previously of Swinton, said to have been the grandson of a famous knight who slew some monstrous animal in the Merse during the time of King Malcolm III of Scotland. This Richard was Lord of the Barony of Gordon in the Merse. The name is said to derive from the Gaelic 'Gor Dun' meaning great fort. The de Gordons held the lairdship of Gordon for over two centuries and were thought to have built a castle at the former hamlet of Huntly just to the north; they still held lands up to the 18th century.Statistical Accounts of Scotland. 1791â€“1799. Volume 5 page 88
The Gordon family are the ancestors of the Dukes of Richmond and Gordon and of the Marquis of Huntly.http://www.electricscotland.com/History/gazetteer/index.htm Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, page 201. Gordon. Edited by Francis Groome

==Church==

In 1171, the chapel at Gordon, dedicated to St. Michael, was transferred by the monks of Coldingham to their counterparts at Kelso in return for the church at Earlston. The present church was built in 1763 and is a part of the Church of Scotland.http://www.electricscotland.com/History/gazetteer/index.htm Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland, page 201, Gordon.

==Greenknowe Tower==

In 1408, Alexander Seton married Elizabeth Gordon, heiress of the Gordon family,http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/earldomschapter3s/htm Earls and Earldoms of Scotland and they were granted lands at Greenknowe, just to the west of the village. A descendent of the family, James Seton of Touch, married Janet Edmonstone and it was they who built the tower in 1581. Their initials IS/IE (the 'I' is Latin for 'J') are carved above the entrance. Later owners of the tower were Walter Pringle of Stichill, the Covenanter and the Dalrymple family.[tpl]cite book|title=The memoirs of Walter Pringle|first=Water|last=Pringle|editor=W.
