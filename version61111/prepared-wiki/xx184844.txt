[[Hate (Sarcófago album)]]

CATEGORIES: 1994 albums, Sarcófago albums

Hate is the Third studio album by Brazilian extreme metal band Sarcófago, released in 1994 through Cogumelo Records. It has a more stripped-down approach than their previous record,Gimenez, 1995, page 54. The Laws of Scourge (1991).
Hate is also notable for its controversial use of a drum machine,Franzin, 1997, page 16. which was used because there were no drummers who could play as fast as the band wished.Entrevista com a banda em 1997 pela revista Rock Brigade nº 130 The band was trying to be the fastest band in the world.
Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.
The song "Satanic Terrorism" is about the 'Inner Circle' church burnings in Norway at the beginning of the 90s; Sarcófago was accused of supporting these acts, but Lamounier claims that the song only describes the acts.
