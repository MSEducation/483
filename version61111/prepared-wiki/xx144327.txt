[[Hebron Gate]]

CATEGORIES: 2002 albums, Groundation albums

Hebron Gate is the third release by American reggae band Groundation.  The album received a nomination for Germany's coveted World Music Award.  For this release, reggae artists Cedric Myton of The Congos and Don Carlos of Black Uhuru were united for the first time in reggae history to collaborate with Groundation. 
The album's nine tracks tell the story of a Dragon War coming upon the nations.  The story unfolds over a twenty-four hour timespan; with the sun rising in the beginning, setting in the middle, and finally rising again at the end.  For the final two tracks Groundation calls upon their elders and reggae legends Don Carlos and The Congos to take up the fight.
