[[Bwa languages]]

CATEGORIES: Gur languages, Languages of Burkina Faso, Languages of Mali

The Bwa languages (Bwamu, Bomu) are a branch of the Gur languages spoken by over half a million Bwa people of Burkina Faso and Mali.  
The Bwa people, and their languages, are one of several called Bobo in Bambara. The Bwa are distinguished as the Bobo Wule/Oule "Red Bobo". The Bwa languages are not mutually intelligible; Ethnologue calculates that the intelligibility of the Ouarkoye and Cwi is 30%, though other varieties are closer.
