Tony Adams (born Anthony S. Adams, 11 December 1940) is a Welsh actor, best known for his performances in two British television soap operas.
Adams was born in Anglesey, Wales, and he trained as an actor at the Italia Conti Stage School.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/your-questions/2008/03/30/ask-tony-adams-79310-20692020/ | work=Sunday Sun | title=Ask: Tony Adams |author= | date=30 March 2008 | accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] After some stage appearances, including a starring role opposite Cheryl Kennedy in a West End revival of The Boy Friend, he made his name as Dr Neville Bywaters in the 1970s soap, General Hospital. He also appeared in the 1973 Doctor Who story The Green Death as Elgin.
In November 1978 he moved on to a major role in Crossroads, as mustachioed Adam Chance.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/birmingham/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8583000/8583024.stm | work=BBC Birmingham | title=Crossroads cast back to Birmingham |author= | date=23 March 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011[/tpl] It is for this role that he is primarily remembered. In September 1987, Adams decided to leave the programme. The announcement was made that the series would end in April 1988, and Adams stayed to the end. He was one of the cast members who returned in the 2001 revival of the series, though his character was later killed off in a fire after becoming obsessed with religion. 
In late 2004, Adams appeared in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the London Palladium theatre where he played Grandpa Potts.
