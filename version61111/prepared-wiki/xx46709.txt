==Earlier use of the name==

The era of 1900 to 1925 saw various corporations, in several U.S. states, use similar "American" names, such as American Motor Carriage Company (Ohio, 1902-1903), American Automobile Manufacturing Company (Indiana, 1911-1912), and American Motors Incorporated (New York, 1919-1920).[tpl]Citation |last=Phillips |first=Lou |year=2011 |title=Cars: 1895-1965 |isbn=978-1456892944 |pages=55–62 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XLS3UagARgwC&pg=PA56#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.[/tpl] In 1916, An earlier "American Motors Corporation", apparently unrelated to the more famous later corporation of the same name, was formed in 1916 in Newark, New Jersey, with Louis Chevrolet as vice president and chief engineer.[tpl]Citation |author=Editorial staff and correspondents |date=March 1, 1916 |title=American Motors Corporation formed |journal=Automobile Trade Journal |volume=20 |issue=9 |page=108 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zqgyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA108#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.[/tpl] By 1918 it was producing cars in a plant at Plainfield, New Jersey.[tpl]Citation |author=American Motors Corporation |date=May 15, 1918 |title=Advertisement |journal=Horseless Age |volume=44 |issue=4 |page=7 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JFbmAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA41#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.[/tpl] In 1923 it merged with the Bessemer Motor Truck Company of Pennsylvania into Bessemer–American Motors Corporation, which lasted less than a year before merging with the Winther and Northway companies into Amalgamated Motors. The latter company apparently ceased soon after.

==Later reuse of trademark==

A new company was formed in Palmdale, California, in 2001. A registration for the American Motors trademarks was filed in 2001 by this California-based firm.[tpl]cite web|url= http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4810:vu8969.2.13 |title=Trademark record for American Motors Corporation, 190 Sierra Court B-11, Suite 103, Palmdale, California |publisher=Tess2.uspto.gov |accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl] The company's website specifically claimed no affiliation to the previous American Motors, but used AMC's history and logos on its website.[tpl]cite web|url= http://e-amc.com/ |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050213164153/http://e-amc.com/ |archivedate=13 February 2005 |title=American Motors Corporation Home Page |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl] The website is now dead, and the company's claims to AMC's trademarks expired in 2005.
The new Chrysler LLC holds a live registration for the name "American Motors", which was applied for in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url= http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4810:vu8969.2.9 |title= Trademark registration by New Carco Acquisition LLC on December 20, 2011 |publisher=Tess2.uspto.gov |accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl] The AMC trademark, complete with "A-mark" - as was originally used in 1970[tpl]cite web|url= http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4810:vu8969.2.46 |title= Trademark registration by American Motors Corporation on December 29, 1970 |publisher=Tess2.uspto.gov |accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl] and through the late-1980s - was registered and published for comment by Chrysler as of 2010.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/news/index.php/2010/12/chrysler-registers-amc-tradesman |title=Chrysler registers AMC, Tradesman |date=23 December 2010 |first=David |last= Zatz |accessdate=18 February 2014[/tpl]

==AMC passenger cars==

*  – The Metropolitan was introduced by Nash in 1954.

** – The Gremlin was the company's first modern subcompact.

==AMC engines==

Also: Kaiser Jeeps used the AMC 327, Buick 225 ("Dauntless V6"), Buick 350 ("Dauntless V8"), Willys 134 I4 ("Hurricane"). The Downsized Jeep XJ Cherokee/Wagoneer used the Chevrolet 2.8 Litre V6 in 1983–1984.
1 AMC contracted with Volkswagen to buy tooling for the Audi 2.0 L OHC I4. Major parts (block, crankshaft, head assembly) were initially purchased from Audi and shipped to the U.S. where final assembly was accomplished by AMC at a plant purchased specifically for production of this engine. Sales never reached numbers to justify taking over total production. AMC made several changes to the engine. They were prevented from using the Volkswagen or Audi names in association with the AMC assembled version by contractual agreement.

==Collectibility==

AMC models historically regarded by hobbyists as particularly "collectible" include the Javelin, AMX, and performance specials such as the 1957 Rambler Rebel, 1965–67 Marlin, 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler, 1970 Rebel Machine, and 1971 Hornet SC/360. These models enjoyed limited popularity when new, resulting in low production figures.[tpl]cite book|last=Zuehlke|first=Jeffrey|title= Classic Cars|publisher=Lerner Publications|year=2007|page=18|isbn=978-0-8225-5926-9[/tpl] In January 2007, the AMC AMX was "really taking off in the muscle car market" according to the editors of Hemmings Classic Car, and it had "left its mark among AMC collectors' minds as a great alternative" to higher-priced Hemi-powered muscle cars.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2007/01/01/hmn_feature5.html |last=Litwin|first=Matthew|title=The Top 21 Hottest Collector Cars|journal=Hemmings Classic Car|date=January 1, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2011[/tpl]
The early Javelin (1968–70) stands out from the Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler pony cars.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/0706_1968_amc_javelin/ |last=Blackwell |first=Rusty |title=Collectible Classic: 1968–70 AMC Javelin |journal=Automobile Magazine |date=February 2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 [/tpl] Car expert Jack Nerad noted in a 2007 article "several fully restored AMX models" listed for sale at "little more than half the price of a comparable Buick Gran Sport, Chevrolet Chevelle, Olds 4-4-2 or Pontiac GTO" in support of the author's opinion that the 1971–74 Javelin was "clearly an outstanding alternative muscle car for the enthusiast on a budget."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carprices.com/articles/cars.html |last=Nerad |first=Jack |title=It doesn’t take a mint to buy one of tomorrow's top collector cars |work=Driving Today |year=2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 [/tpl]
According to James C. Mays, automotive historian and author of The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction, the "Wow! Factor" is an important and measurable pleasure to an owner whether their car is driven or sits in a climate-controlled garage.[tpl]cite book|last =Mays|first=James C.|title=The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction|publisher=Indy-Tech Publishing|year=2006|page=77|isbn=978-0-7906-1322-2[/tpl] His "Wow! Factor" includes examples of a bright red 1969 AMX that according to its owner "is just a fast Rambler", but draws more people at events than the more prestigious Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as well as a "million-dollar moment" when a Rambler owner was serenaded with the "Beep Beep" song by The Playmates while fueling at a travel plaza. Moreover, the author's collector car, a 1969 Ambassador station wagon, made friends as strangers came to greet and host him as if "long lost kin".Mays, pp. 37–38. Mays points out the ready availability of parts for AMC engines and his experiences in having service done on Ramblers without being charged for the work in exchange for the experience of driving a "sassy Rambler" (a 1966 American convertible) and having pictures taken with it.Mays, pp. 39–40.
Other AMC models, once somewhat ignored by the hobby, are now considered "future collectibles". Examples include the 1959 Ambassador 4-door hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were produced, and the Jeep Scrambler CJ8, a combined pickup truck-Jeep, of which only a few thousand were produced.
Hemmings Classic Car magazine included the 1969–70 Rebel SST and the 1974–78 Matador coupe in their 2008 list of "dollar-for-pound weight" cars that could be bought in show-quality condition for a comparatively modest outlay,[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.hemmings.com/hcc/stories/2008/01/01/hmn_feature1.html|last=Koch|first=Jeff |title=Dollar-A-Pound Collectibles|journal=Hemmings Classic Car|volume=4|issue=1|pages=14–19|date=January 1, 2008|accessdate=January 16, 2011[/tpl] The writer also noted that "most of AMC's '70s lineup" qualified for inclusion on the list.
The AMC Gremlin is described to have "a cult-like following in today's collectible car market.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.stltoday.com/classifieds/transportation/reviews/article_88ceab86-32b2-5758-9484-8c48522f060e.html |last=Kunz|first=Bruce|title=1970 AMC Gremlin- America's first "sub" compact car|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=December 3, 2007|accessdate=August 31, 2012[/tpl] The Gremlin shares components with some other AMC models its repair and restoration can be relatively inexpensive compared with other "historic cars".
The AMC Pacer increased in value according to a Pacer owner who is the CEO of a major insurance provider for collector car owners.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/aug2007/bw20070823_780539.htm |last=Palmeri |first=Christopher |title=Revenge of the Nerd Cars |journal=Business Week |date= August 23, 2007 |accessdate=November 24, 2010 [/tpl]
There are active Rambler and AMC car clubs in the U.S. and elsewhere (examples in External Links).

===Hot Rod Magazine revival April Fool's joke===

In April 2008, Hot Rod Magazine released an article claiming that American Motors was in the process of being revived. The vehicles in the works were to be the AMX, Matador, Ambassador, Pacer, and Gremlin. Illustrated with drawings of the concept cars entering production and accompanied by plentiful information, it was a popular article, although it was later revealed to be an April Fools' joke.[tpl]cite journal|last=Stanford|first=Steve|url= http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/hrdp_0804_amc_concept_cars/index.html |title=AMC Concept Cars – The Return Of AMC!
