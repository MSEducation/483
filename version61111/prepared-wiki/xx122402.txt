All of the Rock Aid Armenia projects were coordinated by international charity campaigner Jon Dee. Dee started the project after overseeing the satellite transmission of footage from the Armenian earthquake zone which he distributed to TV newsrooms worldwide. Other key members of the team included film producer Paul Lovell (who produced and edited the Smoke on the Water documentary and who was co-executive producer of "Smoke on the Water"), Phil Banfield (manager of Ian Gillan who assisted  on the track and Rock Aid Armenia's Peter Welles-Thorpe, David Highton, Isobel Sarkissian and Sarah Kaye.
