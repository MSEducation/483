Aalto University School of Engineering ([tpl]lang-fi|Aalto-yliopiston insinööritieteiden korkeakoulu[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sv|Aalto-universitetets högskola för ingenjörsvetenskaper[/tpl]) is part of Aalto University. It is one of the four new schools of technology established on 1 January 2011 from Aalto University School of Science and Technology, formerly known as Helsinki University of Technology. The four new schools continue to offer education and research that promotes advances in science and technology. The Department of Architecture was part of the School of Engineering until 2012, when it was restructured into the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture.School of Arts, Design and Architecture began operations at the start of the year, 02.01.2012.
The School of Engineering creates new information and solutions which serve the goals of sustainable development; key focus areas both in teaching and research include global warming, energy conservation and clean energy, and the sustainable use of natural resources.  The wellbeing of the environment and health and safety of people as well as aesthetics all require new solutions, and the School of Engineering is doing its part in seeking them.
The School operates in the fields of applied mechanics, civil and environmental engineering, energy and HVAC technology, mechanical engineering,  real estate economics, geomatics, structural engineering and building technology, and urban and regional studies.
