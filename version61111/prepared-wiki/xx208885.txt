The main event was an Elimination Chamber match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship between Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista, Edge, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit. Triple H won the match and the championship after last eliminating Orton. One of the predominant matches on the card was between Kane and Gene Snitsky, which Kane won by pinfall after performing a Tombstone Piledriver. Another primary match on the card was Muhammad Hassan versus Jerry Lawler, which Hassan won by pinfall after executing a Reverse STO.

==Background==

On the December 13, 2004 edition of Raw, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced that at New Year's Revolution, there would be an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Batista and Randy Orton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041213.html|title=WWE Raw results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|date=2004-12-13|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/041213.htm|title=Elimination Chamber will decide new World Champions|publisher=PWWEW.net|date=2004-12-13|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl] On the December 27, 2004 edition of Raw, Bischoff announced that all of the match's participants would compete in singles matches, and the length of their match would determine the entrance order of the Elimination Chamber. Christy Hemme was announced as the time-keeper for the show. Another stipulation in the matches was that if any of the participants lost their matches, the person who beat them would replace them in the Chamber match. All six participants won their matches, but Batista won his match in three minutes and two seconds, which turned out to be the shortest match length out of all participants. As a result, Batista earned the right to enter the Elimination Chamber match last. That same night, Bischoff announced that Shawn Michaels would take the Special Guest Referee role in the match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041227.html|title=WWE Raw results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|date=2004-12-27|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/041227.htm |title=Bischoff Delivers Showstopping Announcement for Elimination Chamber|publisher=PWWEW.net|date=2004-12-27|accessdate= 2008-07-26[/tpl] On the following edition of Raw, Bischoff booked three separate matches to take place later that night. The first match was between Benoit and Batista, which saw Batista pin Benoit after a Batista Bomb. The next match was between Edge and Jericho, where Edge pinned Jericho to score the victory. The final match was between Triple H and Orton, which Orton won after delivering an RKO and scoring the pinfall. During the match, the other four Chamber participants interfered when the referee was knocked out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/050103.html|title=WWE Raw results| publisher=Online World of Wrestling|date=2005-01-03|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/050103.htm|title=Six-Man Mayhem|publisher=PWWEW.net|date=2005-01-03|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl]
The primary feud heading into the event was between Kane and Gene Snitsky. On the September 13 edition of Raw, Kane competed in a No Holds Barred match against Snitsky. During the match, Kane's on-screen wife, Lita interfered in the match, which led to Kane accidentally falling a top of her after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair. The match came to an immediate end as trainers and Emergency medical technicians took Lita on a stretcher to an ambulance, as she needed medical attention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/040913.html|date=2004-09-14|title=WWE Raw Results|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/040913.htm|title=Surprise party|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2004-09-14 |publisher=PWWEW.net[/tpl] On the September 20, 2004 edition of Raw, it was announced that Lita had suffered a miscarriage due to what had happened the previous week.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/040920.htm|title=Emotional Night|accessdate=2008-07-29|date=2004-09-20|publisher=PWWEW.net[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/040920.html|title=WWE Raw Results|date=2004-09-20|accessdate=2008-07-29| publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] On the October 4, 2004 edition of Raw, Snitsky claimed in an interview that the miscarriage was "not his fault." Kane proceeded on to attack Snitsky, but Snitsky retaliated by attacking Kane with a lead pipe, which caused Kane to bleed from the head. After the attack, Bischoff made a Weapon of Choice match between the two for Taboo Tuesday. The match was voted to be a steel chain match, where the only weapon that could be used, was the steel chain. Snitsky defeated Kane at Taboo Tuesday after locking a steel chair around Kane's neck, and jumping onto it from the top rope, causing Kane to bleed from the mouth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/tabootuesday04.html|title=WWE PPV wrestling results|date=2004-10-19|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/history/alltimeresults|title=Taboo Tuesday 2004|date=2004-10-19|accessdate=2008-07-29| publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment[/tpl] The following weeks, Snitsky would state before his matches that the incident with Kane and Lita "was not his fault," but the injury's his opponent might get that night "would be his fault."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041025.html|title=WWE Raw Results|date=2004-10-25|accessdate= 2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/041025.htm| title=Dangerous deal|date=2004-10-25|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=PWWEW.net[/tpl] He would also mock the miscarriage during a street fight against Eugene by using a "No Babies" road sign and a baby carriage.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041101.html|title=WWE Raw Results|date=2004-11-01|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher =Online World of Wrestling[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/041101.htm|title=Strength in numbers|date=2004-11-01|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=PWWEW.net[/tpl] On the December 27 edition of Raw, Bischoff announced that Kane would face Snitsky at New Year's Revolution. On the January 3 edition of Raw, Kane would return (after weeks of inactivity) to save Lita from being double-teamed by Snitsky and Trish Stratus.
The predominant feud heading into the event was between Trish Stratus and Lita over the WWE Women's Championship. On the October 25, 2004 edition of Raw, Stratus approached Lita backstage and told her that she had gained weight from her pregnancy, which led to Lita attacking Stratus. That same night, a match was made between the two for the Women's Championship at Survivor Series. At Survivor Series, Stratus defeated Lita by disqualification to retain the title, after Lita hit Stratus with a steel chair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries04.html|title=WWE PPV Wrestling Results|date=2004-11-14|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2004/results/|title= Survivor Series 2004|date=2004-11-14|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment[/tpl] On the November 22 edition of Raw, Stratus defeated Lita and Molly Holly in a Triple Threat match for the title. After the match, Lita attacked Stratus and caused Stratus's nose to bleed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041122.html|title=WWE Raw Results|date=2004-11-22|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] On the December 6 edition of Raw, Lita defeated Stratus in the main event to capture the Women's Championship after delivering a Moonsault.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/041206.html|title=WWE Raw Results|date=2004-12-06|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling[/tpl] On the January 3 episode of Raw, it was announced that Stratus would face Lita for the title at New Year's Revolution.

==Event==

Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Hurricane and Rosey defeated La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Robért Conway) in a dark match. The first match to air live was a tag team match between the team of Eugene and William Regal and the team of Christian and Tyson Tomko for the World Tag Team Championship. During the match, Christian hit Regal in the nose, causing it to bleed. Eugene delivered a dropkick to Tomko and scored the pinfall to win the match.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1105329906.shtml|title=New Year's Revolution (RAW) PPV Results|last=Martin|first=Adam|publisher =WrestleView|date=2005-01-09|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/january/2005raw.htm|title=WWE New Year's Revolution 2005|publisher=PWWEW.net|date=2005-01-09|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/newyearsrevolution/history/2005/results/|title=New Year's Revolution 2005 Results|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=2005-01-09|accessdate=2008-07-26[/tpl]
The next match was between Trish Stratus and Lita for the WWE Women's Championship. Early on in the match, Lita appeared to suffer a legitimate injury after an attack by Stratus. Towards the match's end, Stratus delivered a Chick Kick to Lita to score the pinfall, win the match, and win the title. The third match of the card was between Shelton Benjamin and Maven for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Early in the match, Maven escaped the ring to taunt the fans for speaking Spanish. As the referee began to count him out, Maven ran back into the ring. Benjamin quickly rolled-up Maven to score the pinfall and win the match to retain the title. Immediately after the match, Maven demanded a re-match after stating that the first match "did not count." As match started, Benjamin delivered a T-Bone suplex to Maven to score the pinfall, win the match, and retain the title, again.
The next match was between Muhammad Hassan (with Daivari) and Jerry Lawler (with Jim Ross). Due to Lawler and Ross being involved in the match, no commentary was provided for the match. Towards the end of the match, Lawler attempted to pin Hassan, but Daivari pulled Hassan's foot on the bottom rope, which meant the count would have to stop immediately. Lawler then chased Daivari around the ring, until re-entering the ring, which resulted in Hassan delivering a Reverse STO and scoring the pinfall onto Lawler to win the match. The sixth match of the event was between Kane and Snitsky. A back and forth match took place between the two, with both men having advantages at different spot in the match. Towards the end of the match, Snitsky bit Kane's ear, but Kane retaliated by delivering a Tombstone piledriver to Snitsky to score the pinfall and win the match.
The main event of the card was the Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Batista and Randy Orton (with Shawn Michaels as the Special Guest Referee) for the World Heavyweight Championship. The rules of the match were that two participants would start the match, and every five minutes, another participant would enter the match after being released from their individual chamber. Participants were able to be eliminated from the match via pinfall or submission. Benoit and Jericho were the first two in the match. After five minutes, Triple H was released from his chamber, into the match. With all men remaining in the match, Edge was released from his chamber. Benoit attempted to apply the Crippler Crossface to Edge, but Edge countered the attack. Triple H delivered a Pedigree to Jericho right before Orton entered the match. Mid-match, Edge speared Michaels by accident, but when Michaels recovered, he delivered a Sweet Chin Music to Edge, which resulted in Jericho delivering a Lionsault to Edge. Jericho then pinned Edge to eliminate him from the match. Batista, the final entrant, then entered the match after time expired. Batista delivered a Spinebuster to Jericho a top of Benoit. Batista then pinned Benoit to eliminate him from the match. Seconds later, Batista delivered a Batista Bomb to Jericho to pin him and eliminate him from the match. Later on in the match, Triple H countered an RKO, by throwing Orton into Batista. Batista then attempted to deliver a Batista Bomb to Orton, but Orton countered by delivering a low-blow to Batista and scoring the pinfall to eliminate Batista from the match. Before Batista left the ring, he delivered a clothesline to Orton. Afterward, Triple H delivered a Pedigree to Orton to score the pinfall and eliminate Orton. As a result, Triple H won the match and the title.

==Aftermath==

The night after New Year's Revolution on Raw, Eric Bischoff booked a match between Batista and Randy Orton for later that night. The winner of that match would become the number-one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, and would face Triple H for the title at the Royal Rumble.

After New Year's Revolution, Edge began a feud with Shawn Michaels because of his feeling that Michaels screwed him in the Elimination Chamber match. At the Royal Rumble, Edge defeated Michaels in a singles match. At the event, Eugene suffered a legit ruptured left patella tendon, which required surgery.
