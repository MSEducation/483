Peter Gary Tatchell (born 25 January 1952) is an Australian-born British political campaigner best known for his work with LGBT social movements (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender).
Tatchell was selected as Labour Party Parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey in 1981. He was then denounced by party leader Michael Foot for supporting extra-parliamentary action against the Thatcher government. Labour subsequently allowed him to stand in the Bermondsey by-election in February 1983. In the 1990s he campaigned for LGBT rights through the direct action group OutRage!, which he co-founded. He has worked on various campaigns, such as Stop Murder Music against music lyrics allegedly inciting violence against LGBT people and writes and broadcasts on various human rights and social justice issues. He attempted a citizen's arrest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in 1999 and again in 2001.
In April 2004, he joined the Green Party of England and Wales and in 2007 was selected as prospective parliamentary candidate in the constituency of Oxford East,[tpl]Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6587311.stm |title=Tatchell to stand for Green Party |work=BBC News |accessdate=7 February 2008|date=24 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|title=Out now: Margaret's myopic view of the world |last=Duff |first=Oliver |date=17 April 2007 |newspaper=The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/out-now-margarets-myopic-view-of-the-world-445042.html |location=London[/tpl] but in December 2009 announced he was standing down due to brain damage he says was caused by a bus accident as well as damage inflicted by Mugabe's bodyguards when Tatchell tried to arrest him in 2001, and by neo-Nazis in Moscow while campaigning for gay rights.[ref]

==Personal life==

Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/20/peter-tatchell-retires-interview |title=How constant beatings have caught up with campaigner Peter Tatchell |last=Day |first=Elizabeth |date=20 December 2009 |work=The Observer |accessdate=20 December 2009 |location=London[/tpl] Because the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. He started work as a sign-writer and window-dresser in department stores. Tatchell claims to have incorporated the theatricality of these displays into his activism."Is This Your Life?" television programme, Channel 4, 5 August 1995. Raised as a Christian, Tatchell says that he "ditched his faith a long time ago" and is an atheist.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.secularism.org.uk/comingoutasatheistpetertatchellg.html |title=Coming Out as Atheist: Peter Tatchell, Grayson Perry|date=2 December 2005|publisher =National Secular Society |accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl] It is widely reported that Tatchell is a vegan, however Tatchell himself only states that he eats no meat, but does eat eggs and cheese,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-g-tatchell/peter-tatchell-day-in-the-day_b_2684401.html |title=A Day in the Life of Peter Tatchell|date=14 February 2013|publisher =Huffington Post |accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl] and according to Richard Fairbrass, wild salmon,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/19/date-peter-tatchell-richard-fairbrass |title=Celebrity blind date: Richard Fairbrass and Peter Tatchell|date=19 June 2010|publisher =The Guardian UK |accessdate=15 July 2013[/tpl] meaning Tatchell is in fact a Pescatarian.
He became interested in outdoor adventurous activities such as surfing and mountain climbing. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions about how insurance and legal risks were making British teachers reluctant to take pupils on outdoor adventures, he said outdoor activities helped him develop the courage to take political risks in adult life.

===Early campaigns===

His political activity began at Mount Waverley Secondary College, where in 1967 he launched campaigns in support of Australia's Aboriginal people. Tatchell was elected secretary of the school's Student Representative Council. In his final year in 1968, as school captain, took the lead in setting up a scholarship scheme for Aborigines and led a campaign for Aboriginal land rights. These activities led the headmaster to claim he had been manipulated by communists.
In 2004 he proposed the renaming of Australian capital cities with their Aborigine place names. He joined the Australian campaign against the death penalty. Prompted by the impending hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967, Tatchell went round his local area painting slogans against the hanging, a fact he did not reveal until nearly 30 years later."Bermondsey ten years on", Gay Times, February 1993. Ryan was accused of killing a prison warder while  escaping from Pentridge Prison. Tatchell claimed, unsuccessfully, that the trajectory of the bullet through the warder's body probably made it impossible that Ryan could have fired the fatal shot. [tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In 1968 Tatchell began campaigning against the United States's and Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, in his view a war of aggression in support of a "brutal and corrupt dictatorship" responsible for torture and executions. The Victorian state government and Melbourne city council attempted to suppress the anti-Vietnam War campaign by banning street leafleting and taking police action against anti-war demonstrations.New Statesman: Volume 137, Issues 4891–4903, 2008.

===Gay Liberation Front===

To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971.Jorge Morales, "Tatchell's Long Crusade", The Advocate, 2 May 1995; page 23. He had accepted being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve "poofs" and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others he helped organise Britain's first Gay Pride march in 1972.[tpl]cite book |last=Power |first=Lisa |title=No Bath But Plenty of Bubbles: An Oral History Of The Gay Liberation Front 1970-7 |publisher=Cassell |year=1995 |isbn=0-304-33205-4[/tpl]
In 1973 he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF's behalf. His actions triggered opposition within and between different groups of national delegates including the British Communist Party and National Union of Students. He was banned from conferences, had his leaflets confiscated and burned, interrogated by the secret police (the Stasi) and was threatened and assaulted by other delegates, mostly communists. Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.Peter Tatchell, "GLF at the World Youth Festival, GDR 1973", in Gay Marxist No 3 (October 1973).Documentary Explores Gay and Lesbian Oppression in East Germany - SPIEGEL ONLINE
Describing his campaigning, he is quoted as saying: “Despite our differences, we shared a radical idealism – a dream of what the world could and should be – free from not just homophobia but the whole sex-shame culture, which oppressed straights as much as LGBTs. We were sexual liberationists and social revolutionaries, out to turn the world upside down...  GLF’s strategy for queer emancipation was to change society’s values and norms, rather than adapt to them. We sought a cultural revolution to overturn centuries of male heterosexual domination and thereby free both queers and women. GLF’s gender agenda has been partly won.”Christian Concern: Same sex marriage

===Graduation===

After taking A levels at evening classes, he attended the Polytechnic of North London (PNL), where he obtained a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in sociology.
At PNL he was a member of the National Union of Students Gay Rights Campaign. On graduating he became a freelance journalist specialising in foreign stories, during which he publicised the Indonesian annexation of West Papua and child labour on British-owned tea farms in Malawi."Britain's profitable brew", New Statesman, 20 July 1979, p. 88–89

==Political activity==

Tatchell  popularised the phrase "sexual apartheid" to describe the separate laws that long existed for gays and heterosexuals.Tim Ross (19 March 2011). "Peter Tatchell bids to overturn gay marriage ban at European Court of Human Rights". The Daily Telegraph (London).Megan Murphy (31 July 2006). "British Lesbians Lose Bid to Validate Their Marriage", Bloomberg News (New York).
He opposed the appointment of Ruth Kelly as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in 2006. The Department had responsibility for equalities[tpl]clarify|date=January 2013[/tpl] while Kelly, a practising Roman Catholic, had not supported equal treatment of lesbians and gay men in any parliamentary votes. Tatchell said "her appointment suggests the government does not take lesbian and gay rights seriously", adding "Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race-equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/politics/2005-1410.html |title=article |newspaper=Pink News |location =London |date=9 May 2006 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]

===Labour candidate for Bermondsey===

In 1978 Tatchell joined the Labour Party and moved to a council flat in Bermondsey, south-east London.
From October 1979, he became a leading member in a group of left-wingers planning to depose the right-wing caucus of Southwark councillors that controlled the Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party (CLP). At CLP's AGM in February 1980, the left group won control and Tatchell was elected Secretary.
When the sitting Labour MP, Bob Mellish, announced his retirement in 1981, Tatchell was selected as his successor. The selection was a surprise, as Arthur Latham, a former MP and former Chairman of the Tribune Group), was the favourite. Later the Militant tendency was cited as the reason for Tatchell's selection, but he has pointed out that at that time it had only a handful of members in the constituency, he had never been a member and Militant did not support his selection. Tatchell ascribed his selection to the support of the "older, 'born and bred' working class; the younger professional and intellectual members swung behind Latham".Peter Tatchell (1983). The Battle for Bermondsey. Heretic Books. p. 50.

===Bermondsey by-election===

In an article for a left-wing magazine, Tatchell urged the Labour Party to support direct action campaigning to challenge the Margaret Thatcher-led Tory government.London Labour Briefing, November 1981. Social Democratic Party MP James Wellbeloved, arguing the article was anti-Parliamentary, quoted it at Prime Minister's Questions in December 1981 to embarrass Labour leader Michael Foot. Unexpectedly, Foot denounced Tatchell, stating that he would not be endorsed as a candidate. Foot narrowly won a vote at the Labour Party National Executive Committee to deny Tatchell's endorsement. However, the Bermondsey Labour Party continued to support him and he worked on convincing Foot that his article was in the tradition of the Chartists and the Suffragettes and had been misinterpreted by his political opponents. It was eventually agreed that when the selection was rerun, Tatchell would be eligible, and he duly won. When Mellish resigned from Parliament and triggered a by-election, Tatchell's candidacy was endorsed.
The divisions in the Labour Party, which Tatchell's far left views had exposed, and his homosexuality (which he refused to confirm or deny in media appearances), were used against him, in an election campaign widely regarded as one of the dirtiest and most violent in modern British history. Tatchell was assaulted in the street, had his flat attacked, and had a death threat and a live bullet put through his letterbox in the night. Although the Bermondsey seat had long been a Labour stronghold, the Liberal candidate, Simon Hughes, won the election. During the campaign, allegations were made[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] that some Liberal canvassers stirred up xenophobia and homophobia on the doorsteps, playing up the fact that Tatchell was born in Australia and making an issue of his homosexuality. Members of the Liberal Gay Action Group campaigned wearing lapel badges emblazoned with the words, "I've been kissed by Peter Tatchell" as a protest against the perception that he was attempting to hide his sexuality (see Bermondsey by-election, 1983). One of Hughes' campaign leaflets was condemned[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] for claiming the election was "a straight choice" between Liberal and Labour, but this phrase is regularly used by many parties within the UK, and Hughes has since apologised for what may have been perceived as an inadvertent slur.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/byelections79/bermondsey83/libber834b.jpg|title=British Parliamentary By Elections: Campaign literature from the by-election |archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5knRwGFnk |archivedate=25 October 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl] Hughes later admitted to bisexuality in 2006.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-357.html |title=Hughes considered quitting over bisexual revelations |date=26 January 2006 |first=Marc |last=Shoffman |first2=Benjamin |last2=Cohen|periodical=Pink News|accessdate=1 November 2007[/tpl]
In the mid- and late 1980s, Tatchell wrote books including The Battle for Bermondsey (the story of the by-election), Democratic Defence and a ground-breaking guide to surviving with HIV and AIDS, AIDS: A Guide to Survival. His book Europe in the Pink described the varying laws on homosexuality through the European Union. In 1990 Tatchell sought (unsuccessfully) the Labour nomination for Hampstead and Highgate, but was defeated by actress Glenda Jackson.

===Democratic Defence===

Tatchell's book Democratic Defence was published in 1985.  This outlined how defence of the United Kingdom might be assured after the nuclear disarmament that he and the Labour Party were then committed to.  (Labour has since abandoned this policy).History of the Labour Party, Labour Party website, accessed 21 March 2014  Tatchell argued that the British military was still organised on an imperialist strategy of basing troops abroad rather than on a strategy of defending the UK itself against foreign attacks.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=44–49 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  Citing the problems that the British army was facing in Northern Ireland, he argued that their long-established methods were ineffective against guerilla warfare.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=109–113 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  He argued for a range of methods to liberalise the regime in the armed forces so that troops could be allowed to join trade unions and political parties,[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=80–87, 195–199 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl] and to end he referred to as the "bull" of "petty regulations" and harsh punishments for violating them.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=73–75 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  He upheld the British Home Guard as an example of a citizens' army that had been effective in fighting Nazi Germany,[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=129–142 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl] and also upheld the armed forces of Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia as effective in deterring foreign aggression.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=99–109 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]
Tatchell argued for withdrawal from NATO and for the establishment of a European Self-Defence Organisation, independent of both the United States and the Soviet Union.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=199–201 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  Regarding the United States, he felt that Europe had become too dependent on their military protection and that this was inappropriate given the differing interests of many European countries.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=55-5 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  He condemned the Soviet Union's invasions of Czechoslovakia and of Afghanistan, as well as condemning its internal repression.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=32–43 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]  He wrote, "It is quite evident that the Soviet system today represents the complete opposite of everything that the left in the West is striving for..."[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |page=36 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]   He quoted with approval Enoch Powell's argument that the threat from the Soviet Union to the UK was exaggerated.[tpl]cite book |last=Tatchell |first=Peter |year=1985 |title=Democratic Defence |location=London |publisher=GMP Publishers |pages=36, 38 |isbn=0-946097-16-X[/tpl]

===Green issues===

In February 2000 Tatchell resigned from Labour, citing the treatment of Ken Livingstone during the nomination of a candidate for Mayor of London, and of similar cases in the Scottish and Welsh elections, as evidence that the party "no longer has any mechanism for democratic involvement and transformation".Peter Tatchell: Why I Resigned from Labour, 23 February 2000 He fought unsuccessfully for a seat on the London Assembly as an Independent Green Left candidate, in support of Livingstone. On 7 April 2004 he announced that he had joined the Green Party of England and Wales but did not envisage standing for election. However, in 2007, he became the party's parliamentary candidate for Oxford East.
On 16 December 2009, he withdrew as a candidate claiming brain damage from an assault while protesting in Brussels in 2001, while protesting in Moscow in 2007 and in a bus accident in July 2009.
Tatchell opposes nuclear power; instead he advocates concentrated solar power.Peter Tatchell, "Economic Democracy" – How The Light Gets In, 5 June 2012 In Tribune, he pointed out the adverse effects of climate change: "By 2050, if climate change proceeds unchecked, England will no longer be a green and pleasant land. In between periods of prolonged scorching drought, we are likely to suffer widespread flooding."
For many years, he supported a green-red alliance. More recently, he helped launch the Green Left grouping within the Green Party. He urged links between trade unions and the Greens. On 27 April 2010, he urged Green Party supporters to vote for Liberal Democrats in constituencies where they had an incumbent MP or a strong chance of winning.BBC News: Live coverage – General Election 2010, 27 April 2010, 16:03

===Iraq War===

Tatchell opposed the Iraq war and the subsequent occupation. He had previously advocated military and financial aid to opponents of the Saddam government, suggesting that anti-Saddam organisations be given "tanks, helicopter gun-ships, fighter planes, heavy artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles".Peter Tatchell (19 March 2003). "Iraq: the third way". The Guardian (London). While opposing western intervention, he advocated regime change from within in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria."ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT IGNORES SADDAM'S CRIMES – petertatchell.net. 30 September 2002 Tatchell has written that on 12 March 2003 he ambushed Tony Blair's motorcade in an anti-Iraq war protest. He forced Blair's limousine to stop, and then unfolded a banner that read "Arm the Kurds! Topple Saddam". He added that in terms of the political struggle within Britain (as opposed to struggles against absolute tyrants like Hitler and Saddam, where violent resistance can be the lesser of two evils): "I remain committed to the Gandhian principle of non-violence"."Diary" – Peter Tatchell. New Statesman (London), 24 March 2003. After the war he signed the 'Unite Against Terror' declaration, arguing that "the pseudo-left reveals its shameless hypocrisy and its wholesale abandonment of humanitarian values" by supporting resistance and insurgent groups in Iraq that resort to indiscriminate terrorism, killing innocent civilians.
In 2003 Tatchell said he supported giving "massive material aid" to Iraqi opposition groups, including the "Shi'ite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq" (SCIRI), to bring down Saddam. But in 2006 Tatchell noted that SCIRI had become markedly more fundamentalist and was endorsing violent attacks on anyone who did not conform to its increasingly harsh interpretation of Islam. He claimed that SCIRI, the leading force in Baghdad's ruling coalition, wanted to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship, with a goal of clerical fascism, and had engaged in "terrorisation of gay Iraqis", as well as terrorising Sunni Muslims, left-wingers, unveiled women and people who listen to western pop music or wear jeans or shorts.Peter Tatchell, "Iraq – Ayatollah Sistani Says Death to Gays; Sistani fatwa encourages terror against queers. Shia Badr Corps execute sodomites, Sunnis and others. UK fetes Sistani and hosts Badr's political wing, despite anti-gay murders.", 15 March 2006.; News story about protest- Marc Shoffman, "Iraqi Ayatollah sparks outrage after decreeing death to gays", Pink News, 17 March 2006.

===Balochistan===

In 2006, he expressed concern for the Baloch people facing military operations in their homeland, Balochistan in Pakistan. From 2007 to 2009, he campaigned in defence of two UK-based Baloch Muslim human rights activists, Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch, accused of terrorism charges and tried in London. Both men were acquitted in 2009. He alleged British and U.S. collusion with the suppression of the Balochs, including arms sales to Pakistan, which he says were used to bomb and attack Baloch towns and villages.Peter Tatchell, "Balochistan: UN Speech", delivered to Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization; Human Rights in Pakistan conference held at the United Nations in Geneva on 11 March 2010 parallel to the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council. The conference was co-hosted by UNPO and Interfaith International. (Footage of the speech available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNLm-oD4tok)

===Activities in Moscow===

In May 2006 Tatchell attended the first Moscow Pride Festival. He appears in the documentary Moscow Pride '06 featuring this event.
In May 2007 Tatchell returned to Moscow to support Moscow Pride and to voice his opposition to a ban on the march. On 27 May 2007, Tatchell and other gay rights activists were attacked. He was punched in the face and nearly knocked unconscious, while other demonstrators were beaten, kicked and assaulted.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/27/russia.gayrights.reut/index.html |title=Moscow police detain gay activists |agency=Reuters |work=CNN |date=27 May 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070618233008/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/27/russia.gayrights.reut/index.html |archivedate=18 June 2007|accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl] A German MP, Volker Beck, and a European Parliament deputy from Italy, Marco Cappato, were also punched before being arrested and questioned by police.[tpl]Cite news |title=Gay activists beaten up at Moscow demo |newspaper=The Independent |location =London |date=28 May 2007 |author=Rachel Shields[/tpl] Tatchell later said "I'm not deterred one iota from coming back to protest in Moscow."[tpl]cite web |url=http://pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4499.html |title=pinknews.co.uk |accessdate=18 June 2007 [/tpl]

==Campaigns==

===OutRage!===

Tatchell took part in many gay rights campaigns over issues such as Section 28. Following the murder of actor Michael Boothe on 10 May 1990, Tatchell was one of thirty people to attend the inaugural meeting of the radical gay rights non-violent direct action group OutRage! – although he was not a co-founder – and has remained a leading member.[tpl]cite book |author=Lucas, Ian |title=OutRage!: an oral history |publisher=Cassell |location=London |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-304-33358-1 |oclc= |doi=[/tpl] The group fuses theatrical performance styles with queer protest. As the most prominent OutRage! member, Tatchell is sometimes assumed to be the leader of the group, though he has never claimed this, saying he is one among equals.See, e.g., Ian Lucas, "OutRage! – an oral history", Cassell 1998.
In 1991, a small group of OutRage! members covertly formed a separate group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group's go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS's threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell's assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate the hypocrisy of those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.Ian Lucas, "OutRage! – an oral history", Cassell 1998, pp. 63–71
Some OutRage! activities were highly controversial. In 1994, it unveiled placards inviting ten Church of England bishops to "tell the truth" about what Outrage! alleged was their homosexuality and accusing them of condemning homosexuality in public while leading secret gay lives. Shortly afterwards the group wrote to twenty UK MPs, condemning their alleged support for anti-gay laws and claiming they would out them if the MPs did not stop what they described as attacks on the gay community. The MP Sir James Kilfedder, one such opponent of gay equality,http://www.scotsgay.co.uk/text/sg3.txt who had received one of the letters,[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/183/lucas.html  |title=OutRage!: an oral history – Book Review  |publisher=www.pinktriangle.org.uk  |year=1999  |accessdate=18 February 2008  |last=Lucas  |first=Ian[/tpl] died two months later of a sudden heart attack on the day one of the Belfast newspapers planned to out him.[tpl]citation |last=Lucas |first=Ian |year=1998 |title=OutRage! : an oral history |publisher=London |isbn=978-0-304-33358-5 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/outrage-an-oral-history/oclc/40461622 |page=200 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news|publisher=The Guardian (London)|date=22 March 1995|title=Heart Attack MP 'Received Letter From Outrage!'|author=Lawrence Donegan|author2=David Sharrock[/tpl] In a comment in The Independent in October 2003, Tatchell claimed the OutRage! action against the bishops was his greatest mistake because he failed to anticipate that the media and the church would treat it as an invasion of privacy.
On 12 April 1998, Tatchell led an OutRage! protest, which disrupted the Easter sermon by George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury,  with Tatchell mounting the pulpit to denounce what he claimed was Carey's opposition to legal equality for lesbian and gay people. The protest garnered media coverage and led to Tatchell's prosecution under the little-used Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 (formerly part of the Brawling Act 1551), which prohibits any form of disruption or protest in a church.Garner, Clare (30 November 1998). "Stars of stage and pulpit will support 'indecent' Tatchell". The Independent (London).Garner, Clare (1 December 1998). "Protest in the cathedral 'political', says Tatchell".

===Age of consent laws===

In 1996 Tatchell led an OutRage! campaign to reduce the age of consent to 14 to adjust for studies that showed nearly half of all young people—gay and straight—had their first sexual experiences prior to 16 years old and to exempt them from being "treated as criminals by the law". The campaign claimed there should be no prosecution if the difference in ages of the sexual partners was no more than three years—and providing it accompanies earlier, more effective sex education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/age%20of%20consent/consent%20at%2014.htm |title=CONSENT AT 14 |publisher=Petertatchell.net |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] He was quoted in the OutRage! press release as saying "Young people have a right to accept or reject sex, according to what they feel is appropriate for them".OutRage! press release, 21 February 1996 Leo McKinstry, in The Sun called it "a perverts' charter".McKinstry, Leo (24 February 1996). "Gays Homing in on Kids". The Sun (London).
In a 1997 letter to The Guardian, Tatchell defended an academic book about 'boy-love', calling the work "courageous" before writing:
Tatchell has since reiterated that he does not condone adults having sex with children. On his own website, under Age of Consent, he writes: "My articles arguing for an 'age of consent' of 14 are motivated solely by a desire to reduce the criminalisation of under-16s who have consenting relationships with other young people of similar ages. I do not advocate teenagers having sex before the age of 16. But if they do have sex before their 16th birthday, they should not be arrested, given a criminal record and put on the sex offenders register." [ref]
</ref>
On Tatchell's own website he states " My Guardian letter cited examples of youths in Papuan tribes and some of my friends who, when they were under 16, had sex with adults (over 18s), but who do not feel they were harmed."[ref]
</ref>
In the Irish Independent on 10 March 2008 he repeated his call for a lower age of consent to end the criminalisation of young people engaged in consenting sex and to remove the legal obstacles to upfront sex education, condom provision and safer sex advice. In the early 1990s, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that porn can have some social benefits, and he has criticised what he calls the body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.
OutRage!'s protest against Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, who supported the idea of genetic engineering to eliminate homosexuality,"If we could by some form of genetic engineeringeliminate these trends, we should—so long as it is done for a therapeutic purpose"—letter to the Jewish Chronicle, 16 July 1993 led to accusations that Tatchell was an anti-semite. OutRage! leaflets citing the similarity of Jakobovits ideas for the eradication of homosexuality to those of Heinrich Himmler were distributed outside the Western and Marble Arch Synagogue on the Jewish New Year in September 1993. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, who had campaigned for gay rights, said "Drawing a comparison between Lord Jakobovits and Himmler is offensive, racist and ... makes OutRage appear antisemitic". She stated that the action and leaflet would "alienate Jews who are sympathetic to gay rights".Jason Bennetto, "Is this comparison odious?", The Independent, 31 October 1993

===Zimbabwe===

Part of Tatchell's political activism and journalism in the 1970s involved the Bush War (or Second Chimurenga) in Rhodesia, in which he supported the black nationalist movement, including the Zimbabwe African National Union and its military wing. Mugabe's denunciation of male homosexuality in 1995 led Tatchell to help organise a protest for LGBT rights in Zimbabwe outside the Zimbabwe High Commission in London. Two years later, he passed through police security disguised as a TV cameraman to quiz Mugabe during the "Africa at 40" conference at Central Hall, Westminster. Mugabe told him that allegations of human rights abuses were grossly exaggerated; he became agitated when Tatchell told him that he was gay. Mugabe's minders summoned Special Branch guards, who ejected Tatchell. On 26 October 1997 a letter from Tatchell to The Observer argued that the United Kingdom should suspend aid to Zimbabwe because of its violence against homosexuals.[tpl]cite news |author=Tatchell, Peter |title= The other persecution (Letter) |newspaper=The Observer |location =London |page=C2 |date=26 October 1997[/tpl]
Tatchell researched the Gukurahundi attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked supporters of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He became convinced that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army. The arrest in London of Augusto Pinochet seemed to him a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks to the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999 Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe's car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen's arrest. Tatchell opened the car door and grabbed Mugabe. He then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as "gay gangsters", a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters, and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gays-seeking-sexual-asylum-in-south-africa-1123784.html |title=Gays seeking sexual asylum in South Africa |newspaper=The Independent |location =London |date=6 November 1999|accessdate=7 February 2008 |last=Duval Smith|first=Alex[/tpl]
On 5 March 2001 Tatchell believed Mugabe was about to visit Brussels. He went there and attempted a second citizen's arrest. Mugabe's bodyguards were seen knocking him to the floor. Later that day, Tatchell was briefly knocked unconscious by Mugabe's bodyguards and was left with permanent damage to his right eye. The protest drew worldwide headlines, as Mugabe was highly unpopular in the Western world for his land redistribution policy. Tatchell's actions were praised by Zimbabwean activists and many of the newspapers that had previously denounced him.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/peter-tatchall-there-may-be-a-case-for-the-people-of-zimbabwe-to-kill-robert-mugabe-462146.html |title= Peter Tatchell: 'There may be a case for the people of Zimbabwe to kill Robert Mugabe' |newspaper=The Independent |date=19 August 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2008 |last=Moreton |first=Cole |location=London[/tpl]
Tatchell ultimately failed in his attempt to secure an international arrest warrant against Mugabe on torture charges. The magistrate argued that Mugabe had immunity from prosecution as a serving head of state.
In late 2003 Tatchell acted as a press spokesman for the launch of the Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/whoandwhatisthezimfreedommovement_13nov2003.html |date=13 November 2003 |work=Sokwanele|title=Who and What is the "Zimbabwe Freedom Movement"?[/tpl] This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a "hoax." However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film "Peter Tatchell: Just who does he think he is?" by Max Barber.

===Stop Murder Music campaign===

Tatchell has claimed that the laws against incitement to violence and murder are not being enforced. He has also organised protests outside the concerts of singers whose lyrics he claims urge the killing of 'queers'. Long-running targets of his criticism include reggae artists whose lyrics he and his colleagues claim encourage and glorify violence, including murder, of lesbians and gay men. Tatchell's campaign began in the early 1990s when Buju Banton's song "Boom bye-bye" was released. He has picketed the MOBO Awards ceremony to protest at their inviting performers of what he terms "murder music".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.outrage.org.uk/Tatchell-reggaesingers.asp|title=Reggae Singers urge: Kill Queers|work=Outrage!|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040930145845/http://www.outrage.org.uk/Tatchell-reggaesingers.asp|archivedate=30 September 2004[/tpl] In response Tatchell received death threats and was labelled a racist. Tatchell defended himself by noting that the campaign was at the behest of the Jamaican gay rights group J-Flag, and the UK-based Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, with which he works closely. He also pointed to what he described as his life's work campaigning against racism and apartheid and stated that his campaigns against "murder music" and state-sanctioned homophobic violence in Jamaica were endorsed by black Jamaican gay rights activists such as Jamaican Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG), and by many straight human rights activists in Jamaica (homosexuality remains illegal in Jamaica). The campaign has had positive effects with seven of eight original murder music singers signing the Reggae Compassion Act, which says that signatories will not "make statements or perform songs" that incite hatred or violence.Leah Nelson, "Jamaica's Anti-Gay 'Murder Music' Carries Violent Message" Intelligence Report, Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140.
Members of the Rastafari movement accused Tatchell of racism and extremism, saying, "He has gone over way over the top. It's simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla in the same bracket and just shows how far he is prepared to go."Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter. "Black Music Council Defends DJ's", The Sunday Gleaner (sosjamaica.org). 13 December 2004. Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler.

===Imperialism===

While still at school, Tatchell campaigned in favour of better treatment of, and full human rights for, the Aboriginal people of Australia.(Tatchell, 1983) p.13 He believes that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names, to sever ties with the colonial era. For example, he wants the Tasmanian capital Hobart to be renamed Nibberluna, arguing that this would be a fitting tribute to Australia's Aboriginal heritage, which he says has been discarded and disrespected for too long.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]
His anti-imperialist activism began in 1968 and involved campaigns against the war in Vietnam. He participated in the mass Vietnam Moratorium protests in his Melbourne in 1970. The same year he founded and was elected secretary of the inter-denominational anti-war movement, Christians for Peace. Later, on moving to London in 1971, he was active in solidarity work with the independence movements in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea Bissau, Namibia, Eritrea, Oman, New Hebrides, Western Sahara, Palestine, East Timor and West Papua.
In 2002, he brought an unsuccessful legal action in Bow Street Magistrate's Court for the arrest of the formerU.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on charges of war crimes in Vietnam and Cambodia.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/apr/24/6 |title=Kissinger: mistakes may have been made |accessdate=17 August 2008|date=24 April 2002|publisher=guardian.co.uk | location=London[/tpl]

===South Africa===

A long-time anti-apartheid activist (from 1969), his lobbying of the ANC in 1987 contributed to it renouncing homophobia and making its first public commitment to lesbian and gay human rights. Later, in 1989 and 1990, he helped persuade the ANC to include a ban on anti-gay discrimination in the post-apartheid constitution (he assisted in drafting model clauses for the ANC). See: Sex and Politics in South Africa (Double Storey Books, Cape Town, 2005, pp. 140–149).
He was involved in the anti-apartheid movement from 1969 until the end of the white minority regime in 1990; being a regular protester and speaker at the 24/7 non-stop, four-year-long picket outside South Africa House.Galloway Activist Urges: Assault Tatchell: Respect Member Stirs Homophobia, Violence and Xenophobia Against Gay Activist, UK Gay News, 16 January 2006.

===National Front and British National Party===

In the 1970s and 1980s Tatchell was involved in campaigns against the National Front and the British National Party. He campaigned with Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League.

===Gaza and the West Bank===

For nearly four decades, Tatchell has campaigned for Gaza and the West Bank to be the basis of an independent Palestinian state. In May 2004, he and a dozen other OutRage! members, including gay Arabs, joined a London demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Their placards read "Israel: stop persecuting Palestine! Palestine: stop persecuting queers!" (the latter a reference to the arrest, jailing and torture of homosexuals by the Palestinian authorities). The OutRage! presence was greeted with hostility by some other demonstrators, and Tatchell claims they accused him of being a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, a supporter of Ariel Sharon or an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency or MI5.Gays attacked at Palestinian Rights Protest (Peter Tatchell press release)[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===2008 Olympics===

In April 2008, Tatchell attempted to disrupt the procession of the Olympic torch though London. As a protest against China's human rights record he stood in front of the bus carrying the torch along Oxford Street while carrying a placard calling on Beijing to "Free Tibet, Free Hu Jia" (the name of a recently jailed human rights activist). Tatchell was taken away by police but was not charged.Scott Anthony "Police forced to call in reinforcements as protesters disrupt Olympic torch relay", The Guardian, 6 April 2008. Retrieved on 4 September 2008. In an interview Tatchell called on the world to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics, or to take other visible action.

===Anglican and Catholic churches===

Tatchell criticised the Catholic Church and Pope Benedict XVI, whom he described as "the ideological inheritor of Nazi homophobia".Antonio Fabrizio , "Interview: Peter Tatchell's 40 years of campaigning", Pink News, 15 December 2007. "He'd like to eradicate homosexuality, but since he can't put LGBT people in physical concentration camps, is doing his best to put them in psychological concentration camps."
Channel 4 indicated in June 2010 that Tatchell would be the presenter of a documentary film examining "the current Pope's teachings throughout the world".[ref]
