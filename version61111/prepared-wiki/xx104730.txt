==History==

Construction on the National Sports Complex started in 1963 and was completed in 1964.Khmer Architecture Tours, retrieved 2007-11-25 Designer Vann Molyvann made use of massive earthworks to create the stadium, digging up 500,000 cubic meters of earth to shape the grounds.Deconstructing Cambodia's modernist heritage, Asia Times Online; retrieved 2007-11-25
The stadium might have been built to host the 1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, but the games were cancelled due to political problems in Cambodia. There was also the short-lived GANEFO games, that were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in November 25~December 6, 1966 and were named 'First Asian GANEFO'.  The stadium did play host to appearances by visiting dignitaries and state occasions, and was the home of Cambodia's national athletics teams.
The stadium played a small part in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Unexpectedly, North Korea faced Australia in a qualifier. Because North Korea lacked dipomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, an ally of Kim Il-sung, said the matches could be held in Phnom Penh. The matches attracted 40,000 fans, with Sihounouk decreeing half would cheer for Australia, while the other half cheered the Koreans.  The matches were held on 21 November 1965 and on 24 November 1965 with North Korea winning both (6–1 and 3–1). Because South Korea and all African teams had withdrawn in protests against FIFA, North Korea were thus directly qualified to the final tournament, where they reached the quarter-final.The greatest story never told, Ron Gluckman; retrieved 2008-01-151966 Qualifying Competition, Planet World Cup; retrieved 2007-01-15
Among the facilities are Olympic-size pools for swimming and diving and an indoor volley-ball court with a capacity of up to 8,000, now known as the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena.
During the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium was used as an execution site where officials of the Khmer Republic formerly led by Lon Nol were killed.Notes from Cambodia, Rich Garella; retrieved 2007-11-25
In the decades following the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium facilities fell into disrepair. In 2000 the stadium complex was redeveloped by a Taiwanese firm, the Yuanta Group, which refurbished the stadium but also redeveloped parcels of the complex into condominiums and commercial properties.Illegal disposals of state property, CambodiaPolitic.org; retrieved 2007-11-25Building Phnom Penh: An Angkorian heritage, Robert Turnbull, International Herald Tribune; retrieved 2007-11-25
As of 2007, the stadium has come to be a popular attraction for Phnom Penh residents, who attend daily exercise sessions, as well as football games and other activities.
