</ref> If ''F''(''r'') represents gravity, it is a negative term proportional to 1/''r''<sup>2</sup>, so the net acceleration in ''r'' in the rotating frame depends on a difference of reciprocal square and reciprocal cube terms, which are in balance in a circular orbit but otherwise typically not. This equation of motion is similar to one originally proposed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref>

</ref> Given ''r'', the rate of rotation is easy to infer from the constant angular momentum ''L'', so a 2D solution can be easily reconstructed from a 1D solution of this equation.

</ref> In the special case of circular orbits, in order for the radial distance to remain constant the outward centrifugal force must cancel the inward force of gravity; for other orbit shapes, these forces will not cancel, so ''r'' will not be constant.

==History==

Concepts of centripetal and centrifugal force played a key early role in establishing the set of inertial frames of reference and the significance of fictitious forces, even aiding in the development of general relativity in which gravity itself becomes a fictitious force.[ref]

==Applications==

The operations of numerous common rotating mechanical systems are most easily conceptualized in terms of centrifugal force. For example:
Nevertheless, all of these systems can also be described without requiring the concept of centrifugal force, in terms of motions and forces in a stationary frame, at the cost of taking somewhat more care in the consideration of forces and motions within the system.
