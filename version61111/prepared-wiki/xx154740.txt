Robert John Quiney (born 20 August 1982 in Brighton, Victoria) is an Australian cricketer who has represented the Australian national team in Test cricket. He plays domestic first class and List A cricket for the Victorian Bushrangers side, and plays domestic Twenty20 cricket for the Melbourne Stars, Auckland Aces, Uthura Rudras and Rajasthan Royals.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/globetrotting-quineys-time/33874| title= Globetrotting Quiney’s time has come| publisher = Wisden India | date= 6 November 2012[/tpl] He is a specialist left-handed batsman who also bowls right-arm medium pace. 
Quiney was first called up to the Victorian team in 2005, to play against the touring ICC World XI in a limited overs warm-up match for the ICC Super Series. He was run out for three. In the following season (2006–07), he became a regular member of Victoria's interstate limited overs side and made his first class debut, against Tasmania in Hobart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/211854.html|title=Australia / Players / Robert Quiney|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]
During the 2007/08 season, Quiney began to hold down a regular position in all forms of the game at interstate level, playing some important innings for Victoria, especially in the Ford Ranger Cup where he scored 89 not out off 57 balls against New South Wales at the MCG followed by 78 runs off 95 balls and 65 off 76 against Tasmania in Hobart and Melbourne respectively.  In a Sheffield Shield match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) against Tasmania in 2010–11, he scored a half century in the first innings and then 102 in the second innings. The century was his third in first class cricket, but was unable to save Victoria from their first defeat in a Sheffield Shield match at the MCG for three years. In February 2012, he scored two centuries (114 and 119) in the one Sheffield Shield match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sportal.com.au/cricket-news-display/white-praise-for-quiney-159799|title=White praise for Quiney|last=Mammone|first=Christian|date=5 February 2012|work=Sportal|accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]

After his 2011–12 season for Victoria and a strong innings of 85 for Australia A against the South African XI, Quiney was selected to make his Test debut in the first Test against South Africa in Brisbane in November 2012, after batsman Shane Watson withdrew due to injury. However his poor performance in the Brisbane and Adelaide tests raking in only 9 runs, an average of just 3.00 in the two tests saw him dropped to make way for Shane Watson now back from injury. Since Ponting's retirement, there have been calls for Quiney to replace Ponting in Australia XI.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/rob-quiney-and-ed-cowan-set-for-showdown-for-opening-batting-spot-in-australias-test-side/story-e6frfkp9-1226511369857|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=9 November 2012|title=Rob Quiney and Ed Cowan set for showdown for opening batting spot in Australia's test side|first=Malcolm|last=Conn[/tpl]
