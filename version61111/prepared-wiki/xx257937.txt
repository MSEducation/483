In December 2010, two open letters signed by rabbis in Israel generated heated controversy within and outside the country.
The first letter was a psak din (religious ruling) signed by an estimated 50 rabbis, urged Israeli landowners not to rent to Arabs or other non-Jews.http://www.nif.org/media-center/nif-in-the-news/the-psak-english-hebrew.pdf The second letter, signed by at least 27 rebbetzins (rabbis' wives) and released on December 28 by Lehava, urged young Jewish women not to date Arabs or even to work at locations where non-Jews might be present.
The initiator of the rabbis' letter was the chief rabbi of Safed Shmuel Eliyahu.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007553,00.html Eliyahu was summoned to an Israeli police interrogation on January 2, 2011, on suspicion of incitement to racism, a crime in Israel,http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4008037,00.html but refused to answer the summons.http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/01/02/2742379/safed-rabbi-refuses-police-summons-over-anti-arab-letterhttp://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4007187,00.html
Many of the rabbis who signed the letter are "local rabbis," in charge of religious services provided by their municipality; they are state employees and receive taxpayer salaries. Among the signers were rabbis from Rishon LeZion, Ramat HaSharon, Herzliya, Kfar Saba and Holon (all suburbs of Tel Aviv), Jerusalem, and other towns and settlements.Promised Land » Blog Archive » 50 Israeli Rabbis issue ruling forbidding renting of homes to Arabs
