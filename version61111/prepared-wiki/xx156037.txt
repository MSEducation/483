"All Fall Down" is the name of a 1985 hit single by British pop group Five Star. The single was the third UK release from their first album Luxury of Life, released in June 1985. The single was written by Barry Blue and Robin Smith, themselves famous for writing songs for artists in the 1970s.
The video used a technique similar to that of A-ha's "Take on Me", with a rotoscope type clip.
The single became a breakthrough for Five Star, giving them their first Top 40 entry, peaking at #15.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=12450 |title=Five Star - All Fall Down |publisher=Chart Stats |date=20 July 1985 |accessdate=10 December 2011[/tpl] Their first three single releases had all failed to make the Top 100.
