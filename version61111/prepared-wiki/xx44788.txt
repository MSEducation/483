==History==

===Founding===

John Carroll University was founded in 1886 by the Society of Jesuits under the title of St Ignatius College as a "college for men." It has been in continuous operation as a degree-granting institution since that time. Founded as the 19th of 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, it is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.[tpl]cite web | url = https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/23130/1/V086N3_051 | title = History of the Biology Department of John Carroll University | publisher = Ohio Journal of Science | accessdate = 2006-10-03[/tpl] It was founded 97 years after Georgetown University, the first Catholic Jesuit University in the United States.
In 1923, the College was renamed John Carroll University, after the first archbishop of the Catholic Church in the United States and founder of fellow Jesuit institution Georgetown University. In 1935, it was moved from its original location on the west side of Cleveland to its present site in University Heights, a suburb [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of downtown Cleveland. The city had been renamed from "Idlewood" during the construction of the campus.[tpl]cite web | url = http://cleveland.about.com/od/education/p/johncarroll.htm | title = John Carroll University | publisher = About, Inc. | accessdate = 2006-10-03[/tpl]
During World War II, John Carroll was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sites.jcu.edu/veterans/ |title=Veterans Program |publisher=University Heights, Ohio: John Carroll University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |year=2011[/tpl]

===Expansion===

In September 1968, the University made the transition from full-time male enrollment to a fully coeducational institution, admitting women to the College of Arts and Sciences for the first time.
In recent years, the University has undergone extensive reconstruction and expansion. In 2003, the University opened the $66 million, 265,000 ft² (25,000 m²) Dolan Center for Science and Technology, named after alumnus Charles Dolan, founder of Cablevision, and his wife Helen Dolan.  The couple met while attending John Carroll. In 2011, the university completed the removal of the (older) Bohannon Science building and Hamlin Quad enhancement project.
The current president, Rev. Robert Niehoff was inaugurated the 24th president of John Carroll University in October 2005.

===Jesuit Tradition===

The Jesuits who founded St. Ignatius College were exiles from Germany, forced out by Bismarck's Kulturkampf. They brought with them the traditional structure of the Jesuit college as an extension of the apostolate of the religious community to prepare the student morally as well as intellectually. The principal instrument of this education was the classical course of seven years, in which the first three years were devoted to learning languages as necessary tools. The student was then considered prepared for university work. The next four years were devoted to the study of classical literature and Latin and Greek prose and poetry, and to developing the ability to express one's self in these languages, as well as in the vernacular, orally and in writing. The final year was devoted to philosophy. There were also electives in the sciences, history, and geography, as well as other subjects. If the student completed only six years, a certificate was given. Completion of the year of philosophy made the student eligible for the baccalaureate degree, which the college was empowered to grant when it was chartered in 1890. The first two degrees were awarded in 1895.
John Carroll’s core value and mission emphasizes social justice and service to the community and the broader world. The university also follows Jesuit traditions by focusing on educating the “whole” student, or the intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and physical development of each student. Although its curriculum and community are shaped by its Jesuit and Catholic nature, it welcomes faculty, staff, and students of all faiths and of no faith.[tpl]cite web | url = http://sites.jcu.edu/mission/pages/vision-mission-core-values-and-strategic-initiatives-statement/ | title = Core Values and Strategic Initiatives Statement | publisher = John Carroll University | accessdate = 2011-12-04[/tpl]

==Academic Programs==

John Carroll University is organized into two schools: the College of Arts and Sciences and the AACSB-accredited Boler School of Business, each defining its own academic programs under the auspices of the Academic Vice President. All students need to fulfill the requirements in the core curriculum, as well as those required by their major field of study.

===Core Curriculum===

The university requires a rigorous liberal arts core for all undergraduate students. Among the requirements are a first year seminar course, two semesters of a foreign language, one semester of public speaking, two semesters of English composition, three philosophy courses, and two religious studies courses.
The Core Curriculum in the Liberal Arts of John Carroll is informed by the principles that issue from the University's mission as a Catholic and Jesuit liberal arts institution of higher learning. Accordingly, the Core emphasizes the development of whole human persons who are educated in the humanizing arts and sciences; skilled in expression and in scholarly investigation; and aware of the interrelationship of all knowledge and the interdependence of all peoples. Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and reason by imparting a deeper knowledge of and respect for the students' own cultural and religious traditions as well as those of others. Finally, it highlights intellectual, moral and spiritual principles, and the responsible social actions which flow from them.
As a means to achieve these and other goals significant to the University's mission, the Core has a distributive structure as well as distinctive emphases. The Core thus allows selectivity while also stipulating certain academic experiences which are important for all students.

===Rankings===

==Campus==

More than twenty major buildings, predominantly Collegiate_Gothic in architecture (not to be confused with the common Tudor Revival style found in much of Cleveland Heights), and sixty landscaped acres make up the John Carroll campus. The red-brick Administration Building, surmounted by the university's landmark Grasselli Tower, bears clear resemblance to the English royal palace Hampton Court.
Thorne Acres, a [tpl]convert|38|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] property in nearby Chardon, provides additional recreational and educational facilities.
Major buildings include the Grasselli Library and its John G. and Mary Jane Breen Learning Center, the James A. Bohannon Science Center, the Thomas P. O'Malley, SJ Center for Communications and Language Arts, and the D.J. Lombardo Student Center. This center includes the Little Theatre, the Harold C. Schott Dining Hall, the Inn Between, the Underground, recreational facilities, public conference rooms, and offices for student organizations; it is also the location of the Fritzsche Religious Center containing the campus ministry offices and the Saint Francis Chapel. In recent years, the University has purchased several homes as well as a nearby shopping plaza which abut the campus in order to both provide for additional office and housing space, but also to help preserve the look of the neighborhood around the campus which has become landlocked since the University was one of the original developments in what was once part of neighboring Shaker Heights.
The Don Shula Sports Center includes the William H. Johnson Natatorium and the Ralph Vince Fitness Center. Other major facilities include:

The Center promotes a welcoming and just university community, they sponsor campus speakers and entertainment, as well as providing training related to issues of diversity.

===Arrupe===

The Arrupe Scholars Program recognizes John Carroll students for their significant commitment to two interrelated values of John Carroll's mission: intellectual inquiry that demands critical thinking, and engaging in social justice and community service that leads to social action.
Fr. Pedro Arrupe grew in his understanding of the world, its struggles for justice and peace, and the way God continued to call people to be involved in this world. Students in the Arrupe program can find in his life a paradigm for their own growth, to be unafraid to be challenged, to learn from cultures not their own, and to gauge their growth not in terms of how much they possess but in terms of how much they can give.
A commitment to social justice entails the formation of an ethic of social action that embodies Fr. Arrupe's ideal of "a commitment to promote justice and to enter into solidarity with the voiceless and the powerless."
The humanism of today's Jesuit University is not one that removes young men or women from life but one that prepares them to take their place in life with conviction that their talents are not talents until they are directed to help other people, until they have become genuinely men and women for others.
A commitment to social justice is the full, fair and equal participation of all groups in a society that is mutually shaped to meet the needs of each individual member.
Social justice involves individuals with a deep understanding of their own agency, as well as a personal sense of social responsibility toward and with others and society as a whole.
Social justice includes a vision of society in which the distribution of resources is fair and relatively equitable, and all members are physically, spiritually and psychologically safe and secure.
