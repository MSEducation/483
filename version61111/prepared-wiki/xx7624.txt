Murray Newton Rothbard ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|r|i|_|ˈ|r|ɑː|θ|b|ɑːr|d[/tpl]; March 2, 1926 – January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School,[tpl]cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Economists |publisher=Thoemmes |last=Lewis |first=David Charles |chapter=Rothbard, Murray Newton (1926–1995) |editor=Ross Emmett |year=2006 |isbn=1843711125[/tpl][ref]The following sources identify Rothbard as an economist, philosopher, political theorist, Austrian economist, and movement-builder, among other things:
A heterodox economist,Powell, Benjamin and Stringham, Peter (September 13, 2010). "Economics in Defense of Liberty: The Contribution of Murray Rothbard." Social Science Research Network. Authors describe Rothbard as a "heterodox political economist" far out of the mainstream, who nonetheless was a charismatic figure who caught the attention and provoked responses from the mainstream.Hoppe, Hans Hermann (n.d.). "Austrian Method, Praxeology I." Mises.org. Professor Hoppe notes that Rothbard approached economics from a Misesian perspective which, per Hoppe, is regarded as "dogmatic and unscientific" (i.e. heterodox) by all other economists. Rothbard refused to publish in academic journals. According to economist Jeff Herbener, who calls Rothbard his friend and "intellectual mentor", Rothbard received "only ostracism" from mainstream academia.Herbener, J. (1995). L. Rockwell (Ed.), Murray Rothbard, In Memoriam. Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute. p.87 Rothbard rejected mainstream economic methodologies and instead embraced praxeology. To promote his economic and political ideas, Rothbard joined Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. and Burton Blumert in 1982 to establish the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Alabama.

==Life and work==

===Education===

Murray Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants who had immigrated to the U.S. from Poland and Russia respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mises.org/etexts/hhhonmnr.asp |title=Murray N. Rothbard: Economics, Science, and Liberty |first=Hans-Hermann |last=Hoppe |year=1999 |publisher=The Ludwig von Mises Institute[/tpl] Reprinted from 15 Great Austrian Economists, edited by Randall G. Holcombe.  Rothbard was born in the Bronx, but the family moved to a rent-controlled apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he attended Birch Wathen, a private school on the Upper East Side.[tpl]cite web|last=Flood|first=Anthony|title=Murray Newton Rothbard:  Notes toward a Biography|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/murrayrothbardbio.htm|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|date=March 2014[/tpl] According to Rothbard, Birch Wathen gave tuition subsidies to middle-class boys such as himself in order to maintain gender balance in the school. Local families tended to send their sons to other, more prestigious schools. Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the "debasing and egalitarian public school system" he had previously attended in the Bronx.[tpl]cite web|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=Life on the Old Right|url=http://archive-com.com/page/486945/2012-10-20/http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard45.html|publisher=Lewrockwell.com|accessdate=19 November 2013[/tpl]
Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a "right-winger" (adherent of the "Old Right") among friends and neighbors who were "communists or fellow-travelers."  Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property, and "a determination to rise by one's own merits". To Rothbard "all socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent."
He attended Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate.[tpl]rp|pages=43–44[/tpl]French, Doug (2010-12-27) Burns Diary Exposes the Myth of Fed Independence, Mises Institute Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.[tpl]rp|page=4[/tpl]
During the 1940s Rothbard became acquainted with Frank Chodorov and read widely in libertarian-orented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken and others, as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises[tpl]rp|page=46[/tpl] In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School, Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, Human Action. Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote various "right-wing" ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s.David Gordon, (editor), Strictly Confidential: The Private Volker Fund Memos of Murray N. Rothbard, 2010; Full text reprint Quote from Rothbard: "The Volker Fund concept was to find and grant research funds to hosts of libertarian and right-wing scholars and to draw these scholars together via seminars, conferences, etc." The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain Human Action in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a "senior analyst."[tpl]rp|page=54[/tpl] As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book Man, Economy, and State, published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.[tpl]cite book |last=Gordon |first=David |authorlink=David Gordon (philosopher) |title=The Essential Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Alabama |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-933550-10-7 |oclc=123960448 |url=http://library.mises.org/books/David%20Gordon/The%20Essential%20Rothbard.pdf[/tpl][tpl]rp|page=14[/tpl]

===Marriage, employment and activism===

In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928–1999), whom he called Joey.[tpl]rp|page=124[/tpl] JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his "Rothbard Salon".  They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her "the indispensable framework" behind his life and achievements.  According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage.Scott Sublett, "Libertarians' Storied Guru," Washington Times, 30 July 1987 The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as "Marxist." However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.
Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986.Peter G. Klein, Editor, F. A. Hayek, The Fortunes of Liberalism: Essays on Austrian Economics and the Ideal of Freedom, University of Chicago Press, 2012, p. 54, ISBN 0226321169 Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Butt Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman.Rockwell, Llewellyn H (May 31, 2007). "Three National Treasures."

According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a "fringe existence" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of "students and disciples" through his writings, thereby becoming "the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement."Hoppe, Hans-Hermann (1999). "MURRAY N. ROTHBARD:  ECONOMICS, SCIENCE, AND LIBERTY." Mises.org Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995.

After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. "...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him." She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. "Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day."[tpl]cite book|last=Rothbard|first=JoAnn|title=Murray Rothbard, In Memoriam|publisher=von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, AL|page=vii–ix|url=http://mises.org/books/memoriam.pdf[/tpl] Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of god,Sciabarra, Chris (2000).

"Obviously, I could not be myself, both as a libertarian and as an atheist." However, he continued, "the left-libertarian hostility to religion, based as it is on ignorance and the bitterness of "aging adolescent rebels against bourgeois America", is "monstrous."[/tpl] In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.[tpl]cite book |first1=Gerard |last1=Casey |authorlink=Gerard Casey (philosopher) |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Meadowcroft |year=2010 |title=Murray Rothbard |series=Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers |volume=15 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |isbn=978-1-4411-4209-2 |page=15[/tpl] The New York Times obituary called Rothbard "an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention."David Stout, Obituary: Murray N.

===Conflict with Ayn Rand===

In 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises' seminar, joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism. He soon parted from her, writing, among other things, that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed but similar to those of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Herbert Spencer.[tpl]rp|pages=109–114[/tpl] In 1958, after the publication of her novel, Atlas Shrugged, Rothbard wrote a "fan letter" to Rand, calling her book "an infinite treasure house," and "not merely the greatest novel ever written, but one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction." He also wrote that "you introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy," prompting him to learn "the glorious natural rights tradition."[tpl]rp|pages=121, 132–134[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Burns|first=Jennifer|title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Univ.

He rejoined her circle for a few months, but soon broke with Rand over various differences, including his defense of anarchism. Later, Rothbard ridiculed Rand's circle in his play Mozart Was a Red and essay, "The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult."[tpl]rp|page=184[/tpl]Murray Rothbard play Mozart was a Red, early 1960s, at LewRockwell.com.Rothbard, Murray (1972).
