CATEGORIES: Zygophyllaceae, Rosid families

Zygophyllaceae [tpl]IPAc-en|,|z|eye|g|o-|f|i-|'|l|ay|s|ee|ay[/tpl] is a family of flowering plants that contain the bean-caper and caltrop.  The family includes around 285 species in 22 genera.
In the APG III system of classification, the families Zygophyllaceae and Krameriaceae compose the order Zygophyllales. In the previous version of their classification system, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group had included the option of placing Krameria within Zygophyllaceae. 
Zygophyllaceae are divided into five subfamilies. A molecular phylogeny of the family was published in 2000. Phylogenies of groups within the family have also been published. A phylogeny of the southern African species of Zygophyllum was published in 2008.
Peganum was in Zygophyllaceae before being moved to the newly created family Nitrariaceae.
King Clone, a Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in California, is believed to be the oldest living organism.
