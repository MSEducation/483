Jon-Marc McDonald (born September 20, 1976) is an American born blogger, publicist, political activist and baker. McDonald gained national attention when, at the age of 21, he simultaneously came out of the closet as a gay man and resigned as campaign manager from the 1998 United States congressional campaign of conservative Republican candidate Brian Babin.  McDonald went on to work in communications for Barnes & Noble and then as the Corporate Communications and Marketing Officer of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. Currently McDonald owns and maintains a website devoted to baking  that has received widespread media attention. He also writes a political blog that was transformed in late 2008 into an online diary of McDonald’s daily journey since learning that his partner of eight years, to whom McDonald was joined in a Civil Union, was thought to be in the final stages of AIDS. Spotting Love, a play based upon the diary, premiered as part of New York University's 2010 Creating Original Work season and is currently being adapted into a screenplay. McDonald currently serves as the publicist for the estate of Rue McClanahan.

McDonald writes of his college years "Baylor is a really conservative school in a really conservative town in a really conservative state. And I was doing my best at pretending to be a really conservative student with a really conservative girlfriend studying really conservative things. But I had a secret".[tpl]citation |title=John McDaniel, Jannette Barber and Dreams of Another Time and Place |url=http://www.rooftopscreaming.com/2008/10/john-mcdaniel-janette-barber-and-dreams.html |date=2 October 2008 |periodical=Screaming from the Rooftop |accessdate=2008-10-23 |postscript= [/tpl]

==Political controversy==

At the age of 21, McDonald  resigned from the 1998 United States congressional campaign of Brian Babin, Republican candidate of Texas's 2nd district.
After working on the campaign for three months, McDonald, who is openly gay,[tpl]citation |title=Letter to the Editor |periodical=The Advocate |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/reader+forum.-a069661483 |date=30 January 2001 |accessdate=2009-09-16 |postscript= [/tpl] abruptly stepped down, citing "irreconcilable differences" with Babin over the issue of homosexuality. According to The Dallas Morning News, McDonald announced his resignation via press release without discussing it with Babin, and his sudden departure left those in the campaign shocked and confused.[tpl]citation |title=U.S. Briefs |periodical=PlanetOut |url=http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?1998/08/25/3 |date=25 August 1998 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |postscript= [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]citation |first=G.

Baker|coauthors=Laura Vozella |title=The Insider Report: If they had made one, he would know |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&p_theme=st&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=Jon-Marc%20McDonald%20AND%20date(all)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Jon-Marc%20McDonald)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no&s_trackval= |date=30 August 1998 |periodical=Star-Telegram |accessdate=2008-10-23 |postscript= [/tpl]
McDonald generated further press coverage when he stated in an interview after his resignation that Babin thought "homosexuals should be shot", a claim Babin adamantly denied. In some press reports, Babin claimed that McDonald was not the campaign manager, but instead a "volunteer coordinator", also a paid position.[tpl]citation |first=Alan |last=Bernstein |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1998_3078530 |date=25 August 1998 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |periodical=Houston Chronicle |title=CAMPAIGN 98 / Campaign Notebook |postscript= [/tpl] One article suggested that McDonald was forced to resign by the local media threatening to "out" him.[ref]

The resignation received widespread national media attention due to the sensationalistic way it transpired.[tpl]citation |first=Thornburg |last=Ryan |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/early/archive/aug98/early0825.htm |date=25 August 1998 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |periodical=The Washington Post |title=GOP Aide Resigns From Texas Campaign Over Boss's Views on Gays |postscript= [/tpl]
McDonald's account of the resignation varies somewhat from the reported accounts. On his political website, Screaming from the Rooftop, McDonald recalls the resignation by cryptically writing in his blog "...after a series of events I resigned from the campaign". Later in the same post McDonald claims that he was "...the youngest campaign manager working on a federal level campaign" in the 1998 United States midterm election cycle and describes his motivation for originally taking the job by writing that he "decided to briefly return to the closet in exchange for the superficial satisfaction of doing something that no one else his age was doing".[tpl]citation |url=http://www.rooftopscreaming.com/2008/09/i-was-mark-buse.html |title=I was Mark Buse |periodical=Screaming from the Rooftop |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |postscript= [/tpl]

==Post political career==

After his resignation McDonald returned to Washington, D.C., where he lived prior to the campaign. In 2001, McDonald moved to New York City where he worked in communications for the book retailer Barnes & Noble before being hired as the Corporate Communications and Marketing Director for the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).[tpl]citation |url=http://www.prweekus.com/McDonald-to-push-HKTDCs-message/article/41711/ |title=McDonald to push HKTDC's message |first=Robin |last=Londner |date=11 June 2001 |periodical=PR Week |accessdate=2008-10-22 |postscript= [/tpl] On September 8, 2001 McDonald produced a fashion show featuring Hong Kong designers at New York Fashion Week for the HKTDC.[tpl]citation |periodical=Fashion Windows |title=Asian Chic at Fashion Week |url=http://www.fashionwindows.com/fashion/hk/asian_chic.asp |first=Jenny |last=Bailly |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=2008-10-22 |postscript= [/tpl][tpl]citation |periodical=BizBash New York |title=Party Reports: 09.03.01 to 09.09.01 |url=http://www.bizbash.com/newyork/content/editorial/e1426.php |first= |last= |date=3 September 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |postscript= [/tpl]
In 2006, McDonald began Bake It Til You Make It (BITYMI), a culinary multimedia website that, according to the site's "About" page, is "a journey through the culinary world with some political and social commentary along the way".[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] BITYMI also features many videos starring McDonald, four of which are featured as favorites of Bon Appetit.[tpl]cite web| last = | first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = Bon Appetit Favorites|work =| publisher =Condé Nast Publications | url = http://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-10-22 [/tpl] McDonald is a self-taught baker.

But what I appreciate most about him is that he’s a seriously good baker who takes himself and his trade lightly".[tpl]citation|url=http://badgerherald.com/blogs/arts/simplysumptuous/2009/05/27/epic_fail_sarah_not_.php |title=Epic Fail: Sarah (not Sandra) Bernhardt Cookies |first=Allie |last=Demet |date=27 May 2009 |periodical=The Badger Herald |accessdate=2009-05-30|postscript= [/tpl]

The song was written specifically for the fundraiser by Henry Krieger and Bill Russell  [tpl]citation |url=http://www.bakeittilyoumakeit.com/the_red_bucket_diaries/2008/08/when-you-wish-u.html |title=When You Wish Upon A Frog |periodical=Bake It Til You Make It |accessdate=2009-12-18 |postscript= [/tpl][tpl]citation |first= |last= |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/9/5/63752/56181 |periodical=Daily Kos |title=Hear 36+ Hours of Obama-Themed Original Music (650+ Songs)|date=5 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |postscript=  [/tpl]
In late December 2008 McDonald began a series entitled Angels I Don’t See on his blog, Screaming From the Rooftop.

McDonald learned of his partners status on Christmas Eve, 2008 while at his partner's bedside at the hospital, a revelation that his partner kept from McDonald for many months.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.rooftopscreaming.com/2008/12/angels-i-dont-see-parts-i-ii-iii-iv.html |title=Angels I Don't See |periodical=Screaming from the Rooftop |accessdate=2009-02-02 |postscript= [/tpl]
McDonald writes of the sudden and rapid deterioration of his partner that he was "watching the love of his life waste away from the plague in the supposed non-plague years".[tpl]citation |url=http://www.rooftopscreaming.com/2008/12/angels-i-dont-see-parts-i-ii-iii-iv.html |title=Angels I Don't See, PART XVIII |periodical=Screaming from the Rooftop |accessdate=2009-05-30 |postscript= [/tpl] McDonald's brother, Grant McDonald,then a junior at New York University's (NYU) Playwrights Horizons Theater School, adapted the writing for the stage and a 45 minute original production, entitled Spotting Love, premiered as part of NYU's 2010 Creating Original Work season and is currently being adapted into a screenplay.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.rescueagreement.com/#!__productions |title=Rescue Agreement Theatre |periodical=Rescue Agreement Theatre |accessdate=2011-06-20 |postscript= [/tpl][ref]

On January 7, 2011 McDonald posted that he would lead the publicity and marketing efforts on behalf of friend Michael J. La Rue and the estate of Rue McClanahan for ten auctions to be held throughout the United States to sell McClanahan’s belongings as, according to McDonald, was McClanahan’s wish. In addition McDonald will assist with the publicity for a documentary about the actress, release date unknown.[tpl]citation |first=Jon-Marc |last=McDonald |url=http://www.rooftopscreaming.com/2011/01/on-dreams-fulfilled-my-lifetime-with.html |periodical=Screaming from the Rooftop |title=On Dreams Fulfilled: My Lifetime with Rue McClanahan |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |postscript= [/tpl]
