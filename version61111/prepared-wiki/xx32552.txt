[[List of Puerto Ricans]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of people by nationality, Lists of people from Puerto Rico, Lists of American people

This is a list of notable Puerto Ricans[tpl]efn|[tpl]dynamic list[/tpl][/tpl] which includes people who were born in Puerto Rico, people who are of full or partial Puerto Rican ancestry, and some long-term continental American and other residents and/or immigrants of other ethnic heritages who have made Puerto Rico their home, and who are recognized for their life and/or work.
The list is divided into categories and, in some cases, sub-categories, which best describe the field for which the subject is most noted. Some categories such as "Actors, actresses, comedians and directors" are relative since a subject who is a comedian may also be an actor or director. In some cases a subject may be notable in more than one field such as Luis A. Ferré who is notable as a former "governor" and as an "industrialist". However, the custom is to place the subject's name under the category for which he/she is most noted.
