==Background==

In 2009, vocalist Perry Farrell stated that "the box set was supposed to be released two years ago. It just took so long. We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record, and it took that long to get it co-ordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was just kind of a happenstance that we were together at this time. When Rhino saw that we were together they thought, 'Let’s just really work day and night and get the thing out.'"[tpl]cite web|last=Slevin|first=Patrick|title=Interview with Perry Farrell of Jane’s Addiction|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/05/29/interview-with-perry-farrell-of-janes-addiction/2/|publisher=The Aquarian Weekly[/tpl]
