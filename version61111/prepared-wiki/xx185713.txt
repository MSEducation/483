CATEGORIES: Experimental cancer drugs

CRLX101 is a novel approach to cancer chemotherapy that is under investigation in human trials. It is an example of a nanomedicine.
The agent represents a nanoparticle conjugate that consists of a drug delivery molecule, namely a cyclodextrin-based polymer (CDP) and an anti-cancer compound (camptothecin). It was developed by Mark E. Davis, professor of Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and associates at Insert Therapeutics, Inc., now Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc., hence the original name "IT-101". Its novel delivery mode allows the agent, and thus the toxic anti-cancer component, to be preferentially accumulated in cancer tissue. In turn, toxic side effect are expected to be reduced. The technology was licensed by Calando and Caltech to Cerulean Pharma Inc., in June, 2009.

==Rationale==

Camptothecin (CPT), an alkaloid extract with poor water solubility from plants such as camptotheca acuminata, exhibits anti-cancer activity possibly due, at least in part, by the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I resulting in cell death. In CRLX101, CPT is linked covalently through a glycine link to the linear copolymer CDP, which in turn consists of alternating subunits of beta-cyclodextrin and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The CRLX101 nanoparticle is water soluble. After intravenous injection, active CPT is slowly released as the linkage is hydrolysed. The size of the nanoparticle (20-50 nm in diameter) facilitates its extravasation in the more leaky vessels of tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect and as a result, the anticancer drug is enhanced and retained in the tumor tissue.

==Animal studies==

CRLX101 (formerly IT-101) was studied in mouse xenografts using different cancer models and showed good tolerability and anti-cancer effectiveness in a variety of tumors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schluep T, Hwang J, Cheng J, Heidel JD, Bartlett DW, Hollister B, Davis ME | title = Preclinical efficacy of the camptothecin-polymer conjugate IT-101 in multiple cancer models | journal = Clin.

The data also show that active camptothecin is released from the conjugate within the tumor for an extended period of time. These effects likely play a significant role in the enhanced antitumor activity of IT-101 when compared to CPT alone or irinotecan.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schluep T, Cheng J, Khin KT, Davis ME | title = Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the camptothecin-polymer conjugate IT-101 in rats and tumor-bearing mice | journal = Cancer Chemother.

The calculated tumor vascular permeability indicates that the majority of nanoparticles stay intact in circulation and do not disassemble into individual polymer strands. A key assumption to modeling the tumor dynamics is that there is a "sink" for the nanoparticles within the tumor. Histological measurements using confocal microscopy show that IT-101 localizes within tumor cells and provides the sink in the tumor for the nanoparticles.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schluep T, Hwang J, Hildebrandt IJ, Czernin J, Choi CH, Alabi CA, Mack BC, Davis ME | title = Pharmacokinetics and tumor dynamics of the nanoparticle IT-101 from PET imaging and tumor histological measurements | journal = Proc.

==Alternate drug name==

CRLX101 was originally named "IT-101" and was changed to CRLX101 after licensing to Cerulean Pharma Inc. CRLX101 is the official name in clinical trials.
