==Media career==

Chapman, after decades of bounty hunting, was featured on Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. This led him and the show's production company to do a spin off about his work in capturing bail fugitives. In particular Chapman's efforts in hunting down Max Factor cosmetics heir Andrew Luster, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

===Dog the Bounty Hunter===

After Luster's jailing, Chapman was interviewed for the August 28, 2003 episode of the truTV television series Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice. By now Chapman's profile had come to the attention of the American public. It was during this time A&E decided to create an ongoing reality series around his bounty hunting job. On August 30, 2004, the first series of Dog the Bounty Hunter made its television debut. It was cancelled after 8 seasons in 2012.

==Racism allegations==

In early October 2007, Chapman gained negative public attention after a private phone conversation between him and his son, Tucker, was leaked to the media. The conversation was about the relationship his son was having with a black girl. Chapman was heard to be angry and used the word "nigger" in the recording. Once the tape was made public, A&E announced it was suspending production of Chapman's TV series pending an investigation.[tpl]cite news | url = | title = A&E Suspends Production on "Dog the Bounty Hunter" | date = 2007-10-31 | publisher = TMZ [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b56603_Dog_N-Bombs_Himself_into_Hiatus.html | title = Dog N-Bombs Himself into Hiatus | date = 2007-10-31 | publisher = E!

[tpl]cite news | url = | title = A&E cancels Dog's show | date = 2007-11-02 | publisher = Honolulu Star-Bulletin[/tpl]
On December 21, 2007, Roy Innis, the chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, one of the first to call the A&E network to have the show taken off the air met with Alicia Colon of the New York Sun and Chapman. Later Innis said, "After meeting with him and his wife, Beth, and hearing his side of the story, we realized that the controversy had unjustly spiraled out of control without context. Duane has taken ownership of the damage of his words and has taken on the responsibility of being a racial healer for our country... I have been with this man several times and had extensive dialogues with him. I consider him and his wife good friends. Duane is a changed man and has a higher purpose. Popular television is a wasteland of meaningless titillation and degradation. The Dog's potential to take his celebrity and turn it into something redeeming for our culture and society is immense. It is for these reasons that we want his television show back on the air."[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nysun.com/new-york/out-of-the-dog-house/68487/ | title = Out Of the 'Dog' House | date = 2007-12-21 | author = Colon, Alicia | publisher=The New York Sun |accessdate=2008-01-11[/tpl]
On February 19, 2008, A&E announced that Chapman's TV show would return to production.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSSP8436520080220 | work=Reuters | title=Bounty Hunter "Dog" to return to the air | date=February 20, 2008[/tpl]

==Capture of Andrew Luster==

On June 18, 2003, Chapman made international news by capturing Andrew Luster, who had fled the United States in the middle of his trial on charges of drugging and raping a number of women. He had been convicted in absentia on 86 counts including multiple rape charges connected to assaults in 1996, 1997 and 2000.trial must go on: Conviction in absentia, Court TV news, Updated June 18, 2003, 7:16 p.m. ET Chapman was assisted by his "hunt team", consisting of his son Leland and Tim Chapman. The three bounty hunters captured Luster in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he had been living under an assumed name. On their way to California, while still in Mexico, they were pulled over by Mexican police, and all four of them were jailed. Once the authorities confirmed Luster's identity, he was sent to California to face his 124 year sentence.
Chapman and his team, still in the Mexican jail, were initially denied bail, but after Beth alerted the media and aroused public opinion in the United States, they were granted bail. Once out of jail on bail, they followed their attorney's advice and fled the jurisdiction, thereby becoming international bail-jumpers. On September 14, 2006, days before the expiration of the statute of limitations, Chapman, along with his son Leland Chapman and associate Tim Chapman, were arrested by United States Marshals and jailed in Honolulu on behalf of the Mexican government.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = Bounty hunter Duane "Dog" Chapman arrested | agency = Associated Press |date= 2006-09-14 | accessdate = 2006-09-14 [/tpl]  Mexican authorities had charged all three with deprivation of liberty, involving the 2003 arrest of Andrew Luster, because bounty hunting is illegal in Mexico. Because they did not obtain permission to leave the country while out on bail in 2003, the Mexican Government declared Duane, Leland and Tim Chapman fugitives from justice and tried to get them extradited to Mexico for sentencing. After spending one night in the federal detention center in Honolulu, Chapman told reporters: "The federal marshals treated us with great respect. But let me tell you, you never want to go to a federal prison, because it's terrible."[tpl]cite news | title =Duane 'Dog' Chapman faces electric cuff after being collared| publisher =Boston Herald|date=2006-09-18 | url = | accessdate =2006-09-19 [/tpl]
The next day, September 15, 2006, Chapman appeared in a packed Honolulu courtroom with his ankles shackled. Although the judge agreed that the men were not a significant flight risk, he ordered that each wear an electronic monitoring device around the ankle.  The three men were released on bail ($300,000 for Duane Chapman, $100,000 each for Leland Chapman and Tim Chapman). They were also ordered to wear an electronic ankle bracelet for house arrest.[tpl]cite news | last =Pereira | first =Andrew | title =Duane | publisher =KHON-TV|date=2006-09-15 | url = | accessdate =2006-09-19 [/tpl] Chapman's lead attorney, Brook Hart, reportedly planned to argue that although the charge Chapman faced is a misdemeanor in Mexico[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl], when translated into English it became a felony (kidnapping) under American law. Mexican authorities dismissed Hart's claim as the desperate efforts of an American lawyer trying to free his client. They insisted that Chapman had, in fact, been charged with a felony. An extradition hearing was set for November 16, 2006.
Chapman has speculated that his arrest was due in part to a possible prisoner exchange agreement between the Mexican and American authorities. According to Chapman, the federal agents 'sold him out', by trading him in for a convicted Mexican drug lord.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214484,00.html | title = Duane 'Dog' Chapman Says Feds Sold Him Out to Mexico in Exchange for Drug Lord |date= 2006-09-16|publisher = Fox News | accessdate = 2010-10-11 | deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Duane, Leland, and Tim had their ankle bracelets removed so they could work.[tpl]cite news | title= Duane 'Dog' Chapman Released From Ankle Bracelet | url= | agency=Associated Press | date=2007-09-29 | accessdate=2007-11-01 [/tpl] On October 11, 2006, reports surfaced of an open letter dated September 26, 2006, sent on Chapman's behalf by 29 Republican Congressmen to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  The letter stated the authors' opposition to Chapman's extradition and requested that Rice deny Mexico's request for same.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = Congressmen ask Rice to keep 'Dog The Bounty Hunter' in U.S. |date= 2006-09-16 | publisher = WBIR|accessdate = 2006-10-11[/tpl] Subsequently on October 20, 2006, lawyers for Chapman said that the Mexican federal court had granted them an order that halted the criminal case against the bounty hunter until further evidence and witness testimony were gathered.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = TV bounty hunter Duane 'Dog' Chapman grabs a legal victory in Mexico |date= 2006-10-20|publisher = MSN | accessdate = 2006-10-20[/tpl] A court hearing was held on December 23, 2006. The original hearing was postponed because a report from a lower court was not yet received. The court heard both sides of the story, and then decided to recess. Then court proceedings started on January 16, 2007 and the court had up to Tuesday, February 6, 2007 but the deadline was extended.
On February 16, 2007, a Mexican Federal court ruled that there was no reason not to try him on the charge of deprivation of liberty in Mexico.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = 'Dog' loses extradition battle | date= 2007-02-16 | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2007-02-16[/tpl] In response, on February 23, Hawaii State Representatives Gene Ward, Karen Awana, Rida Cabanilla, Lynn Finnegan, Barbara Marumoto, Colleen Meyer, Kymberly Pine, Joe Bertram, Ken Ito, Marylin Lee, and John Mizuno introduced 'House Concurrent Resolution 50', "Requesting the President of Mexico and the Second District Court of Guadalajara to drop extradition charges against TV Bounty Hunter, Duane 'Dog' Chapman".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2007/bills/HCR50_HD1_.htm | title = HCR50 | date = 2007-02-23 | publisher = Hawaii State Legislature | accessdate = 2010-10-11[/tpl] The resolution was passed by the International Affairs committee on March 7.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = Hawaii Passes Resolution Supporting 'Dog' Chapman | date = 2007-03-07 | publisher = The Hawaii Channel | accessdate = 2007-03-07[/tpl]
During this time, Chapman, along with his new attorney, William C. Bollard, appeared on numerous media shows. Some of these include: Larry King Live, Greta Van Susteren, Mark and Mercedez Morning Show on Mix 94.1 KMXB in Las Vegas, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet on WFLD, Fox 6 News San Diego, The Glenn Beck Program, and THE 9 on Yahoo!. Honolulu news outlet KHNL reported on August 1, 2007 that the arrest warrant issued for Chapman and his associates might be invalidated, as a Mexican court had found that the statute of limitations regarding the arrest had expired.  The 15-page legal order was released in Spanish and was translated and verified for legal acuity.[tpl]cite news | url =  | title = Mexican Case Against Dog Chapman Could Be Dismissed | date = 2007-08-01 | publisher = KHNL | accessdate = 2007-08-01[/tpl] On September 29, 2006, Chapman received permission to have the electronic monitoring device removed temporarily  so that he could travel to the East Coast for previously planned appearances.

The order effectively cancelled all pending charges. The prosecution appealed the ruling; this is standard practice in Mexico, according to A&E.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1338674.php/Dog_the_Bounty_Hunter_s_Mexico_Case_latest_hurdle | title = Dog the Bounty Hunter's Mexico Case, latest hurdle | date = 2007-08-04 | publisher = Monsters & Critics.Com | accessdate = 2010-10-13[/tpl] On November 5, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Kurren dismissed the extradition attempt, saying that even though the cases were appealed, the trio are no longer charged with any crimes.
