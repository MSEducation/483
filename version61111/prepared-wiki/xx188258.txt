==Background==

Ian and Lorraine Ashley, Liam's parents, pressed criminal charges against their son after he used his mother's car without permission. The Ashleys denied bail so that their son would be sent to prison. They wished to correct the boy's behaviour, and prevent additional "minor misdemeanours."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10398440 |title=Justice system last resort for parents of murdered teenager |date=28 August 2006 |agency=NZPA |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl] Liam had previously experienced "minor trouble" with New Zealand law, and his parents believed that the prison system would be the safest place for him."Dead teen "gentle and kind"."

==Murder==

The prison authorities placed Ashley in one of four compartments of a prison van operated by Chubb Security, a company operating under contract with New Zealand officials.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4187501a11.html |title=Chubb guards investigated over missing $200,000 |date=2 September 2007 |agency=NZPA |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl] The van was scheduled to transport the prisoners from North Shore District Court to Auckland Central Remand Prison at Mt Eden. Ashley shared the compartment with two other men, one of whom, George Baker, was classified as a dangerous criminal. Baker attacked Ashley, strangling and stomping on the boy. The victim sustained severe brain injuries. The following day, August 25, at 10:30, his family chose to remove Ashley from life support; Liam Ashley died at 10:45.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4500316a10.html |title=Waist restraints for prisoners introduced |date=28 April 2008 |agency=NZPA |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/488120/1013671 |title=Grieving mothers condemn Corrections |date=6 March 2007 |work=One News |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl]

Chubb, the security company that operated the van, faced criticism in the aftermath of the attack. In June 2007 the company announced that it no longer wished to transport prisoners as contracted with New Zealand authorities.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Video/Chubb-security-wants-out-of-prisoner-transport-contract/tabid/303/articleID/28698/cat/100/Default.aspx |title=Chubb security wants out of prisoner transport contract - Video |work=3 News |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl]
In 2007, John Belgrave, New Zealand Chief Ombudsman, and Mel Smith, the ombudsman of the  Corrections Department, conducted an inquiry into the department's policy for transporting prisoners."Report into Liam Ashley's murder to be released today." TV3. Belgrave described the Corrections' prisoner transport policies as "inhumane", and ordered a review of the system.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4500316a11.html |title=Waist restraints for prisoners introduced |date=28 April 2008 |agency=NZPA |work=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl] After publication of the report, Simon Power, a Justice & Corrections spokesman, asked O'Connor to resign due to the shortcomings in his department, though he stopped short of saying that O'Connor was directly responsible for Ashley's death. Power criticized the system for failing to keep Ashley, a first time offender, and Baker, a high-risk prisoner, separated."Report strengthens call for Minister to resign." Scoop.

In response to Ashley's death New Zealand authorities began testing waist prisoner restraints.
Following his conviction, Baker has remained in the public spotlight after several further violent incidents inside Auckland Prison. In July 2008, while returning to Auckland Prison from Auckland City Hospital after being treated for self-inflicted injuries, Baker pulled a concealed shiv on a prison officer in an attempt to escape. The prison officer received minor injuries and Baker was returned to Auckland Prison.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10520987 |title=Ashley's killer hurts guard in 'escape bid' |author=Vass, Beck |date=11 July 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=26 October 2011[/tpl] On 27 August 2009, Baker took a fellow inmate in Auckland Prison hostage with a makeshift knife and two razor blades.
