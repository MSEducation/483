Death Row Records is an American record company founded in 1991 by Tracy "The D.O.C." Lynn Curry, Andre "Dr. Dre" Young, Marion "Suge" Knight Jr. and Richard Gilbert "Dick" Griffey. It is known to have signed many popular West Coast hip hop artists such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur, The Outlawz, The Lady of Rage, MC Hammer, Young Soldierz, Sam Sneed, LBC Crew, RBX, Michel'le, Jewell, Danny Boy, DJ Quik, Nate Dogg and the rap group Tha Dogg Pound consisting of rappers Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, Soopafly and many others, also Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes of TLC although most if not all departed from the label after its demise following the murder of Shakur in 1996.
The loss of key management and talent of Death Row Records meant a decline in terms of being a powerful hip-hop record company in the industry, despite attempts from the last remaining founder and CEO at the time, Suge Knight, that included signing new talents and releasing many compilations of previously unreleased content recorded by ex-Death Row artists. The label filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and on January 15, 2009, Death Row Records was successfully auctioned to entertainment development company WIDEawake Entertainment Group, Inc. for $18 million.
Death Row has sold nearly 150 million albums worldwide, and generated close to $750 million in revenue.[tpl]cite web|title= Death Row Records History|url=http://www.deathrowrecords-uk.com/history.htm[/tpl]

==Origins and early formation==

In the late '80s, producer Andre "Dr. Dre" Young was a member of the gangsta rap group N.W.A., signed to fellow member Eric "Eazy-E" Wright's Ruthless Records. As head of production at the label, Dre produced a large number of Ruthless projects, many of them high-selling; feeling the pressures of having to produce so many acts, Dre became frustrated with Ruthless.Ruthless (Heller/Reavill, 2007) ISBN 1-4169-1794-2 After the departure of Ice Cube over financial disagreements with manager Jerry Heller,Ice Cube: Attitude (McIver, 2002) ISBN 1-86074-428-1 artist and friend The D.O.C. went over the books with a lawyer. Convinced that Heller was dishonest, they approached Young about forming a label with them, away from Heller and Eazy-E.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] Allegedly using strong-arm tactics, Knight was able to procure contracts from Eazy for The D.O.C., Dr. Dre and singer Michel'le.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dubcnn.com/interviews/eroticd-part1/ |title=Erotic D Interview- Part 1 (June 2008) |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]
Knight approached successful rapper Robert "Vanilla Ice" Van Winkle, using management connections with rapper Mario "Chocolate" Johnson, claiming Johnson had produced the song "Ice Ice Baby", and had not received royalties for the song.[tpl]cite book|last1=Sullivan|first1=Randall|title=LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3971-X|page=56[/tpl] After consulting with Alex Roberts, whom sources suggest was Suge Knight's connection to the underworld, Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking "How you doin'?" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions, including alleged attempts to lure Van Winkle into a van filled with Blood and Crips gang members, before Knight showed up at Van Winkle's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson and a member of the Los Angeles Raiders. According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied he would throw Van Winkle off unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight; Van Winkle's money helped fund Death Row Records. At one time, Death Row Records was located at the intersection of Wilshire Blvd. and San Vicente Blvd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanillaice/articles/story/5921192/to_the_extreme_and_back|title=To The Extreme and Back|accessdate=November 14, 2008|last=Fischer|first=Blair R.|date=March 12, 1998|work=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Knight was seen on several occasions leaving Alex Roberts' home in Malibu. Knight approached Michael "Harry-O" Harris, a businessman incarcerated on drug and attempted murder charges. Through David Kenner, an attorney handling Harris's appeal, Harry-O set up Godfather Entertainment, a parent company for the newly christened Death Row Records.IMDb profile

==International success and controversy==

===The Chronic===

With the help of Kenner, Knight began signing young inner-city California artists and arranged for Death Row to handle the soundtrack for the 1992 Laurence Fishburne/Jeff Goldblum film, Deep Cover. The single, "Deep Cover", established Dre as a solo artist and a young Snoop "Doggy" Dogg as his protege. Work soon began on The Chronic, Dre's solo album, which heavily featured Snoop and the rest of the label's core roster. Its singles, "Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')" and "Nuthin' but a "G" Thang", saw Dre and Snoop dissing Eazy-E and other artists at Ruthless.

Continuing to release songs on albums that dissed Dre, Eazy-E claimed the success of the album and its singles netted him nearly as much money as it did Young.

===Doggystyle===

After finding solo success, Dre began crafting Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; the process took two years. Snoop's debut was finally released in 1993 due to public demand and high pressure from retailers.

They used the music and video images of Death Row Records as examples. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===Signing Tupac and Suge Knight's rise===

By 1995, the label began to flood with Knight's cronies—friends and gang members fresh out of jail, as well as off-duty LAPD officers later implicated in the Rampart scandal working as security. Emboldened, Knight began taking more control of the label and further sought the spotlight, while Dr. Dre receded into the background, shying away from the increasingly violent atmosphere and Suge's newfound volatility. Tucker's pressure to conform extended to a joint proposal by herself and a Warner executive to set up a record label with Knight to put out content-controlled rap music, which Knight billed as a breach of contract, resulting in a switch in distribution from Time Warner to Interscope. At the '95 Source Awards, the Death Row roster's performance garnered a poor reception from the mainly east coast audience; Knight also made comments pertaining to Bad Boy Entertainment CEO Puff Daddy, sparking friction between the two labels (and, soon after, the two entire coasts). Soon Knight would sign rapper Tupac Shakur, incarcerated on a sexual abuse conviction, after agreeing to post Shakur's bail. At the same time, a rift between Michael and Lydia Harris and Suge and David Kenner began to grow, with the latter pair denying Harris's involvement in the company and refusing to take his phone calls.

===Bad Boy feud and Dr. Dre's departure===

Tupac immediately began work on his Death Row album, kicking off his tenure by insulting Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, who he accused of setting him up to be robbed and shot earlier that year, as well as Bad Boy Entertainment, Mobb Deep and Nas. Tha Dogg Pound's debut album, Dogg Food, continued the label's streak of commercial successes; its members, rappers Kurupt and Daz Dillinger, joined Shakur in ridiculing New York rappers with their single "New York, New York," featuring Snoop Dogg. The video, set in New York City, was also heightened when the set was fired upon in a driveby. After the shooting, Snoop and Dogg Pound decided to take a new turn with the video production and filmed new scenes kicking down a building in New York. Death Row's reputation began to grow as rumors began to spread in the media about the label. Suge Knight, along with other Death Row associates, reportedly beat up a music promoter associated with Bad Boy Entertainment at a Los Angeles party, and forced him to drink urine.http://www.trutv.com/crime/library/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/2b.html
Another report was that Death Row Artist, Sam Sneed, was beaten in one of the label's meetings by a group of Death Row affiliates, led by Knight and Shakur. According to Daz Dillinger, the reason this happened was because Sam Sneed had too many East Coast Rappers in his Lady Heroin music video.http://rapresearcharchive.blogspot.com/2011/01/daz-speaks-on-sam-sneed-beatdowntumor.html Disillusioned with the direction of Death Row, artists RBX and The D.O.C. chose to leave, after which Knight exercised tighter control over the rest of the roster. Dogg Food was not produced by Dr. Dre but was mixed by Dre, a further testament to Young's dwindling involvement with his own label. Though he contributed two tracks to 2Pac's All Eyez on Me, it was mostly produced by Daz and Johnny J despite Dre being nominally titled as Executive Producer. Shakur's behavior reportedly became erratic as he continued verbal wars with Mobb Deep, Nas, Biggie, The Fugees and Jay-Z. Shakur also turned on the label's co-founder and former head producer, Dr. Dre. Shakur was incensed that Dre was getting credit for producing recordings that he had little or no involvement in. In 1996, due to the infighting, Dre left Death Row to form Aftermath Entertainment. [tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

===M.C. Hammer's involvement and departure===

Suge Knight's relationship with M.C. Hammer (Stanley Kirk Burrell) dates back to 1988. With the success of Hammer's 1994 album, The Funky Headhunter (featuring Tha Dogg Pound), Hammer signed with Death Row Records by 1995, along with Snoop Dogg and his close friend, Tupac.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.daveyd.com/hammer.html|title= MC Hammer Interview - part 1|accessdate=March 20, 2009|date=June 1997|publisher = daveyd.com[/tpl] The label did not release the album of Hammer's music (titled Too Tight) while he had a career with them, although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429907/19990805/mc_hammer.jhtml|title = MC Hammer|publisher = MTV[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429908/19990421/mc_hammer.jhtml|title = MC Hammer|publisher = MTV[/tpl] However, Hammer did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song "Too Late Playa" (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy).[tpl]cite web|url=http://wn.com/2Pac__Too_Late_Playa__feat_MC_Hammer,_Big_Daddy_Kane,_Nutt-So_Danny_Boy |title=2pac Too Late Playa Feat Mc Hammer, Big Daddy Kane, Nutt-so Danny Boy |publisher=Wn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Burgess |first=Omar |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1320/title.death-row-records-the-pardon |title=Death Row Records: The Pardon | Rappers Talk Hip Hop Beef & Old School Hip Hop |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2011-05-10[/tpl] After the death of Shakur in 1996, Burrell left the record company.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.daveyd.com/hammerpt2.html|title= MC Hammer Interview - part 2|accessdate=March 20, 2009|date=June 1997|publisher = daveyd.com[/tpl] He later explained his concern about this circumstance in an interview on Trinity Broadcasting Network since he was in Las Vegas with Tupac the night of his death.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2009/03/what_had_happened_was_mc_hammer/|title = What had happened was MC Hammer|publisher = vibe.com|date=March 2009[/tpl] Hammer released 2Pac's "Unconditional Love", on his Family Affair album, in 1998.
The friendship between Hammer (played by Romany Malco), Tupac (played by Lamont Bentley) and Suge (played by Anthony Norris) were depicted in the television film, Too Legit: The MC Hammer Story (airing on VH1 in 2001).

===Tupac Shakur's murder and Suge Knight's incarceration===

Formerly a united front of artists, Death Row's roster fractured into separate camps. Daz, now head producer, worked on Snoop Dogg's second album Tha Doggfather, which featured Bad Azz and Techniec of his LBC Crew, Warren G and Nate Dogg of his group 213 and Kurupt and Daz of Tha Dogg Pound shut himself into the studio with little-known producers Hurt-M-Badd and Big "D", crafting The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory - unlike All Eyez on Me, it was devoid of high-profile Death Row guest appearances, instead showcasing Shakur's The Outlawz and Bad Azz. Knight was now barely reachable by his staff, and employees were routinely assaulted as punishment for not following orders.
During a trip to Las Vegas for a Mike Tyson fight, Shakur was interviewed on the possibility of Death Row East, an east coast branch of the record label.  It was also during this time, that Alex Roberts and David Kenner had been seen at Knights Vegas Club 662 in discussion about the possibility of having Roberts New York underworld connections help pave the way for Death Row East. Though names from Big Daddy Kane and the Wu-Tang Clan to Eric B. and K-Solo were mentioned, the label would never be formed; three days later, Knight and others were caught on surveillance camera at the MGM Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas assailing gang member Orlando Anderson who was a Southside Crip (which was rumored to provide security for Bad Boy Entertainment artists). Later that night, Shakur was shot several times while in a car Suge was driving as they headed to Knight's Vegas Club 662;[tpl]Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Who Killed Tupac Shakur?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/06/business/fi-tupac6|accessdate=2012-07-15|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 6, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=How Vegas police probe floundered in Tupac Shakur case|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fi-tupac7sep07,0,6002100.story|accessdate=8 October 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 7, 2002[/tpl] despite living several days in critical condition, the rapper died on September 13, 1996.
Shakur's "Makaveli 7 Day Theory" was released in November just one week before Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Tha Doggfather". Although both albums went to platinum sales in their first weeks on the shelves the impact on Death Row had started to mount; Knight was convicted of parole violation and sentenced to nine years' prison time, causing Interscope to drop its distribution deal with the label.Interscope Music Group – Company History. Fundinguniverse.com. Retrieved on July 11, 2011. His control over the label diminished, Nate Dogg was able to leave, followed by Snoop Dogg and Kurupt; after the release of his own and the Lady of Rage's solo albums, Daz and Rage followed suit. Daz would later return in 1999 with Big C-Style to form Dogg Pound Records only to leave again in early 2001. Kurupt returned to the label in 2002 upon Suge Knight's release from prison.

===2nd generation exodus===

Maintaining artistic control from behind bars, Knight launched smear campaigns against several of his former artists, most notably Snoop Dogg. The label supported itself with releases pulled from vaults—most successfully various posthumous 2Pac albums, along with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg re-releases and then-unreleased compilation records such as Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000 and Snoop Dogg: Dead Man Walkin. He signed new talent, including Female Rapper SKG, Crooked I, Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, Top Dogg and Tha Realest, picking up affiliates Spider Loc and Eastwood. He also appointed former Ruthless Records artist Cold 187um head producer, to oversee the 2Pac album Until the End of Time and unauthorized Dogg Pound release 2002.
Despite bad blood, Kurupt would again sign with Suge Knight in exchange for the position of Vice President, which sparked a feud between himself and former friends Daz and Snoop Dogg. Mentoring Crooked I, he began work on Against tha Grain; his verbal feud with his former partners continued from 2002 to 2005.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] TLC band member Left Eye signed with Death Row after finishing her solo deal with Arista Records who released her first album Supernova in 2001. Lopes joined to record a second solo album under the pseudonym N.I.N.A. (New Identity Not Applicable) she was also working on TLC's new album 3D. N.I.N.A. was cancelled after Lopes's death in April 2002. TLC decided to finish the album 3D because Lopes had already completed her vocals for most of the songs, it would be their last album. TLC went on hiatus in 2003 until 2008.

===Legal troubles===

Further legal troubles included Suge Knight's possible implication in the 1997 murder of Notorious B.I.G. in Los Angeles. A federal informant provided testimony that Los Angeles police officers David Mack and Rafael Perez—both implicated in the Rampart scandal—worked as security for Death Row when off-duty, and that they and Suge Knight had conspired to have Biggie killed after a party the rapper attended on the night of his murder. However, testifying in a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by B.I.G.'s mother and widow, he went back on his testimony, claiming it as hearsay.Kaufman, Gil. (June 3, 2005) MTV News. Retrieved on July 11, 2011. In the same case, a second prison informant named Kenny Boagni claimed that Mack and Perez were indeed on the label's payroll at the time.Harris, Chris.

The case was eventually declared a mistrial, and criminal investigation reopened, though a second suit has thus far brought no claims against Knight directly.
Knight was also investigated in 2005 for paying a man to punch Dr. Dre as he accepted a lifetime achievement award at the 2004 Vibe Awards; though he denies the claim, the assailant apparently told Santa Monica police that Knight offered him $5,000 for the job.Suge Knight News – Yahoo! Music. Music.yahoo.com (January 18, 2005). Retrieved on July 11, 2011. A lawsuit was brought against him by Lydia Harris, resulting in a court order to pay her $107 million in profits owed after she'd been forced from the label. The judgment resulted in Knight declaring bankruptcy in 2006, after turning down Warner Music Group's offer to buy at $25 million, and made to auction off all assets of the label.Kuperstein, Slava.

2006 also saw Dr. Dre bring a lawsuit against the label demanding rights to The Chronic, by reason of unpaid royalties. By 2008, it was reported separately that Susan Berg, president of Global Music Group, bid on the label at auction for $24 million, and that Warner had topped her bid by reiterating its $25 million offer, but neither sale went through;Burgess, Omar.

Since the acquisition, the company has continued to release material from its vast archives of materials acquired in the sale. Noteworthy releases include previously commercially unreleased material from such artists as Snoop Dogg, Kurrupt, Danny Boy, Crooked I, Sam Sneed, LBC Crew and O.F.T.B. Since the acquisition of the material, Money Mafia-Deathrow Entertainment, under the management of WIDEawake Entertainment Group Inc., has made many positive steps towards improving the image of Death Row by making good on its promise to make royalty payments to many of the various artists, producers, and songwriters with commercially released material under the label.  On "Record Store Day" April 18, 2012, the label has issued a free Death Row "Record Store Day" CD sampler, which included Petey Pablo's "Pay for the Pussy," Crooked I's "Hoodstar," and Danny Boy's "Do What You Do."
