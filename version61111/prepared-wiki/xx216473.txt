Ralph Zurmühle (or Zurmuhle), Swiss composer and pianist, discovered his natural talent for the piano at the early age of five. He fostered it over decades with jazz and classical music studies.
Ralph's 4 CDs, composed mostly for piano, have been met with international critical acclaim. His first CD Between was released in 2000, Communion followed in 2003 and Our Mother in 2007. His most recent CD eQuinox, released in 2011, is produced and distributed by Valley Entertainment, New York. 
Compositions from these CDs have been featured in films and multi-media projects, both in the U.S. and in Europe. For more than twenty years Ralph has been scoring music for film and performing solo piano concerts, mostly playing his own repertoire. 
"25 years after the glory days of the solo piano genre sparked by artists like Keith Jarrett and George Winston, the solo piano album remains an elusive undertaking: very easy to do - very hard to do well. Swiss pianist Ralph Zurmühle is one of those rare artists, who does it sublimely well, with great sensitivity to touch, melody, and ambience. Listen and you will find yourself in the hands of a master." - Stephen Hill, Producer of Hearts of Space Radio
