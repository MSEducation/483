''' 
Charles Spear (May 1, 1803 â€“ April 13, 1863)  was a Universalist minister who advocated for the abolishment of the death penalty, supported prison reform, and founded the newspaper Prisoner's Friend. The Prisoner's Friend was advertized as "the only journal known in the world that is wholly devoted to the abolition of capital punishment and the reformation of the criminal."  
Charles was born in Boston in May 1, 1803 and was a member of the Universalist Church of America. Charles Spear was the younger brother of John Murray Spear. Charles studied for the Universalist ministry in Roxbury, Massachusetts. 
Later in life he began to criticize the death penalty. In 1830 he fought against the death penalty, the harsh treatment of prisoners, the conditions of jails, and struggled for a change from the prevailing philosophy of vindication to rehabilitation.Burkart, Harold H.

Through Spear's efforts, prison conditions improved significantly, the death penalty was abolished in three states and imposed less often in others.Howe, Charles A. The Larger Faith: A Short History of American Universalism. Boston: Skinner House, 1993. Print. Page 59.
