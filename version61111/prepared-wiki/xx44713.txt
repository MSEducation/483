==Early life==

Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906 in Englewood, New Jersey.Hertog 2000, p. 50.  Her father was Dwight W. Morrow, a partner in J.P. Morgan & Co., who became United States Ambassador to Mexico and United States Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, a poet and teacher, who was active in women's education,"Anne Morrow Lindbergh Biography." Lindbergh Foundation.  Retrieved: November 17, 2011. and served as acting president of her alma mater Smith College.
Anne was the second of four children; her siblings were Elisabeth Reeve, Dwight, Jr., and Constance. The children were raised in a Calvinist household that fostered achievement.http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/12/12/reviews/991212.12eakint.html Every night, Anne's mother would read to her children for an hour. The children quickly learned to read and write, began reading to themselves, and writing poetry and diaries. Anne would later benefit from this routine, eventually publishing her later diaries to critical acclaim.Hertog 2000, p. 61.
After graduating from The Chapin School in New York City in 1924, Anne attended Smith College, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1928.Pace, Eric. "Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 94, Dies; Champion of Flight and Women's Concerns." The New York Times, February 8, 2001. Retrieved: November 17, 2011.  She received the Elizabeth Montagu Prize for her essay on women of the eighteenth century and Madame d'Houdetot, and the Mary Augusta Jordan Literary Prize for her fictional piece entitled "Lida Was Beautiful".Hertog 2000, p. 74.

==Marriage and family==

Anne and Charles Lindbergh met on December 21, 1927, in Mexico City.[ref]
Lindbergh 1971, p. 118.[/ref] Dwight Morrow—Lindbergh's financial adviser at J. P. Morgan and Co.—invited Lindbergh to Mexico in order to advance good relations between that country and the United States.Jennings and Brewster 1998, p. 420.  At the time, Anne Morrow was a shy 21-year-old senior at Smith College. Charles Lindbergh was a courageous aviator whose solo flight across the Atlantic made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world.
But the sight of the boyish aviator, who was staying with the Morrows, tugged at Anne's heartstrings. She would later write in her diary:
Anne Morrow and Charles Lindbergh were married in a private ceremony on May 27, 1929, at the home of her parents in Englewood, New Jersey."Anne Morrow Lindbergh Biography Timeline." Charles Lindbergh. Retrieved: November 17, 2011.
That year, Anne flew solo for the first time, and in 1930 became the first American woman to earn a first-class glider pilot's license. In the 1930s, Anne and Charles together explored and charted air routes between continents.Lindbergh 1935, pp. 57–59. The Lindberghs were the first to fly from Africa to South America, and explored polar air routes from North America to Asia and Europe.Hertog 2000, p. 141.
Their first child, Charles Jr, was born on Anne's 24th birthday, June 22, 1930.

==Kidnapping==

In an incident widely known as the "Lindbergh kidnapping", the Lindberghs' first child, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., was kidnapped at 20 months of age from their home in East Amwell, New Jersey outside Hopewell on March 1, 1932.

After a massive investigation, a baby's body, presumed to be that of Charles Lindbergh Jr., was discovered the following May 12, some four miles (6 km) from the Lindberghs' home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell–Mt. Rose Highway.Lyman, Lauren D. "Press Calls For Action: Hopes the Public Will Be Roused to Wipe Out a 'National Disgrace'." The New York Times, December 24, 1935, p. 1.

===Exile===

The frenzied press attention paid to the Lindberghs, particularly after the kidnapping of their son and later the trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, prompted Charles and Anne to retreat to England, to a house called Long Barn owned by Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, and later to the small island of Illiec, off the coast of Brittany in France.Winters 2006, p. 193.
While in Europe, the Lindberghs came to advocate isolationist views that led to their fall from grace in the eyes of many. In 1938, the U.S. Air Attaché in Berlin invited Charles Lindbergh to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany's Air Force. Impressed by German technology and their apparent number of aircraft, as well as influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, Lindbergh opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. 
Anne then wrote a 41-page booklet, The Wave of the Future, published in 1940, in support of her husband who was lobbying for a U.S.–German peace treaty similar to Hitler's Non-Aggression Treaty with Stalin,Plunket, Robert. "The Lives They Lived: Anne Morrow Lindbergh, B. 1906: The Heroine." The New York Times, December 30, 2001. and argued that something resembling fascism was the unfortunate "wave of the future", echoing authors such as Lawrence Dennis and later James Burnham.Lindbergh 1976, p. 224. The Roosevelt administration subsequently attacked The Wave of the Future as "the bible of every American Nazi, Fascist, Bundist and Appeaser", and the booklet became one of the most despised writings of the period.Batten, Geoffrey. "Obituary: Anne Morrow Lindbergh." The Independent, February 15, 2001.Pace, Eric.  "Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Author and Aviator, Dies at 94", The New York Times, February 8, 2001. She had also written in a letter, of Hitler, that he was "a very great man, like an inspired religious leader—and as such rather fanatical—but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power."

==Return to the U.S.==

In 1938, the Lindberghs returned to the United States. Because of his outspoken beliefs about a future war that would envelop their homeland, the antiwar America First Committee quickly adopted Charles Lindbergh as their leader in 1940.  After the attack on Pearl Harbor and Germany's declaration of war, the committee disbanded, and Charles pressed to become involved in the military, eventually finding a way to enter combat, albeit as a civilian."Charles Lindbergh in Combat, 1944." EyeWitness to History, 2006. Retrieved: July 20, 2009.Mersky 1983, p. 93.
Charles and Anne Lindbergh had five more children: sons Jon, Land and Scott, and daughters Anne and Reeve.

==Later life==

After the war, Anne and Charles wrote books that rebuilt the reputations they had gained and lost before World War II.  The publication of Gift from the Sea in 1955 earned Anne's place as "one of the leading advocates of the nascent environmental movement" and became a national best seller."Anne Morrow Lindbergh." PBS. Retrieved: November 17, 2011.
Over the course of their 45-year marriage, Charles and Anne lived in New Jersey, New York, England, France, Maine, Michigan, Connecticut, Switzerland, and Hawaii. Charles died on Maui in 1974. Anne had a three-year affair in the early 1950s with her personal doctor.Connelly, Sherryl. "HERO WORSHIP: Anne Morrow Lindbergh emerges from Lindy's shadow in new biography." New York Daily News, December 12, 1999. Retrieved: November 21, 2011.
According to Rudolf Schröck, author of Das Doppelleben des Charles A. Lindbergh (Heyne Verlag, 2005), from 1957 until his death in 1974, Charles had an affair with Brigitte Hesshaimer, a Bavarian woman 24 years his junior, that produced three children, whom he supported financially. In 2003, a spokesman for the Hesshaimer family indicated that DNA tests conducted by the University of Munich proved that Lindbergh fathered the three children. According to Schröck, Charles also had sexual relationships with Brigitte's sister Marietta, who bore him two sons, and with his former private secretary, who bore him two more children.Schröck, Rudolf.

After suffering a series of strokes in the early 1990s, which left her confused and disabled, Anne continued to live in her home in Connecticut with the assistance of round-the-clock caregivers. During a visit to her daughter Reeve's family in 1999, she came down with pneumonia, after which she went to live near Reeve in a small home built on Reeve's Vermont farm, where Anne died in 2001 at the age of 94 from another stroke. Reeve Lindbergh's book, No More Words, tells the story of her mother's last years.Lindbergh, Reeve 2002, p. 175.
