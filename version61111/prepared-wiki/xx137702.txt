[[Bladelets]]

CATEGORIES: Marine_propulsion, Archaeological artifacts

Used in centrifugal impeller terminology, bladelets are the more 'Metro' version of the common engineering description of splitters (shorter blades that do not extend into the centre of the impeller). The term is thought to have originated among the middle-upper level management at medical device engineering companies, near the turn of the millennium.
Archaeology uses the term bladelets in reference to the rockshards shaped by prehistoric peoples for use as scalpels, in darts and in compound tools.  These are small blades typically 10mm wide, approximately the size of your little finger.
