==Plot==

During the thirty-fourth week of their hit Broadway show, dancer Vicky Lane (Betty Grable) awaits the arrival of her partner, Dan Christy (John Payne), but as usual, he is late. Vicky thinks that Dan is buying her an engagement ring and is infuriated to discover that he has been on a date with socialite Marilyn Crothers. Fed up with Dan's womanizing and insensitivity, Vicky quits the show and returns to her former dancing partner and beau, Victor Prince (Cesar Romero), who is still in love with her. Three months pass as Dan sinks into a depression and cannot find a backer for his new show. His agent, the Commissioner, tells him that businessmen Bickel and Brown will back his show, but only if he can get Vicky to return. Dan is pessimistic, for Vicky and Victor are beginning a new engagement with Harry James and His Music Makers at a Lake Louise resort in the Canadian Rockies. The Commissioner tells Dan to romance Vicky so that she will come back, and not tell her about Bickel and Brown until she arrives in New York. He then asks bartender McTavish (Edward Everett Horton) to get the drunken Dan on the next plane to Lake Louise. When Dan awakens sometime later, he finds himself at the Canadian resort and learns that he has hired McTavish as his valet and Rosita Murphy (Carmen Miranda), who was working in a Detroit souvenir shop, as his secretary. He then confronts Vicky, who happily shows off the engagement ring given to her by Victor. Dan is discouraged but hits upon the scheme of making Vicky jealous by romancing Rosita. His plan appears to be working until Vicky learns the truth from Rosita, who has aroused the interest of Victor, although she prefers McTavish. Vicky's friend, Phoebe Gray, is also intrigued by McTavish, and the couples spend much time pursuing and arguing with each other. One evening, Dan barges into Vicky's room and refuses to leave when she summons Victor. Angered by Dan's presence, Victor accuses Vicky of being unfaithful, and she breaks off their engagement. Later that evening, Vicky and Dan reconcile, and he promises to be honest with her. He tries to tell her about the new show, but she rushes off to plan their departure the next morning. As she is checking out in the morning, Vicky runs into the Commissioner, and Bickel and Brown, who have just arrived and spill the beans about the show. Thinking that Dan is using her once again, Vicky runs off in tears, but the quick-thinking Rosita is able to cover up for Dan and convince Vicky that he intended to take her to California for their honeymoon. In the process, however, Bickel and Brown are lost as sponsors and Rosita must persuade McTavish to invest some of his inheritance into Vicky and Dan's new show. That accomplished, the show opens with Vicky and Dan as the star performers, supported by Harry James, Rosita and Victor, and McTavish and Phoebe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&Movie=27475|title=American Film Institute Catalog: 'Springtime in the Rockies'|date=|work=|page=American Film Institute Catalog|accessdate=March 14, 2014[/tpl]
