The song is arguably the second most popular single from the band's debut album and certainly one of their most well known songs overall. It is also one of the album's upbeat tracks while bearing an aggressive chorus. Lyrically, "The Down Town" ambiguiously details a town of drug users who are afraid of change and suppressive of the narrator. The phrase "to bring me down" is rebelliously shouted throughout the chorus. A mention of pointless and rejected concern over another person's well being is also addressed during the bridge. Given this theme of negativity, the "Down Town" song title may be intended as a double entendre or pun.

==Music video==

The "Down Town" video, directed by Lance Bangs, consists of a live concert performance. It retains the live audio and includes some notable differences from the studio recording; verse chords are used extensively in various parts, more punchy staccato is incorporated, and the first lyric of the bridge is changed to "I don't think that I should give a fuck about you." The performance lasts nearly a whole minute longer at 5:10.
