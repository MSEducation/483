Being confronted with wounded, maimed, and dying soldiers on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists, BBC, 21 May 2010. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10138849.stm — although he later switched to biomedical research.
Venter began his college career at a community college, College of San Mateo in California. He received his B.S. degree in biochemistry in 1972, and his Ph.D. degree in physiology and pharmacology in 1975, both from the University of California, San Diego. At UCSD, he studied under biochemist Nathan O.

==Career==

===Scientific discoveries===

While at the NIH, Venter learned of a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell and began to use it to identify human brain genes. The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a name coined by Anthony Kerlavage at The Institute for Genomic Research. The NIH initially led an effort to patent these gene fragments, in which Venter coincidentally and controversially became involved.[tpl]cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Leslie | date = October 11, 1991 | title = Genome patent fight erupts: an NIH plan to patent thousands of random DNA sequences will discourage industrial investment and undercut the Genome Project itself, the plan's critics charge | journal = Science | volume = 254 | issue = 5029 | pages = 184–186 | doi = 10.1126/science.1925568|bibcode = 1991Sci...254..184R [/tpl][tpl]Synthesis-inline|date=October 2009|reason=There's nothing at all "coincidental" here...[/tpl] The NIH later withdrew the patent applications, following public outcry. Subsequent court cases declared that ESTs were not directly patentable.[tpl]Cite journal | year = 2006 | journal = Harvard Law Review | volume = 119 | title = Patent Law—Utility—Federal Circuit holds that expressed sequence tags lack substantial and specific utility unless underlying gene function is identified.—In re Fisher, 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2005) | issue = 8 | pages = 2604–2611 | url = http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/june06/recent_cases/in_re_fisher.pdf[/tpl]

====Human Genome Project====

Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare. Venter believed that shotgun sequencing was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data. The method was controversial, however, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans.[tpl]Cite journal  | last = Green | first =  Philip | year = 1997 | journal = Genome Research | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Against a Whole-Genome Shotgun | pages = 410–417 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.410 | url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/7/5/410.full  | pmid = 9149937  | doi_brokendate = 2010-05-20[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=October 2009|reason=One scientist's opinion is not *most* scientists.[/tpl] Frustrated with what Venter viewed as the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome project, and unable to get funds for his ideas, he sought funding from the private sector to fund Celera Genomics.[tpl]cite book| author = Victor K. McElheny| title = Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project| year = 2010| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-04333-0 [/tpl] The goal of the company was to sequence the entire human genome and release it into the public domain for non-commercial use in much less time and for much less cost than the public human genome project. The company planned to profit from their work by creating a value-added database of genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. DNA from five demographically different individuals was used by Celera to generate the sequence of the human genome; one of the individuals was Venter himself. In 2000, Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.[tpl]cite news |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint of Life |newspaper=U.S. News and World Report |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 30, 2007[/tpl] Venter and Collins thus shared an award for "Biography of the Year" from A&E Network."[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |title=Time Magazine Dubs Montgomery County "DNA Alley" |publisher=Montgomery County, Maryland Government|date=December 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2007[/tpl]
On the 15 February 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal Nature, and was followed, one day later, by a Celera publication in Science.[tpl]Cite doi | 10.1126/science.1058040[/tpl][tpl]Cite  doi | 10.1038/35057062[/tpl] Despite some claims that shotgun sequencing was in some ways less accurate than the clone-by-clone method chosen by the Human Genome Project,[ref]
</ref> the technique became widely accepted by the scientific community.
Although Celera was originally set to sequence a composite of DNA samples, partway through the sequencing, Venter switched the samples for his own DNA.[tpl]cite news |first=Emily |last=Singer |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19328/?a=f |title=Technology Review |newspaper=Technology review |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]
After contributing to the Human Genome, and its release into the public domain, Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002.[tpl]cite news |first=Antonio |last=Regalo |title=Maverick biologist at work on next goal: creating life |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=July 24, 2005[/tpl] According to his biography, Venter was ready to leave Celera, and was fired due to conflict with the main investor, Tony White, that had existed since day one of the project. Venter writes that his main goal was always to accelerate science and thereby discovery, and he only sought help from the corporate world when he couldn't find funding in the public sector.

====Global Ocean Sampling Expedition====

The Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS) is an ocean exploration genome project with the goal of assessing the genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, Craig Venter announced the full Expedition on 4 March 2004. The project, which used Craig Venter's personal yacht, Sorcerer II, started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.[tpl]cite news |title=Yacht for Sale: Suited for Sailing, Surfing, and Seaborne Metagenomics |work=GenomeWeb.com |publisher=GenomeWeb News|author=Larkman, Kirell |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 7, 2007[/tpl]

====Synthetic genomics====

Venter is currently the president of the J. Craig Venter Institute, which conducts research in synthetic biology. In June 2005, he co-founded Synthetic Genomics, a firm dedicated to using modified microorganisms to produce clean fuels and biochemicals. In July 2009, ExxonMobil announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation biofuels.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html |title=Exxon Sinks $600M Into Algae-Based Biofuels in Major Strategy Shift|work=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|date=July 14, 2009 | first=Katie | last=Howell[/tpl]

===Individual human genome===

On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published the first complete (six-billion-letter) genome of an individual human—Venter's own DNA sequence.[tpl]cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779|author-separator=,|author2=Sutton G|author3=Ng PC|author4=Feuk L|author5=Halpern AL|display-authors=5|last6=Walenz|first6=Brian P.|last7=Axelrod|first7=Nelson|last8=Huang|first8=Jiaqi|last9=Kirkness|first9=Ewen F.[/tpl] Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry increased risk of antisocial behavior, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases.[tpl]cite book| author = Venter, J.C.| title = A Life Decoded| year = 2007| publisher = Viking| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-670-06358-1 [/tpl] This publication was especially interesting since it contained a diploid instead of a haploid genome and shows promise for personalized medicine via genotyping.[tpl]Or|date=October 2009[/tpl] This genome, dubbed HuRef by Levy and others, was a landmark accomplishment and as of mid-2010 is probably the highest quality personal genome sequence yet completed.
The Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using microfluidic Sanger sequencing, assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million DNA variations identified by genome analysis. These variants include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), block substitutions, short and large indels, and structural variations like insertions, deletions, inversions and copy number changes.
The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the NCBI and Ensembl annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the haplotype blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including dbSNP, Ensembl, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Gene Ontology (GO).
Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef contig or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

In the June 2011 issue of Men's Journal, Venter was featured as the "Survival Skills" celebrity of the month.  He shared various anecdotes, and advice, including stories of his time in Vietnam, as well as mentioning a bout with melanoma upon his back, which subsequently resulted in "giving a pound of flesh" to surgery.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Men's Journal |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/survival-skills-craig-venter |date=May 20, 2011 |author=Will Cockrell |title=Survival Skills: Craig Venter[/tpl]
Venter is mentioned, in the season finale of the first season of the science fiction series Orphan Black, a joint production of Space and BBC America. In the episode, Venter is referenced as patenting an organism and encoding a message in the genome of that organism, an act repeated by the character of Aldous Leekie (played by Matt Frewer). While the clones fear that this renders them as nothing more than property, in reality, in the United States and Canada, where the show primarily takes place, it is likely that such a patent would either be entirely unenforceable or would to the genomic sequence of the organism only, due to constitutional provisions and laws against owning human beings.
