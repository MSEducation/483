Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons and part of the Simpson family. He is voiced by actress Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Bart was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on Life in Hell but instead decided to create a new set of characters. While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name was an anagram of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family received its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and Maggie. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority. He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons, including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books; he has also inspired an entire line of merchandise. In casting, Nancy Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role. Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "¡Ay, caramba!", and "Don't have a cow, man!"
During the first two seasons of The Simpsons (1989–1991), Bart was the show's breakout character and "Bartmania" ensued. Bart Simpson T-shirts sporting various slogans and catchphrases became popular, selling at a rate of a million per day at their peak. The song "Do the Bartman" became a number one charting single and the seventh best-selling song of 1991 in the United Kingdom. Bart's rebellious attitude and pride at underachieving caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children. A T-shirt reading "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?" was banned in several public schools. Around the third season, the series started to focus more on the family as a group, although Bart remains one of the most prominent characters on the series. Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and he was named "entertainer of the year" in 1990 by Entertainment Weekly. Nancy Cartwright has won several awards for voicing Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995. In 2000, Bart, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Role in The Simpsons==

The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not age most of the time, and as such the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in "I Married Marge" (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s.[tpl]cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-26 |season=03 |number=12[/tpl] He lived with his parents in the Lower East of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that "Bart" was her first word.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10[/tpl] Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life! Now, what do you say?" In his moment of truth, Bart responded, "eat my shorts".[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's Sax |episodelink=Lisa's Sax |series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Polcino, Dominic |network=Fox |airdate=1997-10-19 |season=09 |number=03[/tpl] The episode "That '90s Show" (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.[tpl]cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episodelink=That '90s Show |series=The Simpsons |credits=Selman, Matt; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19 |number=11[/tpl]
Bart's hobbies include skateboarding, watching television (especially The Krusty the Clown Show which includes The Itchy & Scratchy Show), reading comic books (especially Radioactive Man), playing video games and generally causing mischief.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=122[/tpl] His favorite movies are Jaws and the Star Wars Trilogy. For the duration of the series, Bart has attended Springfield Elementary School and has been in Edna Krabappel's fourth grade class. While he is too young to hold a full-time job, he has had occasional part-time jobs. He works as a bartender at Fat Tony's social club in "Bart the Murderer" (season three, 1991);[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart the Murderer |episodelink=Bart the Murderer |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Rich |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-10 |season=03 |number=04[/tpl] as Krusty the Clown's assistant in "Bart Gets Famous" (season five, 1994);[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart Gets Famous |episodelink=Bart Gets Famous |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=1994-02-03 |season=05 |number=12[/tpl] as a doorman in Springfield's burlesque house, the Maison Derrière in "Bart After Dark" (season eight, 1996);[tpl]cite episode |title=Bart After Dark |episodelink=Bart After Dark |series=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Richard; Weinstein, Josh |network=Fox |airdate=1996-11-04 |season=08 |number=05[/tpl] and briefly owns his own factory in "Homer's Enemy".

==Character==

===Creation===

Matt Groening first conceived of Bart and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986, while waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction.[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |date=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. For the rebellious son, he substituted "Bart", an anagram of the word brat, for his own name, as he decided it would have been too obvious for him to have named the character 'Matt'.[tpl]cite video |people=Groening, Matt: Jean, Al |date=2007 |title=The Simpsons Movie: A Look Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=distributed by The Sun[/tpl] Bart's middle initial J is a "tribute" to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, who received their middle initial from Jay Ward.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/groening/page9.shtml |title=J is for Jay |accessdate=2008-09-21 |publisher=BBC[/tpl]Groening, Matt. (2007). Commentary for "D'oh-in in the Wind", in The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. According to the book Bart Simpson's Guide to Life, Bart's full middle name is "JoJo".[tpl]cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |year=2001 |title=Bart Simpson's Guide to Life |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=5-558-68551-4[/tpl]
Bart had originally been envisioned as "a much milder, troubled youth given to existential angst who talks to himself", but the character was changed based on Cartwright's voice acting. Groening has credited several different figures with providing inspiration for Bart: Matt Groening's older brother Mark provided much of the motivation for Bart's attitude.Groening, Matt. (2006). Commentary for "My Sister, My Sitter", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.[tpl]cite news |title=Life in Hell |work=Flux Magazine |last=Paul |first=Alan |date=1995-09-30[/tpl]Groening, Matt. (2006). Commentary for "Bart Carny", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Bart was conceived as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening describes Bart as "what would happen if Eddie Haskell Leave It to Beaver got his own show". Groening has also said that he found the premise of Dennis the Menace disappointing and was inspired to create a character who was actually a menace.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "Two Bad Neighbors", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Bart made his debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night".[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14[/tpl] In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Bart and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.

===Design===

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "Fear of Flying", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size.Silverman, David; Archer, Wes. (2004). Illustrated commentary for "Treehouse of Horror IV", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and "not thinking that Bart would eventually be drawn in color" gave him spikes which appear to be an extension of his head.Anderson, Mike B.; Groening, Matt; Michels, Pete; Smith, Yeardley. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The features of Bart's character design are generally not used in other characters; for example, no other characters in current episodes have Bart's spiky hairline, although several background characters in the first few seasons shared the trait.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "Principal Charming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
The basic rectangular shape of Bart's head is described by director Mark Kirkland as a coffee can. Homer's head is also rectangular (with a dome on top), while spheres are used for Marge, Lisa, and Maggie.Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "Summer of 4 Ft. 2", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Different animators have different methods of drawing Bart. Former director Jeffrey Lynch starts off with a box, then adds the eyes, then the mouth, then the hair spikes, ear, and then the rest of the body. Matt Groening normally starts with the eyes, then the nose, and the rest of the outline of Bart's head. Many of the animators have trouble drawing Bart's spikes evenly; one trick they use is to draw one on the right, one on the left, one in the middle, then continue to add one in the middle of the blank space until there are nine. Originally, whenever Bart was to be drawn from an angle looking down so the top of his head was seen, Groening wanted there to be spikes along the outline of his head, and in the middle as well. Instead, Wes Archer and David Silverman drew him so that there was an outline of the spikes, then just a smooth patch in the middle because "it worked graphically."Groening, Matt; Lynch, Jeffrey; Reardon, Jim; Silverman, David. (2005). Illustrated Commentary for "Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. In "The Blue and the Gray", Bart (along with Lisa and Maggie) finally questions why his hair has no visible border to separate head from hair.
In the season seven (1995) episode "Treehouse of Horror VI", Bart (along with Homer) was computer animated into a three-dimensional character for the first time for the "Homer3" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors was provided by Pacific Data Images. While designing the 3D model of the character, the animators did not know how they would show Bart's hair. They realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model.Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X. "Homer in the Third Dimension" (2005), in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.

===Voice===

Bart's voice is provided by Nancy Cartwright, who voices several other child characters on The Simpsons, including Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Kearney.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=178-179[/tpl] While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of The Tracey Ullman Show cast, the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled, "I always sounded too much like a girl. I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" Smith was given the role of Lisa instead.[tpl]cite news |title=She who laughs last |date=2007-12-08 |page=8E |work=The Daily Telegraph |last=Miranda |first=Charles[/tpl] On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of Lisa. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the "middle child" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, and clever".Cartwright, pp. 35–40 Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm |title=Bart's voice tells all |accessdate=2007-05-16 |date=2000-11-10 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Cartwright is the only one of the six main Simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=21[/tpl]
Cartwright's normal speaking voice is said to have "no obvious traces of Bart". The voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." She traditionally does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "Lisa's Wedding", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
Despite Bart's fame, Cartwright is rarely recognized in public. On occasions when she is recognized on the street and asked to perform Bart's voice in front of children, Cartwright will refuse because it "freaks them out". During the first season of The Simpsons, the Fox Network did not allow Cartwright to give interviews because they did not want to publicize that Bart was voiced by a woman.[tpl]cite news |title=Bart Simpson's secret: he's a woman |author=Bark, Ed |date=1990-07-15 |work=Ottawa Citizen[/tpl]
Until 1998, Cartwright was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was resolved and Cartwright received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 an episode. The dispute was resolved a month later,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml |title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work |accessdate=2008-09-21 |date=2004-05-01 |publisher=CBS News |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913212830/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml |archivedate=13 September 2008  |deadurl=no[/tpl] and Cartwright's pay rose to $250,000 per episode.[tpl]cite news |title=Meet the Simpsons |date=2004-05-06 |publisher=Daily Express |author=Sheridan, Peter[/tpl] After salary re-negotiations in 2008, the voice actors receive approximately $400,000 per episode.[tpl]cite news |title=Simpsons cast sign new pay deal |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-06-03 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm |accessdate=2008-10-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080914050545/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434296.stm |archivedate=14 September 2008  |deadurl=no[/tpl] Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Cartwright and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.[tpl]cite news |last=Block |first=Alex Ben |title='The Simpsons' Renewed for Two More Seasons |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-renewed-two-more-seasons-245748 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |date=October 7, 2011[/tpl]

===Hallmarks===

In the opening sequence of many Simpsons episodes, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the "chalkboard gag".[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=71[/tpl] Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as "The First Amendment does not cover burping",[tpl]cite episode |title=Lemon of Troy |episodelink=Lemon of Troy |series=The Simpsons |credits=Forrester, Brent; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-14 |season=06 |number=24[/tpl] pop culture references such as "I can't see dead people",[tpl]cite episode |title=Take My Wife, Sleaze |episodelink=Take My Wife, Sleaze |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Affleck, Neil |network=Fox |airdate=1999-11-28 |season=11 |number=08[/tpl] and meta-references such as "I am not a 32 year old woman" and "Nobody reads these anymore".[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=71[/tpl] The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for "Homer the Heretic" (season four, 1992) read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in the previous week's episode, which called the city a "home of pirates, drunks and whores".Martin, Jeff (2004). "The Cajun Controversy", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.[tpl]cite news |title=Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song |date=1992-10-08 |page=A1 |publisher=The Times-Picayune |author=Lorando, Mark[/tpl] Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because a shorter opening title sequence, where the chalkboard gags are cut, is used to make more room for story and plot development.
One of Bart's early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but rapidly realizes it is a prank call and (despite not knowing who actually made the call) angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis "Red" Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.[tpl]cite news |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080925085614/http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6 |title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC |accessdate=2008-10-30 |date=2005-08-10 |publisher=Hudson Reporter |work=Jersey City Reporter |author=Kaulessar, Ricardo[/tpl] The prank calls debuted in "Homer's Odyssey", (season one, 1990) the third episode to air, but were included in "Some Enchanted Evening", the first episode of the series that was produced.Brooks, James L.; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al.

They have occasionally resurfaced on the show, the most recent being the season 20 episode "Lost Verizon" (2008), although in that case Bart called various bartenders around the world and not Moe.[tpl]cite news |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/916/916381p1.html |title=The Simpsons: "Lost Verizon" Review |accessdate=2008-11-03 |date=2005-10-06 |author=Canning, Robert |publisher=IGN |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081009060657/http://tv.ign.com/articles/916/916381p1.html |archivedate=9 October 2008  |deadurl=no[/tpl]
The catchphrase "Eat My Shorts" was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was in high school. Cartwright was in the marching band at Fairmont High School, and one day while performing, the band chanted "Eat my shorts" rather than the usual "Fairmont West! Fairmont West!"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date=2007-07-26 |author=Carroll, Larry |publisher=MTV[/tpl] Bart's other catchphrases, "¡Ay, caramba!" and "Don't have a cow, man!", were featured on t-shirts manufactured during the production of the early seasons of The Simpsons.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=25[/tpl] "Cowabunga" is also commonly associated with Bart, although it was mostly used on the show after it had been used as a slogan on the T-shirts. The use of catchphrase-based humor was mocked in the episode "Bart Gets Famous" (season five, 1994) in which Bart lands a popular role on Krusty the Clown's show for saying the line "I didn't do it."[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=61[/tpl] The writers chose the phrase "I didn't do it" because they wanted a "lousy" phrase "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular".Mirkin, David.

===Personality===

[tpl]quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=transparent |align=right |quote=Like any good punk rocker, Bart had the nihilism thing down from the very beginning. Though not so much pissed off as extremely undisciplined, the Bart Simpson of the Ullman shorts is either fighting with his sister, inciting his father into murderous levels of rage, executing dangerous stunts that end in cartoonish levels of disaster, or simply spitting snarky one-liners at whatever authority figures cross his path. This appetite for destruction continued to be the defining feature of the smart-assed boy who dominated many episodes of the first few seasons of The Simpsons–the version that spawned Bart-mania–though his methods and motivations show considerably more nuance than the white-trash Bart of the Ullman era.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=124[/tpl][/tpl]

Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the two have a turbulent relationship. Bart regularly address Homer by his given name instead of "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as "the boy".[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10[/tpl] Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonish manner.Groening, Matt. (2002). Commentary for "Simpson and Delilah", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be "very angry" and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored.Groening, Matt. (2004). Commentary for "Marge on the Lam", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Marge is a much more caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as "a handful" and is often embarrassed by his antics. In "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he felt bad and made it up to her.[tpl]cite episode |title=Marge Be Not Proud |episodelink=Marge Be Not Proud |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Scully, Mike; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-17 |season=07 |number=11[/tpl] Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom.[tpl]cite episode |title=Marge's Son Poisoning |episodelink=Marge's Son Poisoning |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Chun, Daniel; Anderson, Mike B. |network=Fox |airdate=2005-11-13 |season=17 |number=05[/tpl] Marge has expressed an understanding for her "special little guy" and has defended him on many occasions. She once said "I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things."

Bart shares a sibling rivalry with his younger sister, Lisa, but has a buddy-like relationship with his youngest sister Maggie, due to her infant state. While Bart has often hurt Lisa, and even fought her physically, the two are often very close. Bart cares for Lisa as deeply and has always apologized for going too far. He also believes Lisa to be his superior when it comes to solving problems and frequently goes to her for advice. Bart is also highly protective of Lisa: When a bully destroys her box of cupcakes in "Bart the General", (season one, 1990), Bart immediately stands up for her.
Bart is best friends with Milhouse Van Houten, although Bart has at times shown embarrassment about their friendship.[tpl]cite episode |title=Summer of 4 Ft. 2 |episodelink=Summer of 4 Ft. 2 |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Greaney, Dan; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1996-05-19 |season=07 |number=25[/tpl] Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse, and the two have been involved in a lot of mischief together. Because of this behavior, Milhouse's mother forbids Milhouse from playing with Bart in "Homer Defined" (season three, 1991). While at first he pretended that he did not care, Bart eventually realizes that he needs Milhouse, and Marge manages to convince Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider.[tpl]cite episode |title=Homer Defined |episodelink=Homer Defined |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Gewirtz, Howard; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-17 |season=03 |number=05[/tpl] While Bart is portrayed as a popular cool boy, he and Milhouse are frequent targets for bullies, including Dolph, Jimbo, Kearney, and Nelson Muntz.

Bart is one of the biggest fans of children's television host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, "I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings," and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in "Krusty Gets Busted" (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in "Like Father, Like Clown".[tpl]cite episode |title=Like Father, Like Clown |episodelink=Like Father, Like Clown |series=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Bird, Brad; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-04 |season=3 |number=6[/tpl] and helping Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career in "Krusty Gets Kancelled".[tpl]cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Kancelled |episodelink=Krusty Gets Kancelled |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-13 |season=04 |number=22[/tpl] For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart.[tpl]cite episode |title=Kamp Krusty |episodelink=Kamp Krusty |series=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-09-24 |season=04 |number=01[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=128-129[/tpl] One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored.[tpl]cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subjectlink=Matt Groening |interviewer=Terry Gross |title=Fresh Air |program=National Public Radio |callsign=WHYY-FM |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1476480 |city=Philadelphia |date=2003-10-23 |accessdate=2008-10-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047268,00.html |title=Talking about The Simpsons |accessdate=2008-10-29 |date=2007-07-20 |work=Entertainment Weekly |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080930053655/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20047268,00.html |archivedate=30 September 2008  |deadurl=no[/tpl] Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in "Krusty Gets Busted", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes, but is always foiled in the end.

Although there were many critics of the character, favorable comments came from several quarters. Columnist Erma Bombeck wrote, "Kids need to know that somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull off all the things they can only fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live." In 2003, Bart placed first in a poll of parents in the United Kingdom who were asked "which made-up character had the most influence" on children under 12 years old.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/uk/newsid_2972000/2972291.stm |title=Bart Simpson is your top role model |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2008-10-28 |publisher=CBBC Newsround[/tpl] Even a Christian magazine, The Banner, had an article several years ago pointing out that, despite the generally negative connotations toward religion, The Simpsons was the only sitcom on television that depicted an intact family with a mother and a father, that went to church every Sunday, and where good ultimately triumphed over evil.
