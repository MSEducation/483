Berlin Schönefeld Airport ([tpl]Audio|Flughafen_Berlin-Schönefeld.ogg|Flughafen Berlin Schönefeld[/tpl]) [tpl]Airport codes|SXF|EDDB[/tpl] is an international airport located near the town of Schönefeld in Brandenburg, directly at the southern border of Berlin and [tpl]convert|18|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of the city centre. Schönefeld was the major civil airport of East Germany (GDR), and the only airport serving East Berlin. Today, it is the smaller of the two airports in Berlin after Berlin Tegel Airport.
Schönefeld Airport is situated outside the city proper, unlike Berlin Tegel Airport. Noise pollution is, therefore, less of an issue at Schönefeld. The airport will be merged into Berlin Brandenburg Airport when it opens in 2015 or later.The future lies in Schoenefeld
Schönefeld Airport saw a major increase in passenger numbers over the recent years, which was caused by the opening of bases for both easyJet and Germanwings. In 2008, the airport served 6.6 million passengers. At the start of the winter season in 2012 Germanwings left Schönefeld for Berlin-Tegel.Germanwings zieht nach Berlin-Tegel

==History==

Schönefeld airport was opened on 15 October 1934 to accommodate the Henschel aircraft plant. By the end of the Second World War, over 14,000 aircraft had been built. On 22 April 1945, the airport was occupied by Soviet troops, and the aircraft construction facilities were either dismantled or blown up. By late 1947, the airport rail link had been repaired and agricultural machinery was built and repaired on the site. In 1946, the Soviet Air Forces moved from Johannisthal Air Field to Schönefeld, including the civil airline Aeroflot. In 1947, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany approved the construction of a civilian airport at the site. 
Between 1947 and 1990, Schönefeld airport was renamed on several occasions and finally became the main airport of the DDR (Zentralflughafen).
A stipulation of the Four Power Agreement following World War II was a total ban on German carriers' participation in air transport to Berlin,  where access was restricted to US, British, French and Soviet airlines. Since Schönefeld airport was located outside of the city boundaries of Berlin, this restriction did not apply. Thus, aircraft of the East German flag carrier Interflug could use Schönefeld airport, while West German Lufthansa was denied access to Tegel or Tempelhof airports.
Following German reunification in 1990, operating three separate airports became increasingly cost prohibitive, leading the Berlin legislature to pursue a single airport that would be more efficient and would decrease the amount of aircraft noise from the airport within the city. Therefore, it was decided to erect Berlin Brandenburg Airport at the current site of Schönefeld Airport, originally scheduled to open in autumn 2012. For various reasons, mainly issues with the fire alarm/safety system, the opening has been postponed to 2015. 
The new airport will share only one runway with the existing one - the current runway will become the north runway of the new airport. Most of the old Schönefeld Airport, including the terminal and apron areas, will undergo complete urban redevelopment following its closure. Part of the old apron area will be used by the future new passenger terminal of the German government used for state visits and other state flight operations.http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/hauptstadtflughafen/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-regierungsterminal-in-der-warteschleife,11546166,23722270.html

==Terminals==

Schönefeld Airport consists of the four terminals A, B, C and DSchönefeld Airport layout for check-in. Terminals A, B and D are connected through their jointly used airside concourse. Due to a lack of space there are not as many facilities as at many other airports but there are some shops and restaurants as well as a branch of Burger King and airline lounges.

===Terminals A and B===

The main building is the original part of the airport. It houses check-in for Terminals A and B. Terminal A features check-in counters A01–A18, with the largest user being Ryanair besides several other airlines like Aeroflot. Terminal B, in a side wing, was originally reserved for transit passengers to and from West Berlin, who took advantage of cheaper air fares and package tours arranged by an East German travel agency. Nowadays, it is used exclusively by EasyJet with the check-in counters B20–B29. The airside consists of three jet bridges as well as several walk-boarding aircraft stands located at Pier 3a, an extension that was opened in 2005.

===Terminal C===

Terminal C was originally built to accommodate flights to Israel. It was reconfigured in 2008 and now handles sightseeing trips and flights in connection with special events.Event and Show Terminal C It has no direct connection to Terminals A, B and D and doesn't handle scheduled services.

===Terminal D===

Terminal D was opened in December 2005 due to rapidly growing passenger numbers. Being nearly identical to Terminal C at Berlin Tegel Airport, it features check-in counters D40–D57, which are mainly used by Condor and Norwegian Air Shuttle. It doesn't feature jet bridges but several walk-boarding stands.
