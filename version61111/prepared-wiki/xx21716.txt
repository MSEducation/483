Cape Dezhnyov or Cape Dezhnev ([tpl]Lang-ru|мыс Дежнёва[/tpl]; formerly East Cape or Cape Vostochny) is a cape that forms the eastmost mainland point of Eurasia. It is located on the Chukchi Peninsula in the very thinly populated Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. This cape is located between the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea, [tpl]convert|82|km[/tpl] across from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska; the Bering Strait lies between the two capes. The Diomede Islands and Fairway Rock are located in the midst of the strait.

==Geography==

In 1898, the cape was officially renamed as Cape Dezhnev, replacing Captain James Cook's name, the "East Cape". It was named in honor of Semyon Dezhnyov, the first recorded European to round its tip (in 1648). There is a large monument to Dezhnev on the seacoast.
The cape is the eastern tip of a high, rocky headland, about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi[/tpl] from Uelen in the north to Cape Pe'ek in the south, connected to the mainland by a neck of lower-lying land peppered with swamps and shallow lakes. That low-lying land is so low in elevation that the cape appears as an island from a distance far to the south of it. The US Hydrographic Office publication Asiatic Pilot from 1909 gives the height of the headland as [tpl]convert|2521|ft|m[/tpl], and the US Office of Coast Survey chart of 2000 shows the highest peak at [tpl]convert|2638|ft|m[/tpl]. The headland and the neck of low-lying land together form a peninsula.  A well-established trail crossed the neck of land behind the headland in pre-historic and historic times, traversed by sleds in the winter and used as a portage in the summer to avoid traversing the strait.  This route was important enough that, according to an analysis by linguist Michael Krauss, the Central Siberian Yupik language continued up the coast, un-interrupted by the Naukansky dialect spoken in Naukan village on the headland.
The Great Circle distance from Cape Dezhnev to the shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait in Yemen is about 10,855 km, which is the longest land distance of  Asia.
