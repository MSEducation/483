The prison opened in November 1994.  On July 17, 2000, PVSP activated two substance abuse programs involving community services for inmates who have a history of substance abuse. PVSP converted one of its general population yards into a sensitive needs yard (SNY) in November 2002, and now houses approximately 900 SNY inmates on D Facility.  Then in May 2004 converted A Facility to a sensitive needs yard and houses 1000 inmates on A Facility.[tpl]cite web | author=Pleasant Valley State Prison (PVSP) | title=Mission Statement | url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Visitors/Facilities/PVSP.html | publisher=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-20[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
