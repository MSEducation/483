John Sculley III (born April 6, 1939) is an American businessman, entrepreneur and investor in high-tech startups. Sculley was  vice-president (1970–1977) and president of PepsiCo (1977–1983), until he became CEO of Apple on April 8, 1983, a position he held until leaving in 1993. In May 1987, Sculley was named Silicon Valley's top-paid executive, with an annual salary of US$2.2M.Malone, Infinite Loop, pg 412.
Sales at Apple increased from $800 million to $8 billion under Sculley's management, although many attribute this success to Sculley merely joining at an opportune time when Steve Jobs' vision and creations had begun to skyrocket.The New York Times: "Company News – Visionary Apple Chairman Moves On" However, his stint at Apple remains controversial due to his departure from founder Steve Jobs's sales structure, particularly regarding Sculley's decision to compete with IBM in selling computers to the same types of customers.The New York Times: "New Strategy Set by Apple" Others say that the "two clashed over management styles and priorities, Jobs focusing on future innovation and Sculley more on current product lines and profitability."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2013/03/18/ex-apple-ceo-john-sculley-believes-innovation-lull-will-end-smart-watch-likely-key-product-focus/ |title=Sculley quic bio at end of article" |publisher="MacRumors |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] But Sculley ultimately was forced to step down as Apple CEO because he was opposed to licensing Macintosh software and was talking to Goldman-Sachs about splitting Apple into two companies. When Sculley left in May 1993, Apple had $2 billion in cash and $200 million in debt.
John Sculley is recognized worldwide as an expert in marketing, in part because of his early successes at PepsiCo, notably his introduction of the Pepsi Challenge, which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival Coca Cola.[tpl]cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|page=149[/tpl] He used similar marketing strategies throughout the 1980s and 1990s at Apple to mass market Macintosh personal computers, and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies. Sculley is currently invested in and actively involved with a number of high-tech start-up companies, including 3CInteractive, XL Marketing (now rebranded as Zeta Interactive[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zetainteractive.com/company/press/241-january-2014.html |title=January 2014 |publisher=Zeta Interactive |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]), Inflexion Point, Mobeam, OpenPeak, x10 Credit, Pivot Acquisition Corp., nextSource, and WorldMate. Through their family investment office, Sculley Brothers, John Sculley and his brothers Arthur and David are investing in US health care because they see innovation in healthcare delivery services as an opportunity for their marketing skills and experience. Among their healthcare investments are Watermark Medical, MDLIVE, Audax Health Solutions, Misfit Wearables, and Modernizing Medicine.

==Early life==

John Sculley was born in New York City. Five days later, he was one of the first infants to fly the Atlantic Ocean to his mother's home country, Bermuda, where his family first settled in 1624. John and his brothers spent much of their childhood in Bermuda before moving back to New York. He attended high school at St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts. He ultimately received a bachelor's degree in architectural design from Brown University and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/leadership/ |title=Wharton – Leadership Across Industries, High-Tech, John Sculley |publisher=Wharton.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]

==Career==

===1967–82 : Pepsi-Cola===

Sculley joined the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo in 1967 as a trainee, where he participated in a six-month training program at a bottling plant in Pittsburgh.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 30. In 1970, at the age of 30, Sculley became the company's youngest marketing vice-president.
As vice-president of marketing at Pepsi, Sculley initiated one of the company's first consumer-research studies, an extended in-home product test in which 350 families participated. As a result of the research, Pepsi decided to launch new, larger and more varied packages of their soft drinks.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 43–44. In 1970, Pepsi set out to dethrone Coca-Cola as the market leader of the industry, in what would eventually become known as the Cola Wars.
Pepsi began spending more on marketing and advertising, typically paying between US$200,000 and $300,000 for each television spot, while most companies spent between $15,000 and $75,000. With the Pepsi Generation campaign, Pepsi aimed to overturn Coca-Cola's classic marketing.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 54.
At Pepsi, Sculley also took the position of managing PepsiCo's International Food Operations division, shortly after he visited a failing potato-chip factory in Paris. PepsiCo's Food division was their only money-losing division, with revenues of US$83 million and losses of $16 million. To make the food division profitable, Sculley hired new managers from Frito-Lay and improved product quality, as well as improving accounts and establishing financial controls.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 63–66 Within three years, the food division was making US$300 million in revenues and $40 million in profit.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 68
Sculley was best known at Pepsi for the Pepsi Challenge, an advertising campaign he started in 1975 to compete against Coca Cola to gain market share, using heavily-advertised taste tests. It claimed based on Sculley's own research that Pepsi-Cola tasted better than Coca-Cola. The Pepsi Challenge included a series of television advertisements that first aired in the early 1970s, featuring lifelong Coca-Cola drinkers participating in blind taste tests. Pepsi's soft drink was always chosen as the preferred product by the participant; however, these tests have been criticized as being biased. The Pepsi Challenge was mostly targeted at the Texas market, because Pepsi had a significantly low market share there at the time. The campaign was successful, significantly increasing Pepsi's market share in that state. At the time the Pepsi Challenge was started, Sculley was senior vice-president of United States sales and marketing operations at Pepsi.Sculley, Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, pg 71–75 Sculley himself took the taste test and picked Coke instead of Pepsi.Michael S Malone. Infinite Loop. New York: Doubleday Business, 1999.
In 1977, Sculley was named Pepsi's youngest-ever president.

===1983–93: Apple Inc.===

Apple lured Sculley away from Pepsi in order to apply his marketing skills to the personal computer market. Steve Jobs successfully sealed the deal after he made his legendary pitch to John: "Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/nerds/part3.html |title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part III |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]  Also, Apple's president, Mike Markkula, wanted to retire and believed that Steve Jobs, who wished to be the company's president, lacked the discipline and temperament needed to run Apple on a daily basis. Sculley, with his solid business background and considerable recent success, would give Apple an image of greater reliability and stability. From the time they first met in 1982 until 1985, Jobs and Sculley had what both acknowledged as an amazing partnership. Sculley used his marketing experience to help keep the aging Apple II generating much-needed cash and helped Jobs launch the Mac with the most admired consumer marketing campaign of its time. Jobs was the product czar and made all the product decisions.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The Lisa computer, an innovative model designed by a team initially led by Jobs, shipped in January 1983, and had disastrous sales. When Jobs' Macintosh, the first of a new series of models with a pioneering black-and-white graphical user interface, shipped in January 1984, Sculley raised the initial price to $2,495 from the originally planned $1,995, using the additional money for higher profit margins and expensive advertising campaigns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Price_Fight.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium&search=John%20Sculley |title=Andy Hertzfeld, Article: Price Fight (October 1983) |publisher=Folklore.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]  Macintosh sold well, and received excellent reviews;  however, it did not put the IBM PC out of business. Some of the privileges of Jobs' elite development groups were trimmed, and projects were subject to stricter review for usefulness, marketability, feasibility, and reasonable cost.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
At the peak of Macintosh success Apple made an attempt to move unsold inventory of Lisa computers by renaming it "Macintosh XL" and positioning as top-of-the-line pro Macintosh model. Since it lacked user-friendliness of Macintosh, this idea had little success.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
At this point, a power struggle between Jobs and Sculley was becoming readily apparent. Jobs became "non-linear": he kept meetings running past midnight, sent out lengthy faxes, then called new meetings at 7 am.Hormby, Thomas. Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years, Low End Mac, February 22, 2006. Retrieved on March 2, 2007. The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out about Jobs's plans and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year.[tpl]cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = PC Week| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985[/tpl] After Jobs left, the company experienced a turnaround in 1986, introducing a faster microprocessor and renaming "The Macintosh Office" "Desktop Publishing."[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Under the direction of Sculley, who had learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky Macintosh Portable in 1989, Apple introduced the PowerBook in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue. For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine MacAddict named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.
Microsoft threatened to discontinue Microsoft Office for the Macintosh if Apple did not license parts of the Macintosh graphical user interface to use in the Windows operating system. Under pressure, Sculley agreed, a decision which later affected the Apple v. Microsoft lawsuit. About that time, Sculley coined the term personal digital assistant (PDA) referring to the Apple Newton, one of the world's first PDAs which, as it turned out, was several years ahead of its time.Ciber, Technology Milestone: Apple Newton 1993[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In the early 1990s, at enormous expense, Sculley led Apple to port its operating system to run on a new microprocessor, the PowerPC.  Sculley later acknowledged this was his greatest mistake, indicating that he should instead have targeted the dominant Intel architecture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071208100556/http://macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=7045 |title=MacWorld, John Sculley Admits Intel Blunder (2003) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]  After a bad first quarter in 1993, Apple's board forced Sculley out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16538745|title=Ex-Apple boss Sculley sets record straight on Jobs|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 March 2013[/tpl] He was replaced by German-born Michael Spindler, who had been Chief Operating Officer, who was also ousted a year later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nostarch.com/download/apple2_excerpt.pdf |title=Apple Confidential 2.0 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]
In 1987, Sculley made several famous predictions in a Playboy interview.[tpl]cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/137462/article-1G1-5079227/john-sculley |title=Playboy | September 1, 1987 | Goodman, Danny | Copyright 2002 Playboy |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=1987-09-01 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] He predicted that the Soviet Union would land a man on Mars within the next 20 years and claimed that optical storage media such as the CD-ROM would revolutionize the use of personal computers. Some of his ideas for the Knowledge Navigator would eventually be fulfilled by the Internet and the World Wide Web during the 1990s and others by Apple itself with the introduction of Siri.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]

===1994–present===

Since leaving Apple, Sculley has invested in and been actively involved with a number of successful businesses: He was a founding investor in MetroPCS, formerly General Wireless, and helped guide the company's brand marketing; MetroPCS is now a multi-billion dollar public company on the New York Stock Exchange. He built NFO Research from $25 million to $550 million in revenue, and sold it to IPG for $850 million. He helped launch and advised Hotwire.com, Intralinks (which was co-founded by his brother Arthur), and InPhonic, Buy.com, and PeoplePC - each of which became billion dollar market cap public companies in the 1990s. In 1995, Sculley and his two brothers, Arthur and David, formed a family office they call "Sculley Brothers," which is a privately owned portfolio of family investments, not an outside investor fund. Arthur Sculley is a former CEO of JP Morgan Private Bank; David Sculley is a former CEO of HJ Heinz USA. Other successful companies that Sculley Brothers helped create include Profession Sportscare, Intralinks, CreditTrade, Country Gourmet Soups, Buy.com, NextSource, XL Marketing, 3Cinteractive, and OpenPeak.
Sculley turned his attention briefly to politics in the early 1990s on behalf of Republican Tom Campbell, who in 1992 was running in California for a United States Senate seat.  Sculley hosted a fund-raiser for Campbell at his ranch in Woodside. Sculley had become acquainted with Hillary Clinton, serving with her on a national education council. When Bill Clinton ran for president, Sculley supported him. Sculley sat next to Hillary Clinton during the President's first State of the Union address in January 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/president/players/sculley.html |title=– John Sculley – Interlocking business and political relationships |publisher=Pbs.org |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]
In 1994, Sculley signed on as CEO with Spectrum Information Technologies, a US$100 million wireless communications company. Unbeknownst to Sculley, at the time he joined the company, it was under investigation for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Four months later, Sculley learned of the fraud investigation and resigned, filing a lawsuit against Spectrum president Peter Caserta for damaging his reputation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19980515/1117.html |title=Inc.

US$22M in venture capital was provided for the company. Sculley later left the company, but remained an investor. In 1999, Live Picture filed for federal bankruptcy protection as part of a plan to be acquired by MGI Software.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://money.cnn.com/1997/09/11/technology/sculley_intv/ |title=CNNMoney, John Sculley rides again, September 1997 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.next.advocacy/browse_thread/thread/bfe4aab657b25cb0/b4da3428703cb9d3?lnk=st&q=Live+Picture+Inc+Bankrupt&rnum=1&hl=en#b4da3428703cb9d3 |title=Google Groups, Live Picture files for bankruptcy, May 1999 |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]

Two years later, he partnered with Dennis M. Lynch to launch Signature21. In its first year, the two-man firm provided marketing services to an array of small to medium sized businesses. In 2001, Sculley and Lynch transitioned the company into a learning program for rising entrepreneurs. Months later, Lynch left the company, while Sculley continued to consult and work with small businesses, including InPhonic, whose board of directors he later joined. InPhonic is an online retailer of cell phones and wireless plans. Sculley's early leadership and enthusiasmRobert Diamond, When two heads are better than one, May 2, 2001. helped steer InPhonic towards its successful IPO in 2004.
