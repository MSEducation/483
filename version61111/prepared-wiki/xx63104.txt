A cleanroom or clean room is an environment, typically used in manufacturing or scientific research, with a low level of environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles, and chemical vapors. More accurately, a cleanroom has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size. To give perspective, the ambient air outside in a typical urban environment contains 35,000,000 particles per cubic meter in the size range 0.5 μm and larger in diameter, corresponding to an ISO 9 cleanroom, while an ISO 1 cleanroom allows no particles in that size range and only 12 particles per cubic meter of 0.3 μm and smaller.

==History==

The modern cleanroom was invented by American physicist Willis Whitfield.[tpl]cite news|first=William|last=Yardley|title=Willis Whitfield, Clean Room Inventor, Dies at 92 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/business/willis-whitfield-clean-room-inventor-dies-at-92.html |work=New York Times |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl] An employee of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960.  Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable airflows. Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities. Within a few years of its invention in the 1960s, Whitfield's modern cleanroom had generated more than $50 billion in sales worldwide.[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|title=Sandia physicist, cleanroom inventor dies at 92 |url=http://www.kwes.com/story/20187574/sandia-physicist-cleanroom-inventor-dies-at-92 |work=KWES |publisher=Associated Press |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2012-12-03[/tpl] The cleanroom eventually entered the hospital industry in the United Kingdom, primarily in hospital pharmacies.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2078028/

==Overview==

Cleanrooms can be very large. Entire manufacturing facilities can be contained within a cleanroom with factory floors covering thousands of square meters. They are used extensively in semiconductor manufacturing, biotechnology, the life sciences, and other fields that are very sensitive to environmental contamination.
The air entering a cleanroom from outside is filtered to exclude dust, and the air inside is constantly recirculated through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and/or ultra-low penetration air (ULPA) filters to remove internally generated contaminants.
Staff enter and leave through airlocks (sometimes including an air shower stage), and wear protective clothing such as hoods, face masks, gloves, boots, and coveralls.
Equipment inside the cleanroom is designed to generate minimal air contamination. Only special mops and buckets are used. Cleanroom furniture is designed to produce a minimum of particles and to be easy to clean.
Common materials such as paper, pencils, and fabrics made from natural fibers are often excluded, and alternatives used. Cleanrooms are not sterile (i.e., free of uncontrolled microbes);In NASA’s Sterile Areas, Plenty of Robust Bacteria New York Times, 9. October 2007 only airborne particles are controlled. Particle levels are usually tested using a particle counter and microorganisms detected and counted through environmental monitoring methods.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=Application of quality risk management to set viable environmental monitoring frequencies in biotechnology processing and support areas|journal=PDA J Pharm Sci Technol |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=560–79|date=November 2012 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2012.00891[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Sandle, T |title=A review of cleanroom microflora: types, trends, and patterns|journal=PDA J Pharm Sci Technol |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=392–403|date=November 2011 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2011.00765[/tpl]
Some cleanrooms are kept at a positive pressure so if any leaks occur, air leaks out of the chamber instead of unfiltered air coming in.
Some cleanroom HVAC systems control the humidity to low levels, such that extra equipment ("ionizers") is necessary to prevent electrostatic discharge problems.
Low-level cleanrooms may only require special shoes, with completely smooth soles that do not track in dust or dirt. However, for safety reasons, shoe soles must not create slipping hazards. Access to a cleanroom is usually restricted to those wearing a cleanroom suit.Cleanroom Clothing
In cleanrooms in which the standards of air contamination are less rigorous, the entrance to the cleanroom may not have an air shower. An anteroom (known as a "gray room") is used to put on clean-room clothing.
Some manufacturing facilities do not use fully classified cleanrooms, but use some cleanroom practices to maintain their contamination requirements.Your Cleanroom Supplier :: Hutchins & Hutchins, IncCleanroom Forum

==Air flow principles==

Cleanrooms maintain particulate-free air through the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other nonshedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or nonunidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment.Cleanroom Air Flow Principles
