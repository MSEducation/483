[tpl]nihongo|High School Debut|高校デビュー|Kōkō Debyū|also known as Koukou Debut[/tpl] is a shōjo romantic comedy manga by [tpl]nihongo|Kazune Kawahara|河原 和音|Kawahara Kazune[/tpl]. It was serialized in Japan by Shueisha in Bessatsu Margaret from 2003 to 2008 and collected in 13 bound volumes. The series was adapted as a drama CD and as a series of six light novels written by Yuu Kuramoto. The manga is licensed in North America by Viz Media, which published English editions of all 13 volumes between January 2008 and February 2010.
The series follows the relationship between Haruna Nagashima, an enthusiastic former softball star, and Yoh Komiyama, the cool boy she convinces to coach her in romance. It has been praised by reviewers as a standard shōjo manga premise made highly entertaining by Kawahara's handling of the characters, particularly the romantic leads, and artwork.

==Plot==

Haruna Nagashima gave her all to softball in middle school, now that she has made her high school debut, she has decided to give her all for a new goal: getting a boyfriend and falling in love. However, she has one small problem—since she never paid any attention to fashion or trends in middle school, she has no idea how to go about attracting her yet-to-be-found love. But a chance encounter with the popular Yoh Komiyama provides her with the opportunity she needs. If he coaches her in how to become attractive, surely she can find herself a boyfriend. 
He agrees to coach Haruna after her great persistence but on one condition: she mustn't fall in love with him.

Kawahara's art was praised for its clean style and layout, dynamic figures, and emotional expressions,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/on-the-shojo-beat-high-school-debut/43131/ | title=On the Shojo Beat: Crimson Hero, High School Debut, and Love*Com | first=Katherine | last=Dacey | publisher=PopCultureShock | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=29 January 2009 | quote=The artwork, like the motherly advice, is another strength of High School Debut. The layout flows nicely, with Kazume Kawahara artfully varying the detail and density of her panels instead of cramming every inch of the page with super-deformed reaction shots and muttered asides.

It seems as if she learned a 1001 ways to use delicate line work on facial features and tossed hair in order to suggest emotion and mood in her characters and in the story.[/tpl] and was compared by one reviewer to Yoko Kamio's.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.diamondbookshelf.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m=1&c=20&s=421&ai=72135 | title=High School Debut Vol. 1 | first=Sarah | last=Krygier | publisher=School Library Journal | date= | accessdate=26 January 2009 | quote=Kawahara uses a pen-and-ink style similar to that in Yoko Kamio’s Boys over Flowers[/tpl] 
Reviewers consistently hailed Haruna as a comic heroine and a key to the series' appeal,[tpl]cite web | url=http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/HSDebut2.htm | title=High School Debut Volume 2 | publisher=About.com | first=Deb | last=Aoki | date= | accessdate=25 January 2009 | quote=Haruna proves to be a shojo manga heroine who is truly heroic. Despite being dealt a betrayal that would leave a lesser person angry and bitter, Haruna doesn't stoop to playing mind games or wallowing in self-pity. She is always willing to learn from her mistakes.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/03/22/high-school-debut-book-2-recommended/ | title=*High School Debut Book 2 — Recommended | first=Johanna Draper | last=Carlson | publisher=Comics Worth Reading | date=22 March 2008 | accessdate=26 January 2009 | quote=And good-hearted Haruna takes even pain as a learning experience!

The supporting players have a pleasing way of getting things going – creating moments of comedy and conflict with nothing more than a few words or a mere appearance.[/tpl] particularly with Yoh and his sister Asami.[tpl]cite web | url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/10/21/high-school-debut-book-6-recommended/ | title=*High School Debut Book 6 — Recommended | first=Johanna Draper | last=Carlson | publisher=Comics Worth Reading | date=21 October 2008 | accessdate=28 January 2009 | quote=Plus, the art supports all this well with authentic emotion on the characters’ faces. Yoh, especially, is a tough challenge. In lesser hands, he’d seem like a stick or a brick, someone with no feelings — here, though, he seems reserved, as he should, someone with hidden emotion that he chooses not to share.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2009/01/20/high-school-debut-book-7-recommended/ | title=*High School Debut Book 7 — Recommended | first=Johanna Draper | last=Carlson | publisher=Comics Worth Reading | date=20 January 2009 | accessdate=28 January 2009 | quote=Yoh’s sister Asami is a particularly nuanced character.[/tpl] They also praised Haruna's relationship with Yoh, which is presented as a pairing of friends and equals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/HSDebut1.htm | title=High School Debut Volume 1 | publisher=About.com | first=Deb | last=Aoki | date= | accessdate=25 January 2009 | quote=In the hands of a lesser storyteller, High School Debut would have a lot of predictable, sexually-charged hijinks before Yoh and Haruna fall in love.

He tells her what he likes about her, for instance, and they both immediately sense problems in the Asa/Fumi relationship and discuss what they ought to do about it. I really dislike it when a prolonged misunderstanding is used as a plot, so it’s such a relief to me when characters actually talk about things with each other.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/09/12/high-school-debut-book-5-recommended/ | title=*High School Debut Book 5 — Recommended | first=Johanna Draper | last=Carlson | publisher=Comics Worth Reading | date=11 September 2008 | accessdate=26 January 2009 | quote=Plus, their role reversal — Haruna jumps into action to save Yoh — is refreshing, especially since it’s not treated as a behavior pattern that has to be fixed. Instead, it’s accepted as who they are.[/tpl] Some critics noted that the story's initial makeover theme was more deftly handled than a short summary led them to expect,[tpl]cite web | url=http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/HSDebut1.htm | title=High School Debut Volume 1 | publisher=About.com | first=Deb | last=Aoki | date= | accessdate=25 January 2009 | quote=Unlike some other makeover manga, Haruna's transformation doesn't happen overnight, and it's not about making her into something she's not. In fact, Kawahara lets Haruna's quirkiness, inner strength and good nature shine through, such that even pre-makeover, she comes across as someone who deserves true love.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/on-the-shojo-beat-high-school-debut/43131/ | title=On the Shojo Beat: Crimson Hero, High School Debut, and Love*Com | first=Katherine | last=Dacey | publisher=PopCultureShock | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=29 January 2009 | quote=Reading the jacket copy for High School Debut predisposed me to disliking this manga. Its powerful-boy-makes-over-hopeless-girl plot seemed retro and more than a little sexist, not to mention rather stale—She's All That, anyone? I was pleasantly surprised to discover, however, that the underlying message of the book is deeper and wiser than “Makeovers make everything better!”[/tpl] though some still expressed reservations about it.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/on-the-shojo-beat-high-school-debut/43131/ | title=On the Shojo Beat: Crimson Hero, High School Debut, and Love*Com | first=Katherine | last=Dacey | publisher=PopCultureShock | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=29 January 2009 | quote=I still have reservations about High School Debut. Any series with a Pygmalion-esque premise is bound to raise some uncomfortable questions about gender equality, no matter how smart or sporty the Galatea stand-in may be.[/tpl]
