Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949), better known as just Roger Taylor, is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the drummer of the rock band Queen, but has also served as occasional songwriter and occasional lead vocalist. As a drummer, he is renowned for his unique soundRolling Stone – Issue 149 – 12 June 1973 and is considered one of the most influential rock drummers of the 1970s and '80s.Taylor Hawkins: Rhythm 2002.

As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to the band's albums from the very beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and (in the early days) usually singing lead vocals on his own compositions.

As a producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum. He currently resides in Guildford, Surrey, but also has a home in Helford, Cornwall.
In addition to his drum work, Taylor routinely played guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead vocalist and the rhythm guitarist.
In 2005, he was voted by UK fans as the eighth greatest drummer in classic rock music history, in a poll conducted by Planet Rock Radio.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4669597.stm |accessdate=28 January 2008 |work=  BBC News| date=10 July 2005 | title=Zeppelin voted 'ideal supergroup'[/tpl] According to The Sunday Times Rich List he was worth £80 million or around $127 million in 2011."The top 50 richest people in music: Sunday Times Rich List"'.

==Early life==

Roger Meddows Taylor was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, 26 July 1949. Taylor moved to Truro, Cornwall, south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the ukulele. He briefly attended Truro Cathedral School; then, at the age of 13, he joined Truro School as a day boy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012[/tpl] At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a very busy semi-pro rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. In 1967, he went to London to study dentistry at the London Hospital Medical College, but he soon became bored with dentistry and, after changing to Biology, obtained a B.Sc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor|publisher=Queen Online|accessdate=12 August 2012[/tpl]
By the time News of the World was released, Taylor had met his future girlfriend, Dominique Beyrand. She was working for Richard Branson at the time, who was at the helm of Queen's free concert at Hyde Park. They lived together from 1980 to 1987, raising their two children: Felix Luther and Rory Eleanor. They decided to get married for reasons relating to his estate, to protect his children's interests in the future. At the time, Taylor was seeing another girl, Debbie Leng (also seen in the "Breakthru" video); he moved in with her a month after his marriage of convenience to Dominique. Before Freddie Mercury's death, Roger and Debbie had their first child, Rufus Tiger, who was born in March 1991. He ended up having two more children with Debbie: Tiger Lily (1994) and Lola Daisy May (2000). In late 2002, they decided to break up. Taylor remarried on 26 August 2010, to Sarina Potgieter."A mighty bash as Queen drummer Roger Taylor ties the knot". Daily Mail. Retrieved 15 May 2012 Taylor is also a Chelsea F.C. supporterhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNvtMDxfYBw but also supported Manchester United fans who campaigned against media mogul Rupert Murdoch buying a stake into the club.

==1968–70: Smile==

Taylor met Brian May and Tim Staffell in 1968 after seeing an advert on a noticeboard at Imperial College for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band only lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join Humpy Bong, leaving the band with only a catalogue of nine songs:
Smile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band the Cross were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play "Earth" and "If I Were a Carpenter".Tim Staffell Biography

==1970s–present: Queen==

In 1969, Taylor was working with Freddie Mercury at the Kensington Market (they were living in an apartment around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. After the band split up in 1970, Bulsara convinced the remaining two members to continue, and he eventually joined the band. In 1971, they found bassist John Deacon and brought him into the band, before going on to release their debut album in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per record, and he is considered as a prominent songwriter. His compositions for Queen include:
Songs written by Taylor, but credited the band collectively (like the whole The Miracle, Innuendo and most of Made in Heaven albums) and include:
Many of these feature Taylor on vocals. His voice was very recognisable, for both its high range (he would often reach an E5 in full voice during live performances) and raspiness. His extremely high falsetto, sometimes going above an A5, was characteristic of Queen's vocal harmonies, and was often thought to be a woman's voice, or a synthesiser effect (most notably his screams on "In the Lap of the Gods", written by Mercury). His vocal range spans four octaves (E2-E6). Taylor's lead and partial vocal credits include:

==1977–present: Solo career==

Taylor has had a productive solo career, releasing four albums. His first single was his 1977 "I Wanna Testify". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the News of the World album. The A-side, although a cover of The Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song "Turn on the TV".
His first solo album, Fun in Space, was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer David Richards. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, "Future Management", including Top of the Pops. The only other single to come from the album was "My Country". The only US single released from the album was "Let's Get Crazy".
His next venture, Strange Frontier, came in July 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, "Beautiful Dreams" (in Portugal only) and "Man on Fire", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote The Works, and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. Strange Frontier included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on "Killing Time", Deacon remixed the B-side "I Cry For You" and Rick Parfitt co-wrote and played on "It's An Illusion". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of Bruce Springsteen's "Racing in the Street" and Bob Dylan's "Masters of War".
After Queen finished their 1986 Magic Tour, Taylor started a new band, The Cross, which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993 the band split up, after performing one final gig at the Gosport Festival.
In 1994 Taylor worked with Yoshiki Hayashi, drummer and pianist of X Japan and released the song "Foreign Sand" and a reworking of The Cross's "Final Destination". The album Happiness? was "Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger – thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie". "Nazis 1994" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, "Happiness" and "Foreign Sand."
In 1998 he released his fourth solo album Electric Fire. He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs – for which he got a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.The Top 20 Roger Taylor Solo Rarities, Queencollector.com. Retrieved on 26 July 2009.
In 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken). The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline – News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl] Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release.

===The Cross===

The Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted The Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, The Cross incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.

===Shove It===

After Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to Spike Edney after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and Josh Macrae on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.
The first album, Shove It, was released in 1988. In Europe, Heaven for Everyone (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in The 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having "Feel The Force" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: "Cowboys and Indians", "Heaven for Everyone" and "Shove It". Another single, "Manipulator," was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.

===Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know===

After finishing Queen's 1989 album The Miracle, Taylor went into the studio with the rest of The Cross for the first time to record Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know. The band composed the opening track "On Top of the World Ma" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the Led Zeppelin track Whole Lotta Love. The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for "Power To Love" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track "Better Things", and Spike Edney played mandolin on "Final Destination", which was written by Taylor. "Final Destination" was released as a single, as were "Liar" and "Power To Love", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. "Final Destination" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song "Man on Fire" as a B-side, and "Liar" (Noone) had a brand new track, "In Charge of My Heart", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12" single and CD of "Liar" also included extended remixes of both "Liar" and "In Charge of My Heart". The instrumental section at the beginning of "In Charge of My Heart" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. "Closer To You" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.

===Blue Rock===

Made at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, Blue Rock gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, "Bad Attitude" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in "Put It All Down To Love" (Edney), "Life Changes" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and "Heartland" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. "New Dark Ages" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of "Man on Fire", whilst "Life Changes" was released with the B-side "Heartland". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Freddie Mercury's passing. The tour was in support of Magnum, so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.

===Break-up of the Cross===

The band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the Queen + Paul Rodgers tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band ("Spike's All Stars"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.

==Influences==

Taylor has stated that his main influence as a rock drummer is the late John Bonham of Led Zeppelin. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, "The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums – they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll".Biography for Roger Taylor (I), IMDB.com
In a 2009 interview, Taylor also stated that Mitch Mitchell, the drummer for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, was also a major influence of his.

==Equipment==

Until 2008, Taylor exclusively used Ludwig or Sleishman drum kits, or a combination of the two in the 2005 Return of the Champions Tour. In the recent Queen + Paul Rodgers 2008 The Cosmos Rocks tour he opted for a DW kit. Interestingly, for the Magic Tour in 1986, Roger's Ludwig kit was not flown in time for the two Wembley Stadium shows that were being filmed (the DVD of the shows is now one of the most popular Queen videos, even having a "25th Anniversary Edition" released in 2011 for the 40th Anniversary of the band). The Stadium had a 7 piece Yamaha Recording Custom kit that he used for the July 11 and 12th shows, both filmed. Also absent were his trademark Remo Roto Toms!

==Stamps==

In 1999 Taylor became the first living person, other than members of the British Royal Family, to appear on a Royal Mail stamp, being seen behind Freddie Mercury as part of a "Great Britons" issue. This caused controversy as it was an understood rule that the only living people allowed to appear on British stamps could be members of the Royal Family.[tpl]cite news|last=Rohrer |first=Finlo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7669252.stm |title=The politics of stamps |publisher=BBC News |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Alex Spence |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article636773.ece |title=Royal Mail unveils Beatles album cover stamps (Times Online) |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 October 2011[/tpl]
