The climate of Europe is of a temperate, continental nature, with a maritime climate prevailing on the western coasts and a Mediterranean climate in the south.  The climate is strongly conditioned by the Gulf Stream, which keeps mild air over the high latitude northwestern region over the winter months, especially in Ireland, the UK and coastal Norway.  Whilst Western Europe has an oceanic climate, Eastern Europe has a drier, continental climate. Parts of the Central European plains have a hybrid oceanic/continental climate. Four seasons occur in Eastern Europe, while southern Europe experiences distinct wet season and dry seasons, with prevailing hot and dry conditions during the summer months.  The heaviest precipitation occurs downwind of water bodies due to the prevailing westerlies, with higher amounts also seen in the Alps. Tornadoes occur within Europe, with most but not all occurrences being weak.  The Netherlands and United Kingdom experience a disproportionately high number of tornadic events.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

==Overview==

Prevailing westerlies (which squeeze between the Icelandic Low and Azores High) bring rain  from the Atlantic ocean, the position moves southward during winter and rises further north in summer. The Siberian High brings colder, drier weather from the east. Away from the sea,  parts of Central and Eastern Europe have a borderline Oceanic/Continental Climate as they are milder than they would otherwise be due to the open ice-free waters of the North/Baltic Seas and lack of mountain barriers, but are not as mild as the Western coasts, and are subject to more frequent snowfalls. The Danube region through the Balkans, Ukraine and Southern Russia have a continental climate with cold winters and hotter summers, some areas bordering on a dry steppe climate with only certain months of higher precipitation, often due to thunderstorms.
Some coastal regions of the Black Sea have  microclimates that are borderline humid continental/humid subtropical (or sometimes just the latter) due to the winters being mild enough and summer precipitation being high enough to preclude them as being Mediterranean, for example in Sochi, Russia. On the plains of Northern European Russia up to the Ural Mountains, the winter climate is much harsher than elsewhere in Europe with many months of below freezing average temperatures but with periods of hot summer weather. Nevertheless year-to-year variations can produce different climates such as temperate in the winter, and tropical in the summer.

==Gulf Stream==

The climate of Western Europe is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.  The Mediterranean’s waters are not as deep as the large oceans, allowing it to become a heat store tempering winters along its coastlines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asparis.net/lowerschool/2dgrade/maps/climate/europe.htm|title=European Climate|work=World Book|accessdate=2011-02-15|publisher=World Book, Inc[/tpl] The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation also play large roles in determining the amount of Arctic air that penetrates southward diminishing the Gulf stream’s warming effects during winter.[tpl]cite journal |last=Seager |first=Richard |title=The Source of Europe's Mild Climate |journal=American Scientist Online |date=July–August 2006 | url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2006/4/the-source-of-europes-mild-climate|accessdate=2008-09-23 [/tpl]
Comparing to other parts of the globe, the average temperature throughout the year in Naples is 16 °C (60.8 °F), while it is 13 °C (55.8 °F) in New York City, virtually the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8 °C (15 °F) higher than those in Calgary (although Calgary sits 1200m higher in altitude), and they are almost 22 °C (40 °F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk. This difference is even larger on the northern part of the continent; the January average in Brønnøysund, Norway,Brønnøysund is almost 15 °C warmer than the January average in Nome, Alaska,Nome both towns are situated upwind on the west coast of the continents at 65°N, and as much as 42°C warmer than January average in Yakutsk which is actually slightly further south. Further south the oceanic climate of Europe compares thermally to North America, at around 48°N Rennes, France has about an equal average temperature throughout the year to Seattle, Washington, although the latter has drier summers with much wetter winters Yakutsk

==Precipitation==

On an annual basis, rainfall across the continent is favoured within the Alps, and from Slovenia southward to the western coast of Greece.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://sciencestage.com/uploads/text/wn1VIFwvnd3ImrFn3MMQ.pdf|title=Precipitation climatology over Mediterranean Basin from ten years of TRMM measurements|author=A.

The maxima along the eastern coasts of water bodies are due to the westerly wind flow which dominates across the continent.  A bulk of the precipitation across the Alps falls between March and November.  The wet season in lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea lasts from October through March, with November and December typically the wettest months.  For example, the monthly rainfall at Athens ranges from 6 mm (July) during their dry season to 71 mm (December) during their wet season.Athens, Greece(retrieved 9 January 2010)  Summer rainfall across the continent evaporates completely into the warm atmosphere, leaving winter precipitation to be the source of groundwater for Europe.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/nh/021/0185/0210185.pdf|page=187|author=Richard Thornsen|journal=Nordic Hydrology|volume=21|year=1990|accessdate=2010-01-10|title=Effect of Climate Variability and Change in Groundwater in Europe[/tpl]  Places with significant impact by acid rain across the continent include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/acid_rain_in_europe|title=Acid Rain in Europe|author=Ed.

The European Monsoon (more commonly known as the Return of the Westerlies) is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the Atlantic, where they become loaded with wind and rain. Rather than a traditional monsoon, where warm seas fuel precipitation and storms, they are more cyclonic low-pressure systems that travel along the path of the gulfstream Visser, S.W. (1953). Some remarks on the European monsoon. Birkhäuser: Basel. These Westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the European winter, but they ease as Spring approaches in late March and through April and May. The winds pick up again in June, which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as "the return of the westerlies".[tpl]cite web|author=Leo Hickman|publisher=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/09/weather.europe|title=The Question: What is the European monsoon?|accessdate=2009-06-09|date=2008-07-09[/tpl]

These storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures, fierce rain or hail, thunder and strong winds.[tpl]cite web|author=Paul Simons|publisher=The Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article6451573.ece|title='European Monsoon' to blame for cold and rainy start to June|accessdate=2009-06-09|date=2009-06-07[/tpl]  The Return of the Westerlies affects Europe's Northern Atlantic coastline, such as Ireland, Great Britain, the Benelux countries, Western Germany, Northern France and parts of Scandinavia.
There are cycles seen within the rainfall data from Northern Europe between Great Britain and Germany, which are seen at 16 years.  Southern Europe experiences a 22-year cycle in rainfall variation.  Other smaller term cycles are seen at 10-12 year and 6-7 year periods within the rainfall record.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/114077886/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|title=European Rainfall Patterns|author=R.
