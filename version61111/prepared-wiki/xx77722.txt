Phoenix FM is a community radio station serving the areas of Brentwood and Billericay, England. It was formed in 1996 and has broadcast twelve 28-day restricted service licence broadcasts on FM. The station's presenters include local snooker hero Steve Davis, Boxer Rebellion drummer Piers Hewitt, and former Carter USM guitarist/songwriter Les "Fruitbat" Carter. Phoenix FM was also the first community radio station in the UK to provide a streaming internet service, in 2001.
On 16 February 2006 Ofcom announced that Phoenix FM, after ten years of campaigning, had been awarded a full-time Community Radio licence.[tpl]cite web | title = Ofcom awards 21 community radio licences | publisher = Ofcom| date = February 16, 2006 | url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/02/nr20060216 | accessdate = 2008-02-22[/tpl] On Saturday 4 March 2006 the station started podcasting for the first time, with Brentwood's Only Alternative publishing the first show using this method.
Phoenix FM moved its base of operations to the Baytree Centre in early 2007 and started broadcasting full-time on 98.0Â FM at 7pm on Friday 23 March 2007.  The station moved to its current base at the Brentwood Centre in February 2012.
The station's broadcasts have provided a valuable platform for local bands looking to gain airtime. Inme, who were then known under the name of Drowned, were one band whose first radio play and interviews were on the station.  The station's Creative Sessions have given studio recording time to unknown and young local bands.
The station includes local MP Eric Pickles among its presenters.  Pickles has been described as "the Euro-friendly MP for Brentwood and Ongar and occasional star of a chat'n'music programme on local station Phoenix FM"[tpl]cite web | last = Harris | first = John| title = It's a game of two halves as the frontbenchers go for the face-off | publisher = The Guardian| date = July 9, 2007| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jul/09/conservatives.labour | accessdate = 2008-02-22[/tpl]
