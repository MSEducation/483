==Career==

Batan began his career at Assyriska Föreningen. He made his first appearance in the first-team squad in Superettan during the 2003 season. Assyriska was promoted to Allsvenskan in 2004, and Batan made his Allsvenskan debut against Hammarby IF on April 11, 2005. After the 2005 season, Batan received several offers from a number of clubs and was involved in some controversy on leaving Assyriska.[tpl]cite news |first=Anders |last=Lundqvist |title=Batan ratade AIK - skrev på för Djurgården |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=672&a=491162&previousRenderType=1 |work=DN.se |publisher=Dagens Nyheter |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2008-08-21 |language=Swedish [/tpl] AIK had announced to media that Batan had signed for them, claiming they had an oral agreement, but had to see themselves fooled as he signed for their archrivals Djurgårdens IF only a few days later. Batan claimed it was a childhood dream to play for Djurgården, whereas fans of AIK found his "treachery" very hard to accept.
On the pitch, Batan had a tough job making himself a regular starter for Djurgården and he was regularly a substitute for the team. During the summer 2008, he was put on loan for Assyriska Föreningen due to lack of time on the pitch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dif.se/sidor/nyheter/nyheter.asp?action=view&id=8840&typ=1 |title=Batan till Assyriska |accessdate=2008-08-21 |first=Jonas |last=Riedel |work=Dif.se |publisher=Djurgårdens IF Fotboll |date=2008-07-30 |language=Swedish [/tpl] He was also loaned out to Assyriska FF for the 2009 season. He left Djurgården when his contract expired after the 2009 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dif.se/sidor/nyheter/nyheter.asp?action=view&id=10233&typ=1 |title=Utgående Kontrakt Förlängs Inte  |accessdate=2009-12-17 |first=Jonas |last=Riedel |work=Dif.se |publisher=Djurgårdens IF Fotboll |date=2009-12-11 |language=Swedish [/tpl]
