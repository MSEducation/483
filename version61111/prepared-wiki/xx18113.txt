A SQUID (for superconducting quantum interference device) is a very sensitive magnetometer used to measure extremely subtle magnetic fields, based on superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions.
SQUIDs are sensitive enough to measure fields as low as 5 aT (5×10−18 T) within a few days of averaged measurements.[tpl]cite book |url=http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/education/GP-B_T-Guide4-2008.pdf |last=Ran |first=Shannon K’doah |title=Gravity Probe B: Exploring Einstein's Universe with Gyroscopes |format=PDF |page=26 |year=2004 |publisher=NASA[/tpl] Their noise levels are as low as 3 fT·Hz-½.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://ib.ptb.de/de/org/7/75/751/SQUID_Stromsensoren/Drung_ASC06_Preprint.pdf|title=Highly sensitive and easy-to-use SQUID sensors|author=D.

Recently invented SERF atomic magnetometers are potentially more sensitive and do not require cryogenic refrigeration but are orders of magnitude larger in size (~1 cm3) and must be operated in a near-zero magnetic field.

==History and design==

There are two main types of SQUID: direct current (DC) and radio frequency (RF). RF SQUIDs can work with only one Josephson junction, which might make them cheaper to produce, but are less sensitive.

===DC SQUID===

The discussion in this Section assumed perfect flux quantization in the loop. However, this is only true for big loops with a large self-inductance. According to the relations, given above, this implies also small current and voltage variations. In practice the self-inductance L of the loop is not so large. The general case can be evaluated by introducing a parameter
with ic the critical current of the SQUID. Usually λ is of order one.[tpl]cite journal|author=A.TH.A.M. de Waele and R. de Bruyn Ouboter|title=Quantum-interference phenomena in point contacts between two superconductors|journal=Physica|volume= 41|year=1969|pages=225–254|doi=10.1016/0031-8914(69)90116-5|issue=2|bibcode = 1969Phy....41..225D [/tpl]

===RF SQUID===

The RF SQUID was invented in 1965 by Robert Jaklevic, John J. Lambe, Arnold Silver, and James Edward Zimmerman at Ford. It is based on the AC Josephson effect and uses only one Josephson junction. It is less sensitive compared to DC SQUID but is cheaper and easier to manufacture in smaller quantities. Most fundamental measurements in biomagnetism, even of extremely small signals, have been made using RF SQUIDS.[tpl]cite doi|10.1063/1.1136907[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1088/0953-2048/19/3/024[/tpl]
The RF SQUID is inductively coupled to a resonant tank circuit. Depending on the external magnetic field, as the SQUID operates in the resistive mode, the effective inductance of the tank circuit changes, thus changing the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. These frequency measurements can be easily taken, and thus the losses which appear as the voltage across the load resistor in the circuit are a periodic function of the applied magnetic flux with a period of Φ0. For a precise mathematical description refer to the original paper by Erné et al.[tpl]cite journal|author=S.N. Erné, H.-D. Hahlbohm, H. Lübbig|title=Theory of the RF biased Superconducting Quantum Interference Device for the non-hysteretic regime|journal=J. Appl. Phys.|volume=47|pages=5440–5442|year=1976|doi=10.1063/1.322574|bibcode = 1976JAP....47.5440E|issue=12 [/tpl]

===Materials Used===

The traditional superconducting materials for SQUIDs are pure niobium or a lead alloy with 10% gold or indium, as pure lead is unstable when its temperature is repeatedly changed. To maintain superconductivity, the entire device needs to operate within a few degrees of absolute zero, cooled with liquid helium.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]
"High-temperature" SQUID sensors are more recent; they are made of high-temperature superconductors, particularly YBCO, and are cooled by liquid nitrogen which is cheaper and more easily handled than liquid helium. They are less sensitive than conventional "low temperature" SQUIDs but good enough for many applications.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

==Uses==

The extreme sensitivity of SQUIDs makes them ideal for studies in biology. Magnetoencephalography (MEG), for example, uses measurements from an array of SQUIDs to make inferences about neural activity inside brains. Because SQUIDs can operate at acquisition rates much higher than the highest temporal frequency of interest in the signals emitted by the brain (kHz), MEG achieves good temporal resolution. Another area where SQUIDs are used is magnetogastrography, which is concerned with recording the weak magnetic fields of the stomach. A novel application of SQUIDs is the magnetic marker monitoring method, which is used to trace the path of orally applied drugs. In the clinical environment SQUIDs are used in cardiology for magnetic field imaging (MFI), which detects the magnetic field of the heart for diagnosis and risk stratification.
Probably the most common commercial use of SQUIDs is in magnetic property measurement systems (MPMS). These are turn-key systems, made by several manufacturers, that measure the magnetic properties of a material sample. This is typically done over a temperature range from that of 300 mK to roughly 400 K.[tpl]cite doi|10.1109/JPROC.2004.833655[/tpl]
For example, SQUIDs are being used as detectors to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While high-field MRI uses precession fields of one to several teslas, SQUID-detected MRI uses measurement fields that lie in the microtesla range. In a conventional MRI system, the signal scales as the square of the measurement frequency (and hence precession field): one power of frequency comes from the thermal polarization of the spins at ambient temperature, while the second power of field comes from the fact that the induced voltage in the pickup coil is proportional to the frequency of the precessing magnetization. In the case of untuned SQUID detection of prepolarized spins, however, the NMR signal strength is independent of precession field, allowing MRI signal detection in extremely weak fields, of order the Earth's field. SQUID-detected MRI has advantages over high-field MRI systems, such as the low cost required to build such a system, and its compactness. The principle has been demonstrated by imaging human extremities, and its future application may include tumor screening.[ref]

Another application is the scanning SQUID microscope, which uses a SQUID immersed in liquid helium as the probe. The use of SQUIDs in oil prospecting, mineral exploration, earthquake prediction and geothermal energy surveying is becoming more widespread as superconductor technology develops; they are also used as precision movement sensors in a variety of scientific applications, such as the detection of gravitational waves.[ref]

A modified RF SQUID was used to observe the dynamical Casimir effect for the first time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26813/|title=First Observation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect|publisher=Technology Review[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=C.

It has also been suggested that they might be implemented in a quantum computer.Quantum coherence with a single Cooper pair, V Bouchiat, D Vion, P Joyez, D Esteve, M H Devoret, 1998 Phys. Scr. 1998 165 These are the only macroscopic devices that have been cited as possible qubits in this context.
A potential military application exists for use in anti-submarine warfare as a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) fitted to maritime patrol aircraft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-4/iss-2/p20.pdf|title=SQUID Sensors Penetrate New Markets|first=Jennifer|last=Ouellette|page=22|publisher=The Industrial Physicist[/tpl]
