KTRW (630 AM) is a locally-owned adult standards radio station based in Spokane, Washington, USA. It operates at 630 kHz with power of 530 watts (day) and 53 watts (night).
Though it uses the KTW callsign in its marketing materials, KTRW is not related to the original Seattle radio station KTW which was at 1250 kHz and is now called KKDZ.www.seatacmedia.com/?p=4438. 
The station is owned by Mutual Broadcasting System, LLC (owned by Thomas Read, owner of KSPO), which is unrelated to the defunct nationwide radio network of the same name; however, the station has been using this and the Liberty Broadcasting System name as part of the station's promotion.
