Oxford Road Halt was a railway station on the Varsity Line [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl] west of the hamlet of Water Eaton, Oxfordshire.

==History==

The Varsity Line from [tpl]rws|Bletchley[/tpl] to Oxford was opened in stages by the Buckinghamshire Railway. It had been opened as far as [tpl]rws|Islip[/tpl] on 1 October 1850,James, p.60 from Islip to a temporary station at Banbury Road on 2 December 1850, and from Banbury Road to Oxford on 20 May 1851.James, p.64 At the point where the main Oxford-Banbury road (now the A4165 road) crossed the line, a level crossing was constructed, known as Oxford Road Crossing ([tpl]gbmapping|SP500118[/tpl]). This was the location of the temporary Banbury Road terminus, which was used until the facilities at Oxford were ready.Mitchell & Smith, fig. VII
On 1 April 1854 the Buckinghamshire Junction Railway (often known as the Yarnton Loop) was opened, between Oxford Road Junction and Yarnton Junction.Jenkins & Quayle, pp.37,40 The former junction was constructed just to the south-west of Oxford Road Crossing, although the two routes did not diverge until a point somewhat further to the south-west, at [tpl]gbmapping|SP499116[/tpl].Mitchell & Smith, fig. VI
For over fifty years no permanent station had been provided between Oxford and Islip. In 1905, the London and North Western Railway (successor to the Buckinghamshire Railway) constructed three halts on that stretch of line; two were Summertown Halt (later Port Meadow Halt) and [tpl]rws|Wolvercote Halt[/tpl], whilst the northernmost was Oxford Road Halt, and which was situated just east of Oxford Road Crossing. Two of these halts (including Oxford Road Halt) were opened on 9 October 1905; all three closed on 1 January 1917, reopened 5 May 1919 and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway finally closed them on 30 October 1926.Mitchell & Smith, figs. 24,27,28Waters, p.128Simpson, p.107
In 1935 the Oxford Road level crossing was replaced by a bridge to the north-east, which crosses the railway over the site of the former halt.Mitchell & Smith, figs. VII,28
In 1942 a Government grain silo was built next to the site as part of a Second World War network to concentrate scarce food and distribute it by rail. It was in operation until the late 1980s.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/community/memorylane/10751298.a_look_back_at_the_history_of_the_Water_Eaton_grain_silo_as_wartime_facility_nears_its_end/ |author=Memory Lane |title=a look back at the history of the Water Eaton grain silo as wartime facility nears its end |newspaper=Oxford Mail |publisher=Newsquest |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013[/tpl] In October 2013 Chiltern Railways had it demolished as part of site preparation for the planned Oxford Parkway railway station and car park.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/10780555.Water_Eaton_grain_silo_is_demolished/ |last=Fantato |first=Damian |title=Water Eaton grain silo is demolished |newspaper=Oxford Mail |publisher=Newsquest |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=13 December 2013[/tpl]
Oxford Road Junction remained; the signalbox was resited slightly to the north-east on 4 November 1956, and on 15 September 1958 was renamed Banbury Road Junction, since there is a junction just north of [tpl]rws|Reading West[/tpl] also named Oxford Road Junction. It was closed on 29 October 1973.Mitchell & Smith, fig. 29

==Oxford Parkway==

As part of the operator's Project Evergreen 3, Chiltern Railways plans to launch services from a new station on an adjacent site next to the existing Water Eaton Park and Ride site, to be called [tpl]rws|Oxford Parkway[/tpl]. It will be a stop on a new service between London [tpl]rws|Marylebone[/tpl] and [tpl]rws|Oxford[/tpl].
