There are several historical forts in the U.S. state of Florida. De Quesada states that there have been more than 300 "camps, batteries, forts and redoubts"de Quesada (2006), p. 9 in Florida, since European settlement began. More than 80 "blockhouses, forts, camps and stockades"de Quesada (2006), p. 10 were used at one time or another in Florida, during the Seminole Wars. Most forts were constructed from earth or wood, or both; some incorporate brick or stone. Many were intended to be used for only a short period, and most have effectively disappeared. In some cases, a series of forts with different names were built on or close to the same place.de Quesada (2006), p 9â€“10
