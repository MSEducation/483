[[History of surface transit in Northern Virginia]]

CATEGORIES: Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority

Northern Virginia is part of the Washington Metropolitan Area of the United States, and its surface transit system is integrated with that of the city of Washington, D.C. However, because of the Potomac River separating Northern Virginia from the city, the two systems have evolved largely independently. At present, most major bus routes, including all that cross the Potomac, are operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), while several smaller systems are city- or county-owned.Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, [tpl]PDFlink|Metro System Route Map - Virginia and Washington, DC|4.83Â MiB[/tpl], October 2005 Since the Washington Metro opened to Virginia, most of the bus routes have terminated on either side of the Potomac River, where passengers can transfer to the rapid transit system, or to one of the few Metro bus lines that crosses the river (13F, 13G).[tpl]PDFlink|Metro Timetable - Reagan National Airport-Pentagon-Washington Line[/tpl], Reprinted 9/24/12

==Trolleys==

Northern Virginia did not have any street railways until 1892, when the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Railway opened an electric trolley line between Alexandria and Mount Vernon.  It merged with the Washington, Arlington and Falls Church Railway in 1913 to form the Washington-Virginia Railway.  The company entered bankruptcy in 1924, and in 1927 the two former systems were split.  The WA&M was bought by the owner of the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Rapid Transit Company, a competing line of buses, and last ran in 1932; the WA&FC was reorganized as the Arlington and Fairfax Railway and operated until 1939.  A third system, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway, began as the Alexandria and Harper's Ferry Railroad, a steam railroad, in the 1850s.  It was leased by the newly formed W&OD, which also leased the connecting Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad, in 1912.  Trolleys last ran in 1941, but the company continued to operate freight trains (and passenger trains until 1951) until 1968.

==Local buses==

Until 1973, when WMATA began operating buses, the local buses in Northern Virginia were operated by two companies.  The Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company (AB&W) mainly operated along and south of Columbia Pike, while the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company (WV&M) mainly operated along and north of Arlington Boulevard.
The AB&W's first route was along Columbia Pike, now Route 16, in 1921.  It eventually acquired a number of other routes, including several local Alexandria routes.
The WV&M acquired several routes in the late 1920s, mainly operating west from Rosslyn. It absorbed the Arlington and Fairfax Motor Transportation Company in 1947.

==Intercity buses==

Until 1987, when Greyhound Lines acquired Continental Trailways (part of the Trailways Transportation System), there were two systems of intercity buses - Greyhound and Trailways - in Northern Virginia. [tpl]As of|2007[/tpl], the only two routes still operated are southwest to Charlottesville via U.S. Route 29 and south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1.
Greyhound's system once included three lines: one west to Winchester along State Route 7, operated by Capitol Greyhound Lines, one west to Winchester via U.S. Route 50, operated by Atlantic Greyhound Lines, and one south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1, operated by Richmond Greyhound Lines. These were all started in the 1920s and joined Greyhound by the early 1930s.
Virginia Trailways, officially Virginia Stage Lines, had lines west on State Route 55 to Front Royal, west on U.S. Route 211 to Luray, southwest to Charlottesville via U.S. Route 29, and south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1 and State Route 2.  The first one of these operated by Virginia Stage was to Charlottesville; by 1936, it was operating all four.  The company joined Trailways and changed its business name to Virginia Trailways in 1938.
