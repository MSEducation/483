[[Politics of Croatia]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of Croatia

The politics of Croatia are defined by a parliamentary, representative democratic republic framework, where the Prime Minister of Croatia is the head of government in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government and the President of Croatia. Legislative power is vested in the Croatian Parliament ([tpl]lang-hr|Sabor[/tpl]). The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Croatia on 22 December 1990 and decided to declare independence from Yugoslavia. The declaration of independence came into effect on 8 October 1991. The constitution has since been amended several times. The first modern parties in the country developed in the middle of the 19th century, and their agenda and appeal changed, reflecting major social changes, such as the breakup of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, dictatorship and social upheavals in the kingdom, World War II, the establishment of Communist rule and the breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia.
The President of the Republic ([tpl]lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike[/tpl]) is the head of state and the commander in chief of the Croatian armed forces and is directly elected to serve a five-year term. The government ([tpl]lang-hr|Vlada[/tpl]), the main executive power of Croatia, is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers, three of whom also serve as government ministers. Seventeen ministers are in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies. The parliament is a unicameral legislative body. The number of Sabor representatives ranges from 100 to 160; they are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; adoption of the government budget, declarations of war and peace, defining national boundaries, calling referenda and elections, appointments and relief of officers, supervising the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting of amnesties. The Croatian constitution and legislation provides for regular presidential and parliamentary elections, and the election of county prefects and assemblies, and city and municipal mayors and councils.
Croatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the Constitution of Croatia and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme Court ([tpl]lang-hr|Vrhovni sud[/tpl]) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia. There are other specialised courts in Croatia—commercial courts and the Superior Commercial Court, misdemeanour courts, the Superior Misdemeanour (criminal) Court, the Administrative Court and the Croatian Constitutional Court ([tpl]lang-hr|Ustavni sud[/tpl]). The State Attorney's Office represents the state in legal proceedings.

==Legal framework==

Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic. Following the collapse of the ruling Communist Party in Yugoslavia, Croatia adopted a new constitution in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/world/evolution-in-europe-conservatives-win-in-croatia.html?ref=croatia|title=EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Conservatives Win in Croatia|date=9 May 1990|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoption—in 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which lead to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992.[tpl]cite web|work=Official web site of the Parliament of Croatia|publisher=Sabor|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=20091&sec=2462|title=Ceremonial session of the Croatian Parliament on the occasion of the Day of Independence of the Republic of Croatia|date=7 October 2004|accessdate=29 July 2012|archivedate=29 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Wk9bFY8[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/23/world/3-ex-yugoslav-republics-are-accepted-into-un.html|title=3 Ex-Yugoslav Republics Are Accepted Into U.N.|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Paul L.

==Executive==

The President of the Republic ([tpl]lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike[/tpl]) is the head of state; he or she is directly elected and serves a five-year term. The president is the commander in chief of the armed forces, has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the Sabor (Parliament) through a simple majority vote, and has some influence on foreign policy. The most recent presidential election was held on 10 January 2010 and was won by Ivo Josipović. He took the oath of office on 18 February 2010.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia|url=http://www.predsjednik.hr/PRESIDENT|title=Ivo Josipović – biography|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] The constitution limits holders of the presidential office to a maximum of two terms and prevents the president from being a member of any political party. Consequently, the president-elect withdraws from party membership before inauguration. President Josipović did so on 15 February 2010.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Jutarnji list|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/josipovica-u-saboru-mijenja-karolina-levakovic-/591661/|language=Croatian|title=Predsjednika Josipovića u Saboru mijenja mlada Karolina Levaković|trans_title=President Josipović Replaced in Sabor by Young Karolina Levaković|author=Suzana Barilar|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl]
The government ([tpl]lang-hr|Vlada[/tpl]), the main executive power of Croatia, is headed by the prime minister who has four deputies, three of whom also serve as government ministers. there are seventeen other ministers who are appointed by the prime minister with the consent of the Sabor; these are in charge of particular sectors of activity. As of 23 December 2011, the Deputy Prime Ministers are Radimir Čačić, Neven Mimica, Branko Grčić, and Milanka Opačić. Government ministers are from the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and the Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats (HNS) and Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS).[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Večernji list|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/novi-clanovi-banskih-dvora-milanovicevih-21-clanak-359295|language=Croatian|title=Novi članovi Banskih dvora – Milanovićevih 21|trans_title=New members of Banski Dvori - Milanović's 21|accessdate=23 December 2011|author=Ivanka Toma|date=22 December 2011[/tpl] The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the country's foreign and domestic policies.

==Legislature==

The Parliament of Croatia ([tpl]lang-hr|Sabor[/tpl]) is a unicameral legislative body. A second chamber, the Chamber of Counties ([tpl]lang-hr|Županijski dom[/tpl]), was set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution. The Chamber of Counties was originally composed of three deputies from each of the twenty counties and the city of Zagreb. However, as it had no practical power over the Chamber of Representatives, it was abolished in 2001 and its powers were transferred to the county governments. The number of Sabor representatives can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote and serve four-year terms. 140 members are elected in multi-seat constituencies, up to six members are chosen by proportional representation to represent Croatians living abroad and five members represent ethnic and national communities or minorities.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sabor|url= http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=713|title=About the Parliament|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] The two largest political parties in Croatia are the SDP and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). The last parliamentary election was held on 4 December 2011 in Croatia and on 3 and 4 December 2011 abroad.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=94E52275-95BA-48BF-840A-146FB98A70BD | language = Croatian | newspaper = Vjesnik | title = Kukuriku osvojila 80 mandata, koalicija HDZ-a s dijasporom 47 | date = 5 December 2011 | accessdate =12 December 2011|archivedate=14 June 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68PdL3YwE|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
The Sabor meets in public sessions in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, and the second from 15 September to 15 December. Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, by the president of the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations of war and peace, alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty. Decisions are made based on a majority vote if more than half of the Chamber is present, except in cases of constitutional issues.

==Elections==

The Croatian constitution and legislation provides for regular elections for the office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. A majority vote is required to win. A runoff election round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority in the first round of voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the constitution and dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_07_85_2422.html|title=Ustav Republike Hrvatske|trans_title=Constitution of the Republic of Croatia|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=11 October 2011[/tpl]
140 members of parliament are elected to a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, which are defined on the basis of the existing county borders, with amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency to within 5%. Citizens of Croatia living abroad are counted in an eleventh constituency; however, its number of seats was not fixed for the last parliamentary election. It was instead calculated based on numbers of votes cast in the ten constituencies in Croatia and the votes cast in the eleventh constituency. In the 2007 parliamentary election the eleventh constituency elected five MPs. Constitutional changes first applied in the 2011 parliamentary election have abolished this scheme and permanently assigned three MPs to the eleventh constituency.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Sabor|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx|language=Croatian|title=U novi saziv Hrvatskoga sabora bira se 151 zastupnik|trans_title=151 MPs to be Elected to the next Sabor|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl] Additionally, eight members of parliament are elected by voters belonging to twenty-two recognised minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, Czech and Slovak minorities elect one MP jointly, while all other minorities elect two more MPs to the parliament.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski Sabor|trans_title=Croatian Parliament Members Election Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/305405.html|date=23 April 2003|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl] The Standard D'Hondt formula is applied to the vote, with a 5% election threshold.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Večernji list|language=Croatian|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/kukuriku-koalicija-podijelila-mjesta-listama-ali-ne-resore-clanak-310528|title=Kukuriku-koalicija podijelila mjesta na listama, ali ne i resore|trans_title=Kukuriku coalition carves out candidate lists, not the ministries|date=15 July 2011|authors=Petra Maretić-Žonja, Vojislav Mazzocco|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=State Electoral Commission|url=http://www.izbori.hr/izbori/ip.nsf/WPDS/F70CFD524E0E4545C1257455004696F5?open&1|title=Izborni postupak u izborima za Hrvatski sabor|trans_title=Election process for Croatian parliamentary elections|language=Croatian|accessdate=21 November 2011[/tpl] The last parliamentary election, held in 2011, elected 151 MPs.

If the minorities are not represented, further members, who belong to the minorities and who have not been elected through the proportional representation system, are selected from electoral candidate lists and added to the council.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o izboru članova predstavničkih tijela jedinica lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|trans_title=Members of Local and Regional Self-Government Representation Bodies Election Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/288356.html|date=5 April 2005|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl]

==Judiciary==

Croatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the constitution and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme Court ([tpl]lang-hr|Vrhovni sud[/tpl]) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia; its hearings are open and judgments are made publicly, except in cases where the privacy of the accused is to be protected. Judges are appointed by the National Judicial Council and judicial office is permanent until seventy years of age. The president of the Supreme Court is elected for a four-year term by the Croatian Parliament at the proposal of the President of the Republic. As of 2011, the president of the Supreme Court is Branko Hrvatin.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Croatian Supreme Court|url=http://www.vsrh.hr/EasyWeb.asp?pcpid=42|language=Croatian|title=O Vrhovnom sudu|trans_title=About the Supreme Court|date=14 October 2011|accessdate=9 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Croatian Supreme Court|url=http://www.vsrh.hr/EasyWeb.asp?pcpid=31|language=Croatian|title=Ustavne odredbe|trans_title=Provisions of the Constitution|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011[/tpl] The Supreme Court has civil and criminal departments.

In 1918, the Transleithanian part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar, Gospić, Ogulin, Požega, Vukovar, Varaždin, Osijek and Zagreb; the 1992 legislation established fifteen counties in the same territory.[tpl]cite book|author=Mark Biondich|title=Stjepan Radić, the Croat Peasant Party, and the politics of mass mobilization, 1904–1928|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dZBgIIZ18WMC|year=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8294-7|accessdate=18 October 2011|page=11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|newspaper=Narodne novine|date=30 December 1992|accessdate=9 September 2011|language= Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html[/tpl] Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into twenty counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time.

The county prefects, city and municipal mayors are elected to four-year terms by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units. If no candidate achieves a majority in the first round, a runoff election is held. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms, through proportional representation with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.
The number of members of the councils is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national ethnic minorities are represented on the council as required by the constitution. Further members who belong to the minorities may be added to the council in no candidate of that minority has been elected through the proportional representation system. Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=Jutarnji list|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/lokalni-izbori--pocela-izborna-sutnja/205765/|language=Croatian|title=Lokalni izbori: Počela izborna šutnja|trans_title=Local elections: Election silence starts|date=16 May 2009|accessdate=21 November 2011[/tpl] Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen county prefect elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three county prefect elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single county prefect election each.

==History==

===Within Austria-Hungary===

Events of 1848 in Europe and the Austrian Empire brought dramatic changes to Croatian society and politics, provoking the Croatian national revival that strongly influenced and significantly shaped political and social events in Croatia. At the time, the Sabor and Ban Josip Jelačić advocated the severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasising links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. Several prominent Croatian political figures emerged, such as Ante Starčević, Eugen Kvaternik, Franjo Rački and Josip Juraj Strossmayer. A period of neo-absolutism was followed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, which granted limited independence to Croatia. This was compounded by Croatian claims of uninterrupted statehood since the early Middle Ages as a basis for a modern state. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to the sentiment were the Party of Rights, led by Starčević and Kvaternik, and the People's Party, led by Janko Drašković, Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Ivan Mažuranić. They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party, which was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and the 1918, and advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Review of Croatian History|issn=1845-4380|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|volume=6|issue=1|date=April 2011|author=Stjepan Matković|title=Croatian-Slovenian relations in politics, 1848-1914: examples of mutual ties|pages=115–132|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=100777|accessdate=15 November 2011[/tpl]
Other significant parties formed in the era were the Serb People's Independent Party, which later formed the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. The Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The leaders of the Coalition were Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribićević. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In Dalmatia, the two major parties were the People's Party – a branch of the People's Party active in Croatia-Slavonia – and the Autonomist Party, advocating maintaining autonomy of Dalmatia, opposite to the People's Party demands for unification of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party, most notably led by Antonio Bajamonti, was also linked to Italian irredentism. By 1900, the Party of Rights had made considerable gains in Dalmatia.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru|publisher=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|issn=1330-0474|title=O broju Talijana/talijanaša u Dalmaciji XIX. stoljeća|language=Croatian|trans_title=Concerning the Number of Italians/Pro-Italians in Dalmatia in the 19th century|author=Šime Peričić|issue=45|date=September 2003|pages=327–355|accessdate=15 November 2011[/tpl] The Autonomists won the first three elections, but all elections since 1870 were won by the People's Party. In the period 1861–1918 there were seventeen elections in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and ten in the Kingdom of Dalmatia.

===Modern Croatia===

In 1989, the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia since the beginning of the Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru|publisher=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|issn=1330-0474|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=95848|title=Začetci višestranačja u Hrvatskoj 1989. godine|trans_title=The Origins of the Multi-Party System in Croatia in 1989|author=Šime Dunatov|issue=52|date=December 2010|pages=381–397|accessdate=15 November 2011[/tpl]
By the time of the first round of the first multi-party elections, held on 22 April 1990, there were 33 registered parties. The most relevant parties and coalitions were the League of Communists of Croatia – Party of Democratic Changes (the renamed Communist party), the  Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and the Coalition of People's Accord (KNS), which included the HSLS led by Dražen Budiša, and the HSS, which resumed operating in Croatia in December 1989. The runoff election was held on 6 May 1990. The HDZ, led by Franjo Tuđman, won ahead of the reformed Communists and the KNS. The KNS, led by Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo – who had led the Croatian Spring – soon splintered into individual parties. The HDZ maintained a parliamentary majority until the 2000 parliamentary election, when it was defeated by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), led by Račan. Franjo Gregurić, of the HDZ, was appointed prime minister to head a national unity government in July 1991 as the Croatian War of Independence escalated in intensity. His appointment lasted until August 1992.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Government of Croatia|url=http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/prethodne_vlade_rh|language=Croatian|title=Prethodne vlade RH|trans_title=Previous governments of the Republic of Croatia|accessdate=10 November 2011[/tpl] During his term, Croatia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia took effect on 8 October 1991. The HDZ returned to power in the 2003 parliamentary election, while the SDP remained the largest opposition party.[tpl]cite web|publisher=State Election Commission|url=http://www.izbori.hr/arhiva/arhiva.html|title=Arhiva izbora|trans_title=Elections Archive|language=Croatian|accessdate=13 November 2011[/tpl]
Franjo Tuđman won the presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. During his terms, the Constitution of Croatia, adopted in 1990, provided for a semi-presidential system.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Jutarnji list|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/arlovic-i-seks--bilo-bi-dobro-da-ovaj-ustav-izdrzi-dulje--ali-me-strah-da-ipak-nece/838714/|title=Arlović: Bilo bi dobro da ovaj Ustav izdrži dulje, ali me strah da ipak neće|trans_title=Arlović: It would be good if this constitution lasts, but I fear i will not|author=Veronika Rešković|date=17 June 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011[/tpl] After Tuđman's death in 1999, the constitution was amended and much of the presidential powers were transferred to the parliament and the government. Stjepan Mesić won two consecutive terms in 2000 and 2005 on a Croatian People's Party (HNS) ticket. Ivo Josipović, an SDP candidate, won the presidential elections in December 2009 and January 2010.
