Rockin' the Rhein with the Grateful Dead is a Grateful Dead triple live album released in 2004. It was recorded at Rheinhalle in the German town of DÃ¼sseldorf on April 24, 1972 during their famous European tour. The tracklist on the CD differs from the actual setlist played that night. It was done this way to preserve groups of segued tracks and fit on three discs properly. The two bonus tracks, "Turn On Your Lovelight" and "The Stranger (Two Souls In Communion)", were recorded on May 24, 1972.
Pre-orders through the Grateful Dead Store received a bonus disc.
