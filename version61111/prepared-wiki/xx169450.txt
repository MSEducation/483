==Navy career==

Wann enlisted in the Navy at Portland, Oregon, on 14 December 1939 and eventually received the rating of Pharmacist's Mate, 2nd class (PhM2/c).

==Awarded the Silver Star==

While on duty with marines engaged in the attack on Gavutu and Tanambogo, Pharmacist's Mate Wann received the Silver Star medal for conspicuous gallantry and "intrepidity during action" on the night of 7 August 1942. Japanese machine guns, raking the causeway between Gavutu and Tanambogo Islands, pinned down the marines with heavy fire. Wann volunteered to cross the area to render aid and return casualties to the aid station. Ignoring the enemy fire and with complete disregard of his own life, he sprinted back and forth, carrying and rendering aid to wounded marines.

==Killed in action==

He remained attached to Marine units in the Guadalcanal campaign until killed in action on 4 November 1942.

==Namesake==

USS Walter C. Wann (DE-412) was named in his honor.  She was laid down on 6 December 1943 at Houston, Texas, by the Brown Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 19 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Walter C. Wann, Sr.; and commissioned on 2 May 1944, Lt. Comdr. John W. Stedman, Jr., USNR, in command.
