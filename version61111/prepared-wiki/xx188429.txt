The 1995 U.S. Open was the 95th U.S. Open, held June 15â€“18 at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, New York. In the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Open, Corey Pavin won his only major championship, two strokes ahead of runner-up Greg Norman.
Norman began the tournament with rounds of 68-67 before falling back to 74 in the third round, while Tom Lehman fired a third-round 67 to tie Norman for the 54-hole lead. Pavin was three back after rounds of 72-69-71. Norman and Lehman were still tied at the turn, but then Lehman bogeyed 11 and Norman bogeyed 12. Pavin had recorded a birdie at 12, which brought him into a tie with Norman, Lehman, and Bob Tway. Norman and Tway each then suffered bogeys, while Pavin took sole possession of the lead with a birdie at 15. Even with a Norman birdie at the 15th, his first since the opening hole of the third round, nobody could catch Pavin. He sealed the victory with a 4-wood approach to the 18th, running across the fairway as the ball was in the air and raising his hands in triumph after it landed on the green. He carded a 68 and a 280 total, two shots ahead of Norman, who shot a 73.
In the final round, Neal Lancaster set a new tournament record with a 29 on the back-nine. Tiger Woods, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, played in his first U.S. Open but withdrew during the second round with a wrist injury.
This was the third U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills; it previously hosted in 1896 and 1986. It returned nine years later in 2004.
