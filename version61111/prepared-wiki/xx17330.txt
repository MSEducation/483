Increasing the iron content decreases the pressure of the phase transition and narrows the [[wadsleyite]] stability field.  At about 0.8 [[mole fraction]] fayalite, olivine transforms directly to ringwoodite over the pressure range [tpl]convert|10.0|to-|11.5|GPa|atm|abbr=on[/tpl].  Fayalite transforms to [tpl]chem|Fe|2|SiO|4[/tpl] spinel at pressures below [tpl]convert|5|GPa|atm|abbr=on[/tpl]. Increasing the temperature increases the pressure of these phase transitions.

==Weathering==

Olivine is one of the weaker common minerals on the surface according to the Goldich dissolution series.  It weathers to iddingsite (a combination of clay minerals, iron oxides and ferrihydrites) readily in the presence of water.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kuebler, K.; Wang, A.; Haskin, L.

==Uses==

A worldwide search is on for cheap processes to sequester CO2 by mineral reactions, called enhanced weathering. Removal by reactions with olivine is an attractive option, because it is widely available and reacts easily with the (acid) CO2 from the atmosphere. When olivine is crushed, it weathers completely within a few years, depending on the grain size. All the CO2 that is produced by burning 1 liter of oil can be sequestered by less than 1 liter of olivine. The reaction is exothermic but slow. To recover the heat produced by the reaction to produce electricity, a large volume of olivine must be thermally well-isolated. The end-products of the reaction are silicon dioxide, magnesium carbonate and small amounts of iron oxide.[tpl]cite journal | author = Goldberg, P.; Chen, Z.-Y.; O'Connor, W.; Walters, R.; Ziock, H. | url = http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/01/carbon_seq/6c1.pdf | title = CO2 Mineral Sequestration Studies in US | journal = Technology | year = 2000 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages= 1–10 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = Enhanced Weathering: An Effective and Cheap Tool to Sequester CO2 | year = 2006 | last1 = Schuiling | first1 = R.

The aluminium foundry industry uses olivine sand to cast objects in aluminium. Olivine sand requires less water than silica sands while still holding the mold together during handling and pouring of the metal.  Less water means less gas (steam) to vent from the mold as metal is poured into the mold.[tpl]cite book | last = Ammen | first = C.

In Finland, olivine is marketed as an ideal rock for sauna stoves because of its comparatively high density and resistance to weathering under repeated heating and cooling.
Olivine is also used to tap blast furnaces in the steel industry, acting as a plug, removed in each steel run.
