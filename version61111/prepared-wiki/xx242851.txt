==Development==

Immediately following his participation on American Idol, Lambert began writing and recording with predominant pop hit makers such as Lady Gaga, Greg Wells, Max Martin, Linda Perry, RedOne, Ryan Tedder, Evan "Kidd" Bogart, Sam Sparro, Kara DioGuardi, Alex James, Rivers Cuomo and Pink. On October 28, Lambert announced that the lead single would be "For Your Entertainment" produced by Dr. Luke. He tweeted, "Debut single is called 'For Your Entertainment' ..." He also confirmed a song called "Soaked" written by Matthew Bellamy of Muse and a song called "Music Again" written by Justin Hawkins of The Darkness.  Another song from Justin Hawkins titled "Suburban Decay" was also considered for the album, but Lambert decided not to record it, saying it was too different than the rest of the album.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] He also stated that he co-wrote six of the songs on the album: "Strut", "Pick U Up", " Voodoo, "Down The Rabbit Hole," "Aftermath" and "Broken Open". Lambert also announced through Twitter that he had collaborated with Lady Gaga. "Yes it's true: I spent yesterday in the studio with the insanely talented and creative Lady Gaga recording a song that she wrote! I love her."[tpl]cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/278359/adam-lambert-goes-gaga-breaking-collabo-news/ music.yahoo.com|title=Adam Lambert goes "Gaga": Breaking Collabo News|publisher=Yahoo!

===Critical reception===

Critical response to For Your Entertainment was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 71, based on 10 reviews.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/lambertadam/foryourentertainment | title=Adam Lambert:For Your Entertainment (2009): Reviews | work=Metacritic | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=December 21, 2009[/tpl] The Huffington Post called the album "An instant classic" and also stated that "As a whole, For Your Entertainment marks one of the most impressive mainstream pop album debuts in recent memory."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-vogel/review-lamberts-for-your_b_366296.html|title=Review: Adam Lambert's For Your Entertainment Instant Classic|publisher=Huffington Post|last=Vogel|first=Joe|date=2009-11-21|accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] The Detroit News said that "It goes without saying that "For Your Entertainment" is the most poised debut from any "Idol" to date. Lambert has a vision and has successfully honed a sound that pays homage to his heroes while carving a niche for himself." Spin said the album is "perhaps the strongest, most flavorful batch of tunes to reach an AI vet, and Lambert's polymorphous vocal skills unite dancefloor strut and hard-rock pomp in a convincing glam package." Slant Magazine wrote that "'Music Again' and the awkwardly written 'Strut' are every bit as obnoxious as the songs from Mika's The Boy Who Knew Too Much," and that "'Music Again' apes its production and a good deal of its melody from Mika's 'Touches You,' while the title track and lead single is so similar to Sam Sparro's 'Black and Gold' that 19 Entertainment should probably keep a strong legal team on retainer...but questions of originality aside, there's simply no getting around the fact that the Lady Gaga co-write 'Fever' and 'Whataya Want from Me,' written by Pink and Max Martin, are phenomenally well-crafted pop singles that give Lambert the opportunity to shine. To co-opt one of Simon Cowell's favorite phrases: Lambert's music sounds current in a way that Idol albums rarely do." Rolling Stone wrote that "The songs sound great but feel strangely stuffy — Entertainment seems like a disc that was overthought. Next time, the hugely talented Lambert should make sure he's going straight for the gut." In 2010, Adam Lambert was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for "Outstanding Music Artist" for the album For Your Entertainment during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.[tpl]cite web |title=21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards - English Language Nominees |publisher=Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation |year=2010 | url=http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees |accessdate=February 21, 2010[/tpl]
