James Riley (1777, Middletown, Conn.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onlinebiographies.info/oh/merc/riley-j-jw.htm|website=Online Biographies|title=James Riley[/tpl] â€“ 1840 at sea)  was the Captain of the United States merchant ship Commerce.

==Sufferings in Africa==

Riley led his crew through the Sahara Desert, after they were shipwrecked off the coast of Moroccan Western Sahara in August 1815, and wrote a memoir about their ordeal. This true story describes how they came to be shipwrecked and their travails in the Sahara Desert. The book, published in 1817 and originally titled Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig 'Commerce' by the "Late Master and Supercargo" James Riley, is modernly republished as Sufferings in Africa.[tpl]cite book|author=Riley, James|title=Sufferings in Africa|isbn= 1-59048-108-9|date=1817[/tpl] 
The book struck the nineteenth century reader because it was a startling switch on the then-usual master-slave relationship, which was white owners and black slaves.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Lost in this unknown world, Captain Riley felt responsible for his crew and their safety. He told of the events leading to their capture by marauding Sahrawi natives who kept them as slaves. Horribly mistreated, they were beaten, sun-burnt, starved, and forced to drink their own and camel urine.  A slave would be worked until close to death and then either traded or killed.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

Once back on shore, Riley devoted himself to anti-slavery work but eventually returned to a life at sea, where he died of sickness in his sixties. The lives of his crew were foreshortened, no doubt, from complications caused by their hardships in the African desert. The last surviving crewman was the cabin boy, who lived to be 82.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1851, G. Brewster published the Sequel to Riley's Narrative: Being a Sketch of Interesting Incidents in the Life, Voyages and Travels of Capt. James Riley, from the Period of His Return to His Native Land, After His Shipwreck, Captivity and Sufferings Among the Arabs of the Desert, as Related in His Narrative, Until His Death.[tpl]cite book|date=1851|publisher=G.

==Influence==

Riley founded the midwestern village of Willshire, Ohio, which he named for William Willshire, the man who redeemed him from slavery. [tpl]cite book|author=King, Dean |date=2004|title= Skeletons on the Zahara|publisher= Little, Brown and Company|isbn= 978-0-316-83514-5[/tpl]
Abraham Lincoln, who later became president of the United States, listed Sufferings in Africa, as one of the three most influential works that shaped his political ideology, particularly his views on slavery. The others were the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).[tpl]cite news|title=To the Shores of Tripoli |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/weekend/fivebest/?id=110010159|author=Oren, Michael|work=  Wall Street Journal[/tpl]
