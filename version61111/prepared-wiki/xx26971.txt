[[Australian Defence Force]]

CATEGORIES: Commonwealth Government agencies of Australia, Military of Australia, Australian Defence Force

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Australia. It consists of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and a number of 'tri-service' units. The ADF has a strength of just over 80,000 full-time personnel and active reservists, and is supported by the Department of Defence and several other civilian agencies.
During the first decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government established the armed services as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.
The ADF is technologically sophisticated but relatively small. Although the ADF's 57,994 full-time active-duty personnel, 22,072 active reserves and 22,166 standby reserves make it the largest military in Oceania, it is still smaller than most Asian militaries. Nonetheless, the ADF is supported by a significant budget by worldwide standards and is able to deploy forces in multiple locations outside Australia.

==Role==

===Legal standing===

The ADF's legal standing draws on the executive government sections of the Australian Constitution. Section 51(vi) gives the Commonwealth Government the power to make laws regarding Australia's defence and defence forces. Section 114 of the Constitution prevents the States from raising armed forces without the permission of the Commonwealth and Section 119 gives the Commonwealth responsibility for defending Australia from invasion and sets out the conditions under which the government can deploy the defence force domestically.Khosa (2010), p. 2.
Section 68 of the Constitution sets out the ADF's command arrangements. The Section states that "the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative". In practice, however, the Governor-General does not play an active part in the ADF's command structure, and the elected Australian Government controls the ADF. The Minister for Defence and several subordinate ministers exercise this control. The Minister acts on most matters alone, though the National Security Committee of Cabinet (NSC) considers important matters. The Minister then advises the Governor-General who acts as advised in the normal form of executive government.

===Current priorities===

The Australian Government's defence policies are guided by the white paper Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030, which was released in 2009. The white paper argued that Australia's strategic environment is likely to become more complex and uncertain due to the changing relationships between nations in the Asia-Pacific region.Khosa (2011), p. 5 In response to this, it set out a policy of increasing the ADF's capabilities over the period to 2030. This includes significantly expanding the ADF's maritime capabilities, improving the firepower of Army units and equipping the RAAF with modern and more capable aircraft. The ADF's communication, intelligence and logistics capabilities are also to be improved.Khosa (2011), p. 6 The current government has committed to producing new defence white papers "at intervals of no greater than five years" so that changes to Australia's strategic environment are taken into account during defence planning. The next white paper is planned to be released in 2013.[tpl]cite web|last=Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Defence Stephen Smith|title=New Defence White Paper 2013|url=http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/new-defence-white-paper-2013|work=Media release|publisher=Prime Minister Julia Gillard|accessdate=18 June 2012[/tpl]
Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030 identifies Australia's strategic objectives and the ADF capabilities which are necessary for these to be met. It states that "Australia's most basic strategic interest remains the defence of Australia against direct armed attack".Defence (2009), p. 12 To accomplish this, the ADF needs to be capable of dominating the air and sea approaches to Australia, which includes defending the country's sea lanes and infrastructure. The next most important priority is identified as "the security, stability and cohesion of our immediate neighbourhood, which we share with Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, New Zealand and the South Pacific island states". This includes ensuring that the ADF is capable of intervening in these countries to protect Australian citizens, providing humanitarian assistance and, if necessary, stabilising countries at risk of becoming failed states. The third most important priority identified in the white paper is contributing to "the stability of the wider
Asia-Pacific region" and particularly Southeast Asia. This requires that the ADF be able of assisting countries in the region to respond to threats to their security, including in co-operation with the United States. Such assistance may include the deployment of large Australian military forces. The fourth priority set out is "preserving an international order that restrains aggression by states against each other, and can effectively manage other risks and threats". This requires that the ADF be able to contribute limited forces to operations throughout the world.

==History==

===Formation===

Australia has maintained military forces since federation as a nation in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained.Grey (2008), p. 67 In 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth Naval Force.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 467 The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921.Dennis et al. (2008), pp. 61, 457 The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.[tpl]cite web|title=Australians at war|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]
The importance of 'joint' warfare was made clear to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the appointment of a commander in chief of the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent.Horner (2001), p. 42. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.Horner (2001), p. 44.
The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis as a result of the inefficient arrangements which at times hindered the military's efforts during the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single Department of Defence and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The government accepted these recommendations and the Australian Defence Force was established on 9 February 1976.Horner (2001), p. 47.

===Defence of Australia era===

Until the 1970s, Australia's military strategy centred on the concept of 'forward defence', in which the role of the Australian military was to co-operate with allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. In 1969, when the United States began the Guam Doctrine and the British withdrew 'east of Suez', Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance of the Australian continent. This was known as the Defence of Australia Policy. Under this policy, the focus of Australian defence planning was to protect Australia's northern maritime approaches (the sea-air gap) against enemy attack.Tewes, Rayner and Kavanaugh (2004). In line with this goal, the ADF was restructured to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. The ADF achieved this by increasing the capabilities of the RAN and RAAF and relocating regular Army units to northern Australia.Horner (2001), p. 72.
At this time, the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.Horner (2001), pp. 225–227.
Since the late 1980s, the Government has increasingly called upon the ADF to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to Namibia in early 1989, Cambodia between 1992 and 1993, Somalia in 1993, Rwanda between 1994 and 1995 and Bougainville in 1994 and from 1997 onwards.Horner (2001), pp. 228–255.
The Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF. Although the warships and clearance diving team deployed to the Persian Gulf did not see combat, the deployment tested the ADF's capabilities and command structure. Following the war the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.Horner (2001), pp. 231–237.

===East Timor and after===

In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's election campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, there were significant reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. The new government's defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential security threats.Australian Army (2008), p. 81.Horner (2001), pp. 95–96 From 1997 the Government also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.Horner (2001), pp. 93–95
The ADF's experiences during the deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australia's defence policies and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount and sustain such operations.[tpl]cite news |first=Jenny |last=Sinclair |authorlink= |title=Operation Chaos |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/19/1037490107525.html |work=The Age |date=19 December 2002 |accessdate=6 July 2007 [/tpl]. See also Australian National Audit Office (2002). Management of Australian Defence Force Deployments to East Timor. ANAO, Canberra.
In 2000, the Government released a new Defence White Paper, Defence 2000 – Our Future Defence Force that placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year;Thomson (2005b), p. 11. in the event, expenditure increased by 2.3% per annum in real terms in the period to 2012–13. In 2003 and 2005, the Defence Updates emphasised this focus on expeditionary operations and led to an expansion and modernisation of the ADF.Thomson (2006a), pp. 7–8.
Since 2000, the ADF's expanded force structure and deployment capabilities have been put to the test on a number of occasions. Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Australia committed a special forces task group and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships to the Persian Gulf as Operation Slipper.Dennis et al. (2008), pp. 8–9 In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the invasion of Iraq.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 248
Later in 2003, elements of all three services deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. In late 2004, over 1,000 ADF personnel deployed to Indonesia in Operation Sumatra Assist following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.Australian Minister for Defence media release ADF Head Home from Aceh[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. 24 March 2005. In May 2006, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel deployed to East Timor in Operation Astute following unrest between elements of the Timor Leste Defence Force.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 193

===Current operations===

In January 2014, around 2,200 ADF personnel were deployed on operations in Australian territory and overseas. Approximately 800 of these personnel were taking part in domestic maritime security tasks.[tpl]cite web|title=Global Operations|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/op/index.htm|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=24 January 2014[/tpl]  
The ADF currently has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's contribution to the international coalition against terrorism in Afghanistan (designated Operation Slipper) is the largest ADF deployment, with about 500 personnel in the country at any time. Operation Slipper also includes the deployment of one of the RAN's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties. Overall, about 800 personnel are deployed to areas in the Middle East other than Afghanistan as part of the operation. Many of these personnel are stationed at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates.[tpl]cite web|title=Operation SLIPPER|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/operations/afghanistan/home.asp|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=24 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Edmunds|first=Marian|title=Road home from Afghanistan won't be easy|url=http://www.afr.com/p/road_home_from_afghanistan_won_be_wfUSDcNsqLtAQu4b2kHOqO|accessdate=4 June 2013|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|date=6 September 2012[/tpl] The Australian force in Iraq is now limited to four officers attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. The ADF also maintains three small contributions totalling 57 personnel to peacekeeping operations in the Middle East and Africa. All ADF units in the Middle East come under the overall command of Joint Task Force 633, whose headquarters is located at Al Minhad Air Base.[tpl]cite web|title=Al Minhad Air Base|url=http://nautilus.org/publications/books/australian-forces-abroad/bases/mirage/#axzz2VFNH5Dll|publisher=Nautilus Institute|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/australias-basing-its-87m-secret-on-sensitive-absurdity-20091107-i2vy.html|title=Australia's basing its $87m secret on sensitive absurdity|last=Hyland|first=Tom|date=8 November 2009|work=The Age|accessdate=13 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100115012903/http://www.theage.com.au/national/australias-basing-its-87m-secret-on-sensitive-absurdity-20091107-i2vy.html| archivedate= 15 January 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
