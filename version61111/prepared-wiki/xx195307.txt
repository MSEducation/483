Woodland Christian High School (WCHS) is a secondary school located in Breslau, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1976 by a group of churches in the Cambridge area, Woodland provides Christian based education. It was the belief of the founders that it was their responsibility, as Christians, and people of God, to establish a school in which all of its courses and activities would honor Jesus Christ, and would lead students to a deeper understanding of Him, and what it means to serve Him.  For several years it operated from several Church facilities in the Cambridge and Kitchenerâ€“Waterloo areas. In 1983, the school moved into its current location. The facility had a large expansion and renovation which took place in 1999.
Woodland draws students from an area bounded by Ayr, Cambridge, Rockwood, New Dundee, Listowel, Drayton, and Waterloo encompassing Kitchener and Guelph.
Woodland's sports teams, the Cavaliers, compete in District 8 Athletic Association of the Central Western Ontario Secondary Schools Association, as well as the Ontario Christian Secondary Schools Athletic Association. Cavalier teams include girls' and boys' volleyball, basketball, soccer, badminton, cross-country, and track & field.
Woodland is a member of the  Ontario Alliance of Christian Schools.
