===Description===

The Or Zaruaa Synagogue is a two level  building situated on a hill, 258 square meters in size, in the Nachlaot neighbourhood, centrally located in the core of Jerusalem. The exterior walls are covered with Jerusalem stone, as mandated for all buildings in Jerusalem, making the construction solid. The first floor was built to provide the Rabbi and leader of the community, a dwelling home, which serves today as a kindergarten. The second floor which is the synagogue itself, is designed in a typical Spanish North-African style, where the seating for the men prayers surrounds the Bimah (stage). The hall has a very high ceiling, and it includes a gallery section for the women (ezrat nashim). Tall windows are accentuated by massive stone frames, curved at the top. The window panes are decorated with paintings and ornaments.

==History==

[/ref] Ma’araviim committee representative, who explained and emphasized the importance of construction in the land of Israel, creating a stronghold foundation. He thanked and praised Yamin Ben Harroch who, in addition to donating to his Jewish community in Melilla, remembered Jerusalem and through his kindness a temple was established, which will be surrounded by new neighbourhoods which will be built and more inhabitants will reside. Mr. Elmalih mentioned the major involvement of Rabbi Amram Aburbeh who was commended for his efforts convincing Yamin Ben Harroch and drawing his interest and attention to Jerusalem to build in the land of Israel. Rabbi Eliyahu Lagimi who followed with a speech and stated the significance of the mitzvah of building, especially in the city of Jerusalem, later became the capital of the Jewish state. Rabbi Nissim Elishar was honored to put on the first corner stone and after him, the rest of the honoured guests followed, adding the next stones.
Rabbi Amram Aburbeh insisted that the construction workers crew will be Jewish.During the constructions every morning before starting to build the workers had to wash and dip in a Mikveh, the reason for purity was due to the fact that they build a sacred place.http://www.meirtv.co.il/site/article/?id=1214

Between 1925 and 1927 Mr. Yamin Ben Harroch parallelly allocated money for construction of another Synagoguehttp://wikimapia.org/10370768/es/Sinagoga-Or-Zaruah in his home town of Melilla, Spain, where Enrique Nieto (architect) the well known architect, was in charge of the plans. This Synagogue was also named Or Zaruaa.Noach Klinger article: Melilla, the far brothers (In Spanish: Melilla los hermanos lejanos) http://www.delacole.com/cgiperl/medios/vernota.cgimedio=comunidades&numero=382&nota=382-3
Both Or Zaruaa Synagogues in Jerusalem and Melilla,http://mem-guimel.blogspot.co.il/ bear the same name, same philanthropist, resemble each other in style by several aspects of interior design such as: the high ceiling, the marble stone wall engraved dedications, colored stained glass tall curved windows, the ladies gallery (ezrat nashim) design and the unique multiple illuminating chandeliers. The original chandeliers, originally from Italy are still present in both synagogues and connected to modern electricity, which later gave the name Or Zaruaa a special dimension to its name since "Or" in Hebrew means "light".Interior of Jerusalem synagogueMelilla synagogue interior
