Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner (31 March 1858 – 25 August 1935) was a British peace activist, author, atheist and freethinker, and the daughter of Charles Bradlaugh.

==Early life and teaching==

She was born Hypatia Bradlaugh, at 3 Hedger's Terrace, Hackney, London,[tpl]cite web|last=Royle|first=Edward|title=Bonner, Hypatia Bradlaugh (1858–1935)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/47684|work=ODNB|publisher=OUP|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl] the second daughter of Charles Bradlaugh, the first openly atheist Member of Parliament and founder of the National Secular Society, and Susannah Lamb Hooper. She was named after Hypatia, the Ancient Greek philosopher, mathematician, astronomer and teacher, who was murdered by a Christian mob.
Bradlaugh Bonner was educated in private schools in London and Paris, and qualified as a science teacher from the University of London,[tpl]cite book|title=Obituary Notice – Mrs Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner|year=1935|publisher=South Place Ethical Society|location=London|authorlink=J. P. G.|month=October[/tpl] which admitted women to "full privileges" (i.e. degrees) in 1878. She taught in the Hall of Science for the South Kensington Science and Art Examinations, and also acted as a secretary for her father after 1888.
The Halls of Science were mainly for adult education and self-help, like those offered by Mechanics' Institutes and religious organisations at the time.Royle (1976), p.118 The South Kensington Hall of Science was started by Edward Aveling, and other teachers included her sister Alice Bradlaugh (1856–1888) and Annie Besant. The results from the South Kensington Hall of Science were very good, with students exceeding the national average on their examinations in all but one of their offered classes.Royle (1980), p.319.
Bonner was also a lecturer for the National Secular SocietyRoyle (1980), p.151. and the Rationalist Press Association.Royle (1980), p.167.

==Writing==

Bonner is most remembered for being the author of her father's biography, Charles Bradlaugh: His Life and Work.  The Spectator considered the two volumes to be more memoirs than a biography: "That it is preposterously long is manifest at once. More than eight hundred closely printed pages are too much for Charles Bradlaugh, viewed in regard to his real importance in the world", but accepted, "A day will come when they will be found useful".[tpl]cite web|last=Fisher|first=T.|title=Charles Bradlaugh By Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner. 2 vols.|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/6th-july-1895/29/charles-bradlaugh-by-hypatia-bradlaugh-bonner-2-vo|work=The Spectator|publisher=The Spectator|accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
From 1897 to 1904, she was editor of The Reformer, the main purpose of which according to Bernard Porter was to "vindicate her father's career".[tpl]cite book|last=Porter|first=Bernard|title=Critics of empire British radicals and the imperial challenge|year=2008|publisher=I.

However, she was an active contributor to many secularist periodicals including the National Reformer and author of many other books relating to secularism, blasphemy and freethinking. In Penalties upon Opinion she catalogues various trials and cases of blasphemy[tpl]cite book|last=Bradlaugh Bonner|first=Hypatia|title=Penalties Upon Opinion|year=1935|publisher=Watts & Co.|location=London[/tpl] including the recent revival in blasphemy prosecutions in the first decades of the 20th century.

==Publications==

==Peace activism==

In the lead up to the First World War most peace societies were Christian associations. In 1910, Bonner became the chairperson of the first secular peace society, the Rationalist Peace Society.Royle (1980), p.213. The aim of the society was to "protest against ideas and methods which are utterly opposed to reason and the interests of social progress".[tpl]cite web|title=Rationalist Peace Society|url=http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/Library/Library-and-Archive-Collections/Freethought-and-Humanism/Rationalist-Peace-Society|accessdate=8 August 2013|location=Bishopsgate Institute|page=Bishopsgate Institute[/tpl] In her introduction to Essays towards peace, Hypatia noted that there was a "growing public opinion in favour of arbitration as the alternative to war" and that it was reason that demonstrated "the futility, the brutality, the economic waste, the immorality of war".[tpl]cite book|title=Essays towards peace|year=1913|publisher=Watts and Co|location=London|page=10[/tpl]
The Rationalist Peace Society remained active throughout the war, but fell into decline after peace was concluded.[tpl]cite web|title=Rationalist Peace Society|url=http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/Library/Library-and-Archive-Collections/Freethought-and-Humanism/Rationalist-Peace-Society|publisher=Bishopsgate Institute|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]
