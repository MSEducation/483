Melik was born in the village of Črna Vas in Carniola, part of Austria-Hungary. Before and during World War I, he studied at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1916 in history and geography. Later he was employed as a secondary school teacher.

Between 1938 and 1966, he was a professor of geomorphology at the Department of Geography at the University of Ljubljana, succeeding professor Artur Gavazzi in 1938. With his work in this field he established his well-known geomorphological school.
In 1935–1936, the prestigious publishing house Slovenska matica published his monumental work Geografija Slovenije (The Geography of Slovenia) in two volumes with a general regional part, later extended with four additional books between 1954 and 1960, with a detailed regional description of particular areas of Slovenia: the Alps, Styria with Prekmurje and the Mežica Valley, the Sava Valley, and the Slovenian Littoral.
