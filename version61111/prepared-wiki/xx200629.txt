==Reception==

Kathy Justice of Indy Week called it "low on camp and high on suspense", with a plot that resembles the 2006 French cult film 13 Tzameti.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A182772|last=Justice|first=Kathy|date=February 20, 2006|title=Nevermore Film Fest saves horror from those who would destroy it|accessdate=2008-10-17[/tpl]  Scott Foy of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and called it derivative of Cube, Saw, and Battle Royale.  Foy wrote that the film fails to live up to its potential, as too  much of it seems like filler.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/breathing-room-dvd|title=Breathing Room (DVD)|last=Foy|first=Scott|work=Dread Central|date=2008-09-18|accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl]  Rod Lott of the Oklahoma Gazette called it a "largely effective, efficient film" that is 85% Cube and 15% Saw.  Lott gave the film "an A for effort, and a C for execution."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-8164-breathing-room.html|title=Breathing Room|last=Lott|first=Rod|work=Oklahoma Gazette|date=2008-09-20|accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl]  David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it a "taunt, well-made whodunit" with a convoluted denouement.  Johnson wrote that the challenges that the characters face are not memorable or clever, but the characters' reactions are interesting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/breathingroom.php|title=Breathing Room|work=DVD Verdict|date=2008-11-14|accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl]  Marc Patterson of BrutalAsHell.com rated the film 2/5 stars and called it too unoriginal to enjoy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brutalashell.com/2009/01/dvd-review-breathing-room/|title=DVD Review: Breathing Room|last=Patterson|first=Marc|work=BrutalAsHel.com|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl]
