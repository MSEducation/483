[[Mineral wool]]

CATEGORIES: Materials, Building insulation materials

Mineral wool, mineral fibres, or man-made mineral fibres are fibres made from natural or synthetic minerals.   The term "man-made mineral fibres" is generally used to refer solely to synthetic materials including fibreglass, ceramic fibres and stone wool.  Industrial applications of mineral wool include thermal insulation (as both structural insulation and pipe insulation), filtration, soundproofing, and germination of seedlings.

==History==

Slag wool was first made in 1840 in Wales by Edward Parry "but no effort appears to have been made to confine the wool after production; consequently it floated about the works with the slightest breeze, and became so injurious to the men that the process had to be abandoned".Spon, Ernest. Workshop Receipts ... London: E. & F. N. Spon, 18831892. Page 439 It was first produced commercially in 1871 at the Georgsmarienhütte in Osnabrück Germany.

==Manufacture==

Stone wool is a furnace product of molten rock at a temperature of about 1600 °C,  through which a stream of air or steam is blown. More advanced production techniques are based on spinning molten rock on high speed spinning wheels somewhat like the process used to prepare cotton candy. The final product is a mass of fine, intertwined fibres with a typical diameter of 6 to 10 micrometers. Mineral wool may contain a binder, often food grade starch, and an oil to reduce dusting.

==Usage==

Though the individual fibers conduct heat very well, when pressed into rolls and sheets, their ability to partition air makes them excellent heat insulators and sound absorbers.[ref]Weiner, Ethan. Acoustic Treatment and Design for
Recording Studios and Listening Rooms.  "Without question, the most effective absorber for midrange and high frequencies is rigid fiberglass."http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html#rigid%20fiberglass.[/ref]Houghton, Matt. Sound On Sound. "What is the best density for a good, fairly wide-spectrum absorber? . . .try looking for mineral wool in the region of 45-75kg/m3." http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct10/articles/qa-1010-2.htm Though not immune to the effects of a sufficiently hot fire, the fire resistance of fiberglass, stone wool and ceramic fibers makes them common building materials when passive fire protection is required, being used as spray fireproofing, in stud cavities in drywall assemblies and as packing materials in firestops.
Mineral wools are unattractive to rodents, but will provide a structure for bacterial growth if allowed to become wet.
Other uses are in resin bonded panels, as a growth medium in hydroponics, as filler in compounds for gaskets, in brake pads, in plastics in the automotive industry and as a filtering medium.
Mineral fibers are produced in the same way, without binder. The fiber as such is used as a raw material for its reinforcing purposes in various applications, such as friction materials, gaskets, plastics and coatings.

===In hydroponics===

Mineral wool products can hold large quantities of water and air that aid root growth and nutrient uptake in hydroponics; their fibrous nature also provides a good mechanical structure to hold the plant stable.  The naturally high pH of mineral wool makes them initially unsuitable to plant growth and requires "conditioning" to produce a wool with an appropriate, stable pH.[tpl]cite book |url = http://books.google.co.id/books?id=cHT3bMm3njsC&dq=rockwool&hl=id&source=gbs_navlinks_s |title = The Best of Growing Edge |author = Tom Alexander, Don Parker |year = 1994 |publisher = New Moon Publishing, Inc. |isbn = 9780944557013[/tpl][tpl]rp|16[/tpl]

==Safety of material==

Precautions need to be taken when handling a fiber product, as it can irritate the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Prolonged exposure could lead to long-term effects, and some types of mineral wool are considered a possible carcinogen to humans, similar to asbestos[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]. This effect may depend upon the fiber diameter and length, chemical composition and persistence within the body.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has reviewed the carcinogenicity of man-made mineral fibres in October 2002.IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 81 (2002), Man-made Vitreous Fibres (PLEASE NOTE: Some manufacturers of insulation products[tpl]Who|date=December 2011[/tpl] have cited this volume while making erroneous claims that "IARC scientists confirm safety of mineral wool insulation". These claims are just false. The findings in this volume are not a determination of non-carcinogenicity or overall safety.) 
The IARC Monograph's working group concluded only the more biopersistent materials remain classified by IARC as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B). These include refractory ceramic fibres, which are used industrially as insulation in high-temperature environments such as blast furnaces, and certain special-purpose glass wools not used as insulating materials. In contrast, the more commonly used vitreous fibre wools, including insulation glass wool, stone wool and slag wool, are considered "not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans" (Group 3).
High biosoluble fibres (HT-fibres) are produced that do not cause damage to the human cell. These newer materials have been tested for carcinogenicity and most are found to be noncarcinogenic, or to cause tumours in experimental animals only under very restricted conditions of exposure. The IARC Monograph's working group "elected not to make an overall evaluation of the newly developed fibres designed to be less biopersistent such as the alkaline earth silicate or high-alumina, low-silica wools. This decision was made in part because no human data were available, although such fibres that have been tested appear to have low carcinogenic potential in experimental animals, and because the Working Group had difficulty in categorizing these fibres into meaningful groups based on chemical composition."IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 81 (2002), Man-made Vitreous Fibres, Overall evaluation, p. 339
This irritation to the skin is not a chemical irritation, but only a temporary mechanical irritation, comparable with exposure of the skin to bio soluble materials such as straw, grass, or hay.
