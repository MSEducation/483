HMV Retail Ltd, formerly HMV Group plc, is a British entertainment retailing company operating in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index. The first HMV branded store was opened by the Gramophone Company on Oxford Street in 1921, and the HMV name was also used for television and radio sets manufactured from the 1930s onwards. The retail side of the business began to expand in the 1960s, and in 1998 was divested from EMI, the successor to the Gramophone Company, to form what would become HMV Group. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) prior to administration was Trevor Moore; he replaced Simon Fox on 3 September 2012.[tpl]cite web |title=Directorate Change  |url=http://www.hmvgroup.com/~/media/Files/H/HMV-Group/pdf/news/2012/HMV-directorate-change-02-08-2012.pdf |publisher=HMV Group |accessdate=21 October 2012[/tpl]

==History==

===20th century===

The antecedents of HMV began in the 1890s at the dawn of the disc gramophone. By 1902 it had become the beginnings of the Gramophone Company. In February 1907 they commenced building of a new dedicated record factory at Hayes, Middlesex. Disc records were sold in music shops and independent retailers at this time. In 1921 the Gramophone Company opened the first dedicated HMV shop in Oxford Street in London, in a former men's clothing shop; the composer Edward Elgar participated in the opening ceremonies.[tpl]cite news |title=1921: HMV's first store is opened by Edward Elgar |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2013/jan/15/hmv-shop-london-first-elgar-london-1921 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |location=London[/tpl] In March 1931 the Gramophone Company merged with Columbia Graphophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI).
From the 1930s onwards, HMV manufactured radio and television sets and radiograms under the HMV and Marconiphone brand names in their factory at Hayes, Middlesex.
In 1966 HMV began expanding its retail operations in London. Throughout the 1970s, the company continued to expand, doubling in size, and in six years became the country's leading specialist music retailers. It faced new competition, however, from Virgin Megastores, established in 1976, and Our Price, established in 1972. Subsequently, HMV overtook Our Price in popularity and threatened their existence, having established a chain of newer, larger stores.
The company opened its flagship store at a new location on Oxford Street in 1986. It was the largest record store in the world at the time, and the official opening was attended by Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence.[tpl]cite news |title=HMV: How the top dog lost its bite |author=Philip Beeching |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21028803 |newspaper=BBC News Online |date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] Growth continued for a third decade into the 1990s, with the company reaching over 320 stores. HMV celebrated its 75-year anniversary in 1996.
In 1998 HMV Media was spun off from EMI, leaving EMI with a 43% stake in HMV Media. The same year, the company bought the Waterstone's chain of bookshops and merged them with Dillons.WH Smith unloads book shop chain

In 2006 the HMV Group purchased the Ottakar's book chain and merged it into Waterstone's.

The Commission stated that the takeover would "not result in a substantial lessening of competition".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2938612/HMV-merger-with-Ottakars-cleared.html |title=HMV merger with OOttakers cleared |work=The Daily Telegraph| date=12 May 2006|accessdate=16 August 2009 | location=London | first=Caroline | last=Muspratt[/tpl] Waterstone's then announced that it had successfully negotiated a takeover of Ottakar's on 31 May 2006.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/jun/01/media |title=Ottaker's accepts HMV takeover though price is slashed |work=The Guardian| date=1 June 2006|accessdate=16 August 2009 | location=London | first=Fiona | last=Walsh[/tpl]

Eventually HMV had ten stores with the Fopp name, including two new stores in Exeter and Gower Street, London.

As part of chief executive Simon Fox's plans, HMV started a joint venture with Curzon Artificial Eye to bring cinemas to HMV and Waterstone's stores across England. The first trial store was in Wimbledon, London. The cinema is located above the shop in a former storage room converted into three separate screens and a bar. It has its own entrance, so can be visited outside store hours, and one within the store.

==Operations==

As of August 2013, HMV has 133 stores across the United Kingdom, together with 9 stores trading under the Fopp brand. Following the purchase by Hilco UK, it was reported that the company was seeking to reduce the number of store staff across the business, as part of an effort to save £7.8 million on the wages budget. Stores would lose security staff, cashiers and supervisors, with managers required to provide cover.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/hilco-to-cut-400-hmv-jobs-report/0114090 |title=Hilco to cut 400 jobs - report |author=Ben Parfitt |date=15 April 2013 |publisher=MCV |accessdate=17 April 2013[/tpl] As of October 2013, HMV has five stores in Ireland.[tpl]cite news |date=14 October 2013 |title=HMV to reopen Irish website in days ahead of big UK relaunch |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/hmv-to-reopen-irish-website-in-days-ahead-of-big-uk-relaunch-29657205.html |newspaper=Independent |accessdate=19 October 2013[/tpl]

==Former operations==

===Australia===

In 1989 the HMV Group established its first Australian store in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta, closely followed by a second store in Chatswood in that same year. In 1990, HMV opened its flagship store in Sydney's CBD. The 1,207-square-meter superstore in Pitt Street Mall was the largest music store in the Southern Hemisphere and sold more CDs than any other store in the country. It was also awarded the ARIA Charts store of the Year on 3 occasions. By 1998, a further 27 stores were opened in key retail centres on the eastern seaboard of Australia, including other large footprint stores at Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall and Brisbane's 585-square-meter Queen Street Mall store.[tpl]cite web | url=http://superbrands.com.au/index.php/volumes/volume-2/79-volumes/volume-2/254-hmv-vol-2| title=Superbrands: HMV Australia | publisher=Superbrands.com | accessdate=21 June 2012 [/tpl]
In March 2000, HMV made local headlines when their larger rival, Sanity, signed a five-year deal with Festival Mushroom Records for a three-year online exclusivity window on all tracks downloaded from that label at Sanity's website. Sanity's competitors and other online services were meant to be blocked from Festival Mushroom's catalogue for that period unless Sanity agreed to deal with them. Chaos.com and Leading Edge Music both made public threats to boycott Festival Mushroom's content, but HMV Australia (whose website did not offer downloading) followed through, removing all CDs from their domestic stores, adding they would do the same overseas. By the next week, Festival Mushroom backed down, stating Sanity would simply be the wholesaler of their digital downloads for the next three years, requiring them to make all products available to other retailers at the time of release.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/news-corp-unit-sanitycom-plan-online-deal | title=News Corp Unit, Sainty.com Plan Online Deal | publisher=Telecompaper | accessdate=21 June 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s108985.htm|title=ABC Radio PM: HMV boycotts the Festival Mushroom Group|first=Bronwyn|last=Adcock|work=PM (ABC Radio)|date=9 March 2000|accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.downloadsongs.com.au/download-songs-articles/2000/3/17/new-deal-sounds-better-to-retailers/|title=New Deal Sounds Better To Retailers|first=Patrick|last=Donovan|work=The Age|date=17 March 2000|accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl]
In October 2005, Sanity's owner, Brazin Limited acquired the Australian operations of HMV for A$4 million (£1.7 million). The HMV Group's agreement with Brazin was to phase out the HMV brand in Australia by 2010. Immediately after this acquisition of HMV's 32 outlets, this put Brazin at its peak with its 74 Virgin Megastore and Virgin At Myer stores, in addition to Sanity's 215, and EzyDVD's 63 outlets around the country (not counting non-entertainment retail chains within Brazin, such as Bras 'N' Things) and was by far Australia's largest entertainment retailer with close to 43% of the music retail market. However, most HMV stores in Australia had very high overhead costs due to their large footprints and expensive locations, thus most were gradually closed upon the end of rental leases. The remaining stores were re-branded to Sanity over the next five years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Brazin-to-buy-HMV-music-stores-for-4m/2005/09/28/1127804540782.html|title=Brazin to buy HMV music stores for $4m|agency=AAP|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 September 2005|accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/hmv-sells-australian-stores-to-brazin-1001217713.story|title=HMV Sells Australian Stores To Brazin|first=Christie|last=Eliezer|work=Billboard|date=28 September 2005|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl] The horizontal merger was approved by the ACCC that same month leaving Brazin to merge marketing and general operations within the one entertainment division. Also in October, Brazin officially launched its Pulse loyalty card after a year of testing in the market. It worked by giving the customer one point for every dollar spent across Brazin's store network, receiving a $5 discount voucher or other offers once 100 points were reached.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visibleresults.com/about/articles_pr/pr_article_028.htm |title=Visible Results Solution, "Australian Retail's Most Innovative And Dynamic Customer Loyalty Program" Says Brazin Limited CEO |publisher=Visible Results |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]
By December 2006, HMV had already shrunk to 22 outlets from its peak of 32 the year before.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/others/brazin-data-returns-to-aus-charts-1003495396.story|title=Brazin Data Returns To Aus Charts|first=Christie|last=Eliezer|work=Billboard|date=11 December 2006|accessdate=23 January 2013[/tpl]
HMV's Australian flagship store in Pitt Street Mall was shut down on Friday 31 August 2007, when the Mid City Centre shopping centre it was located in was closed for renovation, and the large Bourke Street Mall store closed on Tuesday 19 February 2008. By mid-2010 the last HMV store was closed in Brisbane by Sanity Entertainment (formerly Brazin Limited), and the last re-branded HMV store trading as Sanity closed at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre in December 2012.

===Canada===

HMV established a subsidiary in Canada in 1988 following the purchase of Mister Sound by EMI Music Canada. In June 2011, HMV sold the business for £2 million to Hilco.[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8600295/HMV-confirms-sale-of-stores-in-Canada-for-2m.html|title=HMV confirms sale of stores in Canada for £2m|author=Amanda Andrews|author2=Matthew Holehouse|date=27 June 2011|location=London[/tpl] As of 2012, HMV Canada has 113 stores. It remains a separate business to HMV in the UK, despite both companies being owned by Hilco.

===USA===

HMV stores in the U.S. did not have rights to the His Master's Voice trademark; in those countries, that trademark is part of the RCA trademark portfolio owned by Technicolor SA and licensed to others., HMV was not prevented from using its initials in the U.S.
HMV had a handful of stores in the Eastern United States, which in their final years were overseen by HMV's Canadian operations. In the 1990s they had a significant presence in Manhattan.
Poor real estate decisions made in the early 1990s rendered the United States stores uneconomical and HMV gradually extricated itself from leases, and the final store in the United States, having lost £500,000 in 2003 and £1 million in 2004, closed on 3 November 2004.

===Japan===

In July 2007, HMV Japan, which operates 62 shops, was sold to DSM Investment Catorce. The stores and HMV Japan website continue to trade as HMV, but is no longer owned by HMV Group.[ref]

Since JVC Kenwood Holdings (through its JVC and Victor Entertainment subsidiaries) controls the His Master's Voice trademark in Japan, HMV Japan used a stylised gramophone of its own design as its trademark. As with the former U.S. and Canadian operations, HMV Japan's use of the initials "HMV" has never been challenged.
On 28 October 2010 the Japanese convenience store giant Lawson acquired all shares of HMV Japan from Daiwa Securities SMBCPI for ¥ 1.8 billion. KK HMV Japan became a part of Lawson, and was renamed KK Lawson HMV Entertainment (株式会社 ローソンHMVエンタテイメント) on 1 December in the same year. Terms of the deal were published on official websites.HMVジャパンの完全子会社に関する株式譲渡契約を締結 (in Japanese)

It went on make the first audio recording in India, of singer Gauhar Jan in 1902, and witnessed Indian cinema going talkies in 1931 leading to a boom in film based songs.

===Hong Kong and Singapore===

In 1994, the first HMV store was opened in shopping centre Windsor House on 311, Gloucester Road, Hong Kong. HMV began opening stores in shopping malls that were newly opened. HMV in Hong Kong appeals to the crowd that enjoy wide-ranging music choice, organised and free-sampling environment which many other records cannot match. The Tsim Sha Tsui flagship store, spanning 4 storeys at the corner of Peking Road and Hankow Road, was the largest record store in the territory until 2006, when it was re-located to another smaller location on Hankow Road.[ref]
