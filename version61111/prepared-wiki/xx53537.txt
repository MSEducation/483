Bob Hope Airport [tpl]airport codes|BUR|KBUR|BUR[/tpl] is a public airport three miles (5 km) northwest of downtown Burbank, in Los Angeles County, California. The airport serves the northern Greater Los Angeles area, including Glendale, Pasadena, and the San Fernando Valley. It is closer to Griffith Park and Hollywood than Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and is the only airport in the area with a direct rail connection to downtown Los Angeles. Non-stop flights go mostly to cities in the western United States, but JetBlue Airways has a daily red-eye flight to New York.
The airport was originally in the city limits, but the north end of Runway 15/33 has been extended into the city of Los Angeles.
The airport is owned by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, controlled by the governments of those cities. The Airport Authority contracts with TBI Airport Management, Inc. to operate the airport. TBI Airport Management was acquired by ADC & HAS Airports Worldwide in July 2013 with the transaction closing on October 1, 2013. The airport has its own police department, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority Police. Boarding uses airstairs or ramps rather than jet bridges.
Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 2,647,287 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 2,294,991 in 2009, and 2,239,804 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a primary commercial service airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

==History==

The airport has been Angeles Mesa Drive Airport (1928–1930),Boeing System: Pacific Air Transport Timetable 1929 United Airport (1930–1934), Union Air Terminal (1934–1940), Lockheed Air Terminal (1940–1967), Hollywood-Burbank Airport (1967–1978), Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (1978–2003) and most recently Bob Hope Airport (2003–present).
Boeing Aircraft and Transport (BA&T) was a holding company created in 1928 that included Boeing Aircraft and United Air Lines, itself a holding company for a collection of small airlines that continued to operate under their own names. One of these airlines was Pacific Air Transport (PAT), which Boeing had acquired because of PAT's west coast mail contract in January 1928.D. D. Hatfield, Los Angeles Aeronautics, 1920–1929 (Inglewood, CA:Northrop University Press, 1973, 1976), 111; William Garvey and David Fisher, The Age of Flight: A History of America's Pioneering Airline (Greensboro, NC: Pace Communications, 2002), 206–07. BA&T then sought a suitable site for a new airport for PAT, and found one in Burbank. BA&T had the benefit of surveys that the Aeronautics Department of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce had conducted starting in 1926 to identify potential airport sites.Dr. Ford A. Carpenter, A Preliminary Report on the Airports or Landing Fields of Los Angeles County, prepared for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, October 1, 1926, typescript in the LAX Archive. This report includes photographs and descriptions of existing airports, including meteorological data and a location map. Regional Planning Commission, County of Los Angeles, Master Plan (Los Angeles, CA: Hall of Records, 1929.) Some authors claim, without documentation, that a federal Department of Commerce survey identified the site. The fact that Dr. Carpenter had been the Los Angeles meteorologist for the U. S. Weather Bureau and the Chamber's "Department of Aeronautics" name may explain the confusion.
It took BA&T a year and the cooperation of the city to assemble the site.Burbank City Council, Minutes, January 29, 1929; March 26, 1929; April 16, 1929.  The [tpl]convert|234|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] site was rife with vines and trees and the ground had to be filled and leveled, but it had good drainage, a firm landing surface, steady winds, and good access to ground transport.United Airport of Burbank," typescript information sheet in the Archives of the Burbank Historical Society; n.p., but 1–2. Construction was completed in just seven months. In an age when few aircraft had brakes and many had a tail skid instead of a wheel, runways were not usually paved; those at Burbank had a [tpl]convert|5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] mixture of oil and sand. There were no taxi strips, but the designers left room for them. Two of the runways were over [tpl]convert|3600|ft[/tpl] long; a third was [tpl]convert|2900|ft[/tpl]; all were [tpl]convert|300|ft[/tpl] wide. Generous dimensions, and the site had room for expansion."United Airport of Burbank," 3; Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission, A Comprehensive Report on the Master Plan of Airports for the Los Angeles County Regional Planning District (1940), 122.

United Airport was dedicated amid much festivity (including an air show) on Memorial Day weekend (May 30 – June 1), 1930. The airport and its handsome Spanish revival terminal was a showy competitor to nearby Grand Central Airport in Glendale, which was then Los Angeles' main airline terminal. The new Burbank facility was actually the largest commercial airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the Los Angeles Airport in Westchester when that facility (formerly Mines Field, then Los Angeles Municipal Airport) commenced scheduled airline operations.
The Burbank facility remained United Airport until 1934 when it was renamed Union Air Terminal.  The name change came the same year that Federal anti-trust actions caused United Aircraft and Transport Corp. to dissolve, which took effect September 26, 1934.  The Union Air Terminal moniker stuck until Lockheed bought the airport in 1940 and renamed it Lockheed Air Terminal.
In March 1939, 16 airline departures a day were scheduled out of Burbank: eight on United Airlines, five on Western Airlines and three on TWA (American Airlines' three departures were still at Glendale).[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |year=1939 |title=Official Aviation Guide |publisher= Official Aviation Guide Company |publication-place=Chicago IL |page= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl] Commercial air traffic continued even while Lockheed's extensive factories supplied the war effort and developed numerous military and commercial aircraft into the mid-1960s. The April 1957 OAG shows nine weekday departures on Western, six on United, six on Pacific Air Lines (which subsequently merged with Bonanza Airlines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West), one on TWA and one on American Airlines (a nonstop to Chicago Midway). Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) had 48 Douglas DC-4 departures a week to SFO and SAN (PSA did not fly out of LAX until 1958).[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |year=1957 |title=Official Airline Guide |publisher=American Aviation Publications |publication-place=Washington DC |page= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl]
In the late 1960s Pacific Airlines Boeing 727-100s flew nonstop to Las Vegas.  Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) flew Boeing 727-200s, McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and BAe 146s from Burbank.  Hughes Airwest (previously Air West) DC-9s flew nonstop to Las Vegas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Denver with onestop DC-9s to Houston Hobby Airport.  Hughes Airwest even had one-stop jets to Grand Canyon National Park Airport near the south rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1986 United Airlines Boeing 767s flew nonstop to Chicago, the largest passenger airliner ever scheduled to Burbank. AirCal McDonnell Douglas MD-80s flew nonstop to the Bay Area and direct to Lake Tahoe.
At 3:30 p.m. on February 13, 1966, a fire broke out in a greasy flue in the kitchen of the terminal building's second-floor restaurant, The Sky Room. Fanned by gusty winds, the fire spread through the terminal and control tower. Controllers in the tower were able to escape on an aerial ladder and air traffic was diverted to nearby Van Nuys Airport and Los Angeles International Airport for several hours. A controller communicated with aircraft using the radio in a light airplane belonging to Sky Roamers Air Travel, a flying club whose hangar was just east of the control tower. The fire, contained by about 6:30 p.m., caused an estimated $2 million in damages to the terminal, tower and equipment in the tower. No injuries were reported.
Lockheed officials declared that the airport would reopen the next day, and it did, using electronic equipment borrowed from LAX and set up in a nearby hangar. The hangar also served as the airport's temporary passenger terminal and baggage claim area. The gutted terminal and tower were rebuilt and reopened the following year.
In 1967 Lockheed renamed the facility Hollywood-Burbank Airport. In 1969 Continental Airlines began Boeing 720B flights to Portland and Seattle via San Jose and also flew the short hop to Ontario. Continental later switched to Boeing 727-200 jetliners with some flights continuing on to Chicago O'Hare via Ontario. Continental went on to serve Denver with nonstop Boeing 727-200 service from BUR. Later Alaska Airlines initiated nonstop and direct Boeing 727-200 flights to Seattle and Portland from BUR which was Alaska Air's first service to southern California.  More recently Aloha Airlines pioneered flights to Hawaii, flying Boeing 737-700 jetliners nonstop to Honolulu before ceasing operations due to financial problems.
The facility remained Hollywood-Burbank Airport for more than a decade until 1978 when Lockheed sold the airport to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport then got its fifth name: Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (1978–2003).
On November 11, 2003, the airport authority voted to change the name to Bob Hope Airport in honor of comedian Bob Hope, a longtime resident of nearby Toluca Lake, who had died earlier that year and who had kept his personal airplane at the airfield. The new name was unveiled on December 17, 2003, on the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight in 1903, the year that Bob Hope was born.
Numerous attempts to expand safety buffer zones and add runway length have drawn opposition from the airport's neighbors, citing increased noise. Open space around the airport is nonexistent, making land acquisition unlikely.
In 2005 the airport celebrated its 75th anniversary; in 2006 it served 5,689,291 travelers on seven major carriers, with more than 70 flights daily.
After much debate between the Airport Authority, the city of Burbank, the Transportation Security Administration, and Burbank residents, in November 2007 it was decided that a new $8-million to $10-million baggage screening facility for Terminal B is legal, considering the anti-growth limitations placed on the airport. The facility will house a $2.5-million explosive detection system, used for the automatic detection of explosives within checked luggage. However, the facility is still in the early planning phases.Oberstein, J: "Firm approves new screening facility", Burbank Leader, November 6, 2007. Retrieved November 19, 2007.
The land occupied by the old Lockheed buildings (demolished in the 1990s) at the corners of Empire Avenue and Hollywood Way and Thornton Avenue, is now the site of a growing power center commercial development with chain restaurants and businesses.

==Facilities==

Bob Hope Airport covers 610 acres (247 ha) at an elevation of 778 feet (237 m) above sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 15/33 is 6,885 by 150 feet (2,099 x 46 m) and 8/26 is 5,802 by 150 feet (1,768 x 46 m). Airliners generally take off on Runway 15 due to wind from the south, and land crosswind on Runway 8 since that is the only runway with ILS and clear terrain for the approach. Flights from the northeast sometimes land visually on Runway 15 to save the extra distance circling to Runway 8. When wind is from the north airliners often make a visual left-base approach to Runway 33, with a left turn close to the airport.
In the year ending October 31, 2006, the airport had 130,849 operations, average 358 per day: 52% scheduled commercial, 31% general aviation, 16% air taxi and In the year ending November 30, 2011, the airport had 130,756 operations, average 358 per day: 45% scheduled commercial, 43% general aviation, 12% air taxi, and

The Metro Rail Red Line
Metrolink's Antelope Valley Line stops at the Downtown Burbank station located about 3.3 miles away from the airport. The airport offers complimentary shuttle van service to the station operated by SuperShuttle, reservations are recommended.

==Expansion==

In 2002, Terminal A was renovated and expanded. Plans existed for years to expand the airport with a new passenger terminal north of the existing one, but these plans have been scrapped due to significant opposition from the Burbank City Council and local groups.
A 2004 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) report cited the need for expansion at this airport, but for now this seems impossible due to agreed upon restrictions of the size and number of gates.  Under a development agreement, no gate expansions to the terminal are permitted until after 2015.  The passenger terminal is too close to the runways, according to current safety standards, but is grandfathered in because of its age.

==Incidents==

Bob Hope Airport was initially built for smaller aircraft; as a consequence, the airport has one of the smallest commercially used runways in the United States. The result is a challenging landing for even the most experienced pilots.

==Filming location==

The airport has been used as a filming location for projects including:
