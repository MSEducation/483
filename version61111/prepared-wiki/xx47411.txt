[[Instrumental temperature record]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change science, Climate history

The instrumental temperature record shows fluctuations of the temperature of earth's climate system.  Initially the instrumental temperature record only documented land and sea surface temperature, but in recent decades instruments have also begun recording sub-surface ocean temperature.  This data is collected from several thousand meteorological stations, Antarctic research stations, satellite observations of sea-surface temperature, and subsurface ocean sensors.  The longest-running temperature record is the Central England temperature data series, that starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850.[tpl]cite journal |author=Brohan, P., J.J. Kennedy, I. Harris, S.F.B. Tett, P.D.

==Global records databases==

The Hadley Centre maintains the HadCRUT4, a monthly-mean global surface temperature analysis,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/climate-monitoring | title=Climate monitoring and data sets | publisher=Met Office | accessdate=2013-04-04[/tpl] and NASA maintains GISTEMP, another monthly-mean global surface temperature analysis, for the period since 1880.[tpl]cite web | url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ | title=Datasets & Images – GISS Surface Temperature Analysis | publisher=Goddard Institute for Space Studies | accessdate=2007-07-13[/tpl] The two analyses differ in the details of how they obtain temperature values on a regular grid from the network of irregularly spaced observation sites; thus, their results for global and regional temperature differ slightly. The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Monthly) data base contains historical temperature, precipitation, and pressure data for thousands of land stations worldwide.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/ghcn-monthly/index.php | title=GHCN-Monthly Version 2 | publisher=NOAA | accessdate=2007-07-13[/tpl] Also, NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which has "the world's largest active archive"NCDC State of the Climate Global Analysis, April 2010 of surface temperature measurements, maintains a global temperature record since 1880.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.html | title=Global Surface Temperature Anomalies | publisher=National Climatic Data Center |accessdate=2010-06-16[/tpl]

==Calculating the global temperature==

Deriving a reliable global temperature from the instrument data is not easy because the instruments are not evenly distributed across the planet, the hardware and observing locations have changed over the years, and there has been extensive land use change (such as urbanization) around some of the sites.
The calculation needs to filter out the changes that have occurred over time that are not climate related (e.g. urban heat islands), then interpolate across regions where instrument data has historically been sparse (e.g. in the southern hemisphere and at sea), before an average can be taken.
There are three main datasets showing analyses of global temperatures, all developed since the late 1970s: the HadCRUT analysis is compiled in a collaboration between the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit and the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research,http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/history/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut3/, independent analyses largely based on the same raw data are produced using different levels of interpolation by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and by the National Climatic Data Center.Met Office Hadley Centre observations datasets FAQ [tpl]cite web|url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/|title=GISS Surface Temperature Analysis[/tpl] NCDC: Global Surface Temperature Anomalies These datasets are updated on a monthly basis and are generally in close agreement.
In the late 1990s, the Goddard team used the same data to produce a global map of temperature anomalies to illustrate the difference between the current temperature and average temperatures prior to 1950 across every part of the globe.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hansen, J., R. Ruedy, J. Glascoe, Mki. Sato |title=GISS analysis of surface temperature change |journal=J. Geophys.

===Absolute temperatures v. anomalies===

Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average. For example, if the reference value is 15 °C, and the measured temperature is 17 °C, then the temperature anomaly is +2 °C (i.e., 17 °C -15 °C).
Temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000 km).[ref]

[/ref] In other words, anomalies are representative of temperatures over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances.
Absolute temperatures for the Earth's average surface temperature have been derived, with a best estimate of roughly 14 °C (57.2 °F).[ref]

. Website curator: Schmunk, R.B.
[/ref] However, the correct temperature could easily be anywhere between 13.3 and 14.4°C (56 and 58 °F) and uncertainty increases at smaller (non-global) scales.

===Temperature processing software===

In September 2007, the GISTEMP software which is used to process the GISS version of the historical instrument data was made public. The software that was released has been developed over more than 20 years by numerous staff and is mostly in FORTRAN; large parts of it were developed in the 1980s before massive amounts of computer memory was available as well as modern programming languages and techniques.
Two recent open source projects have been developed by individuals to re-write the processing software in modern open code. One, http://www.opentemp.org/, was by John van Vliet.
More recently, a project which began in April 2008 (Clear Climate Code) by staff of Ravenbrook Ltd to update the code to Python has so far detected two minor bugs in the original software which did not significantly change any results.[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/updates/|title=GISS Surface Temperature Analysis – Updates to Analysis|accessdate=2008-10-16|publisher=NASA[/tpl]

==Global record from 1850==

The period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850. Earlier records exist, but with sparser coverage and less standardized instrumentation.
The temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships. On land, temperature sensors are kept in a Stevenson screen or a maximum minimum temperature system (MMTS). The sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets. The land and marine records can be compared.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-6.htm | title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis – Figure 2.6 | publisher=IPCC | author=Houghton et al. (eds)| year=2001 | accessdate=2007-07-13 [/tpl] Land and sea measurement and instrument calibration is the responsibility of national meteorological services. Standardization of methods is organized through the World Meteorological Organization and its predecessor, the International Meteorological Organization.[tpl]cite book | url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/OSY/Manual/488_Guide_2007.pdf | title=Guide to the Global Observing System | publisher=WMO | year=2007  | isbn= 978-9263134882[/tpl]
Most meteorological observations are taken for use in weather forecasts. Centers such as ECMWF show instantaneous map of their coverage; or the Hadley Centre show the coverage for the average of the year 2000. Coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less. While temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another, the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change.

===Warming in the instrumental temperature record===

Most of the observed warming occurred during two periods: 1910 to 1945 and 1976 to 2000; the cooling/plateau from 1945 to 1976 has been mostly attributed to sulphate aerosol.[ref]

, in [tpl]harvnb|US NRC|2010|p=207[/tpl]
[/ref] Some of the temperature variations over this time period may also be due to ocean circulation patterns.
Attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) factors is an important question: see global warming and attribution of recent climate change.
Land and sea measurements independently show much the same warming since 1860.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-6.htm | title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis – Chapter 2: Observed Climate Variability and Change | publisher=IPCC | author=Houghton et al.(eds) | year=2001 | accessdate=2007-07-13 [/tpl] The data from these stations show an average surface temperature increase of about 0.74 °C during the last 100 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) that the temperature rise over the 100 year period from 1906–2005 was 0.74 °C to 0.92 °C with a 90% confidence interval.
For the last 50 years, the linear warming trend has been 0.13 °C to 0.16 °C per decade according to AR4.
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local, having a negligible influence on global temperature trends (less than 0.006 °C per decade over land and zero over the oceans).
Uncertainties in the temperature record, e.g., the urban heat island effect, are discussed further in a later section.
