The Khamman Fort was constructed in 950 AD by the Kakatiya Dynasty. However, the fort has seen many rulers and kings. In 1512, the fort was taken over by the Qutub Shahis and thereafter, in the 17th century, the Asaf Jahi rulers took it over. The fort stands regally on a hill, overlooking the town of Khammam.

Later, Musunuri Nayaks and Velama kings were involved in the construction of the fort situated on the hill. It was completed in the year 1000 and was under control of Reddy dynasty. Subsequently the Qutb Shahi kingdom (1531) developed further both Khammam Fort and other parts of the region.
