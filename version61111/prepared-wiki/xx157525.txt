The urinary [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|jʊər|ɨ|n|ˌ|ɛ|r|i[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|jʊər|ɨ|n|r|i|[/tpl] meatus [tpl]IPAc-en|m|iː|ˈ|eɪ|t|ə|s[/tpl] is an orifice or meatus of the urethra.  It is the point at which urine and, in males, semen exits the urethra.  The meatus features varying degrees of sensitivity to the touch among male mammals and female mammals. The meatus is located on the glans penis in males and in the vulval vestibule in females.

==Males==

In most males the meatus meets at the junction of the glans and the frenular delta, and continues in a longitudal pattern along the ventral aspect of the glans, which facilitates flow of urine during normal urination (micturition). The meatus is sensitive and is used in sexual intercourse.  It is part of the male reproductive system.

==Females==

In females, the meatus is located between the clitoris and the vagina in the vulvular vestibule of the female genitalia. This part is also part of the female reproductive system. More specifically, it can refer to:

==Disorders==

Disorders of the meatus include epispadias, hypospadias, and urethral blockage by virtue of foreign material, kidney or bladder stones (lithiasis), or deformity, which can cause total or partial urinary blockage, or bifurcation of urine stream.
