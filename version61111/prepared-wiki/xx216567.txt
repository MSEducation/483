The 7 Wonders Creation Museum, also 7 Wonders Museum of Mount St. Helens, is a museum and bookstore dedicated to promoting young Earth creationism in Silverlake, Washington (or Toutle, Washington) near Mount St. Helens, United States. Admission is free, and often accompanied by a guided tour of volcano sights.[tpl]sfn|Paulu|2004[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Johnson|2005[/tpl]
The two-room museum was founded in 1998 by Lloyd and Doris Anderson, who live in a nearby house. Lloyd Anderson, born circa 1934, has a master's degree in theology from Dallas Theological Seminary, and is a retired former pastor; his wife Doris has worked as a registered nurse and journalist.[tpl]sfn|Paulu|2004[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Johnson|2005[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sundeen|2005[/tpl] The 7 Wonders Museum takes its name from seven Mount St. Helens land features that changed in no more than a few years. Lloyd claims that it offers creation evidence to support the Bible as "without error in the original writing."[tpl]sfn|Paulu|2004[/tpl] The Andersons see the eruption as divine evidence for young earth creationism, and see their museum as a counterpoint to the many shops and visitors centers near Mount St. Helens conveying the secular view.[tpl]sfn|Lewis|2004[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The scientific community considers creationism to be pseudoscience.[tpl]sfn|Project Steve|2008[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Delgado|2006[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Martz|McDaniel|1987[/tpl] "By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'" As a result, science organizations, such as the National Center for Science Education, criticize the promotion of creationism as a form of non-science.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Scientists say the museum rejects modern science because of the museum's preconceived religious views, and misleads visitors by extrapolating very special geologic events into equivalence with much longer-term events.[tpl]sfn|Johnson|2005[/tpl]
