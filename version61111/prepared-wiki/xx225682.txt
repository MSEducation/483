[[Experiment (probability theory)]]

CATEGORIES: Probability theory

In probability theory, an experiment or trial (see below) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~albert/m115/probability/sample_space.html |title=Listing All Possible Outcomes (The Sample Space) |last=Albert |first=Jim |date=21 January 1998 |publisher= Bowling Green State University |accessdate=June 25, 2013[/tpl] An experiment is said to be random if it has more than one possible outcome, and deterministic if it has only one. A random experiment that has exactly two (mutually exclusive) possible outcomes is known as a Bernoulli trial.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Papoulis | first =  Athanasios | contribution = Bernoulli Trials | title = Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes | edition =  2nd | url = http://www.mhhe.com/engcs/electrical/papoulis/ | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 57–63 | year = 1984[/tpl]
When an experiment is conducted, one (and only one) outcome results— although this outcome may be included in any number of events, all of which would be said to have occurred on that trial. After conducting many trials of the same experiment and pooling the results, an experimenter can begin to assess the empirical probabilities of the various outcomes and events that can occur in the experiment and apply the methods of statistical analysis.

==Experiments and trials==

Random experiments are often conducted repeatedly, so that the collective results may be subjected to statistical analysis. A fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment can be thought of as a composed experiment, in which case the individual repetitions are called trials. For example, if one were to toss the same coin one hundred times and record each result, each toss would be considered a trial within the experiment composed of all hundred tosses.[tpl]cite web | publisher = Future a/ccountant | title = Trial, Experiment, Event, Result/Outcome | url = http://www.futureaccountant.com/probability/study-notes/trial-result-event-outcome.php | accessdate = 22 July 2013[/tpl]

==Mathematical description==

A random experiment is described or modeled by a mathematical construct known as a probability space. A probability space is constructed and defined with a specific kind of experiment or trial in mind.
A mathematical description of an experiment consists of three parts:
