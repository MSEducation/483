Third Man Records is an independent record label founded by Jack White in Detroit, Michigan, in 2001. Third Man established its first physical location — a combination record store, performance venue, and headquarters for the label — in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2009.

==History==

Jack White founded Third Man Records in Detroit, Michigan, in 2001. Third Man, which releases albums and singles primarily on vinyl record, established its first physical location in Nashville, Tennessee on March 11, 2009. The Nashville location serves as a record store, label offices and live venue. It includes The Blue Room (a live performance venue and screening room for The Light and Sound Machine, a monthly film series co-hosted by The Belcourt Theater), a photo studio and darkroom, a storage facility for master recording tapes, and the label warehouse. The Blue Room is the only venue in the world to record live shows direct-to-acetate, producing a vinyl master in real time. To commemorate the opening of Third Man Records in Nashville, White debuted his new project, The Dead Weather, performing a short set for the 150 invited guests. The label's motto is "Your Turntable's Not Dead."
The label's name features the number three due to White's known fondness of it, as mentioned in several interviews.Killingsworth, Jason. "The White Stripes Play Us a Little Number." Paste Magazine. Retrieved on 17 October 2009. It refers to Carol Reed's The Third Man starring Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles. His old upholstering company was named Third Man Upholstery.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview with Jack White|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_white|publisher=Believer Magazine|accessdate=2014-02-13[/tpl] White also refers to himself as a woman's "third man" in the song "Ball and Biscuit" on The White Stripes' album Elephant.
All six studio albums of The White Stripes appear with the Third Man logo. Both albums of The Raconteurs (Broken Boy Soldiers and Consolers of the Lonely) carry the label's logo. For The Raconteurs' tour of the United Kingdom in October 2006, 1,000 live albums were pressed and sold for each show, all of which display a Third Man logo. The Dead Weather, Jack White, The Black Belles, Karen Elson, and the Greenhornes are also core acts on the Third Man roster. Other artists who have recently released LP's on Third Man Records include Kelley Stoltz, Seasick Steve, and Pokey LaFarge.

==Discography==

Third Man releases some music on compact disc and via electronic release on iTunes, but vinyl records are its primary format.
In addition to pressing titles on regular black vinyl, most releases have an exclusive and/or limited sister pressing on colored or multicolored vinyl. Beginning with TMR-003, a limited edition handmade batch of 100 tri-colored 7" vinyl, in equal parts black, yellow, and white, were produced for exclusive distribution at Third Man's Nashville location. Beginning with TMR-009, an additional 50 tri-colored vinyl have been pressed for random distribution in Third Man mail orders. Certain single releases have been sold on tri-colored vinyl available at record stores in the artist's hometown instead of at the Nashville store. An additional 50 are still randomly distributed in mail orders.
Recordings from live shows in the Blue Room (recorded either directly to analog reel-to-reel tape or direct-to-acetate) are made available in black and blue vinyl in varying quantities. These split-color records are available only to show attendees, and each LP is sealed with a concert-specific label on which the purchaser’s name is written.
Third Man is known for pushing the boundaries with vinyl record production, and with the help of United Record Pressing (their main partner in manufacturing records), their innovations include the following unique record pressings: Glow In The Dark Record, Triple-Decker Record (a 7” within a 12”), Texas-Sized Record (8” and 13” records), Metallized Record, Liquid-Filled Record, Scented Record, Rose Petal-Filled Record, Playable Etching Record, 3 RPM Record, Lightning Bolt Record, Bolt-A-Trope Record, and the Flex-Ray Record (a flexi disc made from an x-ray).
