Swiss cheese is a generic name in North America for several related varieties of cheese, mainly of North American manufacture, which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes". Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind".The Nibble. Cheese Glossary. See the asterisked footnote at the very bottom of that page Thenibble.com (The term is applied to cheeses of this style which have no connection with Switzerland, such as Jarlsberg cheese, which originates in Norway).

==Production==

Three types of bacteria are used in the production of Emmental cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus, Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), and Propionibacterium (Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspecies shermani).Swiss Cheese Niche. Microbewiki.kenyon.edu In a late stage of cheese production, the propionibacteria consume the lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria and release acetate, propionic acid, and carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide slowly forms the bubbles that develop the "eyes".A bacterium used in the production of Emmental. Genoscope. 16 January 2008. Genoscope.cns.fr.

University of Cincinnati Clermont College Historically, the holes were seen as a sign of imperfection and cheese makers originally tried to avoid them by pressing during production. In modern times, the holes have become an identifier of the cheese.Scientific American Cheese Story August 2010 Pg 33 
In general, the larger the eyes in a Swiss cheese, the more pronounced its flavor because a longer fermentation period gives the bacteria more time to act.Swiss Cheese Niche. Microbewiki.kenyon.edu This poses a problem, however, because cheese with large eyes does not slice well and comes apart in mechanical slicers. As a result, industry regulators have limited the eye size by which Swiss cheese receives the Grade A stamp.Swiss Cheese. Professorshouse.com See the eighth paragraph.
