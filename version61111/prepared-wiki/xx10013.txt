==Etymology and usage==

In his 1992 book The Way Things Ought to Be, Limbaugh credited his friend Tom Hazlett, professor of economics at the University of California at Davis, with coining the term.[ref]Rush H. Limbaugh, The Way Things Ought to Be, Pocket Books, 1992 p. 193
There were times when Limbaugh almost stopped using the term. According to Slate.com, in 2000:
[tpl]bquote|  has all-but-dropped the term 'feminazi.' When he was lambasted for mocking AIDS victims, he quickly apologized. He stopped performing 'caller abortions.' Other political talk radio shows stumble because their hosts put the politics before radio (see sclerotic Bob Grant). But Limbaugh never makes that mistake. He is a genuine conservative, but 'he is a political entertainer and a consummate pro,' says John Fund of the Wall Street Journal, who helped write Limbaugh's first book. 'Don't forget he was a DJ.'[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2000/05/rush_limbaugh_and_dr_laura_schlessinger.html | work = Slate | title = Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger | first = David | last = Plotz | date = [tpl]#formatdate:2000-05-26[/tpl][/tpl][/tpl]
In 2004, Limbaugh named feminist activists Gloria Steinem, Susan Sarandon, Christine Lahti, and Camryn Manheim as "famous feminazis."The Rush Limbaugh Show, June 22, 2005: "In The Washington Post we get a little story: 'Tips for the Democrats, Hint: Next time don't compare anybody to Hitler.' And by the way, the only reason they're doing it is because Rush Limbaugh invented the term 'feminazi.' That's the sum total of the Washington Post story—Durbin did it because I popularized it first with 'feminazi.'  I haven't used that term on this program in years. But it still gets to 'em, doesn't it? And you know why? chuckles Because it's right. Because it's accurate. ...

==Criticism==

In a 1996 interview, Gloria Steinem criticized Limbaugh's use of the term feminazi. According to Steinem, "Hitler came to power against the strong feminist movement in Germany, padlocked the family planning clinics, and declared abortion a crime against the state—all views that more closely resemble Rush Limbaugh's."[tpl]cite web|title=Ask Gloria|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/interviews/steinem1.htm|work=Feminist.com|accessdate=3 March 2012|year=1996|first = Gloria | last = Steinem| authorlink = Gloria Steinem[/tpl] In her book Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions, Steinem characterised the term as "cruel and ahistorical", and elaborated on the repression of feminism under Hitler, noting that many prominent German feminists like Helene Stöcker, Trude Weiss-Rosmarin and Clara Zetkin were forced to flee Nazi Germany while others were killed in concentration camps.[tpl]cite book | title = Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=fF9iA-AbPgUC&pg=RA1-PA337&dq=feminists+nazi+germany | chapter = If Hitler Were Alive, Whose Side Would He Be On? | first = Gloria | last = Steinem| authorlink = Gloria Steinem | year = 1986 | publisher = New American Library | isbn = 978-0451139986 | ol = 18320559M | date = [tpl]#formatdate:1995-10-15[/tpl] [/tpl]
John K. Wilson, in his book The Most Dangerous Man in America: Rush Limbaugh's Assault on Reason, cites Limbaugh's definition of the term as meaning "radical feminists whose objective is to see that there are as many abortions as possible" and says "by this definition, there are literally no feminazis."[tpl]cite book|last=Wilson|first=John K.|title=The Most Dangerous Man in America: Rush Limbaugh's Assault on Reason|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCy4-K4nar8C&pg=PA56&dq=feminazi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3kihUN6vH6STyQHu_4DgBQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-61214-6|page=56[/tpl]
