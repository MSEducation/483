==Biography==

Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine to a prosperous family. The young Bertrand-Jean Redon acquired the nickname "Odilon" from his mother, Odile.Online Essay on Odilon Redon Redon started drawing as a child and at the age of ten he was awarded a drawing prize at school. He began the formal study of drawing at fifteen, but at his father's insistence changed to architecture. Failure to pass the entrance exams at Paris’ École des Beaux-Arts ended any plans for a career as an architect, although he briefly studied painting there under Jean-Léon Gérôme in 1864. (His younger brother Gaston Redon would become a noted architect.)
Back home in his native Bordeaux, he took up sculpture, and Rodolphe Bresdin instructed him in etching and lithography. His artistic career was interrupted in 1870 when he joined the army to serve in the Franco-Prussian War.
At the end of the war, he moved to Paris, and resumed working almost exclusively in charcoal and lithography. He called his visionary works, conceived in shades of black, his noirs. It was not until 1878 that his work gained any recognition with Guardian Spirit of the Waters; he published his first album of lithographs, titled Dans le Rêve, in 1879. Still, Redon remained relatively unknown until the appearance in 1884 of a cult novel by Joris-Karl Huysmans titled À rebours (Against Nature). The story featured a decadent aristocrat who collected Redon's drawings.
In the 1890s pastel and oils became his favored media; he produced no more noirs after 1900. In 1899, he exhibited with the Nabis at Durand-Ruel's.  
Redon had a keen interest in Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture. The figure of the Buddha increasingly showed in his work. Influences of Japonism blended into his art, such as the painting The Death of the Buddha around 1899, The Buddha in 1906, Jacob and the Angel in 1905, and Vase with Japanese warrior in 1905, amongst many others.http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/odilon-redon-vase-au-guerrier-japonais-5289376-details.aspxhttp://pressimages.fondationbeyeler.ch/aktuelle-ausstellungen/odilon-redon
Baron Robert de Domecy (1867-1946) commissioned the artist in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room of the Château de Domecy-sur-le-Vault near Sermizelles in Burgundy. Redon had created large decorative works for private residences in the past, but his compositions for the château de Domecy in 1900-1901 were his most radical compositions to that point and mark the transition from ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do not show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colours used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. The influence of the Japanese painting style found on folding screens byōbu is discernible in his choice of colours and the rectangular proportions of most of the up to 2.5 metres high panels.  Fifteen of them are located today in the Musée d'Orsay, acquisitioned in 1988.http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?
Domecy also commissioned Redon to paint portraits of his wife and their daughter Jeanne, two of which are in the collections of the Musée d'Orsay and the Getty Museum in California.http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/baronne-robert-de-domecy-8842.html?tx_commentaire_pi1pidLi=509&tx_commentaire_pi1from=841&cHash=abd6d391a6http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=257416 Most of the paintings remained in the Domecy family collection until the 1960s.http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08633.html/f/46/N08633-46.pdf
In 1903 Redon was awarded the Legion of Honor.Redon and Werner (1969), p. ix. 
His popularity increased when a catalogue of etchings and lithographs was published by André Mellerio in 1913; that same year, he was given the largest single representation at the New York Armory Show.
Redon died on July 6, 1916. In 1923 Mellerio published Odilon Redon: Peintre Dessinateur et Graveur.  An archive of Mellerio's papers is held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago.
In 2005 the Museum of Modern Art launched an exhibition entitled "Beyond The Visible", a comprehensive overview of Redon's work showcasing more than 100 paintings, drawings, prints and books from The Ian Woodner Family Collection. The exhibition ran from October 30, 2005 to January 23, 2006.[tpl]Cite document | title=Dark Dreamer | author= Danielle O'Steen | publisher=ART + AUCTION  | date= November 2005 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1458/dark-dreamer/ | accessdate=2008-05-20 | postscript= [/tpl]

==Analysis of his work==

Redon's work represents an exploration of his internal feelings and psyche. He himself wanted to "place the visible at the service of the invisible"; thus, although his work seems filled with strange beings and grotesque dichotomies, his aim was to represent pictorially the ghosts of his own mind.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] A telling source of Redon's inspiration and the forces behind his works can be found in his journal A Soi-même (To Myself). His process was explained best by himself when he said:
The mystery and the evocation of Redon's drawings are described by Huysmans in the following passage:
Redon also describes his work as ambiguous and undefinable:
