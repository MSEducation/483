During World War II, Operation Fall Rot (Case Red in English) was the second phase of the conquest of France by the German Army, begun on 5 June 1940. It was made possible by the success of Operation Fall Gelb in the Battle of France (the invasion of Belgium). Before that invasion, it had not yet been decided whether mainland France would be attacked: this would depend on the outcome of Fall Gelb.
Fall Rot consisted of two suboperations: first a preliminary attack was carried out in the west over the river Somme in the direction of the Seine; the main offensive started on 9 June in the center over the river Aisne.
