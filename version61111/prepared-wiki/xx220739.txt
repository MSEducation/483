Inheritance of Hope is a non-profit organization that works with young families facing the loss of a parent.  Through counseling and retreat programs, Inheritance of Hope helps spouses and children of terminally ill patients prepare for the eventual loss of that parent. Inheritance of Hope was founded by Kristen and Deric Milligan and rose from their efforts to deal with raising three young children during Kristen's battle with liver cancer.

==History==

Following her liver cancer diagnosis in 2003, Kristen Milligan was unable to find resources to help her children through the process, so she wrote her own book, A Train's Rust, A Toy Maker's Love, aimed at children facing the loss of a parent.  As she progressed through her battle, she authored three more books, including Consider It Pure Joy, aimed at terminally ill parents.  Milligan and husband Deric then went on to found Inheritance of Hope to continue to spread the message put forth in her books.

==Services==

Inheritance of Hope provides several services:
The organization's products and services provide direct benefits for the children and a proactive, therapeutic focus for the parent.  Furthermore, Inheritance of Hope believes that preparing for the death of a parent while they are living will yield significant long-term benefits for children and loved ones, thereby minimizing the potentially catastrophic impact.  Inheritance of Hope is a faith-based organization – welcoming families of all faiths and backgrounds while serving under the core-beliefs of the Christian faith.
