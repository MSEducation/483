The Muppets (a combination of marionette and puppet) are a group of puppet characters created by Jim Henson and now owned by The Walt Disney Company (namely at their entertainment branch called The Muppets Studio). The characters became a household name after their appearance in the children's television program Sesame Street. Henson was initially reluctant to become involved with Sesame Street because he feared being pigeon-holed as a children's performer, but agreed to work on the show to further his social goals. The first Muppet characters appeared as early as 1955, in Sam and Friends, a Washington, D.C.-based show that was on the air for six years. Kermit the Frog was one of the show's regulars, and thus was one of Henson's first Muppet creations.
By the early 1970s, Henson began to think seriously about the possibility of a network series for adults featuring the Muppets. The characters appeared on the comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live (namely The Land of Gorch segments) in 1975, and by 1976, The Muppet Show (which was produced in London) began to air in syndication. Jim Henson and his associates created additional characters for subsequent projects which included television shows, movies, commercials, and programs for the Internet.
