==Early political career==

An official publication of the Polish government-in-exile, March 1944, provides the following information, likely from the subject himself (brackets added showing his ages in the narrative):"The Polish Government and the Polish Underground State" (10 March 1944)
"Jan Kwapinski (correct pronunciation: Kv-a-pin-ski), Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Commerce and Shipping, son of a worker and a metal worker himself, has long been one of the most prominent figures in Poland's labor and political movement.
Born in Warsaw in 1885, his life reflects the turbulent history of the Polish patriotic revolutionary movement. From his early youth he took an active part in the underground organization. He joined the Polish Socialist Party in 1902 17 and played an active role in the anti-Czarist uprising of 1905 20.[tpl]Ref label|a|a|none[/tpl] When the revolt failed, Kwapinski made his escape to Cracow (then in Austrian Poland), where he continued his political activities. After his return to Russian Poland in 1906 21 he took part in underground revolutionary organization. The following year he was arrested by the Czarist police and sentenced to 15 years hard labor. Having organized the prisoners' rebellion in the Lomza Prison, he managed to escape, but was caught and removed to Orel Prison, where he remained until 1917 32, when the Russian Revolution set him free.
Back in Poland in 1918 33, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Party, of which he later became Vice-Chairman. His concern for the fate of the Polish workers and peasants led to his appointment, during the twenty years of Polish independence, as President of the Farm Workers Union and Polish Trade Union Congress.
When the Soviets entered Poland, Kwapinski, who remained in Poland during both invasions, was deported to Siberia. Released after the signing of the Polish-Russian treaty in July 1941 56, he proceeded to London where he was appointed to the Polish Cabinet and was made chairman of the Committee of the Polish Socialist Party. Since General Sikorski's death (in July 1943), Mr. Kwapinski holds the post of Vice-Premier."

==Polish government-in-exile==

Following Prime Minister Władysław Sikorski's death in an airplane crash on 4 July 1943 a new government-in-exile was formed under Prime Minister Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, who had been appointed by President Władysław Raczkiewicz.[tpl]Ref_label|b|b|none[/tpl] On 14 July 1943 Prime Minister Mikolajczyk formed a coalition cabinet from the four main Polish political groups, and including, besides Jews, some without party affiliation. He named Jan Kwapiński of the Polish Socialist Party as Vice Prime Minister as well as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Shipping.
On 29 October 1943, Kwapiński flew, with other diplomats aboard the Pan American Airways Boeing 314A 'Capetown Clipper', from Foynes, Éire to New York City, as "Deputy Premier" of Poland, arriving 5 November 1943, to attend the Atlantic City, New Jersey UNRRA conference.  He was Polish signatory to the agreement at the White House on 9 November 1943.[tpl]Ref_label|c|c|none[/tpl] In London, in January 1944, Mikolajczyk and Kwapiński were the chief Polish moderates with whom British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden sought to resolve a crisis with the Soviets concerning the long contentious issue of the Polish-Russian frontier."Pretty Kettle" Time magazine report, 24 January 1944.  Life magazine photographs of Kwapiński and Mikolajczyk by Bob Landry, during this time, may be found at http://www.life.com/news-pictures/50623451/jan-kwapinskistanislaw-mikolajczyk  On 23 November 1944, three days before Prime Minister Mikolajczyk resigned, Kwapiński left his own posts.  However he was for seven months Treasury Minister under the succeeding Prime Minister, Tomasz Arciszewski, from 29 November 1944 until 28 June 1945—eight days before the United Kingdom and the United States, following the February 1945 Yalta Conference agreement with Joseph Stalin, withdrew recognition of the Polish government in exile.  Remaining an émigré, Jan Kwapiński died in London in 1964.

==Notes==

a'  [tpl]Note_label|a|a|none[/tpl]Piotr Chałupka, of a working-class family in Warsaw, worked as a teenager in metal factories in Ostrowiec, where he became involved with the Polish Socialist Party. During the 1905 revolution he was a member of the Polish Socialist Party Combat Organization, which sent him to Lodz.  See transl. of http://lodz.gazeta.pl/lodz/1,44869,1451386.html.
b [tpl]Note_label|b|b|none[/tpl] Poland, which never surrendered, was the first invaded nation to form a recognized exiled government with full cabinet. Its legitimacy had been arranged through Article 24 of the Polish Constitution, which empowered the President to appoint a successor without approval of the Sejm. Thus, on 30 September 1939, President Ignacy Mościcki, interned in Romania as a refugee, had appointed by letter Władysław Raczkiewicz (safe in Paris) as his successor. The new President had, in turn, appointed as Premier General Sikorski, then serving as commander-in-chief of the Polish army in France. Britain and France recognized the new government, extending it financial credit.Daniel Bell and Leon Dennen, "The System of Governments in Exile", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 232, "A Challenge to Peacemakers" (March 1944): 134-147, p. 134.
