The NEC PC-6001 was the first of the NEC Corporation personal computer line. There were several versions of the PC-6001, including the PC-6001 MK2 and the PC-6001 MK2 SR. There was also an American version, called the NEC TREK, or NEC PC-6001A. It was followed by the NEC PC-6601.
Several peripherals were available for the system in North America, including an expander with three cartridge jacks (some of the cartridge-based games used two cartridges), a cassette-tape recorder, a 5.5" floppy disc drive, a printer, and a touchpad.
