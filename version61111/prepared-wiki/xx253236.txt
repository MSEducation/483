The bridge was built in sandstone in 1894 for Lever Brothers in their model village of Port Sunlight and was designed by the Chester architects' firm of Douglas and Fordham.  It carries a pedestrian walkway over a landscaped hollow which had been formed from a former tidal inlet.[tpl]cite book | last =Hubbard | first =Edward | authorlink = Edward Hubbard | title =The Work of John Douglas |edition= | publisher =The Victorian Society | year =1991 | location =London | pages = 168–169| isbn =0-901657-16-6 [/tpl]  It is a saddle-back bridge with a parabolic arch.  The keystones are carved with masks, one of a Jacobean man, the other of a Restoration man.  Above these are plaques, that to the east bears an inscription; that to the west a sundial.  The bridge is supported by buttresses, and at each end is a canted projection with decorated panels.  There are benches by the walkway.  Originally there were ball finials on the bridge, but these are no longer present.
