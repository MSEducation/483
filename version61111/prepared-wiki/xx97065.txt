Pearlridge (formerly Pearlridge Center) is the second largest shopping center in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, after Ala Moana, and is Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's largest enclosed shopping center, located in [tpl]okina[/tpl]Aiea. Opened in 1972 and expanded in 1976, the enclosed mall is split up into three "phases" (Uptown, Downtown, & Phase Three) and overlooks historic Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial. The property includes the only monorail in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, the only emergency clinic located on mall property (Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Medical Center at Pali Momi), and an eight story office complex (Pearlridge Office Center).

Pearlridge consists of two major shopping areas; one is Pearlridge Uptown and the other is Pearlridge Downtown. There are also two minor strip malls, Pearlridge East and Pearlridge West. The two major shopping areas are connected by the only monorail system in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. Pearlridge primary anchor tenants include: Macy's (formerly Liberty House), Sears and Toys R Us.

==Rival==

Considered a major civic center in West O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, Pearlridge rivals the larger tourist destination Ala Moana Center near Waik朝k朝.  Pearlridge is usually favored by local residents as it offers local tastes in merchandise and services as opposed to high-end merchandise and services provided at its close-to Waik朝k朝 counterpart.
