Henry Wills (born 1842, date of death unknown) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in the Indian Wars of the western United States.
Born in Gracon, Virginia, in 1842, Wills was living in St. Louis, Missouri, when he joined the Army. He served as a Private in Company C of the 8th Cavalry Regiment. He was cited for providing "services against hostile Indians" near Fort Selden, New Mexico, from July 8, to July 11, 1873, and was awarded the Medal of Honor two years later, on August 12, 1875.
