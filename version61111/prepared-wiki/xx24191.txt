This is a list of designated terrorist organizations by national governments, former governments and inter-governmental organizations, where the proscription has a significant impact on the group's activities. Many organizations that are accused of being a terrorist organization deny using terrorism as a military tactic to achieve their goals, and there is no international consensus on the legal definition of terrorism.[tpl]cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=38|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuJIPP9HfRsC&pg=PA38[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Schmid, Alex P.|chapter=The Definition of Terrorism|title=The Routledge Handbook of Terrorism Research|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=0-203-82873-9|page=39|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_PXpFxKRsHgC&pg=PA39[/tpl]

===European Union===

The European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations that provide for different sanctions for the two groups.Kristina Thorne Terrorist designation in the European Union Background paper June 2006

====UN 1267 regime list====

Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and their associates.
The EU provides exceptions to the implementation of relevant asset-freezing sanctions per UN resolution 1452 (2002). Upon request, a competent national authority may determine to release funds on the following grounds if, within the time limit provided for, there has been no objection made, or a release has been explicitly approved, by the UN Sanctions Committee.

====Autonomous list====

All other designated organizations.
It is important to note that sanctions are only applicable to EU-external groups regardless of designation. For example, 47 groups are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU but sanctions are only applied to 27 of these. Member States do have an obligation to assist each other in preventing and combating terrorist acts but this is the only action that follows from the designation of an EU-internal organization.
