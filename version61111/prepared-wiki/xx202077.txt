The 2009 AFC President's Cup was the fifth edition of the AFC President's Cup, a competition for football clubs in countries categorized as "emerging nations" by the Asian Football Confederation. Eleven teams competed for the title and were split up into three groups, playing each other team in their group once. The winner of each group and the best runner-up qualified for the semifinals, and the winners of the semifinal matches played in the final match to determine the winner.
Each group was to be played over a period of days in May and June at one venue - Group A at Dashrath Stadium, Nepal, Group B at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka and Group C at Spartak Stadium, Bishkek.
The final stage of the competition took place in Tajikistan from September 25–27.
