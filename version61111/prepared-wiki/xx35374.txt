Dolly Madison is a U.S. bakery brand owned by Hostess Brands, marketing packaged baked snack foods.

==History==

The brand was among the products that were liquidated by Hostess due to its announced plans to go out of business on November 16, 2012. Apollo Global Management, who acquired Hostess Brands' Twinkies in January 2013, also acquired the rights to the Dolly Madison snack cake brands, as well as the official corporate name to Dolly Madison and Hostess Brands, with plans to resume production of the products.[tpl]cite web|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/12/news/companies/twinkies-buyer |title=Twinkies due on shelves by summer after buyer's winning $410 million bid is approved - Mar. 12, 2013 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=AP 1:58 p.m. EDT April 29, 2013 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/29/hostess-bakeries-indiana-illinois/2121559/ |title=Hostess reopens bakeries for Twinkies, Ho Hos |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl]

==Marketing==

Dolly Madison snacks are probably best known for their long association with characters from Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strip. Charlie Brown and his friends appeared on Dolly Madison packages and in television commercials in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The bakery was one of the sponsors of the Peanuts animated specials telecast on CBS during that period. Each pie flavor was sold with a different character on the label. For example, Peppermint Patty was on the strawberry pie and peach pie label, Sally Brown on the coconut cream pie, Charlie Brown on the cherry pie, Linus van Pelt on the apple pie, Lucy van Pelt on the lemon pie, Schroeder on the berry pie, and Frieda on the chocolate pie.  Charlie Brown was also on Zingers packages wearing a baseball cap.
During the period when the packages featured Peanuts characters, the advertising agency for Dolly Madison products was Dancer Fitzgerald Sample's San Francisco branchâ€”primarily due to its proximity to Schulz.
