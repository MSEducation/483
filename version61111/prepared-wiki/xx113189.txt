LiveWorkPlay is a Canadian charitable organization for people with intellectual disabilities. Founded in Ottawa in 1995 by the husband and wife team of Keenan Wellar and Julie Kingstone, LiveWorkPlay was originally known as the Keen Learning Centre for Youth and then the Special Needs Network.http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/cgi-bin/sc_mrksv/corpdir/dataOnline/corpns_re?company_select=3127281
Soon after its founding as a resource centre, the organization evolved and began offering supports and services related to housing, employment, and community participation. In 2001 the name was changed to LiveWorkPlay to focus on the organization's goal of promoting full participation and decision-making with regard to living situations, work, and play.http://www.liveworkplay.ca/node/322 In 2011 the organization adopted a revised vision, values, and mission: "Helping the community welcome people with intellectual disabilities to live, work, and play as valued citizens."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO309OzM3-E
In an effort to better share best practices and connect with organizations across the province LiveWorkPlay joined Community Living Ontario as an affiliate in 2008.http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/page/community%20living%20leaders/ezlist_item_d28afc98-d8c4-4e9e-a348-85f0d2ebee9d.aspx LiveWorkPlay was the lead Ottawa area organization in marking the historical closure of Ontario's mass institutions for people with intellectual disabilities on March 31, 2009.http://www.communitylivingontario.ca/page/community%20living%20leaders/ezlist_item_d24feccf-d7f5-4a68-8063-9afd6b3cf519.aspx
