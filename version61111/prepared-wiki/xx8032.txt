==Biography==

===Early years===

Miguel de Icaza was born in Mexico City and studied at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México (UNAM) but never received a degree. He came from a family of scientists in which his father is a physicist and his mother a biologist.[tpl]cite web|title=Interview[tpl]sic|hide=y[/tpl] with Miguel De Icaza|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6833|publisher=Linux Journal|accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl] He started writing free software in 1992.

===Early software career===

One of the earliest pieces of software he wrote for Linux was the Midnight Commander file manager, a text-mode file manager.[tpl]cite web | url = http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/mc/mc/FAQ?rev=HEAD | title = Midnight Commander FAQ | author = Midnight Commander authors | accessdate = 2010-09-06 | quote = Midnight Commander was started by Miguel de Icaza and he is the maintainer of the package. Other authors have joined the project later.[/tpl] He was also one of the early contributors to the Wine project.[tpl]cite web|title=Wine History|url=http://wiki.winehq.org/WineHistory|publisher=wiki.winehq.org|accessdate=2012-07-10[/tpl]
He worked with David S. Miller on the Linux SPARC port and wrote several of the video and network drivers in the port, as well as the libc ports to the platform.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/summaries/miller_invite.html | title = The SPARC Port of Linux | author=David S. Miller, Rutgers CAIP, and Miguel de Icaza, Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico | work = Usenix Proceedings | year = 1997 | publisher = USENIX Association | accessdate = 2010-04-18[/tpl] They both later worked on extending Linux for MIPS to run on SGI's Indy computers and wrote the original X drivers for the system.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.kneuro.net/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source/drivers/sgi/char/graphics.c | title = graphics.c | author = Miguel de Icaza | accessdate = 2011-11-19 | quote = Author: Miguel de Icaza[/tpl] With Ingo Molnar he wrote the original software implementation of RAID-1 and RAID-5 drivers of the Linux kernel.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.koders.com/c/fid90D0506D0981288C46C7A849BBB82C7276351E12.aspx?s=rsa | title = raid5.c | quote = Copyright: (C) 1996, 1997 Ingo Molnar, Miguel de Icaza, Gadi Oxman[/tpl]
In summer of 1997, he was interviewed by Microsoft for a job in the Internet Explorer Unix team (to work on a SPARC port), but lacked the university degree required to obtain a work H-1B visa.[tpl]cite web | url = http://nat.org/blog/2009/10/ | title = Startup Visa | author = Nat Friedman | date = 2009-10-31 | accessdate = 2010-09-06 [/tpl] He declared in an interview that he tried to persuade his interviewers to free the IE code even before Netscape did so with their own browser.http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/deicazainterview.asp

===GNOME, Ximian, Xamarin, and Mono===

De Icaza started the GNOME project with Federico Mena in August 1997 to create a completely free desktop environment and component model for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.[tpl]cite book|title=Practical Mono|author=Mark Mamone|page=7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YpIAry7MNCcC&dq=Federico+Mena&cad=0|publisher=Apress|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59059-548-0[/tpl] He also created the GNOME spreadsheet program, Gnumeric.
In 1999, de Icaza, along with Nat Friedman, co-founded Helix Code, a GNOME-oriented free software company that employed a large number of other GNOME hackers. In 2001, Helix Code, later renamed Ximian, announced the Mono Project, to be led by de Icaza, with the goal to implement Microsoft's new .NET development platform on Linux and Unix-like platforms. In August 2003, Ximian was acquired by Novell. There, de Icaza was Vice President of Developer Platform.
In May 2011, de Icaza started Xamarin to replace MonoTouch and Mono for Android after Novell was bought by Attachmate and the projects were abandoned. However, shortly afterwards Xamarin and Novell reached an agreement where Xamarin took over the development and sales of these products.Friedman, Nat.

===Advocacy of Microsoft technologies===

De Icaza endorsed Microsoft's Office Open XML (OOXML) document standard,[tpl]cite web|title=OOXML. (Score:4, Informative)|url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=293507&cid=20547277|publisher=Slashdot|accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The EU Prosecutors are wrong|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Jan-30.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=OOXML: The Wins|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Apr-02.html[/tpl] disagreeing with a lot of the widespread criticism in the open source and free software community.
He has also been a longtime advocate of using Mono - a free software implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework - in GNOME.[tpl]cite web|title=Mono and Gnome: The Long Reply|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-02-06-011-20-OP-GN-MS|publisher=LinuxToday|accessdate=2010-01-15[/tpl]  This has raised much disagreement due to the patents that Microsoft holds on, and related to, the .NET Framework.
For advocating Microsoft technologies, de Icaza was criticized by Richard Stallman on the Software Freedom Day 2009 as "Traitor to the Free Software Community".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/22225/RMS_De_Icaza_Traitor_to_Free_Software_Community/|date=2009-09-21|title=RMS: De Icaza Traitor to Free Software Community|first=Thom |last=Holwerda |accessdate=2012-11-19|publisher=osnews.com[/tpl] Icaza responded on his blog to Stallman with the remark that he believes in a "world of possibility" and that he is open for discussions on ways to improve the FOSS pool.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Sep-23.html|title=On Richard Stallman|first=Miguel|last=de Icaza|quote=I want to say that God loves all creatures. From the formidable elephant to the tiniest ant. And that includes Richard Stallman. As for me, I think that there is a world of possibility, and if Richard wants to discuss how we can improve the pool of open source/free software in the world he has my email address.

===Linux desktop criticism===

In August 2012, de Icaza criticized the Linux desktop as "killed by Apple".
