thumb|upright|left|The Harbour Railway, beside the Avon New Cut, Spike Island.Spike Island is an area of the English port city of Bristol, adjoining the city centre. It comprises the strip of land between the Floating Harbour to the north and the tidal New Cut of the River Avon to the south, from the dock entrance to the west to Bathurst Basin in the east. The island forms part of Cabot ward.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/WardFinder/pdfs/cabotmap-high.pdf |format=PDF| title = Cabot Ward Map | publisher = Bristol City Council | accessdate =20 June 2006 [/tpl]Ordnance Survey (2005).

Spike Island was created by William Jessop in the early 19th century, when he constructed the New Cut, and converted the former course of the River Avon into the Floating Harbour. Until the Second World War, a lock connected Bathurst Basin with the New Cut, and Spike Island was a genuine island surrounded on all sides by water. However, fears that an aerial attack on this lock at low tide could lead to a disastrous dewatering of the docks led to the lock being filled in.
Historically, Spike Island was the site of working quays, shipyards, warehousing, and other associated dockside industry. The Bristol Harbour Railway runs the length of the island, and formerly connected these working areas with the railway network. With the redevelopment of the docks, the Island has become an area popular with developers looking to create prime dock side housing such as Baltic Wharf, The Point and Perretts Court. There are also a few restaurants and popular pubs such as The Cottage. The rest of the area of Bristol between the Docks and New cut is in Redcliffe and St Phillip's Marsh.
Other former dock related buildings have become cultural venues or museums. These include:
The path of the harbour railway across Spike Island is proposed for a £38 million rapid transit bus route from Ashton Vale to the City Centre. The existing steam railway would be retained, but buses would gain a congestion-free journey into the city.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.westofengland.org/media/184380/rt%20scheme%20summary_spring2010-web.pdf | title= West of England Rapid Transit Ashton Vale to Temple Meads and Bristol City Centre Scheme Summary II – Spring 2010 | publisher= West of England Partnership | format= PDF | accessdate=8 July 2010[/tpl] Subject to planning permission, and finances, work could start 2012 with services running 2014.
