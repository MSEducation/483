Hairspray is a musical with music by Marc Shaiman, lyrics by Scott Wittman and Shaiman and a book by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan, based on the 1988 John Waters film Hairspray.  The songs include 1960s-style dance music and "downtown" rhythm and blues.  In 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, plump teenager Tracy Turnblad's dream is to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV dance program based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE4D8113BF932A2575BC0A9649C8B63|title=THEATER; Finally, Footlights On the Fat Girls |last=Waters|first=John|date=August 11, 2002|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl]  When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight, and meets a colorful array of characters, such as Corny Collins (The show's singing host who shares Tracy's liberal political views) and Velma Von Tussle (The villainous producer of the show who does everything in her power to further her daughter's career and destroy Tracy's and Corny's). She then launches a campaign to integrate the show.  Hairspray is a social commentary on the injustices of parts of American society in the 1960s.
The musical's original Broadway production opened on August 15th, 2002.
In 2003 it won eight Tony Awards out of thirteen nominations. It ran for over 2,500 performances and closed on January 4, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124800.html|title=Playbill News: Broadway's Hairspray Has Its Final Spritz Jan. 4|last=Jones|first=Kenneth|date=January 4, 2009|publisher=Playbill.com|accessdate=February 11, 2009[/tpl]  Hairspray has also had national tours, a London West End production, and numerous foreign productions and was adapted as a 2007 musical film.  The London production was nominated for a record-setting eleven Laurence Olivier Awards, winning for Best New Musical and in three other categories.
In 2008, popular magazine New York Theatre Monthly included the characters of Tracy, Corny and Edna on its list of "The 100 Greatest Roles in Musical Theatre".

==Background==

According to interviews included as an extra feature on the 2007 film's DVD release, theatre producer Margo Lion first conceived of Hairspray as a stage musical in 1998 after seeing a television broadcast of the original film. "I was home looking at a lot of movies, and one of those movies was Hairspray". The story was about a unlikely heroine Tracy Turnblad who gets on her local dance show and breaks down their segregation rules. She contacted John Waters, who gave her his blessing, then acquired the rights from New Line Cinema.  Lion contacted Marc Shaiman, who expressed interest in the project only if his partner Scott Wittman could participate, and Lion agreed. The two submitted three songs – one of which, "Good Morning Baltimore", eventually became the show's opening number.  Based on their initial work, Lion felt confident that she had hired the right team.[ref]Pogrebin, Robin. "Riding High With a Big, Bouffant Hit; After 25 Years of Paying Dues, an Independent Producer Scores With 'Hairspray'". The New York Times, October 16, 2002
[/ref]
Lion contacted Rob Marshall about directing the musical.  At the time he was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of Chicago, but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of Hairspray with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film.  Marshall remembered Marissa Jaret Winokur from her brief appearance in the film American Beauty and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman.  The two immediately felt she was right for the role of Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions.  They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later.  One year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  Certain she would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a hysterectomy without telling anyone but her immediate family.  The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project.[ref]undated interview thehpvtest.com[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
[/ref]  Meanwhile, Marshall had started work on Chicago, and Lion hired Jack O'Brien and Jerry Mitchell to direct and to choreograph, respectively. Winokur was one of the first to audition for the role of Tracy Turnblad and spent two years preparing with voice and dance lessons."Marissa Jaret Winokur"Encyclopedia of World Biography, accessed February 8, 2010 Tracy's mother had been portrayed by Divine in the original film, and Shaiman liked the idea of maintaining the tradition of casting a male as Edna Turnblad.  Harvey Fierstein auditioned for the role with a "half hour vocal audition".  He thought they were "pacifying" him, but he was told "they don't want anyone but you".Limsky, Drew. "Everything's Coming Up 'Hairspray'". The Advocate,  July 23, 2002
According to Shaiman, one song, "I Know Where I've Been", became controversial during the genesis of the score:

==Synopsis==

Setting: Baltimore, Maryland, June 1962

===Act I===

As “pleasantly plump” teenager Tracy Turnblad lies in bed, she muses about her love for her hometown, her love of dancing, and her desire to be famous (“Good Morning Baltimore”). She goes to school and is given a warning for "inappropriate hair height". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, The Corny Collins Show (“The Nicest Kids in Town”). Edna, Tracy’s shy and plus-sized mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny’s mother, Prudy complains about it being race music. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held,due to the fact that Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members)leaves the show due to being pregnant. Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Edna, fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on The Corny Collins Show) have similar arguments with their mothers ("Mama, I’m a Big Girl Now").
After gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence ("I Can Hear the Bells"). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show, rejects Tracy from the audition because of her size ("(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs"), as well as refusing a black girl, Little Inez.
Back at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her "monumental hair-don't". There she meets black dancer, Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the host of "Negro Day" on The Corny Collins Show, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the following day to introduce herself to Corny Collins ("The Madison"). When Corny sees how well Tracy can dance, he gives her a place on the show ("The Nicest Kids in Town" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, following Corny’s suggestion, sings "It Takes Two" to Tracy, much to Amber’s dismay. After the show, Mr. Spritzer, the show’s worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy’s appointment to the Council. Velma, threatening to fire Corny from the show, is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy ("Velma’s Revenge").
At the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr. Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover, as she is told, ("Welcome to the '60s") and Tracy becomes the spokes-girl for the shop. At school, signs of Tracy’s fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and another Council Member sporting Tracy’s signature hairdo. During a game of dodge ball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother’s record shop for a platter party ("Run and Tell That!").
At the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day’s Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except for the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested ("Big, Blonde, and Beautiful").

===Act II===

After the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary ("The Big Dollhouse"). Because of Velma’s dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases both her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the remaining people, excluding Tracy who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma’s manipulations.  Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her ("Good Morning Baltimore" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it cost them to bail everyone out and with Tracy still in prison. Edna sympathizes with her daughter’s dream – she had dreamt of making her “own line of queen-sized dress patterns”. She and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (“(You’re) Timeless to Me”).
During the night, Link sneaks into the jail where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny’s mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for “going to jail without her permission” and ties her up in her bedroom where Seaweed comes to her rescue.  Both couples declare their love for one another ("Without Love"). After escaping from their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle’s Record Shop. Tracy thinks that it is unfair that after all of their hard work, The Corny Collins Show is still segregated. They devise a plan to help integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality ("I Know Where I’ve Been").
On the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song ("(It’s) Hairspray"). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers ("Cooties"). Just as the results are about to be announced, Tracy (whose hair is straightened as a sign of her "non-conformity to the man") takes over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny (now transformed from drool to cool), Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition and Corny declares The Corny Collins Show to finally be racially integrated. When all is announced, Mr. Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public’s response to the telecast and announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and he offers Link a recording contract and Motormouth the position of vice president of Ultra Glow – beauty products for women of color. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss ("You Can’t Stop the Beat").

==Musical numbers==

†Not on the cast recording. 

===Score revisions and additional songs===

Hairspray went through several revisions before and during its pre-Broadway run in Seattle, in the process eliminating and replacing several musical numbers.  One of such songs, an infomercial about safety on the road titled "Blood on the Pavement", followed "The Nicest Kids in Town", and is included on the cast album.  In early revisions, various songs, including "The Status Quo" and "Velma’s Cha-Cha" (its short reprise replaced by “Rage,” in turn dropped in favor of “Velma’s Revenge”), were used during Tracy’s audition and dismissal, but the team instead optioned for "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs", as the audience did not like seeing Tracy being verbally attacked after "I Can Hear the Bells".The Roots, p. 59 After the auditions, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer up Tracy after her rejection,The Roots, p. 62 singing that "It Doesn't Get Better than This".  Later replaced by the similar "Positivity", the scene was later cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.
After Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song "The New Girl in Town", which was sung first by the Council girls and later by the black Girls.  Although later cut early during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the 2007 movie and appears in the show’s instrumental score.Review of Hairspray during its pre-Broadway run zipcon.net "The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha" was another cut number that originally followed "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful".  Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene.The Roots, p. 109 A song called "Step on Up" was also cut in favor of "I Know Where I’ve Been".The Roots, pp. 142-43 Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a "Miss Auto Show" competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of "Miss Teenage Hairspray".  For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called "Take a Spin" sung by Corny in the place where “(It’s) Hairspray” is now.The Roots, p. 149 After Amber’s rendition of "Cooties", Tracy had a song before the finale called "It Ain’t Over ’Til the Fat Lady Sings," though, it was cut after the third reading of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack."Dear Listener", Note included in the Special Edition of the 2007 Hairspray Movie Soundtrack

==Instrumentation==

Hairspray's orchestration calls for fifteen musicians: three keyboards, the first of which is played by the conductor, bass guitar, two guitars, drums, percussion, trumpet, trombone, two woodwind players, two violins, and cello.  The guitarists both double on acoustic and electric guitars, and the trumpet doubles on flugelhorn; the original Broadway production also featured a piccolo trumpet double.  The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones, flute and clarinet.  The second woodwind player doubles on tenor, alto and baritone saxophones, flute and clarinet.
In the original Broadway production, a few of the actors mimed on musical instruments in order to fulfill a minimum musician requirement at the Neil Simon Theatre.

"'Hairspray", Daily Variety, August 16, 2002, p. 2  Ben Brantley wrote: "So what if it's more than a little pushy in its social preaching? Stocked with canny, deliriously tuneful songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and directed by Jack O'Brien with a common touch that stops short of vulgarity, 'Hairspray' is as sweet as a show can be without promoting tooth decay. ...it succeeds in recreating the pleasures of the old-fashioned musical comedy without seeming old-fashioned.  ...Shaiman... is taking the infectious hooks and rhythms from period pop and R&B and translating them into the big, bouncy sound that Broadway demands.... And while the savvy arrangements... nod happily to Motown, Elvis, Lesley Gore ballads and standards like "Higher and Higher," the score's appeal isn't nostalgic.  It's music that builds its own self-contained, improbably symmetrical world...."Brantley, Ben."Theater Review; Through Hot Pink Glasses, a World That's Nice" The New York Times, August 16, 2002, Section E, Part 1, Column 1 New York's Daily News wrote, "As Tracy, Marissa Jaret Winokur has the heft, the pipes and an enormously appealing stage presence. Her dancing may not be as special as the plot suggests, but she wins your heart... With this role, Fierstein places himself in the great line of Broadway divas."Kissel, Howard. "This Show Has Body And Bounce", Daily News (New York), August 16, 2002, p. 55
