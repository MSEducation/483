The Jewish World Watch is an NGO based out of Southern California, a coalition of more than 60 synagogues including Valley Beth Shalom GLOBALISM AND JUDAISMRabbi Harold M. Schulweis, Rosh Hashanah 2004, accessed April 17, 2007 and Jewish groups with the objective of educating, advocating, and donating in order to combat genocide and other human rights violations all over the world. It has previously primarily focused on the genocide in Darfur but is now expanding its operations to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
JWW sponsors two major relief programs to benefit refugees.  One provides two free CooKit solar cookers, along with training and supplies, to families.  By providing an alternative fuel, women do not have to leave safe areas, such as camps or villages, to procure firewood for cooking.  In addition to reducing rape and murder of these women,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldwatch.org/refugeerelief/ |title=Welcome to Jewish World Watch :: Do Not Stand Idly By :: www.JewishWorldWatch.org |accessdate=2008-03-03 |format= |work=[/tpl] solar cooking also reduces deforestation and air pollution.  The other program provides backpacks filled with shoes, books, school supplies, and soap to children.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldwatch.org/refugeerelief/backpackproject.html |title=Welcome to Jewish World Watch :: Do Not Stand Idly By :: www.JewishWorldWatch.org |accessdate=2008-03-03 |format= |work=[/tpl]  This program encourages education in unfavorable circumstances.
