===Chinese production controversy===

On 27 November 2007 Cessna announced the new Cessna 162 would be made in the People's Republic of China by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, which is a subsidiary of China Aviation Industry Corporation I (AVIC I), a Chinese government-owned consortium of aircraft manufacturers.[tpl]cite web|url = http://investor.textron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110047&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1081831&highlight=|title = Cessna Chooses China's Shenyang Aircraft Corporation as Manufacturing Partner for Model 162 SkyCatcher|accessdate = 2007-11-28|last = Textron|authorlink = |date=November 2007[/tpl] By manufacturing the aircraft in China, Cessna reports it saved USD$71,000 in production costs per aircraft, or about 40% of the cost. A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was Cessna had no plant capacity available in the USA at the time.
Cessna received a high degree of negative feedback from 162 customers and potential customers regarding this decision. Complaints centered on the recent problems with Chinese production of other consumer products, China's human rights record, exporting of jobs, and China's less than friendly political relationship with the USA.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |title = Making the case for building the SkyCatcher in China|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Aniello|first = Tom|authorlink = |date=December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080106070032/http://www.cessnaskycatcher.com/home/124.html |archivedate = 6 January 2008[/tpl] The backlash surprised Cessna and resulted in a company public relations campaign to try to explain the decision from a business perspective and assure customers that quality of the aircraft will not be compromised.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/RemosAircraft_Germany_Expanding_ChallengesCessna_196872-1.html|title = Germany's Remos Aircraft Expanding, Challenges Cessna|accessdate = 2008-01-03|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=January 2008[/tpl] The reaction to the explanations and assurances has been overwhelmingly negative, although a small number of customers have applauded the production in China.
In early 2009 the company attracted further criticism for continuing plans to build the 162 in China while laying off large numbers of workers in the USA.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/avflash/1307-full.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = AvWeb Staff|authorlink = |date=January 2009[/tpl]

===2008–10 economic crisis===

The company's business suffered notably during the Late-2000s recession, laying off more than half its workforce between January 2009 and September 2010.
On 4 November 2008 Cessna's parent company, Textron, indicated that Citation production would be reduced from the original 2009 target of 535 "due to continued softening in the global economic environment" and that this would result in an undetermined number of lay-offs at Cessna.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaSlowsCitationProduction_CitingGlobalEconomy_199121-1.html|title = Cessna Slows Citation Production, Citing Global Economy |accessdate = 2008-11-06|last = Grady|first = Mary F.|authorlink = |date=November 2008[/tpl]
On 8 November 2008, at the AOPA Expo, CEO Jack Pelton indicated that Cessna sales of aircraft to individual buyers had fallen but piston and turboprop sales to business had not. "While the economic slowdown has created a difficult business environment, we are encouraged by brisk activity from new and existing propeller fleet operators placing almost 200 orders for 2009 production aircraft," Pelton stated.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/aopa/AOPAExpo2008_CessnaAircraft_BuyersMarket_199162-1.html|title = It's a Buyer's Market|accessdate = 2008-11-08|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |date=November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.kwch.com/Global/story.asp?S=9292651&nav=menu486_2_3|title = Cessna Announces Possible Layoffs|accessdate = 2008-11-04|last = Durden|first = Chris|authorlink = |date=November 2008[/tpl]
On 13 November 2008, Cessna announced that a total of 665 jobs would be cut at its Wichita and Bend, Oregon plants starting in January 2009. The Cessna factory at Independence, Kansas, which builds the Cessna piston-engined aircraft and the Cessna Mustang, was not forecast to see any layoffs, but one third of the workforce at the former Columbia Aircraft facility in Bend was laid off. This included 165 of the 460 employees who built the Cessna 350 and 400. The remaining 500 jobs were eliminated at the main Cessna Wichita plant.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/EclipseAviation_Misses_Payroll_TVreport_199202-1.html|title = Eclipse Misses Payroll: TV Report  |accessdate = 2008-11-13|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |date=November 2008[/tpl]
In January 2009 the company announced 2,000 additional layoffs, bringing the total to 4,600. The job cuts included 120 at the Bend, Oregon facility reducing the plant that built the Cessna 350 and 400 to fewer than half the number of workers that it had when Cessna bought it. Other cuts included 200 at the Independence, Kansas plant that builds the single-engined Cessnas and the Mustang, reducing that facility to 1,300 workers.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_textron_pelton_199682-1.html|title = Cessna Layoffs Continue |accessdate = 2009-02-02|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |date=January 2009[/tpl]
On 29 April 2009 the company announced that it was suspending the Citation Columbus program and closing the Bend, Oregon facility. The Columbus program was finally cancelled in early July 2009. The company said "Upon additional analysis of the business jet market related to this product offering, we decided to formally cancel further development of the Citation Columbus". With the 350 and 400 production moving to Kansas, the company indicated that it would lay off 1,600 more workers, including the remaining 150 employees at the Bend plant and up to 700 workers from the Columbus program.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaWillSuspendColumbusProgramAndCloseBendFactory_200284-1.html|title = Cessna Will Suspend Columbus Program, Close Bend Factory|accessdate = 2009-04-30|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=April 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaCancelsExtraLargeColumbusJetProgram_200720-1.html|title = Goodbye, Columbus – Cessna Cancels Extra-Large Jet Program |accessdate = 2009-07-16|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=July 2009[/tpl]
In early June 2009 Cessna announced that it would lay off an additional 700 salaried employees, bringing the total number of lay-offs to 7600 or more than half the company's workers.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_layoff_wichita_columbus_mustang_200511-1.html|title = More Layoffs at Cessna|accessdate = 2009-06-08|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |date=June 2009[/tpl]
In December 2009 the company announced that it will close its three Columbus, Georgia manufacturing facilities between June 2010 and December 2011. The closures will include the new [tpl]convert|100000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] facility that was opened in August 2008 at a cost of US$25M, plus the McCauley Propeller Systems plant. These closures will result in total job losses of 600 in Georgia. Some of the work will be relocated to Cessna's Independence, Kansas or Mexican facilities.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_columbus_mccauley_jobs_cut_wichita_mexico_201673-1.html|title = Cessna Closing Plants, Cutting Jobs|accessdate = 2009-12-14|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |date=December 2009[/tpl]
Cessna's parent company Textron posted a loss of US$8M in the first quarter of 2010, largely driven by continuing low sales at Cessna, which were down 44%. Cessna's workforce remained 50% laid-off and CEO Jack Pelton stated that he expected the recovery to be long and slow.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/CessnaDeclinesSapsTextron_202461-1.html|title = Cessna Declines Sap Textron Revenues|accessdate = 28 April 2010|last = Niles|first = Russ|authorlink = |date=April 2010[/tpl]
In September 2010 Cessna CEO Jack Pelton announced a further 700 layoffs, bringing the total to 8,000 jobs lost. Pelton indicated this round of layoffs was due to a "stalled and lackluster economy" and noted that while the number of orders cancelled for jets has been decreasing new orders have not met expectations. Pelton added "our strategy is to defend and protect our current markets while investing in products and services to secure our future, but we can do this only if we succeed in restructuring our processes and reducing our costs."[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaToCut700Jobs_203322-1.html|title = Cessna To Cut 700 Jobs|accessdate = 23 September 2010|last = Grady|first = Mary|authorlink = |date=September 2010[/tpl]

===2010s===

On 2 May 2011 CEO Jack Pelton retired. The new CEO, Scott A. Ernest, started on 31 May 2011.Press release by Cessna Aircraft Company Ernest joined Textron after 29 years at GE, where he had most recently served as vice president and general manager, global supply chain for GE Aviation.  Ernest previously worked for Textron CEO Scott Donnelly when both worked at GE.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.kansas.com/2011/06/01/1872234/textron-names-new-cessna-ceo.html|title = Kansas native named Cessna CEO|accessdate = 21 July 2012|last = McIllin|first = Molly|authorlink = |date=June 2011| work = The Wichita Eagle[/tpl]
In September 2011 the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a US$2.4M fine against the company for its failure to follow quality assurance requirements while producing fiberglass components at its plant in Chihuahua, Mexico. Excess humidity meant that the parts did not cure correctly and quality assurance did not detect the problems. The failure to follow procedures resulted in the delamination in flight of a [tpl]convert|7|ft|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] section of one Cessna 400's wing skin from the spar while the aircraft was being flown by an FAA test pilot. The aircraft was landed safely. The FAA also discovered 82 other aircraft parts that had been incorrectly made and not detected by the company's quality assurance. The investigation resulted in an emergency airworthiness directive that affected 13 Cessna 400s.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/cessna_corvalis_wing_composite_fine_FAA_205442-1.html|title = Corvalis Wing Prompts $2.4 Million Proposed Fine|accessdate = 24 September 2011|last = Pew|first = Glenn|authorlink = |date=September 2011| work = AVweb[/tpl]
On 23 March 2012 Cessna announced that it is pursuing building business jets in China as part of a joint venture with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). The company stated that it intends to eventually build all aircraft models in China, saying "The agreements together pave the way for a range of business jets, utility single-engine turboprops and single-engine piston aircraft to be manufactured and certified in China."[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Cessna_China_Business_Jets_206365-1.html|title = Cessna Wants To Build Jets in China|accessdate = 26 March 2012|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = 23 March 2012| work = AVweb[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.cessna.com/NewReleases/FeaturedNews/NewReleaseNumber-1192384202959.html|title = Cessna and AVIC Join Forces to Develop General and Business Aviation in China|accessdate = 26 March 2012|last = Cessna |date = 23 March 2012[/tpl]
In late April 2012 the company recalled laid-off workers and started new hiring to fill 150 positions in Wichita as a result of anticipated increased demand for aircraft production.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/CessnaAdds150JobsInWichita_206615-1.html|title = Cessna Adds 150 Jobs in Wichita |accessdate = 3 May 2012|last = Grady|first = Mary|date = 30 April 2012| work = AVweb[/tpl]

==Marketing Initiatives==

During the 1950s and 1960s Cessna's marketing department followed the lead of Detroit automakers and came up with many unique marketing terms in an effort to differentiate its product line from their competitions'.
Other manufacturers and the aviation press widely ridiculed and spoofed many of the marketing terms, but Cessna built and sold more aircraft than any other manufacturer during the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s.
