Yip Man (1 October 1893 – 2 December 1972), also spelled as Ip Man,As written in Romanised text in his passport, which is on display in the Yip Man Tong museum in Foshan in China. http://www.kwokwingchun.com/about-wing-chun/ip-mans-wing-chun/ip-man-or-yip-man/ and also known as Yip Kai-man, was a Chinese martial artist. He had several students who later became martial arts teachers in their own right, including Bruce Lee.

==Early life==

Yip was born to Yip Oi-dor and Ng Shui, and was the third of four children. He grew up in a wealthy family in Foshan, Guangdong, and received a traditional Chinese education. His elder brother was Yip Kai-gak, his elder sister was Yip Wan-mei and his younger sister was Yip Wan-hum.Title: Yip Man – Portrait of a Kung Fu Master, Page:3, Author(s): Ip Ching and Ron Heimberger, Paperback: 116 pages, Publisher: Cedar Fort (23 January 2001), Language: English, ISBN 1-55517-516-3, ISBN 978-1-55517-516-0
Yip started learning Wing Chun from Chan Wah-shun when he was 13. Since Chan was 70 at the time, Yip was Chan's last student.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kwokwingchun.com/about-wing-chun/history-&-family-tree/ |title=Sam kwok Wing Chun – Yip Man Family Tree |publisher=Kwokwingchun.com |accessdate=29 November 2011[/tpl]Mastering Wing Chun, By Samuel Kwok Due to his teacher's age, Yip learned most of his skills and techniques from Chan's second eldest disciple, Ng Chung-sok. Chan died three years after Yip's training started and one of his dying wishes was to have Ng continue teaching Yip.
At the age of 16, Yip moved to Hong Kong with help from his relative Leung Fut-ting. One year later, he attended school at St. Stephen's College—a secondary school for wealthy families and foreigners living in Hong Kong. During Yip's time at St. Stephen's he saw a foreign police officer beating a woman and intervened. The officer attempted to attack Yip, but Yip struck him down and ran to school with his classmate. Yip's classmate later told an older man who lived in his apartment block. The man met with Yip and asked what martial art Yip practised.  The man told Yip that his forms were "not too great". The man challenged Yip's Wing Chun in chi sao (a form of training that involves controlled attack and defence). Yip saw this as an opportunity to prove that his abilities were good, but was defeated by the man after a few strikes. Yip's opponent revealed himself to be Leung Bik, Chan Wah-shun's senior and the son of Chan's teacher, Leung Jan. After that encounter, Yip continued learning from Leung Bik.
Yip returned to Foshan when he was 24 and became a policeman. He taught Wing Chun to several of his subordinates, friends and relatives, but did not officially run a martial arts school. Some of his better known informal students were Chow Kwong-yue (周光裕), Kwok Fu (郭富), Lun Kah (倫佳), Chan Chi-sun (陳志新) and Lui Ying (呂應). Among them, Chow Kwong-yue was said to be the best, but he eventually went into commerce and stopped practising  martial arts.  Kwok Fu and Lun Kah went on to teach students of their own and they passed down the art of Wing Chun in the Foshan and Guangdong region. Chan Chi-sun and Lui Ying went to Hong Kong later but neither of them accepted any students. Yip went to live with Kwok Fu during the Second Sino-Japanese War and only returned to Foshan after the war, where he continued his career as a police officer. Yip left Foshan for Hong Kong at the end of 1949 after the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War because he was an officer of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), the Communists' rival in the Civil War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kwokwingchun.com/about-wing-chun/ip-mans-wing-chun/ip-mans-biography/ |title=Ip Man's Biography |publisher=Kwokwingchun.com |date=2012-07-20 |accessdate=2012-10-12[/tpl]

==Life in Hong Kong==

Initially, Yip Man's teaching business was poor because Yip's students typically stayed for only a couple of months. He moved his school twice: first to Castle Peak Road in Sham Shui Po and then to Lee Tat Street (利達街) in Yau Ma Tei. By then, some of his students had attained proficiency in Wing Chun and they were able to start their own schools. Some of his students and descendants sparred with other martial artists to compare their skills and their victories helped to increase Yip's reputation. In 1967, Yip and some of his students established the Ving Tsun Athletic Association (詠春體育會).Ip Ching, Ip Man: Portrait of a Kung Fu Master (Springville, UT: King Dragon Press, 2001)Ip Man Ving Tsun 50th Anniversary Journal (Hong Kong: Ving Tsun Athletic Association Limited, 2005)
Yip Man was said to have regularly used opium.Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit: A Biography, Bruce Thomas, p. 208 "Both Bruce's father and even his wing chun master Yip Man were no strangers to the opium pipe." One of his former students, Duncan Leung, claimed that Yip used tuition money to support his opium addiction.[tpl]cite web|author=May 16, 2009 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KE16Ad02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: China News, China Business News, Taiwan and Hong Kong News and Business |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2009-05-16 |accessdate=2012-10-12[/tpl]

==Death and legacy==

Yip died on 2 December 1972 in his unit at 149 Tung Choi Street in Hong Kong, from throat cancer, only months before Bruce Lee.Complete Wing Chun: The Definitive Guide to Wing Chun's History and Traditions, Robert Chu, Rene Ritchie, Y.

==In popular culture==

Ip Man, a Hong Kong film loosely based on the life of Yip Man, starring Donnie Yen as the martial artist, was released in cinemas in 2008. The film takes a number of liberties with Yip's life, often for dramatic effect. Yip's eldest son Ip Chun appears in the film and served as a consultant for the film. The film focuses on Yip's life during the 1930s to the 1940s during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The film is the first to be based on the life of Yip. The sequel Ip Man 2 focuses on Yip's beginnings in Hong Kong and his students—including Bruce Lee.
Amid a surge of Yip Man–related film projects in production, Donnie Yen told the Chinese media in March 2010 that after Ip Man 2, he will no longer play the Wing Chun master any more. He stated, "I would never ever touch any films related to Ip Man. This will be my final film on the subject. Whenever something becomes a success, everyone would jump on the bandwagon, this is very frightening. Did you know how many Ip Man films are in production? Under such condition, we would not progress, it'd only lead to over-saturation of the subject matter."
Yu Chenghui played Yip Man in The Legend of Bruce Lee,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0143340/|title= Ip Man (Character)| accessdate  =4 Feb 2011| quote = TV episode, Played by Cheng-Hui Yu (as Ye Wen)[/tpl] a 2008 Chinese television series based on the life story of Bruce Lee, who was one of Yip's students.
Another Hong Kong film based on Yip Man's life, called The Legend Is Born – Ip Man, was released in June 2010. Herman Yau directed the film and it starred Dennis To as Yip Man. Ip Chun makes a special appearance in the film as Leung Bik.
Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster is a 2013 film starring Tony Leung as Yip Man. The film concentrates more on the end of an era in Chinese martial arts history as the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. It was created in an almost biographical style, highlighting parts of history. In contrast with the other Yip Man–related projects, The Grandmaster is a more reflective film, focusing more on the musings and philosophies between martial arts and life, as well as Yip Man's journey through the early 1930s to the early 1950s.
The 2013 Hong Kong film Ip Man: The Final Fight, directed by Herman Yau and starring Anthony Wong as Yip Man, focuses on Yip's later life in Hong Kong. Ip Chun makes a cameo appearance in the film. This film also focuses on the loyalty of his pupils towards him.
The 2013 Chinese television series Ip Man, based on Yip Man's life, was aired on the television network Astro On Demand between March and May 2013. It was directed by Fan Xiaotian and starred Kevin Cheng as the titular character.
