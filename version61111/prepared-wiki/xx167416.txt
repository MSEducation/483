San Raimondo is a church in Siena, Tuscany, Italy.
It was built from 1596 by will of the Sienese noble Aurelio Chigi. In 1660, Pope Alexander VII (a Chigi) commissioned from the city's architect, Benedetto Giovannelli, a new marble fa√ßade, which is in three classicist-style superimposed orders.
The interior has a well-balanced decoration dating from the early 17th century. Canvasses include works by Alessandro Casolani, Francesco Vanni, Rutilio Manetti, Rustichino and Sebastiano Folli.
