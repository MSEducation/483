The Iris Robinson scandal, also known as Irisgate,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6984300.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Who really wins and loses in Irisgate | first=Mick | last=Fealty | date=12 January 2010 | accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/7929/ |title=After Irisgate: the future’s not Orange – or Green | spiked |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl] was a political scandal in Northern Ireland involving Iris Robinson, the wife of Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson, who was a serving MP and MLA for the Democratic Unionist Party, representing Strangford in both assemblies.
In January 2010, a BBC Northern Ireland documentary revealed that Iris Robinson had an affair in 2008 and had procured £50,000 in loans for her lover to finance a start-up restaurant. She had failed to declare her monetary interest in the restaurant, despite serving on the council which gave it permission to open.[tpl]cite news|last=Jamieson |first=Alastair |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6956531/Iris-Robinson-expelled-from-DUP-after-financial-row-over-affair-with-toyboy-lover.html |title=Iris Robinson expelled from DUP after financial row over affair with toyboy lover |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/politics/robinson-fights-for-political-life-amidst-irisgate-scandal-1.997215|title=Robinson fights for political life amidst Irisgate scandal|last=Crichton|first=Torcuil|date=8 January 2010|work=The Herald|accessdate=9 January 2010|location=Scotland[/tpl] Before the airing of the documentary, it was also revealed that she had attempted suicide on 1 March 2009.[tpl]cite news|author=Henry McDonald |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/peter-iris-robinson-bbc-investigation |title=Peter and Iris Robinson face questions after BBC documentary |publisher=Guardian |date= 7 January 2010|accessdate=2011-03-09 |location=London[/tpl]
As a result, Iris Robinson was expelled from the DUP and she resigned her seats in both Westminster and the Northern Ireland Assembly, retiring from politics. Peter Robinson also unexpectedly lost his own Westminster seat (Belfast East) in the 2010 general election, a result which was attributed in part to the scandal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/stormonts-first-minister-peter-robinson-unseated-after-year-of-scandal-1965819.html|title=Stormont's First Minister unseated after year of scandal|accessdate=24 September 2013|location=England|work=The Independent|first=David|last=McKittrick|date=7 May 2010[/tpl]

==BBC Spotlight==

Following the airing of an episode of BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme on 8 January, the First Minister faced demands to explain his role in his wife's financial dealings, including from within his own party.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/mumrsquos-the-word-over-iris-scandal-for-dup-top-brass-14628959.html|title=Mum’s the word over Iris scandal for DUP top brass|last=Henry|first=Lesley-Anne|date=9 January 2010|work=Belfast |accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] The Spotlight investigation revealed that Iris Robinson had procured two loans totalling £50,000 for her then 19-year-old lover Kirk McCambley to assist him in opening a restaurant. The loans were made by local property developers Fred Fraser (who died weeks later) and Ken Campbell.[tpl]cite news|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6949057/Iris-Robinson-young-lover-Kirk-McCambley-attracts-hundreds-of-Facebook-fans.html |title=Iris Robinson's young lover, Kirk McCambley, attracts hundreds of Facebook fans |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2011-03-09 |location=London[/tpl] Iris Robinson did not declare the loan to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and McCambley gave £5,000 back to Iris Robinson as a gift to pay off her own debts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/08/iris-robinson-kirk-mccambley-belfast|title=Iris Robinson and Kirk McCambley: a strange tale of Belfast's 'odd couple'|last=Addley|first=Esther|date=8 January 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 January 2010 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8449689.stm|title=Robinson 'should be given a week' - Gregory Campbell|date=8 January 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2010[/tpl] In the interview with Spotlight, McCambley alleged that Iris requested the money rather than it being a spontaneous gift. The restaurant in question, the Lock Keeper's Inn in South Belfast, is owned by Castlereagh Borough Council. McCambley was awarded the tender to operate the restaurant in 2008. Despite being a Castlereagh Borough councillor, Iris Robinson failed to declare her financial interest in the award of the tender. Selwyn Black, Iris Robinson's former adviser, has alleged that she encouraged McCambley to bid for the tender.
The Canadian crime writer Peter Robinson was notably mistaken for the other Peter Robinson during this scandal. He received angry e-mails, saying his wife was "homophobic", and he quipped on his website under the title "I’m Not That Peter Robinson", "I guess people who send rude and insulting emails or push religion at the vulnerable were not, alas, at the front of the queue when the brains were handed out".Read more: Crime writer Peter Robinson not amused by scandal, Thursday, 14 January 2010

==First Minister steps down==

On 11 January 2010, Peter Robinson announced that he was stepping down from the position of First Minister for a period of six weeks to fight claims over his wife's financial dealings.  Arlene Foster was nominated as his replacement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8450854.stm |title=Robinson takes six-week break from First Minster role |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl]
Peter Robinson is facing a claim that he knew his wife obtained £50,000 from two developers for her teenage lover but did not tell the proper authorities. He returned to his position after three weeks.

==Inquiries==

Peter Robinson said that he would contest the allegations that he failed to properly report these transactions. He claimed to have no knowledge of them "I had no information," he said. "Absolutely no information about that, nor of any of the other financial arrangements, which is hardly surprising – if somebody is hiding an affair from you, it’s probably not a surprise they are hiding the other arrangements relating to that affair."
On 11 January 2010 Peter Robinson confirmed that he had asked both the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly to carry out an inquiry into his conduct. Several other inquiries are or will be carried out. Castlereagh (borough) have launched an inquiry, while the Castlereagh Alliance Party has written to the Northern Ireland Comptroller and Auditor General calling for an inquiry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8454512.stm |title=Up close and personal - Peter and Iris Robinson |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl]
