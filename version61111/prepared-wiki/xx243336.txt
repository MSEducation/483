==Construction==

The Shanti Stupa was built by both Japanese Buddhists and Ladakh Buddhists. Original idea was stated by Nichidatsu Fujii (Fujii Guruji) in 1914. The mission of Nichidatsu Fujii was to build Peace Pagodas and temples over the world and try to resurrect Buddhism back in India.
Construction of the Shanti Stupa began in April 1983 under the supervision of Bhikshu Gyomyo Nakamura and  Kushok Bakula, a lama of Ladakh from New Delhi, member of the Minority commission of Govt of India, former statesman and former international diplomat of the Republic of India. The project was built with the help of Ladakhi Buddhists, who offered voluntary labour, and Japanese Buddhists, who consider India as the "sacred" birth place of the Buddha. Then prime minister of India, Indira Gandhi, sanctioned the construction of a vehicular road to the stupa in 1984. The state government also provided some financial assistance for the construction of the Shanti Stupa.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] The 14th and current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso inaugurated the Shanti Stupa in August 1991.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.buddhist-temples.com/buddhist-monastery/ladakh/shanti-stupa.html|title=Shanti Stupa|publisher=Buddhist-temples.com|accessdate=October 19, 2009[/tpl]

The second level has reliefs depicting the "birth" of Buddha, the death of Buddha (mahanirvana) and Buddha "defeating the devils" while meditating.The titles of the reliefs are given on the plaques under the reliefs at the Shanti Stupa. Both levels feature a series of smaller meditating Buddha reliefs.
