==Etymology==

The place-name Wivenhoe is Saxon in origin, deriving from the personal name Wifa's or Wife's spur or promontory (hoe). The place-name is now usually pronounced 'Wivvenho', but the Essex accent would traditionally have rendered it as 'Wivvenhoo'.  The town's parish church, St. Mary the Virgin, is of Saxon origin[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] though the present building is largely Victorian. According to folk etymology, the name derived from "Wyvernhoe" [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl], originating from the mythical beast called a wyvern and the previously mentioned ridge (hoe). The town's football team, Wivenhoe Town FC, is nicknamed 'The Wyverns'.

Wivenhoe had two prosperous shipyards.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|title= What is it like to live in...
