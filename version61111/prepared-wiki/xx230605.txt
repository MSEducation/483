The Open Bay Islands are located off the south-west coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The group comprises two main islands Taumaka and Popotai plus several smaller islets and rocks. They lie approximately [tpl]convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] offshore from the Okuru River mouth, near Haast and are owned by Poutini Ngai Tahu.
Taumaka is the larger island (c.

==Wildlife==

The Open Bay Islands support several endemic species, including a terrestrial leech (Hirudobdella antipodum), an undescribed gecko species (aff. Hoplodactylus granulatus),Hitchmough, R., Bull, L. and Cromarty, P. (compilers) (2007) "New Zealand Threat Classification System lists— 2005", Dept of Conservation, Wellington. and a skink - the Open Bay Islands skink.  Taumaka Island has been identified as an Important Bird Area, by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for Fiordland Penguins.BirdLife International. (2012).

===Wekas===

Although introduced mammals are not known ever to have reached the islands, the introduction of weka (a native flightless rail, Gallirallus australis) from the South Island in the early 1900s is believed to have had an adverse impact on the flora and fauna of the islands.Stirling, I. & Johns, P.M. (1969) "Notes on the bird fauna of Open Bay islands", Notornis 16(121-125).Burrows, C.J. (1972) "The flora and vegetation of Open Bay Islands", Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand 2 (15-42).  The Department of Conservation have recommended to the Minister of Conservation that weka should be removed from the islands. The Trust which governs the island agreed to having them removed on the condition that they are not killed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/3949003/Colony-of-inbred-wekas-may-have-a-lucky-escape|title=Colony of inbred wekas may have a lucky escape|last=Glass|first=Amy|date=23 July 2010|work=The Press|accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl]

==Castaways==

A sealing gang with ten members was brought to the islands by the Active from Sydney. The men had very basic provisions: some food, salt, an axe, an adze, and a cooper’s drawing knife. The ship, which left the islands on 16 February 1810, was not seen again, and the sealing gang was assumed to have been lost with the ship. After years of considerable hardship, they finally saw a ship, the Governor Bligh, and attracted its attention. They were picked up and arrived back in Sydney on 15 December 1813.[tpl]cite web|last=Fyfe|first=Frank|title=The story of David Lowston, a pre-colonial NZ song |url= http://folksong.org.nz/davylows/lowstonfyfe.html |publisher=Journal of New Zealand Folklore|accessdate=14 August 2012|year=1970[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Smith|first=Ian W.G.|title=The New Zealand Sealing Industry|url= http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/NZsealingentire.pdf |publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=14 August 2012|pages=25, 32|format=PDF|date=June 2002[/tpl]
