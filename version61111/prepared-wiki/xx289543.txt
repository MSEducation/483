According to TorrentFreak it had been downloaded more than 2,500,000 times by October 2013.
The browser circumvents site-blocking in countries including, according to the Pirate Bay Web site, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Iran, Ireland, Italy, North Korea, and the United Kingdom. This allows users to access some websites otherwise blocked, usually by government ban or threat of legal action, by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in these countries.
