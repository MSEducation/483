KMHB was the cable-only affiliate of The CW network in the Rio Grande Valley. It was carried on Time Warner Cable channel 53. 
The station was part of The CW Plus, and as it was a cable-only station, the use of the "KMHB" call letters was done in a fictional manner as cable-only affiliates of broadcast networks are not required to operate under an FCC station license.
Before becoming a CW affiliate, the station was a WB affiliate via The WB 100+ Station Group. The WB 100+ was a similar cable-only operation as the current CW Plus service. On September 18, 2006, KMHB switched its affiliation to The CW after Time Warner and CBS Corporation closed down The WB and UPN networks and merged them into the The CW Television Network.
However, after more than a year, Time Warner Cable replaced KMHB with a new terrestrial CW affiliate, KSFE-LP, on  November 7, 2007.
