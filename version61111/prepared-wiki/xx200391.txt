[[American Roller Skating Derby]]

CATEGORIES: Roller derby leagues in California

The American Roller Skating Derby (ARSD) is a professional roller derby league. As of 2012, the ARSD consists of six teams: the San Francisco Bay Bombers, the Los Angeles Firebirds (formerly the San Diego Firebirds), the Chicago Pioneers, the Brooklyn Red Devils, the Eastern Chiefs (aka the New York Chiefs) and the Orlando Thunder. Most train and compete in the East Bay area (near San Francisco, California), but one team, the Firebirds, is based in Escondido, near San Diego.[ref]
 Miller will serve as women's captain of the newly formed San Diego Firebirds, based in Escondidoâ€¦The Firebirds are part of the American Roller Skating Derby, a five-team league composed of male and female skaters. Owner Dan Ferrari formed the Southern California team after moving to Escondido four months ago.[/ref]
Unlike leagues in the past, the ARSD has invested in building a new track, and new uniforms. Ferrari has made arrangements to have the tracks up at different venues for additional training, and in some cases, for a week or more at a time. The league also uses former skating stars Delores "Tillie" Tucker, "Bad Boy" Alphonso Reyes, Larry Lewis, "Mizz" Georgia Hase and Jim Fitzpatrick as coaches and mentors during these training sessions.
