[[Delaware General Corporation Law]]

The Delaware General Corporation Law (Title 8, Chapter 1 of the Delaware Code) is the statute governing corporate law in the U.S. state of Delaware.  Over 50% of U.S. publicly traded corporations and 60% of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in that state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title=About Agency |publisher=Delaware Division of Corporations[/tpl]

==History==

Delaware acquired its status as a corporate haven in the early 20th century. Following the example of New Jersey, which enacted corporate-friendly laws at the end of the 19th century to attract businesses from New York, Delaware played the game of fiscal competition by adopting in 1899 a general incorporation act aimed at attracting more businesses.  Before the rise of general incorporation acts, forming a corporation required a special act of the state legislature.  General incorporation allowed anyone to form a corporation by simply raising money and filing articles of incorporation with the state government's secretary of state.

==Other legal aspects==

Because of the extensive experience of the Delaware courts, Delaware has a more well-developed body of case law than other states, which serves to give corporations and their counsel greater guidance on matters of corporate governance and transaction liability issues. Disputes over the internal affairs of Delaware corporations are usually filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which is a separate court of equity, as opposed to a court of law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://courts.delaware.gov/overview.stm |title=Overview of the Delaware Court System |publisher=Delaware State Courts[/tpl] Because it is a court of equity, there are no juries, and its cases are heard by the judges, called chancellors. Since 1989, the court has consisted of one Chancellor and four Vice Chancellors. The court is a trial court, with one chancellor hearing each case.  Litigants may appeal final decisions of the Court of Chancery to the Delaware Supreme Court.
Delaware has also attracted some major credit card banks because of its relaxed rules regarding interest. Many U.S. states have usury laws limiting the amount of interest a lender can charge. Federal law allows a national bank to "import" these laws from the state in which its principal office is located.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.occ.gov/static/interpretations-and-precedents/mar98/int822.pdf |title=Interpretive Letter #822 |work=Interpretations and Actions |publisher=Office of the Comptroller of the Currency |volume=11 |number=3 |date=March 1998[/tpl] [tpl]citation needed span|date=January 2014|text=Delaware (amongst others) has relatively relaxed interest laws,  so several national banks have decided to locate their principal office in Delaware. National banks are, however, corporations formed under federal law, not Delaware law.  A corporation formed under Delaware state law benefits from the relaxed interest rules to the extent it conducts business in Delaware, but is subject to restrictions of other states' laws if it conducts business in other states.[/tpl]
Pursuant to the "internal affairs doctrine", corporations which act in more than one state are subject only to the laws of their state of incorporation with regard to the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation.Edgar v. MITE Corp, [tpl]ussc|457|624|1982[/tpl]. As a result, Delaware corporations are subject almost exclusively to Delaware law, even when they do business in other states. Among other reasons, this contributes to Delaware's attractiveness as a state of incorporation.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=763164 |title=Will There Ever Be a Delaware of Europe? |first=Patrick S. |last=Ryan |journal=Columbia Journal of European Law |volume=11 |page=187 |date=Winter 2004–2005[/tpl]

==Tax benefits and burdens==

[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011|text=[/tpl]Delaware charges no income tax on corporations not operating within the state, so taking advantage of Delaware's other benefits does not result in an income tax cost. That said, Delaware has a particularly aggressive tax on banks that locate in the state. However, in general, the state is viewed as a positive location for corporate tax purposes because favorable laws of incorporation allow companies to minimize the corporate expenditures (achieved through legal standardization of corporate legal processes), creating a nucleus in Delaware with operating companies often in other states.
In addition, Delaware has used its position as the state of incorporation to generate revenue from its abandoned and unclaimed property laws.  Under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, a state of incorporation gets to keep any abandoned and unclaimed property, such as uncashed checks and unredeemed gift certificates, if the corporation does not have information about the location of the owner of the property.Delaware v. New York, [tpl]ussc|507|490|1992[/tpl]  [tpl]citation needed span|date=January 2014|Delaware is becoming increasingly aggressive in auditing and assessing companies for unclaimed property. For example, it has deputized sister states to act as contingency fee auditors for unclaimed property.[/tpl]
A state may levy, however, a franchise tax on the corporations incorporated in it. Franchise taxes in Delaware are actually far higher than in most other states which typically charge little or nothing beyond corporate income taxes on the portion of the corporation's business done in that state. Delaware's franchise taxes supply about one-fifth of its state revenue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://finance.delaware.gov/publications/fiscal_notebook_07/Section02/sec2page24.pdf |title=State General Fund Revenues by Category (F.Y. 2002 - F.Y. 2005) |work=Delaware 2005 Fiscal Notebook |publisher=Delaware Department of Finance[/tpl]
In February 2013 the London-based Economist published an article on tax-friendly jurisdictions, commenting that Delaware stood for “Dollars and Euros Laundered And Washed At Reasonable Expense”. Jeffrey Bullock, Delaware’s secretary of state, insists that it has struck the right balance between curbing criminality and “paying deference to the millions of legitimate businesspeople who benefit” from hassle-free incorporation.Onshore financial centres: Not a palm tree in sight.

==2013 amendments==

On June 30, 2013, Delaware Governor Jack Markell signed into law amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law that affect several provisions in the current law and could substantially impact the process through which public companies are merged.
