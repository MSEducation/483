[[Luxury vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Luxury vehicles, Car classifications

Luxury vehicle is a marketing term for a vehicle that provides luxury — pleasant or desirable features beyond strict necessity — at increased expense (see luxury goods).
The term suggests a vehicle with higher quality equipment, better performance, more precise construction, comfort, higher design, technologically innovative modern, or features that convey an image, brand, status, or prestige, or any other 'discretionary' feature or combination of them. The term is also broad, highly variable and relative. It is a perceptual, conditional and subjective attribute that may be understood differently by different people; "what may be luxury for one may be premium for another."[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=YLuoXQ2NKmsC&pg=PA46&dq=We+know+that+luxury+is+relative+what+may+be+luxury+for+one+may+be+premium+for+another |page=46 |title=The Luxury Strategy: Break the Rules of Marketing to Build Luxury Brands |first=Jean-Noël |last=Kapferer |first2=Vincent |last2=Bastien |publisher=Kogan Page |year=2009 |isbn=9780749454777 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
In contemporary usage, the term may be applied to any vehicle type— including sedan, coupe, hatchback, station wagon, and convertible body styles, as well as to minivans,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2007/08/06/057385.html |title=The Original Luxury Minivan Adds Fresh Ideas for 2008 |publisher=The Auto Channel News |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/22/cars-minivan-luxury-forbeslife-cx_jm_0122cars.html |last=Mitchell |first=Jacqueline |title=Nine Minivans You'll Beg To Drive |journal=Forbes |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] crossovers, or sport utility vehicles and to any size vehicle, from small to large—in any price range.[tpl]cite web|title=Consumer Behaviour of Luxury Automobiles: A Comparative Study between Thai and UK Customers’ Perceptions |first= Jakrapan |last=Anurit |first2=Karin |last2=Newman |first3=Bal |last3=Chansarkar |url= http://economicswebinstitute.org/essays/carthai.pdf |publisher=Economics Web Institute |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Moreover, there is a convergence in the markets and a resulting confusion of luxury with high price: where there may have been a clear difference in price between luxury and others, there is no longer an absolute separation between premium and luxury, with what may be premium brands now more expensive than the equivalent so-called luxury ones.Kapferer & Bastien, p. 43.

==Definition==

Automobile manufacturers market specific makes and models that are targeted at particular socio-economic classes, and thus "social status came to be associated more with a particular vehicle than ownership of a car per se."[tpl]cite book|last=Berger |first=Michael L. |title=The automobile in American history and culture: a reference guide |publisher=Greenwood |year=2001 |page=160 |isbn=978-0-313-24558-9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=oRwMv8iNP-MC&pg=PA160&dq=%22a+group+of+car+marques+and+models+that+have+been+expensive+to+purchase |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Therefore, automakers differentiate among their product lines in "collusion" with the car-buying public. While a high price is the most frequent factor, it is "styling, engineering, and even public opinion which cars had the highest and lowest status associated with them."
Every era in automobile history has had "a group of car marques and models that have been expensive to purchase, due to their alleged superiority of their design and engineering". Aimed at wealthy buyers, such automobiles might be generically termed luxury cars. This term is also used for unique vehicles produced during "an era when luxury was individualistic consideration, and coachwork could be tailored to an owner like a bespoke suit."[tpl]cite book|last=Alder |first=Dennis |title=Speed and Luxury: The Great Cars |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2007 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-7603-2960-3 [/tpl] Although there is considerable literature about specific marques, there is a lack of systematic and scholarly work that "analyzes the luxury car phenomenon itself."
Luxury vehicle makers may either be stand-alone companies in their own right, such as BMW and Mercedes, or a division/subsidiary of a mass market automaker (e.g., Lexus is part of Toyota). Badge engineering is often used for cost savings, for example, the Lincoln vehicles that are based on Ford platforms or Acura models derived from Honda.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2013-acura-ilx-concept-photos-and-info-news |title=2013 Acura ILX Concept - This concept previews a production Civic-based compact for Honda's luxury brand |journal=Car and Driver |date=January 2012 |first=Andrew |last=Wendler |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
Though widely used, the term luxury is broad and highly variable. It is a perceptual, conditional and subjective attribute and may be understood differently by different people: "What is a luxury car to some... may be 'ordinary' to others."

==Global references==

According to the European Commission, the "luxury vehicle" segment is classified as F-segment. However, the boundaries between the traditional segments are increasingly becoming blurred and diluted as features once exclusive to luxury vehicles become standard equipment on even small cars.[tpl]cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m1406_en.pdf |title=Case No COMP/M.1406 - Hyundai/Kia - Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 Merger Procedure |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |date=1999-03-17 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m1326_en.pdf |title=Case No IV/M.1326 - Toyota/Daihatsu - Merger Decision IV/M.1326|date=1998-11-06 |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m5219_20080925_20310_en.pdf |title=Case No COMP/M.5219 - VWAG/OFH/VWGI - Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 Merger Procedure |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]

===Premium compact segment===

The compact executive car segment or premium compact class[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/automobiles/autoreviews/05WHEEL.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Lawrence |last=Ulrich |title=Lexus Makes a Hipper Hybrid by Gilding the Prius |date=2011-06-03 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] is relatively new, having been initiated by several European brands in the mid-2000s, and have displaced their compact executive cars to constitute the least expensive offerings in their lineups. The classification varies, for instance Consumer Guide Automotive in the U.S. considers the Audi A3 and Audi A4 as part of the premium compact segment due to similar size and MSRP, though these are known in Europe as a small family car and a compact executive car, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2009-premium-compact-car-buying-guide.htm |title=The Consumer Guide to 2009 Premium Compact Cars |publisher=Consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Adding to some confusion, General Motors has positioned Buick as a "premium" nameplate to compete with Lincoln and front-wheel drive Acura and Lexus models, while Cadillac is aimed at the "luxury" segment which generally encompasses the performance-oriented BMW and Mercedes-Benz marques.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cars.com/buick/regal/2011/expert-reviews |title=2011 Buick Regal |first=David |last=Thomas |publisher=Cars.com |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url =  http://autos.aol.com/cars-Buick-LaCrosse-2010/expert-review/ |title=2010 Buick LaCrosse Expert Review |publisher=AOL autos |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/10q4/2010_acura_tsx_v6_vs._2011_buick_regal_cxl_turbo_2010_volkswagen_cc_2.0t_r-line-comparison_tests|title=2010 Acura TSX V6 vs. 2011 Buick Regal CXL Turbo, 2010 Volkswagen CC 2.0T R-Line - Comparison Tests |journal=Car and Driver |first=John |last=Phillips |date=October 2010 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
The premium compact segment is targeted at a niche market of consumers who found the existing entry-level luxury offerings (mostly consisting of compact executive cars - see below) to be too expensive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/mercedes-benz/cla-class/2014/ |title=2014 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] By offering a smaller, lighter, more fuel-efficient, and less expensive vehicle, premium compacts introduces younger buyers to the luxury marque, in hopes of retaining the coveted customer loyalty. This includes the Audi A3, BMW 1 Series, Lexus CT, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, Aston Martin Cygnet, and the Volvo V40.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.webcitation.org/68dIr87ah |title=Premium-Compacts - Audi A3, BMW 1 series, Volvo C30, MINI |publisher=Squidoo |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Dan |last=Proudfoot |url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/new-car-reviews/audi-luxury-compact-is-ready-for-the-future/article4316959/ |title=Audi luxury compact is ready for the future |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=2012-09-10 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Premium compacts compete with well-equipped midsize (non-luxury) cars, and with options they overlap much with compact executive cars (entry-level luxury cars).[tpl]cite news|first=Jeremy |last=Cato |url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/auto-news/uptown-goes-downtown-with-cheaper-cars/article15577491/ |title=Uptown goes downtown with cheaper cars |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2013-11-29 |accessdate=2014-03-11 |location=Toronto[/tpl]
Premium compacts may share components with mass market cars from the marque's parent company (the Audi A3 for example, shares much of its engineering with the cheaper Volkswagen Golf), and/or have less sophisticated platforms compared to upmarket vehicles in the lineup (such as the Mercedes-Benz B-Class which is front-wheel drive compared to the other marque's more expensive cars that are rear-wheel drive). However, the BMW 1 Series retains the front-engine longitudinal-engine rear-wheel drive configuration of more expensive BMWs.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2010-audi-a3-tdi/ |title=Test Drive: 2010 Audi A3 TDI |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Gerry |last=Frechette |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cars.com/audi/a3/2006/reviews/ |title=2006 Audi A3 Reviews by Cars.com Experts and Consumers |publisher=Cars.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
The body style tends to be a hatchback or compact wagon, previously associated with economy cars but regaining popularity in the United States for its afforded utility, although as of 2013 there are sedans such as the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz B-Class. The luxury branding and style, high-quality interior materials, wide range of convenience features, and performance powertrains are key to distinguishing them from mass market equivalents (one mistake made by the Cadillac Cimarron) and making these appeal to consumers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2010-audi-a3-tdi/ |title=Test Drive: 2010 Audi A3 TDI |publisher=Autos Canada |first=Gerry |last=Frechette |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cars.com/audi/a3/2006/reviews/ |title=2006 Audi A3 Reviews by Cars.com Experts and Consumers |publisher=Cars.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]

===Entry-level luxury/compact executive cars===

This category is known as the compact executive car in Britain where it specifies both the price range and vehicle dimensions. In the U.S., there is a broader category called entry-level luxury, which includes the bottom vehicles in the line-up of luxury brands as well as the top-of-the-line models of some non-luxury brands.
Dimensionally, compact executive cars are smaller than Mid-size cars and sometimes even smaller than compact/Small family cars. Mass market compact cars typically use the economical front wheel drive transverse engine layout, well suited to the inline-4 engine, which also maximizes interior room.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.rearwheeldrive.org/rwd/rwdbenefits.htm |title=Benefits of Rear Wheel Drive |publisher=Rearwheeldrive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Several compact executive cars are rear-wheel drive with longitudinal engines, for improved stability and handling, and in order to accommodate the larger size of higher-performance engines (straight-6, V6, rarely V8), with four-wheel drive often being available.[tpl]cite web|url= http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2008-premium-compact-car-buying-guide.htm |title=The Consumer Guide to 2008 Premium Compact Cars |publisher=Consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Compact executive cars also tend to have more complicated independent suspensions, sportier transmissions, and high revolution engines that may require premium gasoline. The more complex powertrain and mechanical layouts of compact executive cars comes at increased cost and reduced interior passenger and trunk space.
Compact executive cars include the Acura ILX, Alfa Romeo 159, Volvo S60, Lexus IS, Infiniti G/Q50, Saab 9-3, BMW 2 Series, BMW 3 Series, Audi A4, Cadillac ATS, Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class and Mercedes-Benz C-Class which particularly emphasize sporty handling. In the United States and Canada these vehicles are known as entry-level luxury cars.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Comparos/articleId=156106 |title=2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS vs. 2009 Lexus ES 350 Comparison Test and Video on Inside Line |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2009-09-14[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/car-test-drives/test-drive-2009-bmw-328i-xdrive/ |title=Test Drive: 2009 BMW 328i xDrive |first=Chris |last=Chase |publisher=Autos Canada |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-09-14[/tpl]
The American and Canadian classification of entry-level luxury includes is a broad category which includes not only compact executive cars, but also midsize cars such as the Lexus ES, Acura TL, Buick LaCrosse, being similar in price to the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class.[tpl]cite web| |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/09q2/2009_infiniti_g37_vs._bmw_328i_audi_a4_and_acura_tl-comparison_tests |title=2009 Infiniti G37 vs. BMW 328i, Audi A4, and Acura TL - Comparison Tests |publisher=Caranddriver.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05[/tpl] However, the ES, TL, and LaCrosse do not fall under the European luxury classification of compact executive car nor are they sold in Europe. The ES and TL actually began as badge engineered versions of the mid-size Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, respectively, retaining the front wheel drive transverse engine layout, whereas Toyota's current Lexus IS does not share a platform with mass market Toyota cars. The ES and TL are not considered executive cars either (that slot is filled by the Lexus GS and Acura RL, respectively), despite similar dimensions, since executive cars usually emphasize higher performance, often being rear-wheel drive with longitudinal engines. The present iterations of the ES and LaCrosse emphasize "comfortable, reasonably priced luxury",[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Comparos/articleId=156106 |title=2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS vs. 2009 Lexus ES 350 Comparison Test and Video on Inside Line |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] while the TL has recently been targeted at the entry-level luxury sport market due to its SH-AWD.
Recently, the entry-level luxury has been very competitive, and there has been price-overlapping with well-equipped non-luxury cars.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=1668551 |title=How Mercedes got its groove back |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=2009-06-06 |accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Van |first=Nicolas |url= http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Luxury+makers+smash+August+sales+records/1971773/story.html |title=Luxury makers smash August sales records in Canada |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] The bestselling vehicles of the marque are frequently compact executive cars, such as the BMW 3 Series that makes up 40% of the vehicles that BMW sells worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.canadiandriver.com/2005/02/17/retrospective-bmw-3-series.htm |title=History and AutoShows » Retrospective: BMW 3 Series |publisher=CanadianDriver |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cars.com/bmw/535/2011/expert-reviews/?review=2&reviewId=56202 |title=2011 BMW 535 |first=Dan |last=Neil |publisher=Cars.com |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]

===Mid-luxury/executive cars===

The mid-luxury segment is commonly referred to as executive cars in Britain, Obere Mittelklasse in German, and Grandes Routières in French.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.autonews.fr/Ecologie/Actualite/CO2-classement-bonus-malus-302439/ |title=Ecologie: les reines du CO2 |first=Leo |last=Mingot |publisher=Auto News Fr |language=French |date=2012-09-14 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.oeamtc.at/?id=2500%2C1139059%2C%2C |title=Crashtest: Obere Mittelklasse Übersicht A - Z |language=German |publisher=ÖAMTC |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/driver_power/265642/best_executive_car.html |title=Best executive car |publisher=Auto Express |date=April 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120214073724/http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/driver_power/265642/best_executive_car.html |archivedate=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Examples of models in this category include Acura TL, Audi A6, Volvo S80, BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF, Cadillac CTS, Lexus GS, and Infiniti M.[tpl]cite journal|title=Mid-luxury sedans: The money class |journal=Consumer Reports |url= http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/past-road-test/luxury-sedans-11-07/overview/luxury-sedans-ov.htm |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=TopSpeed’s 10 Best Mid-Level Luxury Cars| url= http://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/topspeed-s-10-best-mid-level-luxury-cars-ar93725.html |author=Brian |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.car.com/content/shared/articles/templates/index.cfm/article_page_order_int/2/article_id_int/773 |title=Asian Luxury Comparison Test |publisher=Car.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Although Maserati vehicles have traditionally been priced as ultra-luxury cars, the new Maserati Ghibli III is intended to compete with high-spec executive cars, such as the Audi S6/S7, BMW 550i and Mercedes-Benz E550/CLS550.http://www.edmunds.com/maserati/ghibli/2014/road-test.htmlhttp://www.autoblog.com/2013/06/26/2014-maserati-ghibli-review-first-drive/ 
Although having similar dimensions to mid-size cars and large family cars, executive cars are engineered and positioned as premium vehicles with better performance and technology amenities. There are also higher development and production costs, as many well-known mid-luxury cars use the longitudinal (usually front engine rear wheel drive layout) engine mounting which affords space for powerful engines such as a V8, instead of the more economical transverse engine layout of mass market cars which are restricted to inline-4 or V6. Executive cars usually have lower sales and production volumes compared to mid-size cars, as base trims with less equipment and smaller engines are not sold in U.S. and Canadian markets.[tpl]cite web|last=Goodwin |first=Antuan |url= http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10291117-48.html |title=Mercedes debuts new, efficient, four-cylinder E-Class models |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Also due to the problem of steep depreciation, especially concerning cars from less prestigious brands, most executive cars are produced by marques that specialize in larger/more expensive vehicles. Particularly in the United States, the mid-luxury segment is dominated by Mercedes-Benz and BMW, as executive cars from lesser-known manufacturers such as Citroën and Infiniti have not had much success.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/automobiles/26AUTO.html?ex=1277438400&en=1337af6a5dedd2d5&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |newspaper=The New York Times|first=Michelle |last=Krebs |title=2006 Infiniti M35 and M45: The Japanese Take the Driver's Seat |date=2005-06-26 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/automobiles/autoreviews/20WHEEL.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Lawrence |last=Ulrich |title=Zen and the Art of Image Maintenance |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]

This bracket includes the lineup of Rolls Royce and Bentley, as these marques do not offer lower-priced offerings in the entry-level luxury or mid-luxury segments like more mainstream luxury brands like Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. As of late 2011, super luxury automakers have been "pledging higher sales and offering ever sexier models" despite the economic uncertainty.[tpl]cite news|first=Colleen |last=Barry |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0915/Maserati-Kubang-SUV-Super-luxury-vehicles-belie-gloomy-outlook |title=Maserati Kubang SUV: Super luxury vehicles belie gloomy outlook |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |agency=AP |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl]

By comparison, Maybachs were built alongside the Mercedes-Benz S-Class which partly explains why they have not fared well in the market and were discontinued in 2012. Furthermore the Maybach's brand pedigree was virtually unknown outside of Germany unlike its British rivals which have long enjoyed fame worldwide.[tpl]cite news|url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903885604576486064192002334.html |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |first=Vanessa |last=Fuhrmans |title=A Handful of Maybachs Isn't Enough |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/22/Autos/carreviews/rolls_maybach/index.htm |work=CNN |first=Peter |last=Valdes-Dapena |title=Rolls-Royce vs. Maybach |date=2006-04-04 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] A Bentley executive was quoted as saying "that the brand’s exclusivity, history and obsessive luxury help to convince customers that a Bentley is worth the price" which is at least twice that of a flagship luxury car from BMW or Mercedes-Benz.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/automobiles/autoreviews/a-threat-to-the-job-security-of-chauffeurs.html |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Lawrence |last=Ulrich |title=A Threat to the Job Security of Chauffeurs |date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Although Rolls-Royce and Bentley have traditionally been considered "as a purveyor of boxy British land yachts", newer offerings such as the Bentley Continental Flying Spur and Bentley Continental GT have "upended the super-premium auto segment, making Bentley for the first time a plausible choice for younger Hollywood and music stars".http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bentley-rolls-royce-two-new-444130http://notoriousluxury.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/the-showdown-part-ii-flying-spur-vs-ghost/http://europeluxurycarhire.com/bentley-rental/rent-bentley-continental-gt

===Luxury SUV/Crossover===

Although only becoming popular in the 1990s, this category has been said to be created with Kaiser Jeep's 1966 Super Wagoneer as the first true luxury four-wheel drive (4x4) vehicle.[tpl]cite book|last=Gunnell |first=John |title=American Cars of the 1960s: A Decade of Diversity |publisher=Krause Publications|year=2005 |page=213 |isbn=978-0-89689-131-9 [/tpl] It was the first serious off-road SUV to offer a V8 engine, automatic transmission, and luxury car trim and equipment.[tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/jeep/0801_4wd_1963_jeep_wagoneer/index.html |last=Foster |first=Patrick |title=1963 Jeep Wagoneer - Landmark Vehicle |journal=4 Wheel Drive & Sport Utility Magazine |date=January 2008 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] The Super Wagoneer was "a pioneer that blazed a trail for today's luxury SUVs".[tpl]cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1992-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer3.htm |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide |title=1966 Jeep Wagoneer |date=2007-08-29 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] It came with long list of standard equipment that included bucket seating with center console, air conditioning, seven-position tilt steering wheel, a vinyl roof, as well as "Antique Gold" trim panels on the body sides and tailgate. After American Motors Corporation (AMC) purchased Jeep, the vehicles were upgraded and refined, including features such as an optional electric sliding steel sun roof, "possibly the first offered on an SUV".[tpl]cite web|url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1992-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer4.htm |author=Auto Editors of Consumer Guide|title=1967-1977 Jeep Wagoneer |date=2007-09-29 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] The late-1970s Jeep Wagoneer Limited "set the sport-utility market on its ear ... was the most luxurious four-wheeler anyone had ever seen."[tpl]cite web| url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1992-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer5.htm |author=Auto Editors ofConsumer Guide |title=1978-1979 Jeep Wagoneer Limited |date=2007-08-19 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |accessdate=2014-03-14[/tpl]
The venerable Grand Wagoneer was still the leader in the luxury SUV market in 1986, and continued to be produced virtually unchanged through 1991, long after Chrysler bought out American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&pg=PA202&dq=The+venerable+Grand+Wagoneer+was+still+the+leader+in+the+luxury+SUV+market+in+1986 |title=The Story of Jeep |page=202 |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-87349-735-0 |accessdate=2012-09-14[/tpl] The SUV market soon expanded with new entrants.

The SUV models generated higher-profit-margins than ordinary automobiles, and automakers introduced new luxury models during the late 1990s.[tpl]cite book |last=Frankel |first=Ernst G.|title=Challenging American Leadership: Impact of National Quality on Risk of Losing Leadership |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |page=35 |isbn=978-1-4020-4892-0[/tpl] For some manufacturers such as Porsche and BMW, luxury SUVs were the first SUV models they produced. Luxury SUVs catered particularly to the U.S. market where station wagons were unpopular, often being produced in North America (such as BMW Spartanburg) instead of the luxury marque's home country. Some of these models were not traditional SUVs based on light trucks, rather they are classified as crossovers using unibody constructions. SUVs from non-luxury brands had experienced a surge in popularity through early 2000s, causing the traditional luxury marques to follow.[tpl]cite web|last=Magrath |first=Mike |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=152306 |title=Inside Line: News, Road Tests, Auto Shows, Car Photos and Videos |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=December 2011[/tpl]
SUVs from the luxury marques grew at almost 40 percent to more than 430,000 vehicles, excluding SUV-only brands like Hummer and Land Rover, while luxury car sales in the U.S. during 2003 suffered a 1% decline, and non-luxury SUV sales were flat. By 2004, 30 percent of major luxury brands' U.S. sales are now SUVs. Luxury brands in particular led the development of crossover SUVs (as opposed to body-on-frame SUVs), making it one of the fastest growing segments in the market, as the forecast for 2002 was approximately 240,000 vehicles and that could double by 2006.[tpl]cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3012/is_3_183/ai_99048983/ |title=Infiniti's 'Bionic Cheetah' chases Porsches and BMWs |publisher=Automotive Industries |accessdate=2010-12-07 |first=John |last=Peter |date=March 2003[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] Research data showed luxury SUV buyers are compared those vehicles to SUVs of mass market brands, and not shopping around luxury cars, thus the SUV is becoming the key to bringing new customers to the luxury dealerships.[tpl]cite news|last=Isidore |first=Chris |url= http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/06/news/companies/detroit_luxury_suv/ |title=Luxury SUVs: key to growth for luxury brands, SUV segment |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2004-01-07 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
Certain luxury SUVs use body-on-frame underpinnings, often being badge-engineered versions of their non-luxury counterparts, and retaining the rugged off-road and towing capabilities. Examples include the Lexus LX and Lincoln Navigator, which are the premium versions of the Toyota Land Cruiser (itself a luxurious SUV in the United States) and Ford Expedition, respectively.[tpl]cite web|url= http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Lexus_LX/ |title=2014 Lexus LX Reviews, Pictures and Prices |publisher=U.S. News Rankings and Reviews|date= |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
Other luxury SUVs are crossovers using unibody construction, often sharing the platform with compact executive and executive cars. For example, the Infiniti FX is based upon the Nissan FM platform that also underpins other Infiniti cars. Audi and BMW developed crossovers to compete in the SUV segment as they did not have an existing body-on-frame vehicle in their lineup.[tpl]cite news|first=Ted |last=Laturnus |url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/used-cars/used-cars-archive/bionic-cheetah-married-performance-practicality/article1145752/ |title=‘Bionic cheetah' married performance, practicality |publisher=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |accessdate=2014-03-11 |date=2012-08-23[/tpl] The Lexus RX was the earliest luxury crossover on the market, and it has since been the best-selling luxury vehicle in the US, so it has inspired similar competitors from rival marques.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.allbusiness.com/transportation/motor-vehicle-manufacturing/635959-1.html|title=Lexus The Truckmaker|date=2000-09-01 |publisher=Automotive Industries|last=Gross|first=Ken|accessdate=2008-11-15[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl] While early luxury crossovers released in the late 1990s have resembled traditional boxy SUVs, recent offerings have prioritized sportiness over utility — such as the Infiniti FX and BMW X6.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/infiniti/fx35/review.html|title=Inifiti FX35 Review (MY 2010)|accessdate=2010-01-21 |publisher=Edmunds.com|year=2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.cars.com/infiniti/fx35/2009/expert-reviews/ |title=2009 Infiniti FX35 |publisher=cars.com |date=2008-09-15 |first=David |last=Thomas |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/automobiles/autoreviews/22AUTO.html |newspaper=The New York Times |title=New-Age Mutant Ninja Wagons |first=Ezra |last=Dyer |date=2008-06-22 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Features===

Luxury cars tend to offer a higher degree of comfort than their mainstream counterparts, common amenities include genuine leather upholstery and polished "woodgrain-look" dashboards. Compared to mainstream vehicles, luxury cars have traditionally emphasized comfort and safety.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.forbes.com/vehicles/2007/05/11/car-safe-vehicle-forbeslife-cx_dl_0514safecars_slide_12.html?thisSpeed=15000 |last=Lienert |first=D. |date=2007-03-11 |title=Safest Cars 2007 |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2007-08-15 |deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Luxury vehicles are also a status symbol for conspicuous consumption.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/27/luxury-expensive-cars-lifestyle-vehicles_luxury_cars.html |title=Ten Reasons To Buy A Luxury Car |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2009-02-27 |first=Hannah |last=Elliott |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
Contemporary luxury cars also offer higher performance and better handling, which is often known as sport luxury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/Comparos/articleId=156106 |title=2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS vs. 2009 Lexus ES 350 Comparison Test and Video on Inside Line |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2009-09-14[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] However in Europe, where large-displacement engines are often heavily taxed and many luxury buyers shy away from conspicuous consumption, brands offer buyers the option of removing exterior engine-identifying badges.
Forbes noted that the reputation of luxury marques enables them to continually introduce many new safety technologies and comfort amenities, such as anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control and DVD entertainment systems, before they trickle down to mass market cars. Numerous "smart car" features are largely only found on luxury cars as of 2009.

===Layout and powertrain===

The rear-wheel drive with longitudinal engines (FR) is a common layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted front-wheel drive and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while more expensive than the FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other engine configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.

American manufacturers also largely followed the FR for their luxury brands (as well as their mass-market cars of the time). However, due to the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 and the 1979 fuel crises, began eliminating their FR platforms in favor of the more economical front wheel drive transverse engine layout (FF). Chrysler went 100% FF by 1990 and GM's Cadillac and Buick brands for the US were entirely FF by 1997. One of the few notable holdouts was Ford's Lincoln Town Car and Lincoln LS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popularhotrodding.com/features/0501phr_2005_ford_mustang/index.html |title=2005 Ford Mustang |publisher=Popularhotrodding.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-29[/tpl]

Since the 1980s, a host of new manufacturers have entered the luxury market to challenge the traditional players. The three major Japanese auto manufacturers, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan, created their respective luxury brands particularly for the US. As a result of voluntary export restraints imposed in 1981, these manufacturers were limited to a number of vehicles they could export. While these companies sidestepped this by establishing US production facilities for mass market vehicles, their home factories soon begun producing higher-priced cars as they carried a greater profit margin per car. Acura was launched in 1986, while Lexus and Infiniti were unveiled in 1989. By 1992, these three divisions had sales of over [tpl]USD|3.5 billion[/tpl], using lower prices and innovation to take market share from both domestic (Cadillac, Lincoln) and the European (Mercedes, Volvo, BMW, Audi and Jaguar) luxury car makers.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.ragm.com/books/corp_gov/cases/cs_gm.html |title=General Motors - A Corporate Governance Case Study |publisher=Web.archive.org |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080623201420/http://www.ragm.com/books/corp_gov/cases/cs_gm.html |archivedate=2008-07-23 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Hyundai had recently released the Genesis and the Equus, hoping to repeat the same strategy of undercutting their established competitors.[tpl]cite web|first=Paul A. |last=Eisenstein |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32860931/ns/business-the_drivers_seat/ |title=Luxury car market may never look the same |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl]
The Late-2000s recession was the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s that the luxury car market suffered considerably, something not seen in previous economic downturns. Many such customers saw their net worth decline following the collapse in financial markets and real-estate values.[tpl]cite news|first=Poornima |last=Gupta |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/11/retire-us-bentley-idUSTRE58A5NI20090911 |title=Bentley sees signs of revival in luxury car class |agency=Reuters |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] For example, some of the steepest dropoffs came at the high end, including the BMW 7 Series and Rolls Royce Phantom, and Mercedes-Benz unexpectedly dropped the starting price of its all-new 2010 E-Class. The unusually sharp decline in luxury car sales have led observers to believe that there is a fundamental shift and reshaping of the luxury automotive market, with one industry official suggesting that the marques no longer command the premiums that they used to, and another saying that conspicuous consumption was no longer attractive in poor economic conditions.
 Additionally, mainstream brands have been able to offer amenities and devices such as leather, wood, and anti-lock brakes, previously found only on luxury cars, as the costs decline.
However, luxury vehicle sales have not collapsed as much as their non-luxury counterparts.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hg7ZPPZIisna-qPbZtGBKr5P0s0g |title=Drop in Germany luxury car sales eases |publisher=AFP |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2008/12/01/focus1.html |title=Recession not a roadblock for luxury-car sales |journal=Triangle Business Journal |date=2008-12-01 |first=Richard R. |last=Rogoski |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Luxury vehicle marques generally benefited from financially healthier dealerships, better leasing and certified pre-owned programs and loyal customers, so sales are expected to rebound more quickly than mass market cars. Others note that there is growing interest in luxury vehicles from emerging markets such as China and Russia.
The entry-level luxury segment has been very competitive, and there has been price-overlapping with well-equipped non-luxury cars.[tpl]cite news|last=Van |first=Nicolas |url= http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Luxury+makers+smash+August+sales+records/1971773/story.html |title=Luxury makers smash August sales records in Canada |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=2009-09-08 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120320081039/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Luxury+makers+smash+August+sales+records/1971773/story.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=1668551 |title=How Mercedes got its groove back |publisher=Financialpost.com |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-09-10[/tpl] For example, in Canada, several luxury manufacturers set sales records in August 2009, due mostly to aggressive incentives on entry-level luxury vehicles.[tpl]cite news|first=Michael |last=Vaughan |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/auto/incentives-are-an-expensive-way-to-sell/article1280912/ |title=Incentives are ‘an expensive way to sell' |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2012-09-14[/tpl] In September 2009, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and Audi all saw their Canadian sales increase by more than 10 per cent compared to a year earlier, despite overall Canadian auto sales being down 3.5 per cent compared to September 2008. The head of Mercedes-Benz Canada suggested that the brand "has been able to attract 'middle-class' consumers even during the recession because of the sense that owning a Mercedes comes with 'membership in a club'." BMW Canada's chief said luxury cars continued to be attractive, "I think due to new product offensives and due to new design and due to the fact that we are the benchmark in all areas when it comes to fuel efficiency... that together stimulates a lot of the market".[tpl]cite web|last=Owram |first=Kristine |url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iWIblSq0S_nSCxSAcBwbXUX-FlIw |title=The Canadian Press: Luxury brands' product, pricing helps them sell more cars despite economy |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl] BMW has managed to remain profitable in 2009 while other competitors were posting losses, by scaling down production quickly to avoid cash burn through bloated inventories.[tpl]cite news|url= http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100713-708006.html |title=3rd UPDATE: BMW Lifts 2010 Guidance As Demand Improves |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-06-13 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100728225017/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100713-708006.html |archivedate=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2014-03-15[/tpl]
In 2010, BMW was the best-selling luxury vehicle manufacturer by sales, ahead of rivals Audi AG and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz marque.
