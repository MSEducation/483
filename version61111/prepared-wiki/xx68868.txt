Octavio Antonio Fernández Castro (born June 30, 1962), better known as Tony Fernández, is a former Major League Baseball player most noted for his defensive skills, setting a nine-year record for shortstops with a .992 fielding percentage in 1989.[tpl]cite book|last=Porter|first=David|coauthors=Joe Naiman|title=The San Diego Padres Encyclopedia|publisher=Sports Publishing|year=2002|page=235|isbn=978-1-58261-058-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rcilc7h_2oMC&pg=PA235|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl]

==Career==

Fernández was first scouted by the Toronto Blue Jays' famed Latin America scout Epy Guerrero[tpl]cite journal|last=MacNow|first=Glen|date=June 1986|title=San Pedro de Macoris, Cradle of Major League Talent|journal=Baseball Digest|publisher=Lakeside Publishing|volume=45|issue=6|page=64|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8jMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl] and was signed as an undrafted free agent. Promoted to the Blue Jays in [tpl]by|1983[/tpl],[tpl]cite book|last=Tan|first=Cecilia|title=The 50 Greatest Yankee Games|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|page=184|isbn=978-0-471-65938-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1tVMwr2nmzoC&pg=PA184|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl] Fernández became the team's full-time shortstop in [tpl]by|1985[/tpl], and contributed significantly to the team winning its first division title that year. Fernández continued to star for the Jays for several years afterwards. His 213 hits in 1986 were, at the time, a major league single-season record for a shortstop (the record has since been surpassed).
Before the 1991 season, Fernández was traded to the San Diego Padres in a major deal that also sent Jays star Fred McGriff to San Diego in exchange for Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter. Fernández played well for San Diego for two years and then began the [tpl]by|1993[/tpl] season with the New York Mets. After a disappointing start, he was traded back to the Blue Jays. He played well for the remainder of the season and was instrumental in helping the Blue Jays win the 1993 World Series. In that World Series, Fernández drove in nine runs, a record for a shortstop.[tpl]cite book|last=Westcott|first=Rich|coauthors=Alan Kravetz|title=Phillies '93: An Incredible Season|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1994|page=136|isbn=978-1-56639-231-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=l_sK8igVkBUC&pg=PA13|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl]
Fernández played for the New York Yankees in 1995. It was because of an injury early in the season that Derek Jeter was called up to the major leagues for the first time.

In [tpl]by|1997[/tpl], he reached the World Series again, with the Cleveland Indians, thanks in large part to his own game-winning home run against Baltimore in the American League Championship Series.  This is the only 1-0 game in postseason history where the run was an extra-innings home run. Playing at second base, he committed an error in the bottom of the 11th inning in Game 7 of the World Series; this broke up a potential double play, and the eventual World Series-winning run was put on base.[tpl]cite book|last=McKelvey|first=G.

In [tpl]by|1998[/tpl], he rejoined the Blue Jays, and revitalized his hitting, batting over .300 in two seasons there.[tpl]cite book|last=Porter|first=David L.|title=Biographical Dictionary of American Sports: Baseball, A-F|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2000|page=466|isbn=978-0-313-31174-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=019z2vcdBhUC&pg=PA466|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl] In [tpl]by|2000[/tpl], Fernández played for the Seibu Lions in Japan[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E1DB143EF93BA35751C0A9669C8B63&fta=y|title=Fernandez Signs With Seibu Lions |date=2008-02-08|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-21|archivedate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ekAmtrbu[/tpl] before returning to the majors the following year. When he returned in [tpl]by|2001[/tpl], he briefly played for the Milwaukee Brewers but returned to Toronto late in the season,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/08/fernandez010608.html|title=Jays sign Tony Fernandez|date=2001-06-08|work=CBC Sports|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-21|archivedate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ekBDiecC[/tpl] and retired at its conclusion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061223&content_id=1767401&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Slick-fielding Fernandez seeks Hall call|last=Bastian |first=Jordan|date=2006-12-26|work=MLB.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=2009-02-21|archivedate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ekBTfVVi[/tpl]
A very thin man, Fernández had a tilted, wavering batting stance[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umm.ca/umm_administration/objects/metadata/812376001224093700.pdf|title=Sportsnet’s baseball panel discuss the greatest Jays to ever play the game|last=Zaiontz|first=Dan|work=Urban Male Magazine|page=65|accessdate=2009-02-21|archivedate=2009-02-20|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ekCQCwI3[/tpl] that made it appear as if he might not be strong enough to hold his bat. From early in his career he carried a scar on his right cheek from a pitched ball. Fernández was a noted fitness fanatic; he liked buying unusual home exercise machines and trying them out in the clubhouse.
Early in his career, Fernández was well known for his exceptional defensive skills at shortstop, and was described by Ivan Maisel in a Sports Illustrated article as having "the range of a Texas cattleman".[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119535/index.htm|title=The Blue Jays Are Ruling The Roost|last=Maisel|first=Ivan|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=1985-06-03|accessdate=2012-01-23[/tpl] He was especially famous for leaping into the air while simultaneously making an underhanded throw to first base, on balls hit far to his right.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050928&content_id=1227703&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Who tops list of Latino shortstops?|last=Sanchez|first=Jesse|date=2005-09-25|work=MLB.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=2009-03-04|archivedate=2009-03-04|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5f25xvz3U[/tpl]
Fernández was awarded four consecutive Gold Glove Awards for his defense, from 1986 to 1989.[tpl]cite book|last=Shofner|first=Shawndra |title=The Story of the Toronto Blue Jays|publisher=The Creative Company|year=2007|page=15|isbn=978-1-58341-503-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JR7wkxO3xU8C&pg=PA15|accessdate=2009-02-20[/tpl] Fernández was also named to five All-Star teams. He finished his career with a .288 batting average in 2,158 games played, and batted .327 in postseason play.  Fernandez hit for the cycle as a New York Yankee on September 3, 1995 playing against the Oakland Athletics.[tpl]cite journal|year=1997|month=September|title=Baseball Digest|publisher=Lakeside Publishing|volume=56|issue=9|page=92|issn=0005-609X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Wi4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA92|accessdate=209-02-20[/tpl]
