Sherlock Holmes was Wrong: Re-opening the Case of the "Hound of the Baskervilles" is a 2007 book by French professor of literature, psychoanalyst, and author Pierre Bayard.  
By re-examining the clues, and carefully interpreting them in the context in which Doyle's book was conceived and written, Bayard clears the hound of all wrongdoing and argues that the actual murderer got away with the crime completely unsuspected by Holmesâ€”not to mention by the numerous readers of the story over the past century and even, in a sense, by the author himself.
The book is translated from the French edition.Sherlock Holmes was Wrong! | stevereads - Open Letters Monthly

==Critical reception==

The University of Illinois' The Online Gargoyle wrote in its review that the premise of the book "is original, but it is annoying in its uncreative, hole-poking nature."Book Review: Sherlock Holmes Was Wrong: Reopening the Case of the Hound of the Baskervilles | Online Gargoyle
