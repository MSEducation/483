==Biography==

In 1992, his first novel Yume no ki ga tsugeta nara ("If Only the Dream Trees Could Touch") appeared in Hayakawa Shobo (Tokyo)'s SF Magazine. His short story "Spice" won the Hayakawa AwardAnime on DVD Interview at Anime Expo 2002 By Andrew Tei in 1993.
In 1996, he published his first long novel in three volumes, Seikai no Monshou (Seikai no Monshō/Crest of the Stars). In the next year 1997 Seikai no Monsho was awarded with
Seiun AwardLoneStarCon2 The 55th World Science Fiction Convention Saturday, August 30, 1997 at the Japan SF Convention. He released its sequel Seikai no Senki (Banner of the Stars), where he said that Seikai no Monsho was actually an overture to Seikai no Senki. Morioka had already suggested in Seikai no Monshou 2 that the entire series should narrate the life of Princess Lamhirh (aka Lafiel), from her birth to her eventual ascension to the imperial throne. Five volumes of Seikai no Senki are now available, with Morioka naming the first three the "Diahoc Trilogy", but the series itself has not yet finished.  An English translation of "Seikai no Monshō/Crest of the Stars" has been published by Tokyopop, which came out from the fall of 2006 to May 2007.
Aside from the Seikai series, he published another Senki in 4 volumes, based on Japanese mythology, as well as a two-volume series, Seikai no Danshō (Fragments of the Stars), a collection of stories set in the same universe as the other two series.
His characteristics as a writer include a deep interest for linguistics (especially for conlangs), artificial intelligence, bitter humor, and well-designed world settings.
