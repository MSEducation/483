IsiNgqumo (literally "decisions" in the language itself) is an argot used by the homosexuals of South Africa and Zimbabwe who speak Bantu languages, as opposed to Gayle, a language used by the homosexuals of South Africa who speak Germanic languages. IsiNgqumo developed during the 1980s.http://www.sephis.org/pdf/epprecht.pdf, page 1, paragraph 3 Unlike Gayle IsiNgqumo has not been thoroughly researched or documented, so figures on numbers of speakers are nonexistent.
IsiNgqumo is a Nguni language and seems to have derived from Zulu.http://www.sephis.org/pdf/epprecht.pdf, page 5, paragraph 3 IsiNgqumo is often considered a Western invention by indigenous Zimbabweans but it was actually a creation of indigenous homosexuals, an only recently self-aware group.
