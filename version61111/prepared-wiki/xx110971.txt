Anthony "Tony" Chimel (born October 11, 1961) is an American professional wrestling ring announcer, employed by WWE.

==WWE (1991â€“present)==

Before Chimel was a ring announcer, he and Joey Marella were the main ring technicians for the WWE. Chimel then began announcing duties for the company in 1991, working mostly non-televised house shows and filling in for Howard Finkel whenever necessary.[tpl]cn|date=April 2012[/tpl]

===SmackDown===

Chimel was the SmackDown ring announcer from its inception in 1999. He was also the ring announcer at SmackDown brand pay-per-views from 2002-2007. He defeated Howard Finkel for the rights to be SmackDown announcer in 1999 in a tuxedo match.
On Kurt Angle's final episode as SmackDown General Manager in 2004, he demanded Chimel to come into the ring and give an apology to him; Chimel complied but then was fired by Angle. He was almost immediately re-hired by Vince McMahon.
From 2005 to 2007 Chimel was involved in a mini-feud with Mr. Kennedy, who claimed that Chimel was not announcing his name with the proper respect that it deserved. This feud included Chimel being punched, being "told to take a bow" (hit in the groin), and having a doughnut shoved in his mouth by Kennedy.
On the December 22, 2006 episode of SmackDown, he announced The Boogeyman as victorious too enthusiastically and caught his attention. The Boogeyman forced worms into his mouth as a result. Chimel ran away from the ring afterwards. This was a storyline for Chimel to take some time off to rest his nagging back injury and spend more time with his family. ECW announcer Justin Roberts was the ring announcer of SmackDown until Chimel returned on April 13, 2007.

===Various swapping brands (2007-present)===

In 2007, Chimel swapped ring announcing duties with Justin Roberts, becoming the ring announcer for the ECW brand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/07/04/4312404.html|title=ECW: Pick Your Poison|date=2007-07-04|last=Mackinder|first=Matt|accessdate=2009-01-21|publisher=SLAM! Sports[/tpl] Chimel began announcing on WWE Superstars, and made his first appearance on the April 30, 2009 episode. After Justin Roberts left SmackDown to become the new ring announcer for the Raw brand, Chimel left ECW and returned to SmackDown for his second stint as ring announcer. He then became the announcer of the ECW brand when the last ECW announcer, Lauren Mayhew, quickly left the WWE, before returning to SmackDown.
He was demoted from SmackDown when former Raw announcer Lilian Garcia returned to the WWE in December 2011. At the December 27 taping of SmackDown, NXT, & Superstars, it was revealed that Chimel would be announcing for NXT and the SmackDown portion of WWE Superstars, replacing the departing Eden Stiles. Chimel announced for NXT until the end of the final season of its original run.
He is currently the ring announcer for WWE Main Event as well as for WWE live events, and he was the ring announcer for the short-lived WWE Saturday Morning Slam. He briefly returned to Raw on September 9, 2013, and Smackdown on September 13, 2013, to announce the returning Edge to the ring. On November 16 at WWE live event in the United Kingdom, Chimel delivered a stunner to Curtis Axel after Axel forced Chimel to announce that Axel was still the Intercontinental Champion following Axel's win over R-Truth. Afterward, Chimel was kissed by one of the Bella Twins.[tpl]cite web|last=Middleton|first=Marc|title=Latest WWE NXT Hulu Highlight, Tony Chimel Hits A Stunner And Gets A Kiss, JR On Savage-HOF|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1117/567433/latest-wwe-nxt-hulu-highlight/#3k5vmc4JDY2vluQD.99|accessdate=November 17|publisher=WrestlingInc[/tpl]
