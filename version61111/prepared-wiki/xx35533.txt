Cape Range National Park  is a national park in Western Australia, [tpl]convert|1105|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Perth.
The park occupies the western side of the North West Cape peninsula over an area of [tpl]convert|47655|ha[/tpl]. The nearest town is Exmouth. Directly off the coast is the Ningaloo Reef.
The area resulted from a gradual uplifting from the sea floor followed by fluctuating sea levels, wind and water erosion that have slowly eroded the range and plain leaving behind a range of rugged limestone, deep canyons and pristine beaches.
The Cape is the only elevated plateau composed of limestone on the North West Coast. The range has plateaus to an elevation of [tpl]convert|314|m|ft|0[/tpl] and forms the backbone of the peninsula which extends are far as North West Cape.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturebase.net/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,1/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment and Conservation - Parkfinder|year=2008|accessdate=4 May 2010[/tpl]
