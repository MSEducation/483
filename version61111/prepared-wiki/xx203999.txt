The Springfield metropolitan area is a region that is socio-economically and culturally tied to the City of Springfield, Massachusetts. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines the Springfield, MA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as consisting of three counties in Western Massachusetts. As of July 1, 2009, the metropolitan area's population was estimated at 698,903.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2009/CBSA-EST2009-01.csv | title = Table 1.

An alternative system of measuring New England metropolitan areas has developed - called the NECTA - because, in New England, major cities and surrounding towns are often much smaller in land area than in other parts of the United States.  For example, the City of Springfield is 33.2 sq. miles, whereas the City of Fort Worth, Texas is 298.9 sq. miles, nearly 10 times larger in land area than Springfield. Because of the huge discrepancy in land area, in general New England cities like Springfield feature much higher population densities.  In addition, New England cities and towns have developed allegiances that transcend state borders; thus, cities in Connecticut are included in Springfield's NECTA. This system is thought to better approximate New England's metropolitan areas because it uses New England's geographically smaller building blocks. In Springfield's case, its NECTA consists of 51 additional cities/and towns surrounding the city.
