[[Nuclear engineering]]

CATEGORIES: Engineering disciplines, Nuclear technology

Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of the breakdown (fission) as well as the fusion of atomic nuclei and/or the application of other sub-atomic physics, based on the principles of nuclear physics. In the sub-field of nuclear fission, it particularly includes the interaction and maintenance of systems and components like nuclear reactors, nuclear power plants, and/or nuclear weapons. The field also includes the study of medical and other applications of (generally ionizing) radiation, nuclear safety, heat/thermodynamics transport, nuclear fuel and/or other related technology (e.g.,Â radioactive waste disposal), and the problems of nuclear proliferation.Journal of Petroleum Engineering and Technology[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stmjournals.com |title=Journal of Petroleum Engineering and Technology |work=JoPET |accessdate=2011-03-20[/tpl]

==Professional areas==

Smaller elements and other particles including neutrons.
The United States gets about 18
% of its electricity from nuclear power plants.http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/tablees1a.html Nuclear engineers in this field generally work, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry or for national laboratories. Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical, proliferation-resistant reactor designs with passive safety features. Although government labs research the same areas as industry, they also study a myriad of other issues such as nuclear fuels and nuclear fuel cycles, advanced reactor designs, and nuclear weapon design and maintenance.  A principal pipeline for trained personnel for US reactor facilities is the Navy Nuclear Power Program.

===Nuclear medicine and medical physics===

An important field is medical physics, and its subfields nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, health physics, and diagnostic imaging.http://www.aapm.org/medical_physicist/fields.asp From x-ray machines to MRI to PET, among many others, medical physics provides most of modern medicine's diagnostic capability along with providing many treatment options.

===Nuclear materials and nuclear fuels===

Nuclear materials research focuses on two main subject areas, nuclear fuels and irradiation-induced modification of materials.  Improvement of three nuclear fuels is crucial for obtaining increased efficiency from nuclear reactors. Irradiation effects studies have many purposes, from studying structural changes to reactor components to studying nano-modification of metals using ion-beams or particle accelerators.
