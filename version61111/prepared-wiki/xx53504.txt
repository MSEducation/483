Chain stitch is a sewing and embroidery technique in which a series of looped stitches form a chain-like pattern.Reader's Digest Complete Guide to Needlework. The Reader's Digest Association, Inc. (March 1992). ISBN 0-89577-059-8, p. 32-33 Chain stitch is an ancient craft - examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th – 3rd century BC).Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: World Textiles, Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, 1999, ISBN 0-8212-2621-5, p. 178 Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic "drawing" in thread.Gillow and Sentance: World Textiles, p. 178
Chain stitches are also used in making tambour lace, needlelace, macramé and crochet.

==History==

The earliest archaeological evidence of chain stitch embroidery dates from 1100 BC in China. Excavated from royal tombs, the embroidery was made using threads of silk.[tpl]cite book|author=Mary Schoeser|title=Silk|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LpVdUddNkGUC&pg=PA18|accessdate=15 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11741-7|page=18|quote=from the same dates comes the earliest evidence of chain stitch embroidery, worked with silk threads[/tpl] Chain stitch embroidery has also been found dating to the Warring States period.

==Applications==

===Hand embroidery===

Chain stitch and its variations are fundamental to embroidery traditions of many cultures, including Kashmiri numdahs, Iranian Resht work, Central Asian suzani, Hungarian Kalotaszeg "written embroidery",Gillow and Sentance: World Textiles, p. 178-179 Jacobean embroidery, and crewelwork.

===Machine sewing and embroidery===

Chain stitch was the stitch used by early sewing machines; however, as it is easily unravelled from fabric, this was soon replaced with the more secure lockstitch. This ease of unraveling of the single-thread chain stitch, more specifically known as ISO 4915:1991 stitch 101, continues to be exploited for industrial purposes in the closure of bags for bulk products.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.unionspecial.de/ftp/literature/BagClosing.pdf|author=Union Special|title=Closing Machines BC100 and 80800|page=2|accessdate=2009-05-26[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.amefird.com/stitchtypematrixflyer2.pdf|title=ISO Stitch Terminology|author=American & Efird|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-28[/tpl]
Machine embroidery in chain stitch, often in traditional hand-worked crewel designs, is found on curtains, bed linens, and upholstery fabrics.
