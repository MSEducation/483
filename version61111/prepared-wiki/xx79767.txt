The term in English is from the Latin silva meaning "forest, woods."  This root is found in place names in Canada such as Sylvan Lake  http://www.sylvanlake.ca/  (as in wooded lake) in Alberta, Sylvan Valley Regional Park Reserve in Saskatchewan, and in the United States like Pennsylvania (lit. "Penn's woods") and Spotsylvania.  The first names Sylvester and Sylva(i)n, and the female name Sylvia/Silvia, are also from the Latin word.
