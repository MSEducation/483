The hotel's signature restaurant is the Grant Grill, which opened in 1952. It became a power-lunch spot for downtown businessmen and politicians, so much so that "ladies" were not permitted in the restaurant after 3 PM. In 1969 a group of prominent local women staged a sit-in which resulted in the restaurant abandoning its men-only policy.San Diego Union Tribune, September 3, 2006
The Grant Hotel was, for nearly 35 years, until 1974, known as the site of the annual reunion dinner of the "Great White Fleet Association," a group of sailors who sailed on the cruise of 16 white battleships from 1907-09.[tpl]cite news |title=Huge Navy Cruise Urged |agency=Associated Press |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_ylPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9AEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7398%2C2171571 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |date=17 December 1969 |accessdate=23 March 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite book |last=Alden |first=John Doughty |title=The American steel navy: a photographic history of the U.S. Navy from the introduction of the steel hull in 1883 to the cruise of the Great White Fleet, 1907-1909 |year=1972 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |isbn=9780870216817 |page=349 [/tpl] These dinners attracted a wide range of military officials and guests from all over the world.
