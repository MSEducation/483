</ref>  Compounds with the prefix '''perfluoro-''' are hydrocarbons, including those with heteroatoms, wherein all C-H bonds have been replaced by C-F bonds.  Fluorocarbons and their derivatives are useful [[fluoropolymer]]s, [[refrigerants]], [[solvent]]s, [[anesthetics]].  They are also the basis of some controversies, e.g., the [[ozone depletion|ozone depletors]] and problems with bioaccumulation of [[fluorosurfactant]]s.  

==Perfluoroalkanes==

===Chemical properties===

Perflluoroalkanes are very stable because of the strength of the carbonâ€“fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry.[ref]
