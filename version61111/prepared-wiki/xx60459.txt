St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport [tpl]airport codes|PIE[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx | title = IATA Airport Code Search (PIE: St.Pete/Clearwater) | publisher = International Air Transport Association | accessdate = December 31, 2012[/tpl]|KPIE|PIE[/tpl] is a public and military use airport owned by and located in Pinellas County, Florida, United States. It is eight nautical miles (9 mi, 15 km) north of the central business district of St. Petersburg and [tpl]convert|6|NM|0[/tpl] southeast of Clearwater.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=27%B058%2725%22N+82%B045%2751%22W-KPIE&MS=wls&DU=nm | title = Distance and heading from Clearwater (27°58'25"N 82°45'51"W) to KPIE (27°54'36"N 82°41'15"W) | publisher = Great Circle Mapper | accessdate= December 31, 2012[/tpl] The airport serves both cities and the surrounding Tampa Bay Area.
This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 417,223 enplanements in calendar year 2011, an increase of 8.54 percent from 384,394 in 2010.
While most scheduled commercial airline traffic in the Tampa Bay Area uses Tampa International Airport (TPA), ten miles (16 km) to the east, St. Pete–Clearwater remains a destination airport for low-cost carriers.  St. Pete–Clearwater now serves as a focus city for Las Vegas based carrier Allegiant Air. The airport also serves as the gateway airport to Pinellas County.
Because of its lesser pace of operations, PIE is frequently used instead of TPA as a destination airport by pilots of private planes and executive jets for access to the Tampa Bay Area.
The airport uses "wikt:Tampa Bay The Easy Way" as an advertising slogan and Fly2PIE in reference to its three-letter IATA and FAA codes.

==History==

The airport is located on the west shoreline of Tampa Bay, six miles (10 km) north of St. Petersburg, Florida (the "birthplace of commercial air transportation"). Barely a decade after the pioneer flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk in 1903, the first tickets for airline travel were sold by the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line of Tony Jannus to fare-paying passengers. Using a Benoist XIV amphibious aircraft, the inaugural flight took place from a location near the downtown St. Petersburg Pier.[tpl]cite web |title=Tony Jannus —An Enduring Legacy of Aviation |publisher=Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society |url=http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history.html |accessdate=April 25, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080204230034/http://www.tonyjannusaward.com/history.html  |archivedate = February 4, 2008[/tpl] Mayor Abram C. Pheil of St. Petersburg and Mae Peabody of Dubuque, Iowa, were the first passengers, flying across the bay to Tampa and, according to a United Press account, reportedly reaching the maximum speed of 75 miles per hour during the flight. Other reports indicate that they reached an altitude of [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|0[/tpl].
This historic event marked the beginning of commercial air transportation anywhere in the world and is commemorated by a replica of the Benoist aircraft and a plaque at the airport terminal baggage claim area. Another replica is displayed at the St. Petersburg Museum of History adjacent to the Pier. Since 1991, the terminal holds the archives of the Florida Aviation Historical Society.

===Construction and wartime===

Construction of the airport at its present site started in March 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the airport was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces, which used it as a military flight training base assigned to Third Air Force.
The 304th Fighter Squadron, a combat training unit of the 337th Fighter Group based P-40 Warhawks and, later, P-51 Mustangs at Pinellas Army Airfield (as it was then known) for the duration of World War II.  Antisubmarine patrols were also flown from the airfield.
To commemorate the airport's vital role during that conflict, a plaque was dedicated at the airport terminal in 1994 by the P-51 Fighter Pilots Association and Brigadier General James H. Howard, who was the only European Theater fighter pilot to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II and later served as the last wartime base commander of Pinellas Army Airfield. A permanent exhibit honoring General Howard is located in the terminal.

===Postwar operation===

After World War II, the airport property was returned to Pinellas County by the U.S. government to operate as a commercial airport. It was originally called Pinellas International Airport and given the IATA designation, PIE, which it still uses, because PIA was already taken by Peoria International Airport.[tpl]citation |title= Insiders' Guide to the Greater Tampa Bay Area: Including Tampa, St. Petersburg, & Clearwater |series= Insiders' Guide Series |first= Anne W. |last= Anderson |publisher= Globe Pequot |year= 2010 |isbn= 9780762753475 |page= 16 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=f4LDwCA8B3EC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=St.+Petersburg-Clearwater+International+Airport+name+change&source=bl&ots=b4DAhEDjWz&sig=oBM_K_9uYU7oSpJZEbQZ6Qw22mY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7rVkUJ_PFcyLhQeopYGoAw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=St.%20Petersburg-Clearwater%20International%20Airport%20name%20change&f=false [/tpl] It was later changed to St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport because, according to airport manager "Bobo" Hayes, tourists didn't know where Pinellas county was.[tpl]citation |title= Aviation in Florida |first= Kevin M. |last= McCarthy |others= Illustrated by William Trotter |edition= illustrated |publisher= Pineapple Press Inc |year= 2003 |isbn= 9781561642816 |pages= 159–164 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=jdIClpM7DgQC&pg=PA163&lpg=PA163&dq=St.+Petersburg-Clearwater+International+Airport+name+change&source=bl&ots=jbLcafq4nN&sig=RyNrz748rYYXFF9PugyCxpGoQVM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7rVkUJ_PFcyLhQeopYGoAw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false [/tpl]
In the 1950s some airlines provided service to both PIE and TPA, such as Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines and Northwest Airlines. The April 1957 OAG shows 17 airline departures: ten Eastern, six National and one Mackey. Four of those flights were nonstop beyond Florida, including an Eastern DC-4 to Chicago and a 1049G to Pittsburgh.
With the advent of the Jet Age, the airport's runway was extended northward into Tampa Bay and the first commercial jet service to PIE was operated by Northwest. The greatly increased seating capacities of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, compared to the propeller-driven DC-6 and DC-7, prompted the Civil Aeronautics Board to approve the consolidation of commercial airline service at TPA in the early 1960s. Eastern was the last remaining air carrier at PIE when it terminated service in 1964. In the 1970s Air Florida flew Electras out of PIE; in 1982 Northeastern International started DC-8 nonstops to Islip, and in 1983 PeoplExpress started nonstops to Newark that Continental dropped in 1987. In 1987 American started nonstops to its Raleigh-Durham hub, but by October 1989 PIE again had no scheduled airlines.

===Recent developments===

In September 2006, Allegiant Air announced significant scheduled service from St. Petersburg–Clearwater to destinations in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Since then, Allegiant has grown its destination count to and from PIE to 21 airports across the eastern U.S. In February, the Lansing, Michigan service shifted to Grand Rapids, Michigan, with four weekly flights.
Also, the airport recently completed a $22 million renovation, including, among other things, expanding the gate sizes, new plumbing, and building loading bridges, as the current system requires all passengers to walk across the tarmac to the gate. These improvement played a significant roll in the airport luring Frontier Airlines to launch flights at the airport.'Other' airport gets facelift, St. Petersburg Times, June 26, 2007.
