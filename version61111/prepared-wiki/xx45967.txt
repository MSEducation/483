In late 1954 Evers' was named the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi.
In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He was involved with James Meredith's efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s. Evers' also helped Dr. Gilbert Mason Sr. organize the Biloxi Wade-Ins, protests against segregation efforts on the Mississippi Gulf Coast beaches.[tpl]cite book|author1=Dorian Randall|title=Medgar Evers: Direct Action|url=http://mdah.state.ms.us/senseofplace/2013/06/17/medgar-evers-direct-action/|accessdate=17 January 2014|date=17 June 2013[/tpl]
Evers’ civil rights leadership and investigative work made him a target of white supremacists. In the weeks leading up to his death, the hostility directed towards him grew. His public investigations into the murder of Emmett Till and his vocal support of Clyde Kennard had made him a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home.[tpl]cite web | url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-resolution/1022/text?textVersion=54662 | title =H.Res.1022 - Honoring the life and sacrifice of Medgar Evers and congratulating the United States Navy for naming a supply ship after Medgar Evers. | author =Hank Johnson | publisher =beta.congress.gov | date =January 21, 2013[/tpl] On June 7, 1963, Evers was nearly run down by a car after he emerged from the Jackson NAACP office.

==Assassination==

In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's speech on national television in support of civil rights, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read "Jim Crow Must Go," Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. He staggered [tpl]convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] before collapsing. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson where he was initially refused entry because of his color, until it was explained who he was; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later.Birnbaum, p. 490.[tpl]full[/tpl]
Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000.
On June 21, 1963, Byron De La Beckwith, a fertilizer salesman and member of the White Citizens' Council (and later of the Ku Klux Klan), was arrested for Evers' murder.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=1311 | title=Exposing the Secrets of Mississippi Racism | author=Dufresne, Marcel | journal=American Journalism Review |date=October 1991[/tpl]
District Attorney and future governor Bill Waller prosecuted De La Beckwith.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/02/medgar-evers-family-legacy/2378631/ | title =Medgar Evers: Assassin's gun forever changed a family | author =Jerry Mitchell | author2=The Clarion-Ledger | publisher =usatoday.com | date =June 2, 2013[/tpl] Juries composed solely of white men twice that year deadlocked on De La Beckwith's guilt.
In 1994, 30 years after the two previous trials had failed to reach a verdict, De La Beckwith was brought to trial based on new evidence. Bobby DeLaughter was the prosecutor. During the trial, the body of Evers was exhumed from his grave for an autopsy. De La Beckwith was convicted of murder on February 5, 1994, after having lived as a free man for much of the three decades following the killing (he was imprisoned from 1977 to 1980 for conspiring to murder A. I. Botnick). De La Beckwith appealed unsuccessfully, and died at age 80 in prison in January 2001.

==Legacy==

Evers's legacy has been kept alive in a variety of ways. Evers was memorialized by leading Mississippi and national authors, both black and white: Eudora Welty, James Baldwin, Margaret Walker and Anne Moody.Minrose Gwin"Mourning Medgar: Justice, Aesthetics, and the Local", Southern Spaces, 2008. In 1963, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |title=NAACP Spingarn Medal |publisher=Naacp.org |accessdate=2013-06-13[/tpl] In 1969, Medgar Evers College was established in Brooklyn, New York as part of the City University of New York. Evers's widow, Myrlie Evers co-wrote the book For Us, the Living with William Peters in 1967. In 1983, a movie was made based on the book. Celebrating Evers's life and career, it starred Howard Rollins, Jr. and Irene Cara as Medgar and Myrlie Evers, airing on PBS.

On the 40-year anniversary of Evers' assassination, hundreds of civil rights veterans, government officials, and students from across the country gathered around his grave site at Arlington National Cemetery to celebrate his life and legacy. Barry Bradford and three students—Sharmistha Dev, Jajah Wu and Debra Siegel, formerly of Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois—planned and hosted the commemoration in his honor."Medgar Evers", Arlingon Cemetery.

==In popular culture==

The murder and subsequent trials caused an uproar. Musician Bob Dylan wrote his 1963 song "Only a Pawn in Their Game" about the assassination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history-medgar-evers |title=NAACP Evers biography |publisher=Naacp.org |accessdate=2013-06-13[/tpl] Nina Simone wrote and sang "Mississippi Goddam" about the Evers case and Phil Ochs wrote the songs "Another Country" and "Too Many Martyrs" (also titled "The Ballad Of Medgar Evers") in response to the killing, with Matthew Jones and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Freedom Singers also recording the latter song.  Eudora Welty's short story "Where Is the Voice Coming From", in which the speaker is the imagined assassin of Medgar Evers, was published in The New Yorker in 1963."Where Is The Voice Coming From?", The New Yorker July 6, 1963 by Eudora Welty
Evers' story inspired a 1991 episode of the NBC TV series In the Heat of the Night, entitled "Sweet, Sweet Blues", written by author William James Royce. The story tells of a murder of a young black man and the elderly white man, played by actor James Best, who seems to have gotten away with the 40-year-old murder. (The TV episode preceded by several years the trial that convicted Beckwith.) In the Heat of the Night won its first NAACP Image Award for Best Dramatic Series that season.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000345/1992 | title = Image Awards | publisher = imdb.com | year = 1992 | accessdate = 12 September 2011[/tpl]
The 1996 film Ghosts of Mississippi, directed by Rob Reiner, tells the story of the 1994 retrial of Beckwith, in which prosecutor DeLaughter of the Hinds County District Attorney's office secured a conviction in state court. Beckwith and DeLaughter were played by James Woods and Alec Baldwin, respectively; Whoopi Goldberg played Myrlie Evers. Evers was portrayed by James Pickens, Jr.. The film was based on a book of the same name.[tpl]cite book|last=Vollers|first=Maryanne|authorlink=Maryanne Vollers|title=Ghosts of Mississippi: the murder of Medgar Evers, the trials of Byron de la Beckwith, and the haunting of the new South|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zix1QgAACAAJ|accessdate=2011-09-12|date=April 1995|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-91485-7[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Biography of Bobby B.
