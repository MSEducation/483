The Shamrock Summit was the colloquial name given to the 1985 meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and US President Ronald Reagan in Quebec City. So-named because of the Irish background of the two leaders, and due to the meeting being held on St. Patrick's Day, the event is considered a major political-cultural episode in Canada, mostly on the basis of the perceived symbolism of the summit. It was also a prelude to Mulroney's efforts to create far closer links between Canada and the United States, culminating in the 1988 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

==Background==

Mulroney enjoyed a close friendship with Reagan at the time; both men considered themselves conservatives politically, and shared a common agenda on many issues, notably Free Trade. This relationship was favourably contrasted in Canada with that between the Prime Minister's and President's predecessors, Pierre Trudeau and Richard Nixon, though it also bred some resentment among those who felt it was improper for Canadian-US relations to be too intimate. Canadian historian Jack Granatstein said that this "public display of sucking up to Reagan may have been the single most demeaning moment in the entire political history of Canada's relations with the United States."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4KxDd4K1X-gC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=single+most+demeaning+moment+in+the+entire+political+history+of+Canada%27s+relations+with+the+United+States&source=bl&ots=HHJbgQGOW0&sig=MbtpdjJZ5BM0ueIkSlzpf9vEomU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RZvUUpTaB6PmsATW2YLIDg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=single%20most%20demeaning%20moment%20in%20the%20entire%20political%20history%20of%20Canada's%20relations%20with%20the%20United%20States&f=false |title=Canada and the United States: Ambivalent Allies |first1=John Herd |last1=Thompson |first2=Stephen J. |last2=Randall |publisher=University of Georgia Press |date=2010-05-31 |page=265 |accessdate=2014-01-14[/tpl]
The camaraderie between the two men was most prominently displayed in the most famous event of the summit, when Reagan and Mulroney joined others in singing "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling". Commentator Eric Kierans observed that "The general impression you get, is that our prime minister invited his boss home for dinner."[tpl]cite book| last=Ferguson| first=Will| authorlink=Will Ferguson| title=Why I Hate Canadians| year=1997| accessdate=2007-09-03| publisher=Douglas & McIntyre| location=Vancouver, BC, Canada| isbn=1-55054-600-7| pages=112–113| chapter=11[/tpl][tpl]cite news| last=Steele | first=Andrew | title=Mr. Angry and Mr. Happy | publisher=The Globe and Mail | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/andrew-steele/mr-angry-and-mr-happy/article1312681/ | accessdate=April 13, 2010[/tpl]
