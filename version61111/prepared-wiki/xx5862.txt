CATEGORIES: Japanese deities, Shinto kami, Creation myths

In Japanese Shinto, Kotoamatsukami (別天津神, literally means "distinguishing heavenly kami") is the collective name for the first gods which came into existence at the time of the creation of the universe. They were born in Takamagahara, the world of Heaven at the time of the creation, as Amenominakanushi 天御中主 (Central master), Takamimusubi (High creation), Kamimusubi (Divine creation), and a bit later Umashiashikabihikoji (Energy) and Amenotokotachi (Heaven).
These forces then became gods and goddesses, the tenzai shoshin (heavenly kami) - Ame no minakanushi ; Takami-musubi no ōkami; Kamimusubi no ōkami; Umashiashikabihikoji ; Ame no Tokotachi ; Kuni no Tokotachi; Toyokumono; Uhijini no mikoto; Suhijini; Tsunokuhi ; Ikukuhi ; Ōtonoji ; Ōtonobe ; Omodaru ; Kashikone ; Izanagi ; Izanami ; and Amaterasu ōmikami.
