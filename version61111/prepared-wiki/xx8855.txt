Neapolitan sauce  or Napoli sauce is the collective name given (outside Italy) to various basic tomato-based sauces derived from Italian cuisine, often served over pasta and then sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
In Naples, Neapolitan sauce is simply referred to as la salsa, which literally translates to the sauce.  Basil, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, peppercorns, cloves, and mushrooms may be included depending on taste preferences. There are vegetarian variants with carrots and celery.La passata di pomodoro fatta in casa Italians refer to Neapolitan sauce only in association with other recipes, for instance, spaghetti napolitana.Spaghetti Napolitana | Thermominx
The sauce is a mainstay of Southern Italy as meat was traditionally scarce, with Bolognese sauce being attributed to Northern Italy. This sauce is also widely used in Italian-American cuisine, which has diverged from its Old World origins.
