===Ceramics and glass===

Lithium oxide is a widely used flux for processing silica, reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes of improved physical properties including low coefficients for thermal expansion.Worldwide demand by sector Lithium oxides are a component of ovenware. Worldwide, this is the single largest use for lithium compounds. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) is generally used in this application: upon heating it converts to the oxide.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/compounds.html |title=Some Compounds of the Group 1 Elements |last1=Clark |first1=Jim |year=2005 |website=chemguide.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-08[/tpl]

===Electrical and electronics===

In the later years of the 20th century, owing to its high electrochemical potential, lithium became an important component of the electrolyte and of one of the electrodes in batteries. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, should not be confused with lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.batteryreview.org/disposable-batteries.html |title=Disposable Batteries - Choosing between Alkaline and Lithium Disposable Batteries |publisher=Batteryreview.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emc2.cornell.edu/content/view/battery-anodes.html |title=Battery Anodes > Batteries & Fuel Cells > Research > The Energy Materials Center at Cornell |publisher=Emc2.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.

===Lubricating greases===

The third most common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils, and it is used to manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J_AkNu-Y1wQC&pg=PA559|page=559|title=Fuels and lubricants handbook: technology, properties, performance, and testing, Volume 1|author=Totten, George E.; Westbrook, Steven R. and Shah, Rajesh J.|publisher=ASTM International|year=2003|isbn=0-8031-2096-6[/tpl][tpl]cite book|pages=150–152|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3FkMrP4Hlw0C&pg=PA152|title=Significance of tests for petroleum products|author=Rand, Salvatore J. |publisher=ASTM International|year= 2003|isbn=0-8031-2097-4[/tpl]

===Metallurgy===

When used as a flux for welding or soldering, metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities. Its fusing quality is also important as a flux for producing ceramics, enamels and glass. Alloys of the metal with aluminium, cadmium, copper and manganese are used to make high-performance aircraft parts (see also Lithium-aluminium alloys).[tpl]cite book|author1=Davis, Joseph R.

===Other chemical and industrial uses===

====Pyrotechnics====

Lithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils and Holleman, Arnold Frederick Inorganic chemistry, Academic Press (2001) ISBN 0-12-352651-5, p. 1089

====Air purification====

Lithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams.  Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.
Lithium peroxide (Li2O2) in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but also releases oxygen.[tpl]cite book|chapter=Air Quality Systems for Related Enclosed Spaces: Spacecraft Air|author=Mulloth, L.M. and Finn, J.E.|title=The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry|year=2005|volume=4H|pages=383–404|doi=10.1007/b107253[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=AD0619497|title=Application of lithium chemicals for air regeneration of manned spacecraft|publisher=Lithium Corporation of America & Aeropspace Medical Research Laboratories|year=1965[/tpl] The reaction is as follows:

The high non-linearity of lithium niobate also makes it useful in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.[tpl]cite web|url =http://nl.computers.toshiba-europe.com/Contents/Toshiba_nl/NL/WHITEPAPER/files/TISBWhitepapertech.pdf|title = You’ve got the power: the evolution of batteries and the future of fuel cells|publisher = Toshiba|format = PDF|accessdate = 2009-05-17[/tpl]

Many other lithium compounds are used as reagents to prepare organic compounds.  Some popular compounds include lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), lithium triethylborohydride (LiBH(C2H5)3).

====Military applications====

Metallic lithium and its complex hydrides, such as LiAlH4, are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants. Lithium aluminum hydride can also be used by itself as a solid fuel.LiAl-hydride
The Mark 50 Torpedo stored chemical energy propulsion system (SCEPS) uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium. The reaction generates heat which is used to generate steam.

===Nuclear===

Lithium-6 is valued as a source material for tritium production and as a neutron absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons.[tpl]cite book|pages=59–60|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0oa1vikB3KwC&pg=PA60|title=Nuclear Wastelands: A Global Guide to Nuclear Weapons Production and Its Health and Environmental Effects|author=Makhijani, Arjun and Yih, Katherine |publisher=MIT Press|year= 2000|isbn=0-262-63204-7[/tpl] Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iRI7Cx2D4e4C&pg=PA278|page=278|title=Nuclear wastes: technologies for separations and transmutation|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1996|isbn=0-309-05226-2|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride still apparently plays a role in modern nuclear weapons, as a fusion material.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA39|page=39|title=How nuclear weapons spread: nuclear-weapon proliferation in the 1990s|author=Barnaby, Frank|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0-415-07674-9[/tpl]
Lithium fluoride, when highly enriched in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-BeF2 used in liquid fluoride nuclear reactors. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF2 mixtures have low melting points. In addition, 7Li, Be, and F are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross-sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor.Beryllium and fluorine occur only as one isotope, 9Be and 19F respectively. These two, together with 7Li, as well as 2H, 11B, 15N, 209Bi, and the stable isotopes of C, and O, are the only nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross sections aside from actinides to serve as major constituents of a molten salt breeder reactor fuel.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Baesjr|first1=C|title=The chemistry and thermodynamics of molten salt reactor fuels|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=51|page=149|year=1974|doi=10.1016/0022-3115(74)90124-X|bibcode = 1974JNuM...51..149B [/tpl]
In conceptualized nuclear fusion power plants, lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium:
Lithium is also used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei. When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed, which undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called "splitting the atom" at the time, was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction. It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XyOBx2R2CxEC&pg=PA139|page=139|title=Nobel Prize Winners in Physics|author= Agarwal, Arun|publisher=APH Publishing|year=2008|isbn=81-7648-743-0[/tpl]"'Splitting the Atom': Cockcroft and Walton, 1932: 9. Rays or Particles?" Department of Physics,University of Cambridge (Nuclear reactions and human-directed nuclear transmutation had been accomplished as early as 1917, but by using natural radioactive bombardment with alpha particles).
In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said the Lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decay of US nuclear infrastructure. The US shut down most of its machinery in 1963, given a huge surplus, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report said it would take five years and $10 million to $12 million.
Reactors that use lithium-7 heat water under high pressure and transfer heat through heat exchangers that are prone to corrosion. The reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid, which is added to the water to absorb excess neutrons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/business/energy-environment/report-says-a-shortage-of-nuclear-fuel-looms.html |title=Report Says a Shortage of Nuclear Ingredient Looms |author=MATTHEW L.

==Precautions==

Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate the nose and throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because of the caustic hydroxide produced when it is in contact with moisture. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.[tpl]Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=Oo3xAmmMlEwC&pg=PA244|pages = 244–246|isbn = 978-0-8493-2523-6|author = Furr, A.

===Regulation===

Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries, which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers. Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General – Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.ncjolt.org/sites/default/files/7_nc_jl_tech_421.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-10-05|title=Methamphetamine remediation research act of 2005: Just what the doctor ordered for cleaning up methfields—or sugar pill placebo?| journal=North Carolina Journal of Law & Technology|year=2006|volume=7|first=Aaron R.|last= Harmon[/tpl]
Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer lithium batteries have thermal overload protection built-in to prevent this type of incident, or their design inherently limits short-circuit currents. Internal shorts have been known to develop due to manufacturing defects or damage to batteries that can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.[tpl]Cite book|isbn = 978-0-306-44758-7|pages = 15–16|url = http://books.google.com/?id=i7U-0IB8tjMC&pg=PA15|author = Bro, Per and Levy, Samuel C.|year = 1994|publisher = Plenum Press|location = New York|title = Battery hazards and accident prevention[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/assistant/batteries.shtm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120104141539/http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/assistant/batteries.shtm |archivedate=2012-01-04 |title=TSA: Safe Travel with Batteries and Devices |publisher=Tsa.gov |date=2008-01-01[/tpl]
