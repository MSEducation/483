[[Fornicephalae]]

CATEGORIES: Mygalomorphae

The Fornicephalae are an infraorder of mygalomorph spiders, consisting of eight families with ca. 70 genera and 700 species.
They are opposed to the Tuberculotae, which make up the rest of the Mygalomorphae.
However, according to (Goloboff, 1993), neither group appears to be monophyletic.
