==Lancia Ro==

The Lancia Ro (or 264) was the first of a family of Lancia 4x2 heavy truck, starting in 1933. The Ro was built with two versions, a three cylinder gasoline (BM) engine or a two cylinder diesel (Nm) engine. The Ro was particularly robust truck, considered reliable, requiring little maintenance, and easy to drive. It was the first Italian truck to receive a 4 speed transmission. From 1934 to 1938 the Royal Italian Army acquired 4,757 Lancia Ro's   which were equipped with pneumatic tires where it was used to transport artillery and light tanks.
The Royal Italian Army deployed the Lancia Ro for the first time in North Africa in 1935-1936. The 228 Ro's sent there gave full satisfaction to the Italian Army. Ro's traveled over roads and tracks in all temperatures; and did not encounter difficulty in the mountain routes where grades can reach 25%. In Spain Ro's still proved reliable on roads, but its capacities over ground were very limited. 
The Lancia Ro was used by Royal Italian Army and Wehrmacht in World War II in all theaters of the war.

==Lancia 3Ro==

The Lancia 3 RO NM, 6.5-ton 4x2 heavy truck  ("Nafta Militare" = Diesel Military)
was manufactured by Lancia from 1938 to 1950 and used by the Royal Italian Army and Wehrmacht in WWII. The 3 Ro evolved from the earlier Lancia RO in 1938 by receiving a stronger five cylinder engine to replace the weaker two and three cylinder engine, pneumatic tires and an improved transmission.  The Lancia 3 Ro’s design was simple, functional and was considered the most reliable heavy truck of the Royal Italian Army in World War II serving in all theaters of the war.  Some 9,490 Lancia 3 Ro’s were built over the course of the war and came in many variants; troop transport, supply transport, 5000 liter fuel tanker, 4,000 liter water tanker, mobile repair workshops, anti-aircraft, and self-propelled guns.
In North Africa and Sicily with the top of the cab cut away and lower sideboards the Lancia 3 Ro became well suited for desert warfare serving as a self-propelled gun porting the Cannone da 90/53 as well as the 100/17 howitzer. German armed forces always in need of supplies and material made use of any Ro's and 3 Ro's as well as any another equipment, Italian, or otherwise that came into their possession.
After the Italian armistice of September 8, 1943, the Wehrmacht absorbed commandeered Ro and 3 Ro trucks from their former ally. In April 1944 with the Lancia factory in German controlled Italy, German armed forces placed an order for 772 3 Ro's built between January 1944 and February 1945. After WWII the 3 Ro was produced until 1950 and remained in service with the Italian Army with the last 3 Ro truck being retired in 1964.
