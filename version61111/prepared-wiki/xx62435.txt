Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon (2000) is a book by author Patrick Tierney that accuses geneticist James Neel and anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon, of conducting human research without regard for their subjects' well-being while conducting long-term ethnographic field work among the indigenous Yanomamö, in the Amazon Basin between Venezuela and Brazil. He also wrote that the researchers had exacerbated a measles epidemic among the Native Americans.[tpl]Cite news| first=Stacey | last=Silva | coauthors= | title=Meeting The Fierce People | date=1988-01-20 | publisher= | url =http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0601.pdf| work =The Daily Nexus | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | language = [/tpl]
While the book was positively reviewed and well received at first, later investigations by multiple independent organizations found Tierney's main allegations to be false and libelous.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=claim must be substantiated|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==Assessments==

In 2000, Tierney published Darkness in El Dorado, which accused geneticist James Neel and anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon of exacerbating a measles epidemic among the Yanomamo people, among other damning allegations.  This work initially received good reviews and was nominated for a National Book Award. Tierney's accusations against anthropologist Chagnon were accepted as fact by the New York Times book reviewer John Horgan; the resulting political controversy resulted in Chagnon's early retirement.[tpl]cite news|last=Horgan|first=John|title=Hearts of Darkness|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/reviews/001112.12horgant.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=login|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 12, 2000[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Chagnon|first=Napolean|title=Noble Savages|year=20132|isbn=978-0684855103[/tpl] At least one reviewer, John Tooby of Slate, thought the book was internally inconsistent and suggested that it should have been identified as fiction.John Tooby, "Jungle Fever: Did two US scientists start a genocidal epidemic in the Amazon or was The New Yorker duped?", Slate, 24 October 2000
Several inquiries related to Tierney's allegations against the researchers were conducted by the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and outside evaluators. Tierney's book was condemned by a number of academic researchers and professional associations, including the National Academy of Sciences,[tpl]cite web|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|date=November 9, 2000|title=Setting the Record Straight Regarding Darkness in El Dorado - A Statement from Bruce Alberts, President of the National Academy of Sciences|url=http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0538.htm|publisher=Anthropological Niche of Douglas W. Hume|accessdate=17 March 2013[/tpl] and the American Society of Human Genetics.[tpl]cite journal|last=American Society of Human Genetics|title=Response to Allegations against James V.

Tierney's charges against Neel and Chagnon were initially investigated by the Peacock Commission, later known as the  El Dorado Task Force, formed by the AAA. It supported Tierney and questioned the conduct of Neel and Chagnon; its findings were accepted by the AAA board in May 2002.
Because of dissension within the organization, the AAA subsequently requested an outside investigative team. It said in its preliminary report that the "book appears to be deliberately fraudulent", and that "Patrick Tierney has misconstrued or misrepresented his primary sources to a considerable degree in an effort to support his allegations."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/ucsbpreliminaryreport.pdf|title=Preliminary report: The major allegations against Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel presented in Darkness in El Dorado by Patrick Tierney appear to be deliberately fraudulent.[/tpl] The investigators concluded it was not Chagnon who committed any wrongdoing, but Tierney, who fraudulently altered evidence to support a story he either at best imagined or at worst manufactured.
In 2004  Thomas A. Gregor and Daniel R. Gross published their investigation of the AAA's reviews.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gregor|first=Thomas A.|coauthors=Daniel R. Gross|title=Guilt by Association: The Culture of Accusation and the American Anthropological Association's Investigation of Darkness in El Dorado|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1 December 2004|volume=106|issue=4|pages=687–698|doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.4.687|url=http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0588.pdf[/tpl] In 2005 they called for the membership of the AAA to rescind the organization's support of the book. This resolution passed overwhelmingly, 846 to 338.
A detailed investigation of Tierney's charges by a panel set up by the University of Michigan found the most serious charges to have no foundation and others to have been exaggerated. The Provost's office of the University of Michigan in November 2000 refuted almost all of Tierney's claims.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/Releases/2000/Nov00/r111300a.html | title=Statement from University of Michigan Provost Nancy Cantor on the book Darkness in El Dorado[/tpl] Sponsel and Turner, the two scientists who originally touted the book's claims, admitted that their charge against Neel "remains an inference in the present state of our knowledge: there is no 'smoking gun' in the form of a written text or recorded speech by Neel."
Alice Dreger, an historian of medicine and science, and an outsider to the debate, concluded after a year of research that Tierney's claims were false. She wrote that the AAA was complicit and irresponsible in helping spread these falsehoods and not protecting "scholars from baseless and sensationalistic charges".[tpl]cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice|title=Darkness’s Descent on the American Anthropological Association|journal=Human Nature|date=16 February 2011|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–246|doi=10.1007/s12110-011-9103-y[/tpl]
The AAA rescinded its support of the book and acknowledged fraudulent, improper and unethical conduct by Tierney. The association admitted that "in the course of its investigation, in its publications, in the venues of its national meetings and its web site, AAA condoned a culture of accusation and allowed serious but unevaluated charges to be posted on its website and expressed in its newsletter and annual meetings" and that its "report has damaged the reputations of its targets, distracted public attention from the real sources of the Yanomami tragedy and misleadingly suggested that anthropologists are responsible for Yanomami suffering".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/05ref_eldorado.htm |title=AAA Rescinds Acceptance of the El Dorado Report |work= | publisher=American Anthropological Association | year=2005 |accessdate=30 August 2013[/tpl]
The accusations of medical improprieties[tpl]Vague|date=November 2013[/tpl] contained in Tierney's book were investigated by the Medical Team of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and found to be false.Report of the Medical Team of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on Accusations Contained in Patrick Tierney's Darkness in El Dorado, University of Michigan website
Since the controversy  over Darkness in El Dorado, Tierney has kept a low profile. He has  rarely appeared in public to defend his work.[tpl]cite news|title=Rebuttal of Decade-Old Accusations Against Researchers Roils Anthropology Meeting Anew|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Rebuttal-of-Decade-Old/49320/|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=December 3, 2009|author=David Glenn|author2=Thomas Bartlett[/tpl]
