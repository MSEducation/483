Simone Lia  is an English cartoonist and author. 
She has created a number of children's books including Billy Bean's Dream, Follow the Line and Little Giant; and comics such as Golden Lions and Monkey and Spoon.
Her graphic novel Fluffy appeared in four self-published parts before being collected in one volume by Jonathan Cape in 2007.
Fluffy is a baby rabbit who is being looked after by an anxious, single man called Michael Pulcino. Michael tries to make it clear to Fluffy that he is not his daddy, but Fluffy appears to be in denial. 
She is also noted for her work with Tom Gauld, whom she met at the Royal College of Art. Together they self-published the comics First and Second, under their Cabanon Press. The two volumes were then published together by Bloomsbury Publishing in 2003, as Both.
She has drawn Sausage and Carrots for The DFC and Lucie for  The Phoenix.
