James Clayton "Jim" Dobson, Jr. (born April 21, 1936) is an American evangelical Christian author, psychologist, and founder in 1977 of Focus on the Family (FOTF), which he led until 2003. In the 1980s he was ranked as one of the most influential spokesmen for conservative social positions in American public life.[tpl]cite book| last = Detwiler| first = Fritz| title = Standing on the Premises of God The Christian Right's Fight to Redefine America's Public Schools| url = http://books.google.com/?id=mdWLvULyG2YC&pg=PA68| year = 1999| publisher = NYU Press| isbn = 978-0-8147-1914-5| page = 68 [/tpl] Although never an ordained minister, he was called "the nation's most influential evangelical leader" by Time while Slate portrayed him as a successor to evangelical leaders Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/februaryweb-only/12.0c.html|title=Who's Driving This Thing?| last=Olsen |first=Ted |date=2005-02-21 |accessdate=2008-09-05 |publisher=Christianity Today[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://slate.msn.com/id/2109621/|title=James Dobson: The Religious Right's New Kingmaker.|publisher=Slate.com|date=2004-11-12|first=Michael|last=Crowley|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl]
He is no longer affiliated with Focus on the Family. Dobson founded Family Talk as a non-profit organization in 2010 and launched a new radio broadcast, "Family Talk with Dr. James Dobson", that began on May 3, 2010 on over 300 stations nationwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ambassadoradvertising.com/media-center/family-talk-dr-james-dobson/news/family-talk-largest-launch-christian-radio-history/ |title="Family Talk" Is Largest Launch In Christian Radio History - Media Center - Ambassador Advertising Agency - We Connect Ministry and Media |publisher=Ambassadoradvertising.com |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-02-26-dobson-focus-family_N.htm |title=James Dobson delivers final broadcast for Focus on Family |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl] As part of his former role in the organization, he produced Focus on the Family, a daily radio program which according to the organization was broadcast in more than a dozen languages and on over 7,000 stations worldwide, and reportedly heard daily by more than 220 million people in 164 countries.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/press/focusvoices/A000000025.cfm| publisher=Focus on the Family| title=Press Biographies > Dr. James Dobson| accessdate=2007-05-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070329151712/http://www.focusonthefamily.com/press/focusvoices/A000000025.cfm  |archivedate = 2007-03-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=4257| publisher=People For the American Way| title=Focus on the Family|year=2006| accessdate=2006-10-10[/tpl] Focus on the Family was also carried by about sixty U.S. television stations daily.

==Background==

Dobson was born to Myrtle Georgia (née Dillingham) and James C. Dobson, Sr. in Shreveport, Louisiana.http://www.sanbenitohistory.com/projects/Famous_San_Benitians_8th/Dobson.html From his earliest childhood, religion played a central part in his life. He once told a reporter that he learned to pray before he learned to talk, and says he gave his life to Jesus at the age of three, in response to an altar call by his father.[tpl]cite book| last = Apostolidis| first = Paul| title = Stations of the Cross Adorno and Christian Right Radio| date = May 2000| publisher = Duke University Press| isbn = 0-8223-2541-1| page = 22 [/tpl] He is the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Church of the Nazarene ministers,[tpl]cite news|first=Michael|last=Gerson|title=A Righteous Indignation|publisher=US News & World Report|date=1998-05-04[/tpl] reprinted at SkepticTank.org although he does not speak for the denomination in any capacity.
His father, James Dobson Sr. (1911–1977), never went to college. He was a traveling evangelist, chiefly in the southwest. The parents took their young son along to watch his father preach. Like most Nazarenes, they forbade dancing and going to movies. Young "Jimmie Lee" (as he was called) concentrated on his studies.
Dobson studied academic psychology, which most evangelical Christians in the 1950s and 1960s did not look upon favorably. He came to believe that he was being called to become a Christian counselor or perhaps a Christian psychologist. He attended Pasadena College (now Point Loma Nazarene University) as an undergraduate and served as captain of the school's tennis team.[ref][tpl]cite web|title=Love to Serve News|url= http://www.tennisministry.org/LTS/lts-091500.html|publisher=TennisMinistry.org |year=2000|accessdate=December 6, 2010[/tpl]

For a time, Dobson worked as an assistant to Paul Popenoe at the Institute of Family Relations, a marriage-counseling center, in Los Angeles.

Dobson arguably first became well-known with the publication of Dare to Discipline (1970), which encouraged parents to use corporal punishment in disciplining their children.[ref][tpl]cite web|title=The Wizard of Colorado Springs |last=Balmer |first=Randall |url=http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&issue=soj0708&article=070833a|date=August 2007|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Sojourners Magazine[/tpl] "his breakthrough book, Dare to Discipline, ... challenged the permissive child-rearing techniques of Benjamin Spock. The book, published in 1970, encouraged parents to spank their children with belts or switches and to leave such items on the child's dresser to remind her of the consequences of challenging authority"
[/ref] Dobson's social and political opinions are widely read among many evangelical church congregations in the United States.[ref][tpl]Cite journal|last=Gibbon|first=Jeani Hunt|title=Listening to Dr. Dobson|publisher=Tikkun|volume=20|issue=5|page=11|date=Sep–October 2005|postscript=[/tpl] "Dobson is one of the single most important religious intellectuals and political leaders in America today, and many people take his words very seriously. When Dobson makes such a statement, it is the Evangelical equivalent of a Vatican Decree that is meant to communicate a policy position not only to church goers, but to social conservatives as a whole-specifically, the Republican Party."
[/ref] 
Dobson publishes monthly bulletins, also called Focus on the Family, which are dispensed as inserts in some Sunday church-service bulletins.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Steven V.|title=The Heavy Hitter|publisher=US News & World Report|date=1995-04-25|volume=118|issue=16|page=34|postscript=[/tpl] "Like a religious version of Walt Disney, Dobson started with a small idea and built it into a multimedia empire: 10 radio shows, 11 magazines (including specialty publications for doctors, teachers and single parents), bestselling books, film strips and videos of all kinds. Then there are the basketball camps and the curriculum guides, the church bulletin fillers and suggested sermon topics, faxed weekly to thousands of pastors."
Dobson interviewed serial killer Ted Bundy on-camera the day before Bundy's execution on January 24, 1989. The interview became controversial because Bundy was given an opportunity to attempt to explain his actions (the rape and murder of 30 young women). Bundy claimed in the interview (in a reversal of his previous stance) that violent pornography played a significant role in molding and crystallizing his fantasies. In May 1989, during an interview with John Tanner, a Republican Florida prosecutor, Dobson called for Bundy to be forgiven. The Bundy tapes gave Focus on the Family revenues of over $1 million, $600,000 of which it donated to anti-pornography groups and to anti-abortion groups.[ref][tpl]Cite news| last = Aynesworth| first = Hugh| title = Bundy lore lives decade after killer was put to death| publisher = The Washington Times| date = January 24, 1999 | accessdate = November 3, 2010[/tpl]

Dobson stepped down as President and CEO of Focus on the Family in 2003, and resigned from the position of chairman of the board in February 2009. Dobson explained his departure as a result of "significant philosophical differences" with successor Jim Daly.
In 2010 Dobson founded Family Talk,
a non-profit organization that produces his radio program, “Dr. James Dobson’s Family Talk”.
Dobson frequently appears as a guest on the Fox News Channel.

==Personal life==

Dobson married his wife, Shirley, on August 26, 1960; they have two children, Danae and Ryan. Ryan Dobson (born in California in 1970), who graduated from Biola University in La Mirada, California, is a public speaker, specializing on issues relating to youth and the pro-life movement. He was adopted by the Dobsons and is an ardent supporter of adoption, especially adoption of troubled children.

===Degrees, positions, and awards===

Dobson attended Point Loma Nazarene University, where he was team captain of the tennis team, most valuable player in 1956 and 1958, and later returned to coach in 1968-1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pointloma.edu/Athletics/MensTennis/Archives/Year_Coach_Record_MVP.htm|title=Year/Coach/Record/MVP|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] Dobson earned a doctorate in child development from the University of Southern California in 1967. He was an Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Southern California School of Medicine for 14 years. He spent 17 years on the staff of the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles in the Division of Child Development and Medical Genetics. Dobson is a licensed psychologist in the State of California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.dca.ca.gov/pls/wllpub/WLLQRYNA$LCEV2.QueryView?P_LICENSE_NUMBER=3203&P_LTE_ID=725 |title=Psychologist license|work=State of California|accessdate=2011-05-24[/tpl]
At the invitation of Presidents and Attorneys General, Dobson has also served on government advisory panels and testified at several government hearings. He has been given the "Layman of the Year" award by the National Association of Evangelicals in 1982, "The Children's Friend" honor by Childhelp USA (an advocate agency against child abuse) in 1987, and the Humanitarian Award by the California Psychological Association in 1988.

==Social views==

===Views on marriage===

James Dobson is a strong proponent of traditional marriage, which he defines as "one where husband and wife are lawfully married, are committed to each other for life," and have a homemaker mother and breadwinner father.James C. Dobson and Gary L. Bauer, Children at Risk (1994) p. 119, 122 According to his view, women are not deemed inferior to men because both are created in God's image, but each gender has biblically-mandated roles.[tpl]cite web|last=Dobson|first=James|title=Why Boys Are So Different|work=FocusonYourChild.com|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2001|url=http://www.focusonyourchild.com/develop/art1/A0000716.html|accessdate =2007-09-07[/tpl] He recommends that married women with children under the age of 18 focus on mothering, rather than work outside the home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://family.custhelp.com./cgi-bin/family.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=974|title=Is it important for mothers to stay home during the teen years?|publisher=Focus on the Family|first=James|last=Dobson|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl]
In the 2004 book Marriage Under Fire, Dobson suggests that heterosexual marriage rates in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have been falling, and that this is due to the recognition of same-sex relationships by those countries during the 1990s. He remarks that the "institution of marriage in those countries is rapidly dying" as a result, with most young people cohabiting or choosing to remain single (living alone) and illegitimacy rates rising in some Norwegian counties up to 80%.Why We Must Win This Battle
Dobson writes that "every civilization in the world" has been built upon marriage.Dobson, James C. Marriage under fire: why we must win this war. Sisters, Or. : Multnomah Publishers, 2004. quoted in McManus, Mike and Harriet McManus. Living together: myths, risks, and answers. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008. He also believes that homosexuality is neither a choice nor genetic, but is caused by external factors during early childhood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/22/lkl.01.html|title=Interview With Dr. James Dobson|first=Larry|last=King|publisher=CNN|date=2006-11-22|accessdate=2010-11-13[/tpl] He anecdotally cites as evidence the life of actress Anne Heche,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8234503/|title=‘Healed’ by God: Evangelical group sponsors conference on nature of gays|first=Alex|last=Johnson|publisher=MSNBC|date=2005-06-23|accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl] who was previously in a relationship with Ellen deGeneres. Criticizing "the realities of judicial tyranny," Dobson has written that "there is no issue today that is more significant to our culture than the defense of the family. Not even the war on terror eclipses it."
Critics have stated that Dobson's views on homosexuality do not represent the mainstream views of the mental health community, with Dan Gilgoff noting the positions of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association on homosexuality.[tpl]cite book| last = Gilgoff| first = Dan| title = The Jesus Machine How James Dobson, Focus on the Family, and Evangelical America Are Winning the Culture War| url = http://books.google.com/?id=MdeHmAEACAAJ| year = 2008| publisher = Macmillan Publishers| isbn = 9780312378448| pages = 56 [/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Dudley| first = Jonathan| title = Broken Words The Misfortunes of Science and Scripture in Evangelical Politics| url = http://books.google.com/?id=UHIWXheyNuEC| year = 2011| publisher = Random House| isbn = 9780385525268| pages = 69 [/tpl]

===Views on schooling===

Focus on the Family supports private school vouchers and tax credits for religious schools. According to Focus on the Family website, Dobson believes that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's education, and encourages parents to visit their children's schools to ask questions and to join the PTA so that they may voice their opinions.[tpl]cite web|title=What can parents do to improve public schools?|publisher=Focus on the Family|url=http://family.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/family.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=796|accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl] Dobson opposes sex education curricula that are not abstinence-only. According to People for the American Way, Focus on the Family material has been used to challenge a book or curriculum taught in public schools. Critics, such as People for the American Way, allege that Focus on the Family encourages Christian teachers to establish prayer groups in public schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060814/zirin|title=You Can Keep the Faith|first=Dave|last=Zirin| date=2006-07-28|publisher=The Nation| accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl] Dobson supports student-led prayer in public schools, and believes that allowing student-led Christian prayer in schools does not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.[tpl]cite news|last=Stammer|first=Larry B.|coauthor=Richard Lee Colvin|title=Foes Target Amendment on Prayer in Schools; Beliefs: Citing Federal Guidelines, Activists and Some Religious Leaders say a Change in Constitution is Unneeded|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1995-08-31|page=3[/tpl] "We do not support teacher-led, state-mediated school prayer, but we do believe that students have the same religious rights as other people," said Alan Crippen of "Focus on the Family," a major evangelical Christian broadcast and publications ministry founded by psychologist James Dobson.

===Views on discipline within the family===

In his book Dare to Discipline, Dobson advocated the spanking of children up to eight years old when they misbehave, but warns that "corporal punishment should not be a frequent occurrence" and that "discipline must not be harsh and destructive to the child's spirit." He warns against "harsh spanking" because "It is not necessary to beat the child into submission; a little bit of pain goes a long way for a young child. However, the spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the child to cry genuinely."*[tpl]cite book| last = Dobson| first = James C.| title = Dare to Discipline| date = February 1977| publisher = Bantam| isbn = 0-553-22841-2| page = 7 [/tpl]
Dobson has called disciplining children to be a necessary but unpleasant part of raising children that should only be carried out by qualified parents:
[tpl]quote|Anyone who has ever abused a child — or has ever felt himself losing control during a spanking — should not expose the child to that tragedy. Anyone who has a violent temper that at times becomes unmanageable should not use that approach. Anyone who secretly 'enjoys' the administration of corporal punishment should not be the one to implement it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uexpress.com/focusonthefamily/?uc_full_date=20041121|title=Good-Natured Child Needs His Share of Parents' Attention|first=James|last=Dobson|date=2004-11-21|publisher=Focus on the Family|accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl][/tpl]
In his book The Strong-Willed Child, Dobson suggests that if authority is portrayed correctly to a child, the child will understand how to interact with other authority figures:
[tpl]quote|By learning to yield to the loving authority... of his parents, a child learns to submit to other forms of authority which will confront him later in his life — his teachers, school principal, police, neighbors and employers.[tpl]cite book| last = Dobson| first = James C.| title = The Strong-Willed Child| date = September 1992| publisher = Living Books| isbn = 0-8423-2335-X| page = 235 [/tpl][/tpl]
In Dobson's opinion, parents must uphold their authority and do so consistently: "When you are defiantly challenged, win decisively." In The Strong-Willed Child, Dobson draws an analogy between the defiance of a family pet and that of a small child, and concludes that "just as surely as a dog will occasionally challenge the authority of his leaders, so will a little child — only more so." (emphasis in original)
When asked "How long do you think a child should be allowed to cry after being punished? Is there a limit?" Dobson responded:
[tpl]quote|Yes, I believe there should be a limit. As long as the tears represent a genuine release of emotion, they should be permitted to fall. But crying quickly changes from inner sobbing to an expression of protest... Real crying usually lasts two minutes or less but may continue for five. After that point, the child is merely complaining, and the change can be recognized in the tone and intensity of his voice. I would require him to stop the protest crying, usually by offering him a little more of whatever caused the original tears. In younger children, crying can easily be stopped by getting them interested in something else."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.troubledwith.com/stellent/groups/public/%5C@fotf_troubledwith/documents/articles/twi_012701.cfm?channel=Parenting%20Children&topic=Discipline&sssct=Questions%20and%20Answers|title=Discipline problems|accessdate=2008-05-04[/tpl][/tpl]
Sociologists John Bartkowski and Christopher Ellison have stated that Dobson's views "diverge sharply from those recommended by contemporary mainstream experts" and are not based on any sort of empirical testing, but rather are nothing more than expressions of his religious doctrines of "biblical literalism and 'authority-mindedness.'"[ref]

===Views on tolerance and diversity===

In the winter of 2004-2005, the We Are Family Foundation sent American elementary schools approximately 60,000 copies of a free DVD using popular cartoon characters (most notably SpongeBob SquarePants) to "promote tolerance and diversity."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4190699.stm|title=US right attacks SpongeBob video|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-01-20|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] Dobson contended that "tolerance" and "diversity" are "buzzwords" that the We Are Family Foundation misused as part of a "hidden agenda" to promote homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tolerance.org/teach/current/event.jsp?p=0&ar=625|title='We Are Family' DVD Still Available|date=2005-09-06|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] Kate Zernik noted Dobson asserting: "tolerance and its first cousin, diversity, 'are almost always buzzwords for homosexual advocacy.'"[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE1DE153BF933A05752C0A9639C8B63|title=Buzzwords; Hello, Synergy, Begone, Crisis|date=2005-01-30|last=Zernike|first=Kate|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] He stated on the Focus on the Family website that "childhood symbols are apparently being hijacked to promote an agenda that involves teaching homosexual propaganda to children."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=131|title=Religious Right Attacks Tolerance Pledge|date=March 2005|accessdate=2008-06-20|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] He offered as evidence the association of many leading LGBT rights organizations, including GLAAD, GLSEN, HRC, and PFLAG, with the We Are Family Foundation as shown by links which he claims once existed on their website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20050128/20875_Dobson_Clarifies_Pro-Gay_SpongeBob_Video_Controversy.htm|title=Dobson Clarifies Pro-Gay SpongeBob Video Controversy|date=2005-01-28|last=Chang|first=Pauline J.|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl]

In September 2005, Tolerance.org published a follow-up message advertising the DVD's continued availability, including We Are Family Foundation president Nancy Hunt's speculation that many of the DVDs may be "still sitting in boxes, unused, because of Dobson's vitriolic attack."

===Views on homosexuality===

Dobson believes that God defines marriage as between one man and one woman only and describes this as the central stabilizing institution of society. Dobson believes that any sexual activity outside of such a union — including homosexuality — cannot be approved by God. In Dobson's view, homosexuality is a choice that is made through influences in a child's environment rather than an inborn trait. He states that homosexual behavior, specifically "unwanted same-sex attraction", has been and can be "overcome" through understanding developmental models for homosexuality and choosing to heal the complex developmental issues which led to same-sex attraction.[tpl]cite news|first=David|last=Schmader|title=Jesus Hates You; Christians Rationalize Bigotry at "Love Won Out"|publisher=The Stranger|date=2005-06-30|volume=14|issue=42|page=16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lovewonout.com/questions/|title=Love Won Out FAQ[/tpl]
Focus on the Family ministry sponsors the monthly conference Love Won Out, where participants hear "powerful stories of ex-gay men and women." Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) has protested against the conference in Orlando, questioning both its methodology and supposed success.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truthwinsout.org/pressreleases/orlando-sentinel-gay-activists-to-protest-orlando-event-notion-that-homosexuality-is-curable/|title=Orlando Sentinel: Gay activists to protest Orlando event, notion that homosexuality is ‘curable’|date=2008-06-06|accessdate=2008-09-05|publisher=Truthwinsout.org[/tpl] In regards to the conference, Dobson has stated that "Gay activists come with preconceived notions about who we are and what we believe and about the hate that boils from within, which is simply not true. Regardless of what the media might say, Focus on the Family has no interest in promoting hatred toward homosexuals or anyone else. We also don't wish to deprive them of their basic constitutional rights... The Constitution applies to all of us." Dobson strongly opposes the movement to legitimize same-sex relationships. In his book Bringing Up Boys, Dobson states that "The second thing we know is that the disorder is not typically "chosen." Homosexuals deeply resent being told that they selected this same-sex inclination in pursuit of sexual excitement or some other motive.

Sociologist Judith Stacey criticized Dobson for claiming that sociological studies show that gay couples do not make good parents. She stated that Dobson's claim "is a direct misrepresentation of my research."[tpl]Cite news | last = Paulson | first = Steven K. | title = Gay rights group: Dobson manipulated research | newspaper = Boston Globe |date=2006-07-17 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/07/17/gay_rights_group_dobson_manipulated_data/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+News | postscript = [/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl] In response to Dobson's claim that "there have been more than ten thousand studies that have showed that children do best when they are raised with a mother and a father who are committed to each other," Stacey replied that "all of those studies that Dobson is referring to are studies that did not include gay or lesbian parents as part of the research base."YouTube - Dr. Judith Stacey on James Dobson's Distortions
Dobson objected to a bill expanding the prohibition of sexual orientation-based discrimination in the areas of "public accommodation, housing practices, family planning services and twenty other areas." He said that, were such a bill passed, public businesses could no longer separate locker rooms and bathrooms by gender, which he claimed would lead to a situation where, "every woman and little girl will have to fear that a predator, bisexual, cross-dresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_9420864|title=Anti-bias measure inked: Governor signs bill covering sexual orientation, religious beliefs|last=Ingold|first=John|publisher=The Denver Post|date=2008-05-30|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coloradoconnection.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=137923 |title=Controversial ad offends transgendered community : News |publisher=ColoradoConnection.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-10-16[/tpl]

==Political and social influence==

Although Dobson initially remained somewhat distant from Washington politics, in 1981 he founded the Family Research Council as a political arm through which "social conservative causes" could achieve greater political influence.[tpl]cite news|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|title=The 2004 Campaign: Evangelical Christians—Warily, a Religious Leader Lifts His Voice in Politics|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EED9113CF930A25756C0A9629C8B63|publisher=The New York Times|date=2004-05-13|page=A22[/tpl] In 1996, he cast a vote for U.S. Taxpayers' Party Presidential candidate Howard Phillips.Phillips, Howard (2004-11-08) Constitutionally Correct Peroutka, The American Conservative
In late 2004, Dobson led a campaign to block the appointment of Arlen Specter to head of the Senate Judiciary Committee because of Specter's pro-choice stance on abortion.[tpl]cite news|title=Conservative leader targets Specter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/specter.judiciary/index.html|date=2004-11-09|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080417183706/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/11/07/specter.judiciary/index.html |archivedate = April 17, 2008[/tpl] Responding to a question by Fox News personality Alan Colmes on whether he wanted the Republican Party to be known as a "big-tent party," he replied, "I don't want to be in the big tent...

A May 2005 article by Hedges in Harper's Magazine described Dobson as "perhaps the most powerful figure in the Dominionist movement" and "a crucial player in getting out the Christian vote for George W. Bush."[tpl]cite web|publisher=Harper's Magazine|date=May 2005|first=Chris|last=Hedges|url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2005/05/0080541|title=Feeling the hate with the National Religious Broadcasters[/tpl](subscription required, reprinted here.) Discernment Ministries, a site that describes dominionism as a heresy, characterized Dobson as belonging to the "Patriotic American" brand of dominionism, calling him "One of its most powerful leaders."[tpl]cite web|publisher=Discernment Ministries|url=http://www.discernment-ministries.org/ChristianImperialism.htm|title=Dominionism and the Rise of Christian Imperialism|first=Sarah|last=Leslie|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl]
In November 2004, Dobson was described by the online magazine Slate as "America's most influential evangelical leader." The article explained "Forget Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes... Dobson is now America's most influential evangelical leader, with a following reportedly greater than that of either Falwell or Robertson at his peak... Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in Ohio and Florida." Further, "He's already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the White House, Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush 'needs to be more aggressive' about pressing the religious right's pro-life, anti-gay rights agenda, or it would 'pay a price in four years.'... Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues: "Does the Republican Party want our votes, no string attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me, I'll call you' — and not to care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that what they want? Is that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be? If it is, I'm gone, and if I go, I will do everything I can to take as many people with me as possible."
However, in 2006, Dobson said that, while "there is disillusionment out there with Republicans" and "that worries me greatly," he nonetheless suggested voters turn out and vote Republican in 2006. "My first inclination was to sit this one out," but according to The New York Times, Dobson then added that "he had changed his mind when he looked at who would become the leaders of Congressional committees if the Democrats took over."
Dobson garnered national media attention once again in February 2008 after releasing a statement in the wake of Senator John McCain's expected success in the so-called "Super Tuesday" Republican primary elections. In his statement, Dobson said: "I cannot, and will not, vote for Senator John McCain, as a matter of conscience," and indicated that he would refrain from voting altogether if McCain were to become the Republican candidate, echoing other conservative commentators' concerns about the Senator's conservatism.[tpl]cite news|last=Stoddard|first=Ed|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/02/05/dobson-delivers-blow-to-mccain-candidacy/|publisher=Reuters| title=Super Tuesday: Dobson delivers blow to McCain candidacy|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] He endorsed Mike Huckabee for president. After McCain selected a pro-life candidate, Sarah Palin, as his running mate, Dobson said that he was more enthusiastic in his support for the Republican ticket.[tpl]cite news|last=MacAskill|first=Ewen|coauthor=Ed Pilkington|title=US politics: McCain defends running mate's experience|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/01/johnmccain.palin|date=2008-09-01|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=The Guardian | location=London[/tpl] When Palin's 17-year old daughter's pregnancy was revealed, Dobson issued a press release commending Palin's stance, saying,
[tpl]quote|We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through, even though there will of course be challenges along the way. That is what the Palins are doing, and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances."[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/dobson-on-brist.html|title=Dobson on Bristol Palin's Pregnancy|last=Tapper|first=Jake|date=2008-09-01|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=ABC News[/tpl][/tpl]

Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design. 2004, page 270 In 2007, Dobson was one of 25 evangelicals who called for the ouster of Rev.

At a National Day of Prayer event in the U.S. Capitol, Dobson called Barack Obama "the abortion president." He said, "President Obama, before he was elected, made it very clear that he wanted to be the abortion president. He didn’t make any bones about it. This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he has done that, and in a sense he is the abortion president." Among others, Rep. Janice Hahn complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, "Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer. It was very disturbing to me...and really a shame. James Dobson hijacked the National Day of Prayer — this nonpartisan, nonpolitical National Day of Prayer — to promote his own distorted political agenda."Ashtari, Shadee (May 1, 2014) Hahn Walks Out Of Event After James Dobson Calls Obama The 'Abortion President'."

==Ecumenical relations==

Dobson and Charles Colson were two participants in a 2000 conference at the Vatican on the global economy's impact on families. During the conference, the two Protestants met with Pope John Paul II. Dobson later told Catholic News Service that though he has theological differences with Roman Catholicism, "when it comes to the family, there is far more agreement than disagreement, and with regard to moral issues from abortion to premarital sex, safe-sex ideology and homosexuality, I find more in common with Catholics than with some of my evangelical brothers and sisters."Weblog: James Dobson Charles Colson Head to Vatican Meet with Pope
In November 2009, Dobson signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox Christians not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience
