The University of Hildesheim (in German Universität Hildesheim) was founded in 1978. 

==Description==

The main faculties are educational and social sciences, cultural sciences and aesthetic communications, and information and communication sciences. 
With around 5000 students currently enrolled, the university is relatively small. In an unusual move for a German university, the university became a foundation (German: Stiftungsuniversität) under public law on January 1, 2003.
