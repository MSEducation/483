AXIS dancers who are not disabled come with extensive training in a variety of contemporary dance, improvisation and other movement practices. Through interactions between these dancers and nondisabled dancers, a new dance vocabulary began to be developed. This started a trend, which eventually became known as physically integrated dance, which seeks to broaden the definition of ‘dance’ and ‘dancer’  and increase opportunities for artistic expression through movement for a wide spectrum of physical attributes and disabilities.[tpl]cite book |title=Moving Over the Edge: Artists with Disabilities Take the Leap |last=Pamela Kay |first=Walker |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Horton Media |location=Davis, California |pages=112–117 |isbn=0-9771505-2-6 [/tpl]Interview, Judith Smith, “Artistic Director, AXIS Dance Company” conducted by Esther Ehrlich in 2005, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2006.
