CATEGORIES: CBC Radio One programs

Rewind is a Canadian radio program broadcast by CBC Radio One.
Hosted by Michael Enright, the series presents archived recordings of CBC Radio's history.
This program should not be confused with the American public radio series of the same name, which is produced by KUOW in Seattle and is a humorous recap at the past week's headlines.
