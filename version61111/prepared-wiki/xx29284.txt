Manhattan is a 1979 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Woody Allen from his screenplay co-written with Marshall Brickman and produced by Charles H. Joffe.  Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer dating a 17-year-old girl (Mariel Hemingway) before eventually falling in love with his best friend's (Michael Murphy) mistress (Diane Keaton).  Meryl Streep and Anne Byrne also star in the film.
Manhattan was filmed in black-and-white and 2.35:1 widescreen.  The decision to shoot in black and white was to give New York City a "great look".  The film also features music composed by George Gershwin, including his arguably most famous piece, Rhapsody in Blue, which inspired the idea behind the film.  Allen described the film as a combination of his previous two films, Annie Hall and Interiors.
The film was met with widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress for Hemingway and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Allen and Brickman.  Its North American box office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box office hit (after adjusting for inflation). Often considered Allen's best film,Woody Allen – Biography by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in The New York TimesArticle in New York by Bilge Ebiri on AFI Top 100 it ranks 46th on AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list and number 63 on Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies."  In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

The film opens with a montage of images of Manhattan accompanied by George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.  Isaac Davis (Woody Allen) is introduced as a man writing a book about his love for New York City.  He is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer dealing with the women in his life who quits his unfulfilling job.  He is dating Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a 17-year-old girl attending the Dalton School.  His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack (Michael Murphy), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie (Diane Keaton).  Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah (Wallace Shawn), also appears.  Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis (Meryl Streep) is writing a confessional book about their marriage.  Jill has also since come out of the closet and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).
When Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way.  Isaac runs into her again at an Equal Rights Amendment fund-raising event at the Museum of Modern Art hosted by Bella Abzug (who is played by herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home.  They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the Queensboro Bridge.  In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting.  In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through Central Park.
After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out.  Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him.  Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment.  Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend, and after several meetings between the two couples, including one where Emily reads out portions of Jill's new book about her marriage with Isaac, Yale leaves Emily to resume his relationship with Mary.  A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first.  Isaac responds by discussing Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily, but Yale told her that Isaac introduced Mary to him.  In the denouement, Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make "life worth living". When he finds himself saying "Tracy's face", he sets down the microphone.
He leaves his apartment and sets out on foot for Tracy's.  He arrives at the lobby of her family's apartment just as she is leaving for London.  He says that she does not have to go and that he does not want "that thing about her that he likes" to change.  She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that "not everybody gets corrupted" before saying that he's "got to have a little faith in people."  He gives her a slight smile segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of Rhapsody in Blue playing again.  An instrumental version of "Embraceable You" plays over the credits.

===Development===

According to Allen, the idea for Manhattan originated from his love of George Gershwin's music.  He was listening to one of the composer's albums of overtures and thought, "this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie".[tpl]harvnb|Fox|1996|p=[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  Allen has said that Manhattan was "like a mixture of what I was trying to do with Annie Hall and Interiors".[tpl]harvnb|Brode|1987|p=[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  He also said that his film deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essentially junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of his "possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances", adding that he has "rationalized his way out of it so far, but he could conceive of doing it".[tpl]cite news | last = Rich | first = Frank | title = An Interview with Woody |work=Time| date = April 30, 1979[/tpl]
According to actress Stacey Nelkin, Manhattan was based on her romantic relationship with Woody Allen.  Her bit part in Annie Hall ended up on the cutting room floor, and their relationship started when she was 17 years old and a student at New York’s Stuyvesant High School.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&d=1302062400|title=Stacey Nelkin: Actress, Sexpert – The Howard Stern Show for April 7, 2011|date=April 7, 2011[/tpl]  (Allen did not publicly acknowledge the relationship until 2014.)[tpl]cite news|last=Allen|first=Woody|title=Woody Allen Speaks Out|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html?hp&rref=opinion&_r=0|accessdate=Feb 13, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=Feb 7, 2014[/tpl]

===Filming===

Allen talked to cinematographer Gordon Willis about how fun it would be to shoot the film in black and white, Panavision aspect ratio (2.35:1) because it would give "a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film".[tpl]harvnb|Bjorkman |1993|p=108[/tpl]  Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white because that's how he remembers it from when he was small.  "Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York."  He always heard Gershwin music with it, too.  In Manhattan he really thinks that he and cinematographer Gordon Willis – succeeded in showing the city. "When seeing it there on that big screen, it's really decadent".[tpl]harvnb|Palmer|1980|p=112[/tpl]  The picture was shot on location with the exception of some of the scenes in the planetarium which were filmed on a set.[tpl]harvnb|Bjorkman |1993|p=112[/tpl]
The famous bridge shot was done at five in the morning.[tpl]cite news|last=Willis|first=Gordon|title=Made in Manhattan|work=Moviemaker|pages=|publisher=|date=April 6, 2004|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/made_in_manhattan_2930/|accessdate=February 13, 2009[/tpl] The production had to bring their own bench, because there were no park benches at the location.[tpl]cite video|people=Weide, Robert B. (Director)|year=2011|title=Woody Allen: A Documentary|medium=Television|publisher=PBS[/tpl] The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and that he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterwards, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take.
After finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it.  He offered to make a film for free instead.[tpl]harvnb|Bjorkman |1993|p=126[/tpl]  He later said, "I just thought to myself, 'At this point in my life, if this is the best I can do, they shouldn't give me money to make movies'".

===Music===

All titles of the soundtrack were compositions by George Gershwin. They were performed by the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the Buffalo Philharmonic under Michael Tilson Thomas.
A part of the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 is heard in a concert scene.

===Critical response===

The film received largely positive reviews and currently holds a rating of 98% "Certified Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes.[tpl]cite news |title=Manhattan |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | date =May 2, 1979 |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/manhattan/|accessdate=May 27, 2009[/tpl]  Gary Arnold, in The Washington Post, wrote, "Manhattan has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes at the expense of his own parochialism.  There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sellouts decorating the Hollywood landscape.  The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness".[tpl]cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | title = Woody Allen's Comic High: A Delightful and Deluxe Rhapsody of Wry Romance |work=The Washington Post |date =May 2, 1979[/tpl]  In his review for Newsweek magazine, Jack Kroll wrote, "Allen's growth in every department is lovely to behold.  He gets excellent performances from his cast.  The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen's yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental – a balance also expressed in his best screen play sic yet".[tpl]cite news | last = Kroll | first = Jack | title = Woody's Big Apple |work=Newsweek | date =April 30, 1979[/tpl]  In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote, "Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual.  And Mariel Hemingway deserves some kind of special award for what's in some ways the most difficult role in the film".[tpl]cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title= Manhattan |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=January 1, 1979 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19790101/REVIEWS/901010322/1023|accessdate=January 11, 2008[/tpl] Ebert includes the film in his list of great movies.[tpl]cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=March 18, 2001 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |work=Sun-Times[/tpl]
Alexander Walker of the London Evening Standard wrote, "So precisely nuanced is the speech, so subtle the behaviour of a group of friends, lovers, mistresses and cuckolds who keep splitting up and pairing off like unstable molecules".[tpl]harvnb|Palmer|1980|p=114[/tpl]  Time film critic Frank Rich wrote at the time that Allen's film is "tightly constructed, clearly focused intellectually, it is a prismatic portrait of a time and place that may be studied decades hence to see what kind of people we were".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]  Recently, J. Hoberman wrote in The Village Voice, "The New York City that Woody so tediously defended in Annie Hall was in crisis.  And so he imagined an improved version.  More than that, he cast this shining city in the form of those movies that he might have seen as a child in Coney Island—freeing the visions that he sensed to be locked up in the silver screen".[tpl]cite news | last = Hoberman | first = J | title = Defending Manhattan |work=The Village Voice|date=July 10, 2007 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0728,hoberman,77195,20.html|accessdate=July 11, 2007[/tpl]

==Home release==

Allen wanted to preserve Willis's compositions and insisted that the aspect ratio be preserved when the film was released on video (an unusual request in a time when widescreen films were normally panned and scanned for TV and video release).  As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were letterboxed, originally with a gray border.
Manhattan was first released on Blu-ray on January 24, 2012 alongside Allen's 1977 film Annie Hall.[tpl]cite web|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20562561,00.html|title=Annie Hall Review|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 24, 2012|accessdate=July 19, 2012[/tpl] Both releases included the films' original theatrical trailer.
