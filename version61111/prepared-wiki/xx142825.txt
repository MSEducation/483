[[The Tour of Brotherly Love]]

CATEGORIES: 2001 concert tours, Oasis (band) concert tours, The Black Crowes concert tours

The Tour of Brotherly Love was a 2001 tour of North America featuring Oasis, The Black Crowes, and Spacehog, three rock bands featuring pairs of brothers: Noel and Liam Gallagher, Chris and Rich Robinson, Royston and Antony Langdon, respectively. The tour's title is a nod to the fact that all three pairs of brothers have been known to fight, sometimes physically, sometimes even publicly.
Originally scheduled for 21 dates across the United States and Canada, the three bands performed to capacity crowds in medium-sized arenas and concert halls, including a three-night stand at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Prior to the tour's two dates at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, The Black Crowes were inducted into the Guitar Center Rockwalk, a walk of fame honoring notable musical acts and artists. Noel Gallagher and Slash were on hand for the ceremony.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/3080.html |title=Rock Walk inducts the Black Crowes; Robinson, Gallagher talk Brotherly Love tour |accessdate=2008-04-22 |publisher=LiveDaily [/tpl]
Noel Gallagher and Gem Archer of Oasis and the Langdon brothers of Spacehog joined The Black Crowes on stage at the end of most shows on the tour, performing covers of songs by Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones. Oasis drummer Alan White missed the tour with a thumb injury and was replaced by older brother Steve White, drummer for Paul Weller.
The May 24 date in Cincinnati, Ohio, was canceled when the Riverbend Music Theater's stage, backstage and pavilion were flooded by forty-five feet of water from the rising Ohio River. The May 29 show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was canceled because of the tour re-rerouting following the Cincinnati cancellation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12031970 |title=Black Crowes-Oasis Tour Cancels Two Dates |accessdate=2008-04-22 |publisher=Yahoo Music!
