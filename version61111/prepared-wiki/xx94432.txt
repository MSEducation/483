==History==

The city of Abéché was made capital of the Wadai Sultanate in the 1890s, after the wells at Ouara, the former capital, had dried out. In 1909, French troops invaded the Kingdom and established a garrison in Abéché. France took power, forcing the sultan to renounce his throne.  At that time, Abéché was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, but major epidemics reduced the population to 6000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restored by orders of the French government, and Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king. Once one of the strongholds of the Arabic slave trade route, the city is known today for its markets, mosques, church, square (the Place de l'Indépendance) and for its sultan's palace. Abéché has several schools, a hospital, a university and is one of the major garrisons of the Armee Nationale du Tchad ANT . There is a small airport [tpl]Airport codes|AEH|FTTC[/tpl], Airport ID: AE, operated sunrise to sunset (SR-SS) with flights to N'Djaména.
On 25 November 2006, the city was taken by the Union of Forces for Democracy, a rebel group that seeks to depose president Idriss Déby. Extensive looting took place during the night. On the same day, nearby Biltine was captured by the  Rally of Democratic Forces, another rebel group. A day later, both cities were retaken by the Chadian army.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6185074.stm|title=Chad denies rebel move on capital|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-11-26[/tpl]
