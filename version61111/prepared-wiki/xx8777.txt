</ref> This number steadily increased during the century, with [[Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux]] compiling a list of 20 (including eight not previously known) in 1746. From 1751â€“53, [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] cataloged 42 nebulae from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], with most of them being previously unknown. [[Charles Messier]] then compiled a catalog of 103 "nebulae" (now called [[Messier object]]s, which included what are now known to be galaxies) by 1781; his interest was detecting [[comet]]s, and these were objects that might be mistaken for them, wasting time.<ref name="hoskin2005">

The number of nebulae was then greatly expanded by the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel. Their Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars was published in 1786. A second catalog of a thousand was published in 1789 and the third and final catalog of 510 appeared in 1802. During much of their work, William Herschel believed that these nebulae were merely unresolved clusters of stars. In 1790, however, he discovered a star surrounded by nebulosity and concluded that this was a true nebulosity, rather than a more distant cluster.
Beginning in 1864, William Huggins examined the spectra of about 70 nebulae. He found that roughly a third of them had the absorption spectra of a gas. The rest showed a continuous spectrum and thus were thought to consist of a mass of stars.[ref]
