Gold Against the Soul is the second studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 14 June 1993, through Columbia Records.

==Background==

The lyrics on Gold Against the Soul are considerably less political than their previous album Generation Terrorists, and the album is more reflective of the despair and melancholy of their later work.
"La Tristesse Durera" (literally "the sadness will go on") is the title of a biography of Vincent van Gogh, although the song is not about him, but about a war veteran.

==Critical reception==

Gold Against the Soul received mixed reviews from critics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/manic-street-preachers-mn0000954964 |title=Manic Street Preachers - Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl] Allmusic, awarding the record three and a half stars out of five, described it as a "flawed but intriguing second album", while Kerrang! and Melody Maker listed the record at #8[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/kerrang.html |title=Kerrang!

Stuart Bailie, writing for the NME, was uncertain however, calling the album "confusing" and "too much Slash and not enough burn" but did compliment its musicality, saying "the drums and guitars rumble higher in the mix, and massive, harmonising riffs are everywhere". Q Magazine's Peter Kane was more critical, describing Gold Against the Soul "superficially competent, of course, but scratch below the surface and you'll find few signs of life, just a vaguely expressed, bemused and bored dissatisfaction".[tpl]cite web |url=http://home.germany.net/100-496653/manics/articles/gats_ereviews.htm |title=Gold Against The Soul (Q Magazine) |last=Kane |first=Peter |work=home.germany.net |accessdate=4 January 2013[/tpl]
The band themselves have described the record as their least favourite album and the most unfocused period of their career. The band's vocalist and guitarist James Dean Bradfield has said, "All we wanted to do was go under the corporate wing. We thought we could ignore it but you do get affected."[tpl]cite journal |title=James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers on a Year of Hospital Horror... |magazine=Select |url=http://www.thisisyesterday.com/ints/horror.html |accessdate=1 October 2012[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Gold Against the Soul remains a controversial record among critics. Both the NME and Q have revised their opinions in some later articles, with the former's Paul Stokes opining that its short, "snappy, driven and focused" length contrasts with other albums' "indulgently lengthy tracklistings", and suggesting that "with its big, radio-friendly Dave Eringa production, it's easy to see why Gold Against The Soul caused such a stir compared to the wild, almost feral rock of Generation Terrorists that preceded it a year earlier. However, with the band's more beefed up, arena-friendly sound emerging in subsequent years, this album is no longer so at odds with the general Manics aesthetic." The latter publication, in a retrospective review of The Holy Bible, looked back on Gold Against the Soul as "an underrated pop-metal effort that's armed with a handful of bona-fide big tunes" and cited "La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)" as its highlight.[tpl]cite journal |last=Grundy |first=Gareth |date=December 2004 |title=They took a trip to the heart of darkness.

In a negative commentary, meanwhile, Joe Tangari of Pitchfork lambasted Gold Against The Soul as a "labored, sophomore-slumping hard rock turd that had them looking washed up early," concluding that "there was really no preparation for the intensity, perversion, and genuine darkness of The Holy Bible", which would follow in 1994.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5074-the-holy-bible/ |title=Manic Street Preachers: The Holy Bible |last=Tangari |first=Joe |date=17 January 2005 |work=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc. |accessdate=9 January 2012[/tpl]
