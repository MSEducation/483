The Micro-MBA is a learner-driven, outcomes-based entrepreneurial course based on classroom session followed by pro-active mentoring meetings. The programme aims to teach entrepreneurs, mostly in developing countries, fundamental business skills thus they can operate their businesses successfully. The term Micro-MBA refers to the traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) programme. There is no official definition for the term Micro-MBA. The course programme focuses on teaching theory about subjects as money management, stock control, customer handling, and marketing that can be applied in the daily business activities of the business owners.

==Objective==

The main aim of the Micro-MBA programme is to provide small business owners with basic business skills, which they can apply in their daily activities to grow and sustain their businesses. Furthermore, it is supposed to empower them to become self-employed.

==History==

The Trident Institute offered the first Micro-MBA programme in 1998 and it was aimed atÂ business owners who had limited access to further education in South Africa. The programme focuses on teaching students basic business skills in class and mentoring sessions after completing the classes at their marketplaces. The main aim of the course has been to enable small business owners to operate their businesses more successfully or to start their own business.
Since its formation 160 000 people have successfully finished the Micro-MBA course at the Trident Institute. Different surveys have shown that between 67% and 81% of former programme students are still successful with their own business or participating in the labour market 18 months after completing the course.[tpl]cite web|title=Micro-MBA Project|url=http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Micro-MBA_project|work=Wikiversity|publisher=Wikiversity|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]  
The programme has become a successful education tool in basic economic development in South Africa and has spread to other African and Asian countries. The course has been described by the London Financial Times as "Brilliantly Simple and Simply Brilliant!".[tpl]cite news|title=This course is Brilliantly Simple and Simply Brilliant!|url=http://www.micro-mba.com/|accessdate=7 August 2013|newspaper=London Financial Times|date=August 1991[/tpl] 
The founder and CEO of Trident Institute, Cedric Buffler, won the award for Outstanding Social Entrepreneur for 2007 by the Schwab Foundation.
The Micro-MBA has not only spread from South Africa to neighbouring African countries (Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria) but also to Asia and South America. Characteristic of these markets is that poor people with small businesses do not have access to supportive business theory and knowledge.

==Admission criteria==

Most organizations that offer Micro-MBA are founded or sponsored by Nonprofit Organizations. Admissions criteria vary. But mostly it is generally required that participants already have an existing business or a business idea that they want to realize after the course. No specific academic qualifications are required. The most important requirements are high motivation levels and the will to apply the learning to their businesses. Interviews are conducted before choosing applicants to guarantee that they take the opportunity serious. Most of the courses are free of charge but this depends on the programme, course design, and the organization.

==Course design and structure==

The duration of the courses varies from three weeks of classes combined with nine months of mentoring training to three months of classes with additional mentoring training. Lectures are business owners or business lecturers. Mentoring and coaching, in terms of visiting students at their marketplace, after the course, guarantee the long-term success of the programme. The course materials are simple as e.g. workbooks and calculators. 
Typical classes during the course are:
