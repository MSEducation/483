Bruin's Slave Jail is a two-story brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, United States from which slave trader Joseph Bruin imprisoned slaves.  Bruin's company, called Bruin and Hill, transported blacks to slave markets in the Southern United States.  
At the start of the American Civil War, Joseph Bruin was captured himself and imprisoned in Washington, D.C.  His property, including the slave jail, was confiscated by the U.S. Marshall and used as the Fairfax County Courthouse until 1865.
All that remains today of the entire compound is a brick, two-storey structure that housed the slaves.  Bruinâ€™s home, kitchen, and wash-house no longer remain.  The jail can be found at 1707 Duke Street in Alexandria.
