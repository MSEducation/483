Reich is gay, and came to terms with this in San Francisco during the 1970s era of rapidly advancing gay rights and liberation. He eventually became actively out during this early period of the modern LGBT rights movement and in his autobiography he details his activism and the process of coming to terms with his then long-repressed homosexuality. Decades later Reich was less active in LGBT affairs and explicitly stated that his need to live alone "trumped" sexual orientation as meaningful in his life.
