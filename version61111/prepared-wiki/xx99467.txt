A bindi ([tpl]lang-hi|बिंदी[/tpl], from Sanskrit bindu, meaning "a drop, small particle, dot"; see below for alternative designations) is a forehead decoration worn in South Asia (particularly India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Mauritius)[tpl]cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/bindis/a/bindi.htm|title=Bindi: The Great Indian Forehead Art|last=Das|first=Subhamoy|accessdate=2009-02-16[/tpl] and Southeast Asia. Traditionally it is a bright dot of red colour applied in the centre of the forehead close to the eyebrows, but it can also consist of other colours with a sign or piece of jewellery worn at this location.

==Religious significance==

Traditionally, the area between the eyebrows (where the bindi is placed) is said to be the sixth chakra, ajna, the seat of "concealed wisdom". The bindi is said to retain energy and strengthen concentration. The bindi also represents the third eye.[tpl]cite news | title = Couples Fuel India's Vibrant Art Scene | date = 13 October 2011 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/arts/14iht-rartcouples14.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&sq=bindi&st=cse&scp=1 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2011-10-20[/tpl] It is also used in festivals such as Holi.[tpl]cite news | title = Prince Charles dances in India at Holi celebration | date = 5 October 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11477436 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2011-10-20[/tpl]
According to the Jabala upanishad, Avimukta (the middle of the eyebrows) "is the abode of Brahman in all beings".url=http://www.vedarahasya.net/jabala.htm 
In modern times, the bindi is worn by women of many religious dispositions in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and is not restricted to one religion or region. However, the Islamic Research Foundation, located in India, says "wearing a bindi or mangalsutra is a sign of Hindu women. The Islamic dress code does not permit a Muslim to wear any sign, symbol or mark which is specially significant of a non-Muslim."http://www.irf.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=380%3Abindi-and-mangalsutra&catid=73%3Acommon-questions-asked-by-hindus-about-islam&Itemid=199 The traditional bindi still represents and preserves the symbolic significance that is integrated into Indian mythology in many parts of India.
Red represents honour, love and prosperity, hence it was worn traditionally by women to symbolise this.
The red bindi has multiple meanings which are all valid at the same time. It is also a spiritual symbol.

==Traditional application method==

A traditional bindi is red or maroon in colour. A pinch of vermilion powder applied skilfully with a practised fingertip makes a perfect red dot. It takes considerable practice to achieve the perfect round shape by hand. A small annular disc (perhaps a coin) aids application for beginners. First they apply a sticky wax paste through the empty centre of the disc. This is then covered with kumkum or vermilion and then the disc is removed to get a perfect round bindi. Various materials such as sandal, 'aguru', 'kasturi', 'kumkum' (made of red turmeric) and 'sindoor' (made of zinc oxide and dye) colour the dot. Saffron ground together with 'kusumba' flower can also work.[tpl]cite news | title = Bindi: The Great Indian Forehead Art | url = http://hinduism.about.com/od/bindis/a/bindi.htm | work = About.com | accessdate = 2012-01-09[/tpl]

Bindis are worn throughout South Asia, specifically India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, by women, men, girls and boys and no longer signify age, marital status, religious background or ethnic affiliation.Parvesh Handa, "Home Beauty Clinic", Pustak Mahal, ISBN 81-223-0099-5 The bindi has become a decorative item and is no longer restricted in colour or shape.Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Government of India Self-adhesive bindis (also known as sticker bindis) are available, usually made of felt or thin metal and adhesive on the other side. These are simple to apply, disposable substitutes for older tilak bindis. Sticker bindis come in many colours, designs, materials, and sizes. Some are decorated with sequins, glass beads, or rhinestones. Bindis are not worn by women in Pakistan, or typically by Indian Muslim women. However they are worn by Bangladeshi women regardless of religious affiliation.
In India there are different regional variations of the bindi. In Maharastra a large crescent shape bindi is worn with a smaller black dot underneath. In Bengal a large round red bindi is worn.
