Diane Medved Harper is a professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville.[tpl]cite web | url=http://php.louisville.edu/advancement/ocm/news/release.php?relid=2208 | title=Missouri professor named family, geriatric medicine chair at UofL | work=University of Louisville | date=26 August 2013 | accessdate=30 January 2014 | author=Scoggins, Jill[/tpl] From 2009 to 2013 she was a professor at the University of Missouri Kansas City's department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. From 1996 to 2009 she held a clinical, teaching, and research post at Dartmouth Medical School.http://www.umkcfm.org/Faculty/bioHarper.html Her area of expertise is human papillomavirus (HPV) and the diseases associated with it, as well as colposcopy, and she was the principal investigator of the clinical trials of Gardasil and Cervarix, vaccines against HPV.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcia-g-yerman/an-interview-with-dr-dian_b_405472.html | title=An Interview with Dr. Diane M. Harper, HPV Expert | work=Huffington Post | date=28 December 2009 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Yerman, Marcia[/tpl] She has since made statements raising concerns about both vaccines, and she recommends that patients be more explicitly informed of the risks associated with them. She has also stated there is no data showing that Gardasil remains effective at preventing cervical cancer beyond five years, and has written that vaccination efﬁcacy must last at least 15 years – any less duration of efﬁcacy and cervical cancers are merely postponed, not prevented.

==Early life==

Harper grew up in Kansas City; her father was an electrical and mechanical engineer. Her mother died in July 1981 of breast cancer.

==Education, research and career==

A graduate of the University of Kansas (where she completed a residency in family medicine), Harper also completed undergraduate and graduate degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering, her original choice of major, before attending Stanford University and Harvard University to receive her public health degree. Her decision to go to medical school instead of continuing to study engineering was made in 1981, when, on Thanksgiving Day, she called her dad and told him that her heart wasn't in engineering.[tpl]cite web | url=http://dartmed.dartmouth.edu/fall06/html/faculty_focus.php | title=Dream Work: Diane Harper MD MPH | work=Dartmouth Medicine | date=Fall 2006 | accessdate=13 August 2013 | author=Durgin, Jennifer[/tpl] While at Stanford, she studied medical decision making and cost-effectiveness analysis. Harper's degrees include MD, MPH, and MS.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.secondopinion-tv.org/panelist/diane-medved-harper-md-mph-ms | title=Diane Medved Harper | publisher=Second Opinion (TV series) | accessdate=13 August 2013[/tpl]
Harper has co-authored clinical trials of HPV vaccines in journals including the New England Journal of Medicine[tpl]cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa061760[/tpl] and The Lancet Oncology.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/S1470-2045(05)70101-7[/tpl]

==Questioning the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines==

Although, in 2008, she stated that Gardasil "is a good vaccine and ... is generally safe,"[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/578110 | title=HPV Vaccine Deemed Safe and Effective, Despite Reports of Adverse Events | publisher=Medscape Today | date=9 August 2008 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Chustecka, Zosia[/tpl] in recent years, mainly beginning in 2009, Harper has questioned the safety of Gardasil, and has appeared at the International Public Conference on Vaccination, a conference held by the National Vaccine Information Center, a U.S. anti-vaccine group that has consistently advocated against the use of vaccines.[tpl]cite book|last=Specter|first=Michael|title=Denialism : How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives|year=2009|publisher=PenguinPress|page=7[/tpl]  She also appeared in The Greater Good, an anti-vaccine film.[tpl]cite web|last=Gorski|first=David|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-greater-good-pure-unadulterated-anti-vaccine-propagand/ |title=The Greater Good: Pure, unadulterated anti-vaccine propaganda masquerading as a 'balanced' documentary[/tpl]
Pointing to research by Barbara Slade,[tpl]cite doi|10.1001/jama.2009.1201.[/tpl] Harper states, 
"Gardasil has been associated with at least as many serious adverse events as there are deaths from cervical cancer developing each year. Indeed, the risks of vaccination are underreported in Slade's article, as they are based on a denominator of doses distributed from Merck's warehouse. Up to a third of those doses may be in refrigerators waiting to be dispensed as the autumn onslaught of vaccine messages is sent home to parents the first day of school. Should the denominator in Dr. Slade's work be adjusted to account for this, and then divided by three for the number of women who would receive all three doses, the incidence rate of serious adverse events increases up to five fold."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/19/cbsnews_investigates/main5253431.shtml | title=Gardasil researcher speaks out | publisher=CBS News | date=29 August 2009 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Attkisson, Sharyl | authorlink=Sharyl Attkisson[/tpl]
In October 2009 Harper stated to the Guardian "I fully support the HPV vaccines," she says. "I believe that in general they are safe in most women."http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/10/ben-goldacre-cervical-cancer-jab?guni=Article:in%20body%20link
In the December 2009 issue of Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Harper published an opinion piece regarding the potential risks of both Gardasil and Cervarix, and concluded that, given the various limitations and risks of the vaccines, the beneﬁts and risks of HPV vaccination must be weighed with the beneﬁts and risks of HPV screening (Pap smears) to reduce cervical cancer in a cost-effective manner.[tpl]cite doi|10.1097/GCO.0b013e328332c910[/tpl] This paper was challenged by two scientists from Merck (the maker of Gardasil), who wrote, among other things, that it "contains inaccuracies and assumptions not supported by the currently available data" and that its methodology was flawed because "Efficacy estimates alone cannot be compared across studies and populations in order to infer differences in vaccine impact."[tpl]cite doi|10.1586/erv.10.56[/tpl]
In a 2011 NPR interview, she argued against mandatory HPV vaccines for schoolchildren, saying "Ninety-five percent of women who are infected with HPV never, ever get cervical cancer."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/2011/09/19/140543977/hpv-vaccine-the-science-behind-the-controversy | title=HPV Vaccine: The Science Behind the Controversy | publisher=NPR | date=19 September 2011 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Knox, Richard[/tpl] In an article in the 2013 book Vaccination Controversies: A Reference Handbook, she argued further against HPV vaccine mandates for schoolchildren, because "Population health models show that if the HPV vaccine does not last for at least 15 years, no cancers will ever be prevented; women will just get the cancers at a later time in life after the vaccine has worn off" and that Gardasil and Cervarix have only been shown to last for 5 and 9.4 years respectively.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3MeQVLE49oYC&pg=PA137 | title=Vaccination Controversies | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Newton, David E. | year=2013 | pages=137–141 | isbn=978-1-61069-311-0[/tpl] In 2012 she told Women's Health that "It's critical to note that more than 70 healthy young girls have died from a neurological reaction that occurred soon after getting Gardasil; you can avoid the risks by opting for a lifetime of Pap smear screening rather than vaccination."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/hpv-vaccine-facts | title=The HPV Vaccine: Risks vs. Rewards | publisher=Women's Health | date=9 May 2013 | accessdate=11 August 2013 | author=Rhodes, Maura[/tpl] In a July 2013 interview, she stated that she advocates personal choice and an individualized approach to HPV vaccination, saying that she provides "a balanced picture to my patients and their families and am not at all upset if they refuse the vaccine, especially at younger ages."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mdnews.com/news/2013_07/national_julyaug13-hpv-a-complicated-vaccine.aspx | title=HPV: A Complicated Vaccine | work=MDNews | date=1 July 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] Harper appeared on a December 2013 episode of Katie Couric's show Katie devoted to the HPV vaccine, and stated that newly developed pap screenings that combine HPV testing and cytology have a nearly 100% ability to detect pre-cancers and cancers; she noted that Gardasil doesn't last long enough to prevent cervical cancer and that there are some harms associated with it."Was the HPV Vaccine Responsible for One Girl's Death?"
