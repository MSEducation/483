Baldur's Gate is a fictional city in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. It is a coastal city on the north bank of the river Chiontar, located in the Western Heartlands region of Faer√ªn. Situated to the south of the great city-state of Waterdeep and to the north of the country of Amn, it lies on the heavily travelled Coast Way road. The city was detailed in Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast, published in 1994, and provided the main setting to the computer game, Baldur's Gate, released in 1998.
As a wealthy port metropolis, with over 42,000 inhabitants (although that almost doubles in the summer months), it is an important merchant city on the Sword Coast. Its strong Watch and the presence of the powerful Flaming Fist mercenary company maintain order within the city.
The city's unique shape, curved around its harbor, gives it the appearance of a crescent moon.  The docks and shipping facilities are among the most efficient along the coast and the city relies heavily on the ships that dock there.  A large open marketplace, called The Wide, dominates the northeast portion of the walled city, and other large structures include The High Hall, seat of the city government, the High House of Wonders, a large temple to Gond, and the Seatower of Balduran, a small fortress in the center of the harbor. To keep vermin from spreading too much into the city proper, cats are bred and encouraged to roam the city[tpl]Who|date=January 2008[/tpl].

==History==

The city takes its name from the great seafaring hero Balduran.Baldur's Gate Game Manual, pp. 42  Long ago, Balduran sailed to the fabled Anchorome and returned with great wealth which was used to build the wall around what became Baldur's Gate.  He left the city again, presumably to return to Anchorome, but never returned.
At the time, the growing town was controlled by local farmers who mercilessly taxed incoming shipments.  This infuriated ship captains, who believed that since the harbor wasn't walled in, its traffic should not be taxed, and they eventually overthrew the farmers.  The four eldest captains ruled the city together, and jokingly called themselves "dukes," which stuck.

==Government==

Baldur's Gate is ruled by four grand dukes, the Council of Four. The rulers include Duke Eltan, leader of the Flaming Fist, Belt, a powerful warrior and divine spellcaster, Liia Jannath, a mage, and Entar Silvershield, the richest man in Baldur's Gate, but also a strong warrior in his own right.  The Council is part of the Lords' Alliance, which includes Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Silverymoon, among others. However, with Neverwinter being wiped out by a plague whether this Alliance still exists or not is uncertain.
Baldur's Gate contains a very effective Thieves Guild, as well as a powerful and honest Merchant's League.  Additionally, the Knights of the Shield and the Knights of the Unicorn are both active in the city. Various thieves guilds have risen and fallen in Baldur's Gate including Xantam's Guild and the Hands of Glory. Amn's Shadow Thieves are also known to be active in the city, although their local operations are believed to be strictly commercial.[tpl]Who|date=May 2008[/tpl]
