David of Sassoun ([tpl]lang-hy|Սասունցի Դավիթ[/tpl] Sasuntsi Davit) is the main hero of Armenia's national epic Daredevils of Sassoun, who drove Arab invaders out of Armenia.
The Daredevils of Sassoun (also known as after its main hero David of Sassoun) is an Armenian national epic poem recounting David's exploits. As an oral history, it dates from the 8th century, and was first put in written form in 1873 by Garegin Srvandzediants.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
David of Sassoun is the name of only one of the four acts, but due to the popularity of the character, the entire epic is known to the public as David of Sasun. The epic's full name is Sasna Tsrer (The Daredevils of Sasun).
Modern Armenian writer Hovhannes Tumanyan later penned a poem of the same name retelling the story of the David of Sasun in a more modern language.
