==Opinions on intellectual property==

Doctorow believes that copyright laws should be liberalized to allow for free sharing of all digital media. He has also advocated filesharing.[tpl]cite web|last=Doctorow |first=Cory |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/12/steal-this-file-shar.html |title=Steal This File Sharing Book – A–Z HOWTO for file-sharing |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2004-12-12 |accessdate=2010-11-16[/tpl] He argues that copyright holders should have a monopoly on selling their own digital media, and copyright laws should only be operative when someone attempts to sell a product currently under someone else's copyright.[tpl]cite web|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=The Internet is Not a Waffle Iron Connected to a Fax Machine|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-internet-is-not-a-waffle-iron-connected-to-a-fax-machine|publisher=IAI|accessdate=29 January 2014[/tpl]
