Senescence (from [tpl]lang-la|senescere[/tpl], meaning "to grow old", from senex) or biological aging (also spelled biological ageing) is the gradual deterioration of function characteristic of most complex lifeforms, arguably found in all biological kingdoms, that on the level of the organism increases mortality after maturation. The word "senescence" can refer either to cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism. It is commonly believed that cellular senescence underlies organismal senescence. The science of biological aging is biogerontology.
Senescence is not the inevitable fate of all organisms. Organisms of some taxonomic groups (taxa), including some animals, even experience chronological decrease in mortality, for all or part of their life cycle.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=The New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616[/tpl] On the other extreme are accelerated aging diseases, rare in humans. There is also the extremely rare and poorly understood "Syndrome X", whereby a person remains physically and mentally an infant or child throughout one's life.[tpl]Cite pmid|19428454[/tpl][tpl] cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=7880954&page=1 |title=Doctors Baffled, Intrigued by Girl Who Doesn't Age |last=Brown |first=Bob |date=23 June 2006 |work=Health |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=27 June 2009[/tpl]
Even if environmental factors do not cause aging, they may affect it; in such a way, for example, overexposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging. Different parts of the body may age at different rates. Two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates, so that biological aging and chronological aging are quite distinct concepts.
Albeit indirectly, senescence is by far the leading cause of death (other than in the trivially accurate sense that cerebral hypoxia, i.e., lack of oxygen to the brain, is the immediate cause of all human death). Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes; in industrialized nations, moreover, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.[tpl]cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 |id=Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 [/tpl]
There are a number of hypotheses as to why senescence occurs; for example, some posit it is programmed by gene expression changes, others that it is the cumulative damage caused by biological processes. Whether senescence as a biological process itself can be slowed down, halted or even reversed, is a subject of current scientific speculation and research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sens.org/ |title=SENS Foundation[/tpl]

==Cellular senescence==

Cellular senescence is the phenomenon by which normal diploid cells cease to divide, normally after about 50 cell divisions in vitro. This phenomenon is also known as "replicative senescence", the "Hayflick phenomenon", or the Hayflick limit in honour of Dr. Leonard Hayflick, co-author with Paul Moorhead, of the first paper describing it in 1961.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hayflick L, Moorhead PS |title=The serial cultivation of human diploid cell strains |journal=Exp. Cell Res. |volume=25 |pages=585–621 |date=December 1961 |pmid=13905658 |doi=10.1016/0014-4827(61)90192-6[/tpl] Cells can also be induced to senesce by certain toxins, irradiation, or the activation of certain oncogenes. In response to DNA damage (including shortened telomeres), cells either age or self-destruct (apoptosis, programmed cell death) if the damage cannot be easily repaired. In this 'cellular suicide', the death of one cell, or more, may benefit the organism as a whole. For example, in plants the death of the water-conducting xylem cells (tracheids and vessel elements) allows the cells to function more efficiently and so deliver water to the upper parts of a plant. The ones that do not self-destruct remain until destroyed by outside forces. Though they no longer replicate, senescent cells remain metabolically active and generally adopt phenotypes including flattened cell morphology, altered gene expression and secretion profiles (known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype), and positive  senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining.[tpl]cite journal|last=Campisi|first=Judith|title=Aging, Cellular Senescence, and Cancer|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=February 2013|volume=75|pages=685–705|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183653|pmid=23140366[/tpl] In a study conducted in 2011 on mice, senescent cells were deliberately eradicated, which led to greater resistance against aging-associated diseases.[tpl]cite journal| author = Baker, D.; Wijshake, T.; Tchkonia, T.; LeBrasseur, N.; Childs, B.; van de Sluis, B.; Kirkland, J.; van Deursen, J.| date=10 November 2011 | title = Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders| journal =Nature | volume =479 | pages =232–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature10600 [/tpl] Cellular senescence is causally implicated in generating age-related phenotypes, and removal of senescent cells can prevent or delay tissue dysfunction and extend healthspan.

==Aging of the whole organism==

Organismal senescence is the aging of whole organisms.
In general, aging is characterized by the declining ability to respond to stress, increased homeostatic imbalance, and increased risk of aging-associated diseases. Death is the ultimate consequence of aging, though "old age" is not a scientifically recognized cause of death because there is always a specific proximal cause, such as cancer, heart disease, or liver failure. Aging of whole organisms is therefore a complex process that can be defined as "a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability".[tpl]Cite web|title=Aging and Gerontology Glossary |url=http://www.senescence.info/glossary.html | accessdate = 26 February 2011[/tpl]
Differences in maximum life span among species correspond to different "rates of aging". For example, inherited differences in the rate of aging make a mouse elderly at 3 years and a human elderly at 80 years.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Comparative Biology of Aging |year=2009 |author=Austad, S |journal=J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci |volume=64 |pages=199–201|pmid=19223603|issue=2|doi=10.1093/gerona/gln060|pmc=2655036[/tpl] These genetic differences affect a variety of physiological processes, including the efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant enzymes, and rates of free radical production.
Senescence of the organism gives rise to the Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality, which says that mortality rate accelerates rapidly with age.
Some animals, such as some reptiles and fish, age slowly (negligible senescence) and exhibit very long lifespans. Some even exhibit "negative senescence", in which mortality falls with age, in disagreement with the Gompertz–Makeham "law".
Whether replicative senescence (Hayflick limit) plays a causative role in organismal aging is at present an active area of investigation.

==Theories of aging==

The exact etiology of senescence is still largely unclear and yet to be discovered. The process of senescence is complex, and may derive from a variety of different mechanisms and exist for a variety of different reasons. However, senescence is not universal, and scientific evidence suggests that cellular senescence evolved in certain species because it prevents the onset of cancer. In a few simple species, such as those in the genus Hydra, senescence is negligible and cannot be detected.
All such species have no "post-mitotic" cells; they reduce the effect of damaging free radicals by cell division and dilution.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Another related mechanism is that of the biologically immortal planarian flatworms, which have “apparently limitless telomere regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells.”[tpl]cite journal |author=Thomas C. J. Tan, Ruman Rahman, Farah Jaber-Hijazi, Daniel A. Felix, Chen Chen, Edward J. Louis, and Aziz Aboobaker |title=Telomere maintenance and telomerase activity are differentially regulated in asexual and sexual worms |journal=PNAS |volume=109 |issue=9 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1118885109 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/22/1118885109.full.pdf+html[/tpl] These organisms are biologically immortal but not immortal in the traditional sense as they are nonetheless susceptible to trauma and infectious and non-infectious disease. Moreover, average lifespans can vary greatly within and between species. This suggests that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to aging.
In general, theories that explain senescence have been divided between the programmed and stochastic theories of aging. Programmed theories imply that aging is regulated by biological clocks operating throughout the lifespan. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair, and defense responses. The Reproductive-Cell Cycle Theory suggests that aging is caused by changes in hormonal signaling over the lifespan.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bowen RL, Atwood CS|title=The reproductive-cell cycle theory of aging: an update. |journal=Experimental Gerontology|volume=46|issue=2|pages=100–7|year=2011|pmid=20851172|doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.09.007[/tpl] Stochastic theories blame environmental impacts on living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels as the cause of aging, examples of which ranging from damage to DNA, damage to tissues and cells by oxygen radicals (widely known as free radicals countered by the even more well-known antioxidants), and cross-linking.
However, aging is seen as a progressive failure of homeodynamics (homeostasis) involving genes for the maintenance and repair, stochastic events leading to molecular damage and molecular heterogeneity, and chance events determining the probability of death. Since complex and interacting systems of maintenance and repair comprise the homeodynamic (old term: homeostasis) space of a biological system, aging is considered to be a progressive shrinkage of homeodynamic space mainly due to increased molecular heterogeneity.

===Evolutionary theories===

A gene can be expressed at various stages of life. Therefore, natural selection can support lethal and harmful alleles, if their expression occurs after reproduction. Senescence may be the product of such selection.[tpl]cite book |author=Medawar, P.B. |title=An Unsolved problem of biology; an inaugural lecture delivered at University College, London, 6 December, 1951 |publisher=H.K. Lewis |location=London |year=1952 |oclc=8482093[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Williams, G.C. |title=Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence |journal=Evolution |volume=11 |pages=398–411 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2406060[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Hamilton WD |title=The moulding of senescence by natural selection |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=12–45 |date=September 1966 |pmid=6015424 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022-5193(66)90184-6 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6[/tpl]  In addition, aging is believed to have evolved because of the increasingly smaller probability of an organism still being alive at older age, due to predation and accidents, both of which may be random and age-invariant. It is thought[tpl]By whom|date=September 2012[/tpl] that strategies that result in a higher reproductive rate at a young age, but shorter overall lifespan, result in a higher lifetime reproductive success and are therefore favoured by natural selection. In essence, aging is, therefore, the result of investing resources in reproduction, rather than maintenance of the body (the "Disposable Soma" theory[tpl]Cite journal|author=Kirkwood TB |title=Evolution of ageing |journal=Nature |volume=270 |issue=5635 |pages=301–4 |date=November 1977 |pmid=593350 |doi=10.1038/270301a0[/tpl]), in light of the fact that accidents, predation, and disease kill organisms regardless of how much energy is devoted to repair of the body. Various other theories of aging exist, and are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane wondered why the dominant mutation that causes Huntington's disease remained in the population, and why natural selection had not eliminated it. The onset of this neurological disease is (on average) at age 45 and is invariably fatal within 10–20 years. Haldane assumed that, in human prehistory, few survived until age 45. Since few were alive at older ages and their contribution to the next generation was therefore small relative to the large cohorts of younger age groups, the force of selection against such late-acting deleterious mutations was correspondingly small. However, if a mutation affected younger individuals, selection against it would be strong. Therefore, late-acting deleterious mutations could accumulate in populations over evolutionary time through genetic drift. This principle has been demonstrated experimentally.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]  And it is these later-acting deleterious mutations that are believed to allow—even cause—age-related mortality.
Peter Medawar formalised this observation in his mutation accumulation theory of aging.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Medawar PB |year=1946 |title=Old age and natural death |journal=Modern Quarterly |volume=1 |pages=30–56[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| first=Peter B. | last=Medawar |  year=1952 | title=An Unsolved Problem of Biology |  publisher=H. K. Lewis | location=London[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] "The force of natural selection weakens with increasing age—even in a theoretically immortal population, provided only that it is exposed to real hazards of mortality. If a genetic disaster... happens late enough in individual life, its consequences may be completely unimportant". The 'real hazards of mortality' are, in typical circumstances, predation, disease, and accidents. So, even an immortal population, whose fertility does not decline with time, will have fewer individuals alive in older age groups. This is called 'extrinsic mortality'. Young cohorts, not depleted in numbers yet by extrinsic mortality, contribute far more to the next generation than the few remaining older cohorts, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations, which affect only these few older individuals, is very weak. The mutations may not be selected against, therefore, and may spread over evolutionary time into the population.
The major testable prediction made by this model is that species that have high extrinsic mortality in nature will age more quickly and have shorter intrinsic lifespans. This is borne out among mammals, the best-studied in terms of life history. There is a correlation among mammals between body size and lifespan, such that larger species live longer than smaller species under controlled/optimum conditions, but there are notable exceptions. For instance, many bats and rodents are of similar size, yet bats live much longer. For instance, the little brown bat, half the size of a mouse, can live 30 years in the wild. A mouse will only live 2–3 years even under optimum conditions. The explanation is that bats have fewer predators, and therefore low extrinsic mortality. More individuals survive to later ages, so the force of selection against late-acting deleterious mutations is stronger. Fewer late-acting deleterious mutations equates to slower aging and therefore a longer lifespan. Birds are also warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5–10 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals. Seabirds, which, in general, have the fewest predators of all birds, live longest.
When examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and often their sociality, help them avoid becoming prey. High position in the food chain, intelligence and cooperativeness all reduce extrinsic mortality in species.
Another evolutionary theory of aging was proposed by George C. Williams[tpl]Cite journal|first=George C. |last=Williams |date=December 1957 |title=Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence |journal=Evolution |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=398–411 |doi=10.2307/2406060 |url=http://www.devonescent.org/pdfs/Williams57.pdf |jstor=2406060[/tpl] and involves antagonistic pleiotropy. A single gene may affect multiple traits. Some traits that increase fitness early in life may also have negative effects later in life. But, because many more individuals are alive at young ages than at old ages, even small positive effects early can be strongly selected for, and large negative effects later may be very weakly selected against. Williams suggested the following example: Perhaps a gene codes for calcium deposition in bones, which promotes juvenile survival and will therefore be favored by natural selection; however, this same gene promotes calcium deposition in the arteries, causing negative atherosclerotic effects in old age. Thus, harmful biological changes in old age may result from selection for pleiotropic genes that are beneficial early in life but harmful later on. In this case, selection pressure is relatively high when Fisher's reproductive value is high and relatively low when Fisher's reproductive value is low.

===Gene regulation===

A number of genetic components of aging have been identified using model organisms, ranging from the simple budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to worms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Study of these organisms has revealed the presence of at least two conserved aging pathways.
One of these pathways involves the gene Sir2, a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase. In yeast, Sir2 is required for genomic silencing at three loci: The yeast mating loci, the telomeres and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In some species of yeast, replicative aging may be partially caused by homologous recombination between rDNA repeats; excision of rDNA repeats results in the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs). These ERCs replicate and preferentially segregate to the mother cell during cell division, and are believed to result in cellular senescence by titrating away (competing for) essential nuclear factors. ERCs have not been observed in other species (nor even all strains of the same yeast species) of yeast (which also display replicative senescence), and ERCs are not believed to contribute to aging in higher organisms such as humans (they have not been shown to accumulate in mammals in a similar manner to yeast). Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has been found in worms, flies, and humans. The origin and role of eccDNA in aging, if any, is unknown.
Despite the lack of a connection between circular DNA and aging in higher organisms, extra copies of Sir2 are capable of extending the lifespan of both worms and flies (though, in flies, this finding has not been replicated by other investigators, and the activator of Sir2 resveratrol does not reproducibly increase lifespan in either species[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bass TM, Weinkove D, Houthoofd K, Gems D, Partridge L |title=Effects of resveratrol on lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=128 |issue=10 |pages=546–52 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17875315 |doi=10.1016/j.mad.2007.07.007[/tpl]). Whether the Sir2 homologues in higher organisms have any role in lifespan is unclear, but the human SIRT1 protein has been demonstrated to deacetylate p53, Ku70, and the forkhead family of transcription factors. SIRT1 can also regulate acetylates such as CBP/p300, and has been shown to deacetylate specific histone residues.
RAS1 and RAS2 also affect aging in yeast and have a human homologue. RAS2 overexpression has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast.
Other genes regulate aging in yeast by increasing the resistance to oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase, a protein that protects against the effects of mitochondrial free radicals, can extend yeast lifespan in stationary phase when overexpressed.
In higher organisms, aging is likely to be regulated in part through the insulin/IGF-1 pathway. Mutations that affect insulin-like signaling in worms, flies, and the growth hormone/IGF1 axis in mice are associated with extended lifespan. In yeast, Sir2 activity is regulated by the nicotinamidase PNC1. PNC1 is transcriptionally upregulated under stressful conditions such as caloric restriction, heat shock, and osmotic shock. By converting nicotinamide to niacin, nicotinamide is removed, inhibiting the activity of Sir2. A nicotinamidase found in humans, known as PBEF, may serve a similar function, and a secreted form of PBEF known as visfatin may help to regulate serum insulin levels. It is not known, however, whether these mechanisms also exist in humans, since there are obvious differences in biology between humans and model organisms.
Sir2 activity has been shown to increase under calorie restriction. Due to the lack of available glucose in the cells, more NAD+ is available and can activate Sir2. Resveratrol, a stilbenoid found in the skin of red grapes, was reported to extend the lifespan of yeast, worms, and flies (the lifespan extension in flies and worms have proved to be irreproducible by independent investigators). It has been shown to activate Sir2 and therefore mimics the effects of calorie restriction, if one accepts that caloric restriction is indeed dependent on Sir2.
Gene expression is imperfectly controlled, and it is possible that random fluctuations in the expression levels of many genes contribute to the aging process as suggested by a study of such genes in yeast.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Ryley J, Pereira-Smith OM|title=Microfluidics device for single cell gene expression analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Yeast |volume=23 |issue=14–15 |pages=1065–73 |year=2006 |pmid=17083143 |doi=10.1002/yea.1412[/tpl]  Individual cells, which are genetically identical, none-the-less can have substantially different responses to outside stimuli, and markedly different lifespans, indicating the epigenetic factors play an important role in gene expression and aging as well as genetic factors.
According to the GenAge database of aging-related genes there are over 700 genes associated with aging in model organisms: 555 in the soil roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans), 87 in the bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 75 in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and 68 in the mouse (Mus musculus).[tpl]Cite web|title=GenAge database | url= http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/models.html | accessdate = 26 February 2011[/tpl]
The following is a list of genes connected to longevity through research[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] on model organisms:

===Cellular senescence===

As noted above, senescence is not universal. It was once thought that senescence did not occur in single-celled organisms that reproduce through the process of cellular mitosis.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Gavrilov LA, Gavrilova NS |title=The reliability theory of aging and longevity |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=213 |issue=4 |pages=527–45 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11742523 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2430[/tpl] Recent investigation has unveiled a more complex picture. Single cells do accumulate age-related damage. On mitosis the debris is not evenly divided between the new cells. Instead it passes to one of the cells leaving the other cell pristine. With successive generations the cell population becomes a mosaic of cells with half ageless and the rest with varying degrees of senescence.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stephens C |title=Senescence: even bacteria get old |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=R308–10 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15854899 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960-9822(05)00377-5[/tpl]
Moreover, cellular senescence is not observed in several organisms, including perennial plants, sponges, corals, and lobsters. In those species where cellular senescence is observed, cells eventually become post-mitotic when they can no longer replicate themselves through the process of cellular mitosis; i.e., cells experience replicative senescence. How and why some cells become post-mitotic in some species has been the subject of much research and speculation, but (as noted above) it is sometimes suggested that cellular senescence evolved as a way to prevent the onset and spread of cancer. Somatic cells that have divided many times will have accumulated DNA mutations and would therefore be in danger of becoming cancerous if cell division continued.
Lately, the role of telomeres in cellular senescence has aroused general interest, especially with a view to the possible genetically adverse effects of cloning. The successive shortening of the chromosomal telomeres with each cell cycle is also believed to limit the number of divisions of the cell, thus contributing to aging. There have, on the other hand, also been reports that cloning could alter the shortening of telomeres. Some cells do not age and are, therefore, described as being "biologically immortal". It is theorized by some that when it is discovered exactly what allows these cells, whether it be the result of telomere lengthening or not, to divide without limit that it will be possible to genetically alter other cells to have the same capability. It is further theorized that it will eventually be possible to genetically engineer all cells in the human body to have this capability by employing gene therapy and, therefore, stop or reverse aging, effectively making the entire organism potentially immortal.
The length of the telomere strand has senescent effects; telomere shortening activates extensive alterations in alternative RNA splicing that produce senescent toxins such as progerin, which degrades the tissue and makes it more prone to failure.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Collins FS et al. |title=Progerin and telomere dysfunction collaborate to trigger cellular senescence in normal human fibroblasts |journal=J Clin Invest. |date=13 June 2011 |pmid=21670498|doi=10.1172/JCI43578|volume=121|issue=7|pages=2833–44|pmc=3223819[/tpl]
Cancer cells are usually immortal. In about 85% of tumors, this evasion of cellular senescence is the result of up-activation of their telomerase genes.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Hanahan D, Weinberg RA |title=The hallmarks of cancer |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647931 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9[/tpl] This simple observation suggests that reactivation of telomerase in healthy individuals could greatly increase their cancer risk. 
A research team led by Darren J. Baker, Tamara Tchkonia, James L. Kirkland, and Jan M. van Deursen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., purged all the senescent cells in mice by giving them a drug that forces the cells to self-destruct. The mice’s tissues showed a major improvement in the usual burden of age-related disorders. They did not develop cataracts, avoided the usual wasting of muscle with age, and could exercise much longer on a mouse treadmill. They retained the fat layers in the skin that usually thin out with age and, in people, cause wrinkling.

===Chemical damage===

One of the earliest aging theories was the Rate of Living Hypothesis described by Raymond Pearl in 1928[tpl]Cite book| first=Raymond | last=Pearl |  year=1928 | title=The Rate of Living, Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration |  publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | location=New York[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] (based on earlier work by Max Rubner), which states that fast basal metabolic rate corresponds to short maximum life span.
While there may be some validity to the idea that for various types of specific damage detailed below that are by-products of metabolism, all other things being equal, a fast metabolism may reduce lifespan, in general this theory does not adequately explain the differences in lifespan either within, or between, species. Calorically restricted animals process as much, or more, calories per gram of body mass, as their ad libitum fed counterparts, yet exhibit substantially longer lifespans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]  Similarly, metabolic rate is a poor predictor of lifespan for birds, bats and other species that, it is presumed, have reduced mortality from predation, and therefore have evolved long lifespans even in the presence of very high metabolic rates.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Brunet-Rossinni AK, Austad SN |title=Ageing studies on bats: a review |journal=Biogerontology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=211–22 |year=2004 |pmid=15314271 |doi=10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038022.65024.d8[/tpl] In a 2007 analysis it was shown that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.[tpl]Cite journal|author=de Magalhães JP, Costa J, Church GM |title=An Analysis of the Relationship Between Metabolism, Developmental Schedules, and Longevity Using Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=149–60 |date=1 February 2007|pmid=17339640 |pmc=2288695 |url=http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17339640 |doi=10.1093/gerona/62.2.149 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] (For a critique of the Rate of Living Hypothesis see Living fast, dying when?[tpl]Cite journal|author=Speakman JR, Selman C, McLaren JS, Harper EJ |title=Living fast, dying when?

With respect to specific types of chemical damage caused by metabolism, it is suggested that damage to long-lived biopolymers, such as structural proteins or DNA, caused by ubiquitous chemical agents in the body such as oxygen and sugars, are in part responsible for aging. The damage can include breakage of biopolymer chains, cross-linking of biopolymers, or chemical attachment of unnatural substituents (haptens) to biopolymers.
