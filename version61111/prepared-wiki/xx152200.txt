==Silos==

Peak Hillâ€™s central Position in the New South Wales wheat belt may have been the reason why Peak Hill became the site for Australia's first upright bulk wheat silo in 1918. It was not until 1927 that the next stage, the six-bin silos and weighbridge complex, was completed at Peak Hill. In 1950 the construction of three additional 50,000 bushel bins was carried out and the bulkhead was completed in 1959.
After viewing the current silo it will become apparent that they have grown substantially over the years to cope with the local grain production. A lot of locally grown grain is also taken over to the Parkes silo.
The Peak Hill silo can be viewed from Lindner Avenue, which runs parallel with the railway line.
