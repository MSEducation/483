==Outline==

The new city of Matsumoto is the city comprising the mergers of the old city of Matsumoto and four villages. Matsumoto officially absorbed those villages without creating a new municipal organization.
Matsumoto is surrounded by mountains and is acclaimed for its beautiful views. Hiking and climbing locations in the mountains are readily accessible by local bus transportation. Matsumoto has several historic features, such as [tpl]nihongo|Matsumoto Castle|松本城|Matsumoto-jō[/tpl], Kaichi School Museum (Kaichi gakkō), and Temari (traditional Japanese handball).
Matsumoto is attractive to travellers not only because of the traditional culture but also its calm climate and its products. Matsumoto soba is famous and many are delighted by its delicate taste. The world's largest wasabi farm, Daio Wasabi Farm, is located just north of Matsumoto in Azumino.http://welcome.city.matsumoto.nagano.jp/contents03+index.id+15.htm Wasabi can only be grown in extremely clean water so there is much local pride in this product. In addition, Matsumoto is home to the Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto, held every August by conductor Seiji Ozawa and featuring the Saito Kinen Orchestra; regular guests have included Robert Mann and Mstislav Rostropovich. It is very difficult to get tickets: Many people wait in line two days before tickets go on sale.
Home to several renowned current and former musical instrument factories, such as Matsumoku (closed in 1986) and FujiGen Gakki.
Matsumoto, like many areas in Japan, is home to abundant onsen (温泉 or hot springs). It also is host to a number of summer festivals, including the Bon-Bon Festival on the first Saturday of August, which features its signature dance.

==Geography==

===Surrounding municipalities===

The newly merged city of Matsumoto is surrounded by 14 municipalities.

===The former city of Matsumoto===

Since the post merger Matsumoto's (the new city of Matsumoto) area is too big because the city now includes the mountainous areas, the data of the former city (the old city of Matsumoto) is listed on the right.
However, "The city of Matsumoto" is primarily centralized on the old city of Matsumoto because most of the dramas and plays are centralized on Kaichi Gakko (Kaichi School) and Matsumoto Castle.
Since the new city of Matsumoto has absorbed the village of Azumi, the tour guides are calling the area "Matsumoto-Kamikochi Area" instead of "The city of Matsumoto."
The Old Matsumoto City Hall is currently used as the New Matsumoto City Hall. However, the old city of Matsumoto was located within Higashichikuma District, and the district's name came from the former Chikuma Prefecture.

===Climate===

Matsumoto has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) bordering on a  humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa) with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is quite high in summer, but the weather is somewhat drier in winter.
