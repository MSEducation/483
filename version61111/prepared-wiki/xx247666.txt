The General Jewish Labour Party ([tpl]lang-yi|אַלגעמײַנער ײדישער אַרבעטער פרטיי[/tpl], Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Partei, abbreviated A.Y.A.P, [tpl]lang-pl|Ogólno Zydowska Partia Pracy[/tpl]) was a Jewish socialist political party in Poland. The party was founded in Lvov in November 1931 by a leftwing group of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland in East Galicia, which upheld the idea of dictatorship of the proletariat, a faction of the Poale Zion Left and young left-wing Zionists. The party was aligned with the Communist Party of Poland.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d.

The party was banned in July 1934, a move welcomed by mainstream Jewish leaders in East Galicia. Several activists of the party were imprisoned for being members of the party. The party later merged into the Communist Party of Poland.
