He describes himself as "rabidly pro-Israel" and says that Fables "was intended from the beginning" as a metaphor for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although he argues that Fables is not "a political tract. It never will be, but at the same time, it's not going to shy away from the fact that there are characters who have real moral and ethical centers, and we're not going to apologize for it."[tpl]cite web | last = Deppey | first = Dirk | title = Bill Willingham (excerpts) | date = September 18, 2006 | url = http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=410&Itemid=48 | accessdate = July 31, 2007 [/tpl]
