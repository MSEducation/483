CATEGORIES: Lithuanian culture-related lists

In the 1970s Soviet Lithuania, there were many groups resisting official Soviet ideology. One of most notable were hippies.[tpl]lt icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book | author = Egidija Ramanauskaitė| coauthors = | title = Jaunimo kultūrinė rezistencija sovietmečiu: hipių kultūrinės idėjos Lietuvoje | year =2003 | editor = | pages = | publisher = | id = | url = http://www.vdu.lt/etnologija/docs/11Kiskina.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =2006-09-23 [/tpl]
As hippie movement faded in the '80, punk subculture took over its role of youth's cultural resistance. In those days people participating in punk subculture could still get beaten up by Soviet police (Militsiya), taken for interrogation by KGB, expelled from schools and sometimes even put into mental health institutions[tpl]en icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | author =Arnoldas Blumberg| coauthors = | title =Thatcher, Punk and Post-Socialism| year = | publisher = National Radio and Television of Lithuania | url = http://www.lrt.lt/subsite/subnews.php?strid=1177239&id=1177256| format = | accessdate =2006-09-23 [/tpl]

===Zines===

The first punk zine in Lithuania was published in 1986 by punk-rocker Atsuktuvas (Nėrius Pečiūra). It was called Mūsų ašigalyje (In Our Pole) http://www.hell-music.lt/straipsniai/subkultura/98/. During The Soviet era zine publishing was extremely difficult because private ownership of Xerox machines was prohibited and state-owned Xerox machines were under close watch by KGB http://www.hell-music.lt/straipsniai/subkultura/98/. During Perestroyka and Glasnost reforms ban of private ownership of Xerox machines was lifted and zine publishing flourished. When Lithuania regained its independence dozens of zines (most of them short lived) were published all across the country. But with coming of the Internet, zine publishing stopped almost completely. Some zines however continued to exist on the Internet. 
K.N.K. (Koks nors kelias - Any Road) punk/alternative zine from Kaunas. First issues were distributed for free, but 1993 in order to finance its existence couple English issues were released and called KNKKKKKK, i.e. KNK c(K)omercial http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Knknk/knknk.2.

Raganos ir Alus (Witches and Beer) was most popular Lithuanian zine ever. It was edited by Ugnius Liogė, founder of Dangus label.

Very important element of Raganos ir Alus was humorous style and its trademark short stories about Buratinos (Soviet adaptation of Pinocchio), the satire on urlaganai. Later Raganos ir Alus become rather conventional heavy metal magazine. As a tribute to its roots one of the last editions of Raganos ir Alus was distributed with small packed portion of baked bread, which is used a snack with beer http://www.giljotina.lt/archyvas.php?cid=5006.
