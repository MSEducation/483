[[Hydrangeaceae]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrangeaceae, Asterid families

Hydrangeaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Cornales, with a wide distribution in Asia and North America, and locally in southeastern Europe.

==Overview==

In its broad sense (as treated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group), the family includes 17 genera, but some botanists divide the family into two, with seven genera split off into a separate family, Philadelphaceae.
The genera are characterised by leaves in opposite pairs (rarely whorled or alternate), and regular, bisexual flowers with 4 (rarely 5-12) petals. The fruit is a capsule or berry containing several seeds, the seeds with a fleshy endosperm.

==Genera==

In addition, the genus Pottingeria is sometimes included in Hydrangeaceae, while others treat it in either Balanophoraceae, or in its own family Pottingeriaceae.
