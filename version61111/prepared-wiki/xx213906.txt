[[Symphony No. 1 (Schubert)]]

CATEGORIES: 1813 compositions, Symphonies by Franz Schubert, Compositions in D major

The Symphony No. 1 in D major, D. 82, was composed by Franz Schubert in 1813, when he was just 16 years old.  Despite his youth, No. 1 is an impressive piece of orchestral music for both its time and size. The first movement opens with a stately Adagio introduction, reminiscent of the Haydn's 104 in its format.  The short Adagio sets off a lively Allegro vivace.
The symphony is scored for 1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in D, 2 trumpets in D, timpani and strings.  The orchestration, which is balanced between strings and winds, lends itself to small chamber orchestras, as well as larger ensembles.  The trumpets are scored particularly high, as in many of Schubert's early works. Trumpet players will find, in general, the tessitura sitting between a concert D to Concert A for most of the 1st and 4th movements.  In the 4th movement, Schubert pushes them up to a high D, in a repeated fashion.  Some careful planning is needed to balance the multiple doublings between horns and trumpets. 
The standard four movement work runs about 26 minutes.
