CATEGORIES: 20th century in Croatia

The Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia ([tpl]lang-sh|Sekretar Centralnog komiteta Komunističke partije Hrvatske[/tpl]) was the head of the League of Communists of Croatia, heading the Central Committee of the Party. The holder of the office was for a significant period, the de facto most influential politician in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, a constituent republic of Yugoslavia. The official name of the office was changed in May 1982 from "Secretary of the Central Committee" to President of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia (Predsjednik Predsjedništva Centralnog komiteta Saveza komunista Hrvatske).
The League of Communists of Croatia was also an organization subordinate to the federal-level League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Between August 1937 and September 1952, the former was named the Communist Party of Croatia (being part of the larger Communist Party of Yugoslavia), until both parties were renamed "League of Communists" in 1952.
