Established on 2 December 1971, the country is a federation of seven emirates (equivalent to principalities). Each emirate is governed by a hereditary emir who jointly form the Federal Supreme Council which is the highest legislative and executive body in the country. One of the emirs is selected as the President of the United Arab Emirates. The constituent emirates are Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain. The capital is Abu Dhabi, which is one of the two centers of commercial and cultural activities, together with Dubai.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mpiweb.org/Archive/217/56.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710033215/http://www.mpiweb.org/Archive/217/56.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2011 |title=Abu Dhabi |publisher=Mpiweb.org [/tpl] Islam is the official religion of the UAE, and Arabic is the official language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://middleeast.about.com/b/2008/03/09/uae-makes-arabic-its-official-language.htm |title=UAE Makes Arabic Its Official Language |publisher=Middleeast.about.com |date=9 March 2008 [/tpl]
In 1962, Abu Dhabi became the first of the emirates to begin exporting oil. The late Sheikh Zayed, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first president of the UAE, oversaw the development of the Emirates and steered oil revenues into healthcare, education and infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703998 |title=United Arab Emirates profile |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2012 [/tpl] Today, Emirates oil reserves are ranked as the seventh-largest in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2178rank.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020171232/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2178rank.html|archivedate=2012-10-20 |title=Oil – proved reserves |publisher=Cia.gov [/tpl] along with world's seventeenth largest natural gas reserves.Natural Gas.

==History==

[tpl]Main|History of the United Arab Emirates[/tpl] The earliest known human habitation in the UAE dated from 5500 BC. At this early stage, there is proof of interaction with the outside world, particularly with civilizations to the northwest in Mesopotamia. These contacts persisted and became wide-ranging, probably motivated by trade in copper from the Hajar Mountains, which commenced around 3000 BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adias-uae.com/ |title=Abu Dhabi Islands Archaeological Survey (ADIAS) |publisher=Adias-uae.com [/tpl] Foreign trade, the recurring motif in the history of this strategic region, flourished also in later periods, facilitated by the domestication of the camel at the end of the second millennium BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/More_light_thrown_on_Jebel_Buhais_Neolithic_age/30453.htm |title=More light thrown on Jebel Buhais Neolithic age |publisher=Uaeinteract.com [/tpl]
By the 1st century AD overland caravan traffic between Syria and cities in southern Iraq began. Also, there was seaborne travel to the important port of Omana (present-day Umm al-Qaiwain) and then to India. These routes were an alternative to the Red Sea route used by the Romans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/e_walk/con_3/con3_17.asp |title=UAE History: 2,000 to 200 years ago |publisher=UAEinteract [/tpl] Pearls had been exploited in the area for millennia but at this time the trade reached new heights. Seafaring was also a mainstay and major fairs were held at Dibba, bringing in merchants from as far as China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/e_walk/con_3/con3_1.asp |title=UAE History: 2,000 to 200 years ago |publisher=UAEinteract [/tpl]

===Advent of Islam===

The arrival of envoys from the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 630 reportedly heralded the conversion of the region to Islam (See also the section History about a companion of Moḥammad in Al-`Ain). After Muhammad, one of the major battles of the Ridda Wars was fought at Dibba resulting in the defeat of the non-Muslims and the triumph of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula.
In 637, Julfar (today Ra's al-Khaimah) was used as a staging post for the Islamic invasion of Sasanian Iran.[tpl]cite book|author1=Ibrahim Abed|author2=Peter Hellyer|title=United Arab Emirates, a New Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&pg=PA83|year= 2001|publisher=Trident Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-900724-47-0|pages=83–84[/tpl] Over many centuries, Julfar became a wealthy port and pearling center from which dhows travelled throughout the Indian Ocean especially to the neighboring land of Sindh, and its cities of Thatta and Debal.

===Portuguese rule (1506–1620)===

Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean in the early 16th century following Vasco da Gama's route of exploration saw them battle Safavid Persia up the coast of the Persian Gulf. In 1507, the Portuguese Captain Afonso de Albuquerque sailed a small fleet into the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz seeking a way of by-passing Arab traders and taking control of the Indian Ocean to increase the amount of wealth flowing into the Portuguese monarchy's coffers.Moving and 'Sheikhing'! – NewsDay Zimbabwe. Newsday.co.zw (16 February 2013). Retrieved on 14 July 2013.  Vasco da Gama was helped by Ahmad Ibn Majid, a navigator and cartographer from Julfar, to find the spice route from Asia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdr.gov.ae/ncdr/English/uaeGuide/index.aspx |title=NCDR | UAE History | Portuguese Era |publisher=Cdr.gov.ae |date=30 January 2005 [/tpl]
Affonso d'Albuquerque set sail in 1506, intent on founding a Portuguese empire in the Persian Gulf. The following year, the area of the Emirates soon became a target. After sacking Sohar in Oman, he pillaged and burnt to the ground the Fujairah port of Khor Fakkan, before overwhelming Hormuz Island. Over the succeeding decades the Portuguese invested considerable time and energy in trying to keep order along the coasts of Arabia, as local Emirati tribes rebelled against Portuguese control, and in fending off challenges from the Ottoman Empire. In the Emirates, Portuguese forts were constructed all along the East Coast beginning in the north at Dibba and proceeding south to Khor Fakkan, Fujairah, Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah. Remnants of the Portuguese forts have been located at Bidya and Julfar, but the ruins of the remaining ones continue to elude archaeologists and historians.
By the early seventeenth century, the Portuguese were beginning to suffer from the efforts of the East India Company and the Safavids to expel them from the region. They were dislodged from their base on Bahrain in 1602, from Bandar Abbas in southern Iran in 1615, and from Ras al-Khaimah in 1620.UAE History: 2,000 to 200 years ago. UAEinteract.

===Saudi rule (1744–1891)===

Between 1744 and 1891, the Emirates was officially part of the First Saudi State, and after the Ottoman–Saudi War, was officially part of the Second Saudi State. Despite this, the first and second Saudi states had very little influence and control over the Emirates. During this time, the Ottoman Navy tried to gain influence along the coast but the Saudi rulers were too busy fighting the Ottomans in the Hejaz and therefore could never have effectively ruled the Emirates in a traditional way, let alone come to their assistance and fight a two-front war. As a result, the Emirates operated independently from the capital city Diriyah during the first Saudi state and later from Riyadh which was the capital during the Second Saudi state. The Emirates also had an extremely high degree of autonomy. Not only could they negotiate treaties with outside powers if they wanted to, they also had their own militias and navies.Peter Malcolm Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis (1977) The Cambridge history of Islam, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29136-4.
After the Ottoman-Saudi War in 1818 which led to the collapse of the first Saudi state, the British eventually got the upper hand, but the region was known to the British as the "Pirate Coast", as raiders based there harassed the shipping industry despite both European and Omani navies patrolling the area from the 17th century into the 19th.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/articles/20081102_3 |title=November 3, 2008 – The UAE is the old Pirate Coast. Not much has changed. |publisher=Wayne Madsen Report [/tpl] British expeditions to protect the Indian trade from raiders at Ras al-Khaimah led to campaigns against that headquarters and other harbours along the coast in 1819. The following year, Britain and local rulers signed a treaty to combat piracy along the Persian-Gulf coast. Yet according to the local Qawassim version, the piracy issue was a pretext. The British Empire tried to further establish itself in the Persian Gulf region and to secure it from any other European influence, particularly from France and Russia, not from local raiders. This version has been particularly well articulated by the current emir of Sharjah in his 1986 book 'The Myth of Arab Piracy in the Gulf'. From this, and from later agreements, the area became known as the Trucial Coast. Raids continued intermittently until 1835, when the sheikhs agreed not to engage in hostilities at sea. In 1853, they signed a treaty with the British, under which the sheikhs (the "Trucial Sheikhdoms") agreed to a "perpetual maritime truce." It was enforced by the United Kingdom, and disputes among sheikhs were referred to the British for settlement. The Battle of Mulayda in 1891 marked the formal end of the second Saudi state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ukinuae.fco.gov.uk/en |title=UK in the UAE |publisher=Ukinuae.fco.gov.uk |date=1 May 2008 [/tpl]

===British rule (1892–1971)===

The following year after the formal collapse of the second Saudi state, and primarily in reaction to the ambitions of other European countries, the United Kingdom and the Trucial Sheikhdoms established closer bonds in an 1892 treaty, similar to treaties entered into by Britain with other principalities in the Persian Gulf. The sheikhs agreed not to dispose of any territory except to Britain and not to enter into relationships with any foreign government other than the United Kingdom without its consent. In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from all aggression by sea and to help in case of land attack.[tpl]cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://looklex.com/e.o/trucial_states.htm |title=Trucial States |publisher=Looklex.com |date=4 April 2007 [/tpl] British suppression of piracy meant that pearling fleets could operate in relative security. However, the British prohibition of the slave trade meant an important source of income was lost to some sheikhs and merchants.United Arab Emirates – The Economy". Library of Congress Country Studies. Countrystudies.us. Retrieved on 14 July 2013.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the pearling industry thrived in the relatively calm sea, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. It began to become a good economic resource for the local people. Then the First World War had a severe impact on the pearl fishery, but it was the economic depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the Japanese invention of the cultured pearl, that all but destroyed it. The industry eventually faded away shortly after the Second World War, when the newly independent Government of India imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The decline of pearling resulted in a very difficult era, with little opportunity to build any infrastructure.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |publisher=UAEinteract [/tpl]
Oil was first discovered in the 1950s. At the beginning of the 1960s, the first oil company teams carried out preliminary surveys and the first cargo of crude was exported from Abu Dhabi in 1962. As oil revenues increased, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, undertook a massive construction program, building schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai's oil exports commenced in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the de facto ruler of Dubai, was also able to use oil revenues to improve the quality of life of his people.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703998|title=Middle East | Country profiles | Country profile: United Arab Emirates|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2009[/tpl]

The border with Oman also remains officially unsettled, but the two governments agreed to delineate the border in May 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/fr/fr050802_1_n.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814005539/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/fr/fr050802_1_n.shtml|archivedate=14 August 2007|title=Oil at heart of renewed UAE-Saudi border dispute |publisher=Jane's Security News[/tpl]
The British had set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office. In 1952, they formed the Trucial States Council,[tpl]cite web|url=http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803020019/http://nasibbitar.net/adi_sr/DocumentsArticle4.jpg|archivedate=3 August 2008|title=Al Khaleej News Paper[/tpl] and appointed Adi Bitar, Sheikh Rashid's legal advisor, as Secretary General and Legal Advisor to the Council. The council was terminated once the United Arab Emirates was formed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ae_tsc.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011257/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ae_tsc.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |title=Trucial States Council until 1971 (United Arab Emirates) |publisher=Fotw.net [/tpl]
The development of the oil industry in the 1960s, encouraged unification of the sheikdoms. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan became ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966 and the British started losing their oil investments and contracts to U.S. oil companies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/85.htm |title=United Arab Emirates – Oil and Natural Gas |publisher=Countrystudies.us [/tpl]

===Independence (1971)===

By 1966 it had become clear the British Government could no longer afford to administer and protect what is now the United Arab Emirates. British MPs debated the preparedness of the Royal Navy to defend the trucial sheikhdoms. Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the British Armed Forces were seriously overstretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped to defend the trucial sheikhdoms. On 24 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the government's decision, reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath to end the treaty relationships with the seven Trucial sheikhdoms that had been, together with Bahrain and Qatar, under British protection. Days after the announcement, the ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, fearing vulnerability, tried to persuade the British to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the full costs of keeping the British Armed Forces in the Emirates. The British Labour government rejected the offer.[tpl]cite web|author=Jonathan Gornall|date=2 December 2011 |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/sun-sets-on-british-empire-as-uae-raises-its-flag#page5 |title=Sun sets on British Empire as UAE raises its flag – The National |publisher=Thenational.ae[/tpl] After Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed Sheikh Zayed of the news of British withdrawal, the nine Gulf sheikhdoms attempted to form a union of Arab emirates, but by mid-1971 they were still unable to agree on terms of union even though the British treaty relationship was to expire in December of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guide.theemiratesnetwork.com/basics/history_of_the_emirates.php |title=History the United Arab Emirates UAE] – TEN Guide |publisher=Guide.theemiratesnetwork.com |date=11 February 1972 [/tpl]

The UAE supported military operations from the US and other Coalition nations that are engaged in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan (2001) and Saddam Hussein in Iraq (2003) as well as operations supporting the Global War on Terror for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base located outside of Abu Dhabi.

The first-ever national elections were held in the UAE on 16 December 2006. A small number of hand-picked voters chose half of the members of the Federal National Council—which is an advisory body.
Largely unaffected by the Arab Spring turmoil, the government has nonetheless clamped down on Internet activism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=23898 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234849/http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=23898 |archivedate=16 January 2013 |title=UAE toughens Internet clampdown |publisher=The Muslim News |date=14 November 2012 [/tpl] In April 2011, five activists who signed an online petition calling for reforms were imprisoned. They were pardoned and released in November. Since March 2012 more than 60 activists (later showed evidence of being moved by Iran to create chaos) have been detained without charge (at the time) – some of them supporters of the Islah Islamic group. A member of the ruling family in Ras al-Khaimah was put under house arrest in April 2012 after calling for political openness. Mindful of the protests in nearby Bahrain, in November 2012 the UAE outlawed online mockery of its own government or attempts to organise public protests through social media.

==Geography==

The United Arab Emirates is situated in Southwest Asia, bordering the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, between Oman and Saudi Arabia; it is in a strategic location along southern approaches to the Strait of Hormuz, a vital transit point for world crude oil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/oil_gas.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705161411/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/oil_gas.htm|archivedate=5 July 2008 |title=UAE Oil and Gas |publisher=Uae.gov.ae |date=19 June 1999 [/tpl]
The UAE lies between 22°30' and 26°10' north latitude and between 51° and 56°25′ east longitude. It shares a 530-kilometer border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a 450-kilometer border with Oman on the southeast and northeast. The land border with Qatar in the Khawr al Udayd area is about nineteen kilometers ([tpl]convert|19|km|abbr=off|disp=output only[/tpl]) in the northwest; however, it is a source of ongoing dispute.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/CountryBackgrounds/SaudiArabia/SaudiUAEdisputes/tabid/174/Default.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408121304/http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/CountryBackgrounds/SaudiArabia/SaudiUAEdisputes/tabid/174/Default.aspx |archivedate=8 April 2010 |title=Saudi-UAE Disputes |publisher=Arabmediawatch.com |date=21 August 1974 [/tpl] Following Britain's military departure from UAE in 1971, and its establishment as a new state, the UAE laid claim to islands resulting in disputes with Iran that remain unresolved. UAE also disputes claim on other islands against the neighboring state of Qatar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeprison.com/uae_disputes.htm |title=UAE Disputes, International UAE Disputes, UAE Boundary Dispute, UAE National Disputes, UAE Emirate Disputes, Claims Three Islands, Abu Musa Island, Greater & Lesser Tumb, The History of Islands, Human Resources UAE, Arab Emirates |publisher=Uaeprison.com |date=14 May 2007 [/tpl]
The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87% of the UAE's total area ([tpl]convert|67340|km2|0|abbr=out|lk=out[/tpl]). The smallest emirate, Ajman, encompasses only [tpl]convert|259|km2|0|abbr=on[/tpl](see figure).
The UAE coast stretches for more than [tpl]convert|650|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the Al Bāţinah coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the Musandam Peninsula, the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz is an exclave of Oman separated by the UAE.
South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation.Muhammad Aurang Zeb Mughal (2013) Persian Gulf Desert and Semi-desert. Robert Warren Howarth (ed.), Biomes & Ecosystems. Ipswich, MA: Salem Press, pp. 34–36. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About [tpl]convert|100|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] to the northeast of Liwa is the Al-Buraimi oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. Lake Zakher is a man-made lake near the border with Oman.
Prior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Al-Hajar al-Gharbi Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.

===Flora and fauna===

The oases grow date palms, acacia and eucalyptus trees. In the desert the flora is very sparse and consists of grasses and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, Arabian oryx and leopards. Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel, perch and tuna, as well as sharks and whales.

===Climate===

The climate of the U.A.E is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above [tpl]convert|45|°C|°F|1|lk=on[/tpl] on the coastal plain.

==Government and politics==

The United Arab Emirates is a federation of absolute hereditary monarchies. It is governed by a Federal Supreme Council made up of the seven emirs of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai, Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Qaiwain. All responsibilities not granted to the national government are reserved to the emirates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp#B|title=UAE Government: Political system|publisher=UAEinteract[/tpl] A percentage of revenues from each emirate are allocated to the UAE's central budget.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/government/political_system.asp |title=UAE Government: Political system |publisher=UAEinteract [/tpl]
Although elected by the Supreme Council, the president and prime minister are essentially hereditary. The emir of Abu Dhabi holds the presidency, and the emir of Dubai is prime minister. All but one prime minister served concurrently as vice president. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was the UAE's president from the nation's founding until his death on 2 November 2004. On the following day the Federal Supreme Council elected his son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to the post. Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the heir apparent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arabruleoflaw.org/countryprofiles/uae.html|title=UAE|publisher=Arabruleoflaw.org[/tpl]
The UAE convened a half-elected Federal National Council in 2006. The FNC consists of 40 members drawn from all the emirates. Half are appointed by the rulers of the constituent emirates, and the other half are indirectly elected to serve two-year terms. However, the FNC is restricted to a largely consultative role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801202643/http://www.government.ae/gov/en/gov/federal/politics.jsp|archivedate=1 August 2008|title=UAE Federal e-Government Portal|publisher=Government.ae[/tpl] In December 2008, the Supreme Council approved constitutional amendments both to empower the FNC and to improve government transparency and accountability.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yearbook.uaeinteract.com/yearbook2010_EN.html?lang=ENG |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020103837/http://yearbook.uaeinteract.com/yearbook2010_EN.html?lang=ENG |archivedate=20 October 2010 |title=Multimedia Yearbook 2010 |publisher=UAE Yearbook[/tpl]

===Human rights===

Although human rights are enshrined in the Constitution of the United Arab Emirates, several international NGOs and civil society groups have raised concerns over the country's human rights record.

===Political divisions===

The United Arab Emirates is divided into seven emirates. Dubai is the most populated Emirate with 35.6% of the UAE population. The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has a further 31.2%, meaning that over two-thirds of the UAE population live in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai.
Abu Dhabi has an area of [tpl]convert|67340|km2|0|abbr=off[/tpl], which is 86.7% of the country's total area, excluding the islands. It has a coastline extending for more than [tpl]convert|400|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and is divided for administrative purposes into three major regions.
The Emirate of Dubai extends along the Persian Gulf coast of the UAE for approximately [tpl]convert|72|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Dubai has an area of [tpl]convert|3885|km2|0|abbr=off[/tpl], which is equivalent to 5% of the country's total area, excluding the islands.
The Emirate of Sharjah extends along approximately [tpl]convert|16|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of the UAE's Persian Gulf coastline and for more than [tpl]convert|80|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] into the interior. The northern emirates which include Fujairah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, and Umm al-Qaiwain all have a total area of 3,881 km2. There are two areas under joint control. One is jointly controlled by Oman and Ajman, the other by Fujairah and Sharjah.
There is an Omani exclave surrounded by UAE territory, known as Wadi Madha. It is located halfway between the Musandam peninsula and the rest of Oman in the Emirate of Sharjah. It covers approximately [tpl]convert|75|km2|0|abbr=off[/tpl] and the boundary was settled in 1589. The north-east corner of Madha is closest to the Khor Fakkan-Fujairah road, barely 10 metres (33 ft) away. Within the Omani exclave of Madha, is a UAE exclave called Nahwa, also belonging to the Emirate of Sharjah. It is about 8 kilometres (5 mi) on a dirt track west of the town of New Madha. It consists of about forty houses with its own clinic and telephone exchange.

Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be supplemented with cardamom, saffron, or mint to give them a distinct flavor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/travel/food.asp |title=UAE Travel& Tourism: Food & Drink |publisher=UAEinteract [/tpl] The cosmopolitan nature of the UAE means that food from every continent can be found here.
