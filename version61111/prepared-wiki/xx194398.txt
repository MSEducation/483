Redfest is an annual music festival at Robins Cook Farm, Kings Mill Lane, Nutfield, Redhill, Surrey, England.
It was established in 2007 as a small (5,000 capacity) independent music festival geared toward youth, with over 70% of its initial attenders expected to be under 17, and promised to be safer than its competitors such as GuilFest and Reading.
