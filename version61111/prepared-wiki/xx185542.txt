==Heliopause==

In June 2010, the EP Helipause Prelude was released on the mrs.vee recordings labelmrsvee.co.uk as a precursor to the forthcoming album Heliopause; on the back of this release the band appeared in the September issue of Classic Rock Presents Prog in the "On The Threshold..." feature, and the EP received a very positive review in the same issue "...if the aggressive, doom-laden title track is the biggest indicator of where The Resonance Association are heading with Heliopause, then rest assured there is little chance of an anti-climax."
The release was also backed up with the band's most notable live performances to date. On October 8 the band opened the 2010 edition of Summer's End festivalSummer's End supporting Jem Godfrey's and Pete Trewavas' new band Defence Of The Realm; Powerplay magazine wrote "...displayed their vision of musical soundscapes, pulsating, hypnotic, rhythmic music featuring some euphoric rhythm and lead work, which filled the room... the band couldn’t fail to impress" whilst Classic Rock Presents Prog "there is something undoubtedly engaging about the throbbing space prog in which Daniel Vincent and Dominic Hemy engage."
Heliopause was released October 17th, 2011.bandcamp
