Atomic units (au or a.u.) form a system of natural units which is especially convenient for atomic physics calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, Hartree atomic units[tpl]Cite news|last=Hartree|first=D. R.|title=The Wave Mechanics of an Atom with a Non-Coulomb Central Field. Part I.

This article deals with Hartree atomic units. In atomic units, the numerical values of the following four fundamental physical constants are all unity by definition:
Atomic units are often abbreviated "a.u." or "au", not to be confused with the same abbreviation used also for astronomical units, arbitrary units, and absorbance units in different contexts.

==Use and notation==

Atomic units, like SI units, have a unit of mass, a unit of length, and so on. However, the use and notation is somewhat different from SI.
Suppose a particle with a mass of m has 3.4 times the mass of electron. The value of m can be written in three ways:

==Fundamental atomic units==

These four fundamental constants form the basis of the atomic units (see above). Therefore, their numerical values in the atomic units are unity by definition.

==Derived atomic units==

Below are given a few derived units. Some of them have proper names and symbols assigned, as indicated in the table.

==SI and Gaussian-CGS variants, and magnetism-related units==

There are two common variants of atomic units, one where they are used in conjunction with SI units for electromagnetism, and one where they are used with Gaussian-CGS units.[tpl]cite web|title=A note on Units|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys7550/phys7550_sp07/extras/Appendix_1.pdf|work=Physics 7550 — Atomic and Molecular Spectra|publisher=University of Colorado lecture notes[/tpl] Although the units written above are the same either way (including the unit for electric field), the units related to magnetism are not. In the SI system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
and in the Gaussian-cgs unit system, the atomic unit for magnetic field is
(These differ by a factor of α.)
Other magnetism-related quantities are also different in the two systems. An important example is the Bohr magneton: In SI-based atomic units,[tpl]cite web|last=Chis|first=Vasile|title=Atomic Units; Molecular Hamiltonian; Born-Oppenheimer Approximation|url=http://phys.ubbcluj.ro/~vchis/cursuri/cspm/course2.pdf|work=Molecular Structure and Properties Calculations|publisher=Babes-Bolyai University lecture notes[/tpl])
and in Gaussian-based atomic units,[tpl]cite book|last1=Budker|first1=Dmitry|last2=Kimball|first2=Derek F.|last3=DeMille|first3=David P.|title=Atomic Physics: An Exploration through Problems and Solutions|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850950-9|page=380|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GW6pclAk-JcC&pg=PA380[/tpl]

==Bohr model in atomic units==

Atomic units are chosen to reflect the properties of electrons in atoms. This is particularly clear from the classical Bohr model of the hydrogen atom in its ground state. The ground state electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus has (in the classical Bohr model):

==Non-relativistic quantum mechanics in atomic units==

The Schrödinger equation for an electron in SI units is
The same equation in au is
For the special case of the electron around a hydrogen atom, the Hamiltonian in SI units is:
while atomic units transform the preceding equation into

==Comparison with Planck units==

There are much larger discrepancies in some other units. For example, the unit of mass in atomic units is the mass of an electron, while the unit of mass in Planck units is the Planck mass, a mass so large that if a single particle had that much mass it might collapse into a black hole. Indeed, the Planck unit of mass is 22 orders of magnitude larger than the au unit of mass. Similarly, there are many orders of magnitude separating the Planck units of energy and length from the corresponding atomic units.
