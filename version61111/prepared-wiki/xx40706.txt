The state of Ohio is the home of a number of public and private institutions of higher learning. Several of these institutions are ranked among the top national universities (in order), including Case Western Reserve University (private), The Ohio State University (public), Miami University (public), University of Dayton (private), Ohio University (public), University of Cincinnati (public), Bowling Green State University (public), and Kent State University (public). Ohio State is the largest university in the United States as of 2006, 2007, and 2008; it was designated as the "Land Grant and National Research" institution of the newly established University System of Ohio. Case Western Reserve and Ohio State are Ohio's two members of the Association of American Universities as well as the universities with the largest endowments. Ohio University is the oldest university in the Northwest Territory and Xavier University is the oldest Catholic Institution in the Northwest Territory. Miami University in 1986 and Ohio State in 2001 were noted as "public ivy" institutions, the state/public equivalent of a private Ivy League institutions. Ohio University's journalism school ranks, with Columbia University's journalism school, as one of the nation's best. University of Akron's Polymer Science and engineering program is among top five in the US, as ranked by U.S. News & World Report.
According to the most recent undergraduate rankings by US News & World Report, Case Western Reserve is Ohio's highest ranked university at 38. Ohio State is Ohio's highest ranked public national university at 55, and Oberlin College is Ohio's highest ranked liberal arts college at 23.
The Ohio Board of Regents oversees the public institutions of higher education in Ohio. This system has come under some criticism in recent years as contributing greatly to overlap and redundancies in the higher education system. For example, Ohio's public university system supports nine doctoral programs in history and five law schools while four different public universities in Ohio operate airports and offer aviation programs. At the same time, the system has been lauded for creating powerful "utility" organizations, such as OhioLINK and the Ohio Supercomputer Center, which allow campuses to collaborate and achieve significant efficiencies. A new credit transfer program makes transferring among Ohio's public campuses much easier, and allows students to preview academic programs.
Eleven of the 13 public universities top the state's enrollment statistics, with Ohio State ranking as one of the nation's top five universities by enrollment. The remaining two public institutions -- Shawnee State University and Central State Universityâ€”are relatively small. The University of Dayton is the state's largest private university by enrollment, followed by Case Western Reserve, Ashland University, Franklin University, and Xavier University.
