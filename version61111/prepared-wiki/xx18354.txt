Apple sauce or applesauce is a purée made of apples. It can be made with peeled or unpeeled apples and a variety of spices (commonly cinnamon and allspice). Flavorings or sweeteners such as sugar or honey are also commonly added. Apple sauce is inexpensive and is widely used in the United States and some European countries.[tpl]cite book|last=Palmatier|first=Robert Allen|title=Food: a dictionary of literal and nonliteral terms|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-31436-0|page=11|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OqIe3YFwsFkC&pg=PA11[/tpl]

==Preparation==

Apple sauce is made by cooking down apples with water or apple cider (fresh apple juice) to the desired level. More acidic apples will render a finer purée; the highly acidic Bramley apple is popular for creating a very fine purée. Apples may or may not be peeled; sugar, spices, or lemon juice may be added for flavoring. Apple butter is similar to apple sauce, but has a high cider to apple ratio, of 8 liters to 100 kilograms.[tpl]cite book|last=Rosenstein|first=Mark|title=In Praise of Apples: A Harvest of History, Horticulture & Recipes|year=1999|publisher=Lark Books|isbn=978-1-57990-124-0|page=135|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bq6k9IyHd74C&pg=PA135|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl]

==Use and availability==

Apple sauce used to be a food prepared for winter, since it keeps well.[tpl]cite book|last=Hale|first=Sarah Josepha Buell|title=The good housekeeper: or, The way to live well and to be well while we live : containing directions for choosing and preparing food, in regard to health, economy and taste|year=1839|publisher=Weeks, Jordan|page=79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=P28EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79|authorlink=Sarah Josepha Hale|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl] It is often an accompaniment to a main course. Swedes and the English, for instance, usually eat apple sauce as a condiment for roast pork. In Germany it accompanies potato pancakes. In the Netherlands, people often eat it with their fries;[tpl]cite news|title=Zappelin plaatst Publieke Omroep voor dilemma|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/anp/kunst/article1701879.ece/Zappelin_plaatst_Publieke_Omroep_voor_dilemma|accessdate=11 January 2011|newspaper=NRC Handelsblad|date=12 July  2006[/tpl] It is also a popular accompaniment in the United States of America and is sometimes served as a dessert there as well, alone or used in making apple sauce cake.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theodora.com/recipies/cakes_and_frostings/applesauce_cake.html |title=Applesauce Cake, Source: U.S. Department of Defence |work=Theodora's RecipiesItalic text |accessdate= March 2014[/tpl]  In France where it is referred to as compote, it is mostly viewed as a dessert and served at room temperature, with the notable exception of boudin aux pommes (dark blood sausage with apple sauce). In Portugal as well, maçã cozida (cooked apple) is solely viewed as a dessert.
It has been suggested that it can substitute for fat (e.g. butter/oil) in baking.http://greatist.com/health/healthy-baking-fat-swaps/http://www.wilton.com/blog/index.php/baking-alternatives-reducing-fat-in-your-favorite-baked-goods-recipes/http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/low-fat-baking3.htm
Commercial versions of apple sauce are readily available in supermarkets.  It may be packaged in glass jars, tins, or plastic tubs. It is also sold in serving-size small plastic cups.

==Herbalism==

Since it is high in pectin (more of which can be added during the cooking process), apple sauce is a homemade remedy to combat diarrhea.[tpl]cite book|last=Graedon|first=Joe|title=The People's Pharmacy Guide to Home and Herbal Remedies|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-98139-6|page=198|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JcrHUCvUKxMC&pg=PA198|author2=Teresa Graedon|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl]
