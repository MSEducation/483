On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives – friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc. – flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.

In Armenia, after the collapse of the Soviet Union celebrations of IWD were abandoned. Instead, April 7 was introduced as state holiday of 'Beauty and Motherhood'. The new holiday immediately became popular among Armenians, as it commemorates one of the main holidays of the Armenian Church, the Annunciation. However, people still kept celebrating IWD on March 8 as well. Public discussion held on the topic of two ‘Women's Days’ in Armenia resulted in the recognition of the so-called ‘Women's Month’ which is the period between March 8 and April 7.
In Italy, to celebrate the day, men give yellow mimosas to women.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html |title=la Repubblica/societa: 8 marzo, niente manifestazione tante feste diverse per le donne |publisher=Repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html |title=politica » Festa della donna, parla Ciampi "La parità è ancora lontana" |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=March 8, 2006 |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl] Teresa Mattei chose the mimosa as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, violets and lily-of-the-valley, were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.[tpl]cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Pirro|title=Teresa Mattei, Flower power |url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=5425 |work=The Florentine |publisher= |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=2013-04-01[/tpl] Yellow mimosas and chocolate are also one of the most common March 8 presents in Russia and Albania.
In many countries, such as in Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Colombia, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine the custom of giving women flowers still prevails these regions only. Women also sometimes get gifts from their employers. Schoolchildren often bring gifts for their female teachers, too.
In countries like Portugal groups of women usually celebrate on the night of March 8 in "women-only" dinners and parties.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
In Pakistan working women in formal and informal sectors celebrate International Women's Day every year to commemorate their ongoing struggle for due rights, despite facing many cultural and religious restrictions. Some women working for change in society use IWM to help the movement for women's rights. In Poland, for instance, every IWD includes large feminist demonstrations in major cities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ippf.org/en/News/Intl+news/March+8+in+Poland+Still+Marching+Together+for+Freedom+and+Equality.htm |title=March 8 in Poland: Still Marching Together for Freedom and Equality |publisher=Ippf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]
In 1975, which was designated as International Women's Year, the United Nations gave official sanction to, and began sponsoring, International Women's Day.
As for efforts to achieve official recognition in the United States of America, actress and human rights activist Beata Pozniak worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February, 1994, H.J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters, along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.j.res.00316: |title=Bill Summary & Status 103rd Congress (1993 - 1994) H.J.RES.316 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]
The 2005 Congress (conference) of the British Trades Union Congress overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for IWD to be designated a public holiday in the United Kingdom.
Since 2005, IWD has been celebrated in Montevideo, either on the principal street, 18 de Julio, or alternatively through one of its neighbourhoods. The event has attracted much publicity due to a group of female drummers, La Melaza, who have performed each year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uruguaynow.com/la_melaza_candombe.php |title=Travel Guide to Uruguay – Uruguay gets a female beat |publisher=UruguayNow |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]
Today, many events are held by women's groups around the world.

In Taiwan, International Women's Day is marked by the annual release of a government survey on women's waist sizes, accompanied by warnings that weight gain can pose a hazard to women's health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/09/2003556662 |title=Women's waistlines increasing: bureau |publisher=Taipei Times |date=March 9, 2013[/tpl]

==Controversies==

In some cases International Women's Day has led to questionable practices that discriminated against men. For example Tower Hamlets Council closed off one of its libraries to all males to "celebrate" the occasion, forcing them to travel elsewhere, going as far as even banning male staff from the premises.[tpl]cite web|author=Phil Carradice |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/international_womens_day_global_centenary |title=International Women's Day, BBC blog |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=2013-03-08[/tpl]
In Communist Czechoslovakia, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the Parliament of the Czech Republic only recently,[tpl]When|date=January 2012[/tpl] on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] In 2008, the Christian conservative Czechoslovak People's Party's deputies unsuccessfully proposed the abolition of the holiday. However, some non-government organizations consider the official recognition of International Women's Day as an important reminder of women's role in the society.
International Women's Day sparked violence in Tehran, Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.[tpl]cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm |title=Middle East | Iranian women struggle for equality |publisher=BBC News |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl] Shadi Sadr, Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen day hunger strike.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm |title=Iran: Release Women's Rights Advocates | Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-08[/tpl]

==Apocrypha==

A popular apocryphal story which surfaced in French Communist circlesTemma Kaplan, On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day, in: Feminist Studies, 11, 1985, S. 163–171. (PDF)Liliane Kandel / Françoise Picq, Mythe des origines à propos de la journée internationale des femmes", in: La Revue d'en face, 12, 1982, S. 67–80. claimed that women from clothing and textile factories had staged a protest on March 8, 1857 in New York City.Angela Howard Zophy, Handbook of American women's history, Garland, 1991, 187. The story alleged that garment workers were protesting against very poor working conditions and low wages and were attacked and dispersed by police. It was claimed that this event led to a rally in commemoration of its 50th anniversary in 1907. Temma Kaplan explains that "neither event seems to have taken place, but many Europeans think March 8, 1907, inaugurated International Women's Day." Speculating about the origins of this 1857 legend, Liliane Kandel and Françoise Picq suggested it was likely that (in recent times) some felt it opportune to detach International Women's Day from its basis in Soviet history and ascribe to it a more "international" origin which could be painted as more ancient than Bolshevism and more spontaneous than a decision of Congress or the initiative of those women affiliated to the Party.
