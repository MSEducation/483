The soundtrack to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (or Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States, India, and Pakistan) was released on 30 October 2001. The film's score was composed and conducted by John Williams. The soundtrack was nominated for Best Original Score at the 74th Academy Awards. The film introduces many character-specific themes (leitmotifs) that are used in at least one sequel as well, although most of the themes are only used again in Chamber of Secrets. These themes include two themes for Voldemort, two themes for Hogwarts, a Diagon Alley theme, a Quidditch theme, a flying theme, a friendship theme, and the main theme ("Hedwig's Theme").  This main theme can be found in all of the films although not usually in its unaltered state. The soundtrack was certified gold in Canada (50,000 units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on 14 December 2001.http://www.cria.ca/gold/1201_g.php It was also certified gold in Japan for 100,000 units by the RIAJ.[tpl]cite journal |title=GOLD ALBUM 他認定作品 2002年1月度 |trans_title=Gold Albums, and other certified works.

==Behind the Scenes==

"Hedwig's Theme" is the leitmotif for the film series. Often labelled as the series' main theme, it was first featured in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the track "Prologue". A concert arrangement of the same name is featured in the end credits. "Hedwig's Theme" has been interpolated throughout the rest of the Harry Potter film scores, from those by Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Hooper, and Alexandre Desplat. It is also featured in the scores to the last four Harry Potter video games, all composed by James Hannigan. "Hedwig's Theme" has achieved significant pop culture status, being featured as ring tones, trailer music, and other forms of multimedia.
Track [tpl]Abbr|No.|Number[/tpl] 10 concludes with "A Change of Season", although in the film, the season's change had occurred before the aforementioned Norwegian Ridgeback (Norbert) had hatched.
Track [tpl]Abbr|No.|Number[/tpl] 18 is also featured during the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 as a tribute to Williams and the series' end.
