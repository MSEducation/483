The show began online on the Rock Star web site on MSN on Monday, July 3 with an Internet exclusive weekly episode and premiered on CBS on July 5, 2006. Votes were cast via the Rock Star website. On September 13, 2006, Lukas Rossi was crowned the winner.

==Release and reception==

Upon release, Rock Star Supernova entered the Billboard 200 charts at number 101 selling 17,000 copies in the first week. The album also debuted at number 87 in Australia and number 4 in Canada.
Professional music critics mostly offered negative reviews of the album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior critic of Allmusic, wrote, "At no point does this band make sense ... it's gloriously bad, the kind of music that can only result when three talented musicians are contractually obligated to work with a wannabe singer who would be a laughing stock on a local level." Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone thought the album had a few bright spots, "but most of the tunes feel tired, if not retrograde: Opener 'It's On' could have come from Collective Soul, the ballads suck, and there are some dark, sub-Alice in Chains bangers."
