Cop Rock is an American musical police drama series that aired on ABC in 1990. The show, a police drama presented as a musical, was co-created by Steven Bochco, who also served as executive producer. TV Guide ranked it #8 on TV Guide's List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/12/entertainment/main515057.shtml|title=The Worst TV Shows Ever|date=2002-07-12|publisher=cbsnews.com|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl] The periodical dubbed it "the single most bizarre TV musical of all time."[tpl]cite web|title=TV Musicals: The Highs and Lows|url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Favorite-TV-Musicals-1060019/1060048|work=TV Guide|accessdate=April 13, 2013[/tpl] 

==Synopsis==

Cop Rock attempted to combine police procedural with  musical theatre, the former a genre in which Bochco had already been very successful with Hill Street Blues. The series centered on the LAPD and featured an ensemble cast that mixed musical numbers and choreography throughout storylines.  For example, one courtroom scene in the pilot episode had the jury break into song, proclaiming their verdict on the defendant ("He's Guilty") Gospel-style.  Another episode had a lineup of Hispanic suspects proclaim in song "We're the local color with the coppertone skin / And you treat us like we're guilty of some terrible sin."  The show also featured crossover appearances from other Bochco series; one episode featured James B. Sikking reprising his Hill Street Blues role of Lt. Howard Hunter, while another episode featured cameos by L.A. Law stars Jimmy Smits and Michele Greene.
The series' theme song, "Under the Gun," was written by Randy Newman, who also performed it in the series' title sequence music video-style in a recording studio, complete with a full backing band and the show's cast (appearing out of character) serving as an audience. Mike Post, who served as Cop Rock's music supervisor, was also part of Newman's band in that opening sequence; Post is the keyboardist in dark glasses sitting next to Newman.
The show was a critical and commercial failure and was canceled by ABC after 11 episodes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DA1E3BF930A25752C1A966958260|title=ABC Cancels 'Cop Rock' |date=1990-11-30|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl] Owing to the combination of its bizarre nature (a fusion of musical performances with serious police drama) and its high-powered production talent, it became infamous as one of the biggest television failures of the 1990s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D61338F935A35752C1A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=A Series Makes the Starting Gate|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|date=1991-11-06|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,643229,00.html|title=Flops 101: Lessons From The Biz|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=2004-06-04|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl]  The series' final episode, which aired on December 26, 1990, concluded with the cast breaking character and joining crew members in performing a closing song. (That final episode featured Sheryl Crow appearing as a back-up singer.)
Despite its overwhelmingly negative reception and short run, the series still has been rebroadcast in later years, with VH1 and A&E Network airing it on separate occasions later in the 1990s, and Trio airing it in the 2000s.
