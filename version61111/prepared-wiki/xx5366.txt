===2001–2005===

In 2001 Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich, who helped wage a successful lawsuit against energy giant Pacific Gas & Electric. While presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year she made a gaffe, saying she was glad that Tom Conti wasn't there. She meant the conductor, Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/040502/aro_040502005.shtml|title=Julia Roberts' Oscar bias obvious to Hollywood peers|accessdate=July 23, 2011|date=April 5, 2002|work=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal[/tpl]
Roberts' first film following Erin Brockovich was the romantic comedy America's Sweethearts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen's once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked "sympathetic characters" and was "only funny in spurts."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/americas_sweethearts/|title=America's Sweethearts (2001)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 3, 2013[/tpl] A commercial success, it grossed over $138 million worldwide however.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=americassweethearts.htm|title=America's Sweethearts (2001)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 3, 2013[/tpl] Later in 2001 she starred in Gore Verbinski's road gangster comedy, The Mexican, giving her a chance to work with long-time friend, Brad Pitt. The film's script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. Ultimately, The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0236493/business |title=The Mexican (2001) – Box office / business[/tpl]
In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven (2001), a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast also including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is flirting with a casino owner, played by Andy Garcia. In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson's performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-100004/Who-fills-whos-shoes-Oceans-Eleven.html#ixzz2PKxWNRCp|title=Who fills who's shoes in Ocean's Eleven|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Associated Newspapers|accessdate=April 2, 2013|location=London[/tpl] A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean's Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of $450 million worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=oceanseleven.htm|title=Ocean's Eleven (2001)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 3, 2013[/tpl]

Roberts received a record $25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953, who teaches conservative students to question their traditional societal roles – the highest ever earned by an actress then.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/17/richest-women-entertainment-tech-media-cz_lg_richwomen07_0118womenstars_slide_9.html| title = The 20 Richest Women in Entertainment|work=Forbes| date = January 17, 2007| accessdate = July 15, 2011| first1=Lea| last1=Goldman| first2=Kiri| last2=Blakeley[/tpl] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics who found it "predictable and safe".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mona_lisa_smile/|title=Mona Lisa Smile (2003)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=April 3, 2013[/tpl]

Fireflies in the Garden (2008), also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe, was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011.
Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006 as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg's 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[tpl]cite news |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |title=Julia rains money on Broadway |date=April 13, 2006 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/theater/news/2006-04-12-roberts-broadway_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=July 6, 2009[/tpl] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with "self-consciousness (especially in the first act) and only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays."[tpl]cite news |first=Ben |last=Brantley |title=Enough Said About 'Three Days of Rain.'

Writing in The New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, "Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her.
