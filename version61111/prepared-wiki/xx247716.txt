==History==

In 1960, six superintendents from the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Brooklyn, Rockville Center, Bridgeport, Newark and Jersey City, as well as the Archdiocese of New York, decided to use television as a means of education within their parochial schools. In 1965, production by the Brooklyn diocese began on educational and religious shows for Catholic schools in the area, under the name Instructional Television Associates (ITA).  In 1966, the newly reflagged Catholic Television Network (CTN) began broadcast from Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School in Brooklyn.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/nyregion/thecity/30fyi.html|title=F.Y.I.|last=Pollack|first=Michael|date=November 28, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] CTN still produces religious and educational material for schools.
Initially broadcast during excess time on the schedule (after school, on weekends and during summertime), The Prayer Channel was spun off from CTN in 1988. The Prayer Channel was developed via an advisory group of people in church media and diocesan agencies.  Also, surveys were conducted within parishes to develop what this new channel would be.  It began broadcasting as a daytime channel — either 8 am or 8:30 am until 4 pm or 4:30 pm.  Gradually it added weekend daytime, then expanded to 10 pm and then twenty-four hours in 1990.  The first programming schedules had a small percentage of in-house programming. Series produced by the channel included Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, Sacred Songs and The Rosary.
The channel was seen on all four cable systems serving New York City at the time, with Cablevision being the fourth to add the channel in late 1989.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/10/23/2004-10-23_prayer_on_cable_makes_connec.html|title=Prayer on Cable Makes Connection|last=Bell|first=Charles W.|date=October 23, 2004|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] By 1989, it was available to 125,000 people and broadcast seven days a week from Park Slope, Brooklyn.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103331565.html?dids=103331565:103331565&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+29%2C+1989&author=By+B.J.+Kowalski&pub=Newsday+%28Combined+editions%29&desc=BROOKLYN+CLOSEUP+Prayer+Channel+Now+On+7+Days+a+Week&pqatl=google|title=Prayer Channel Now On 7 Days a Week|last=Kowalski|first=B.J.|date=March 29, 1989|work=Newsday|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl]

==Recent years==

Inspired by the call from Pope John Paul II for "New Evangelization" in the media, the channel revamped its image, mission and name on December 8, 2008, becoming New Evangelization Television.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1602735731.html?dids=1602735731:1602735731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+27%2C+2008&author=MICHAEL+STARR&pub=New+York+Post&desc=FAITH+REACHES+CABLE&pqatl=google|title=Faith Reaches Cable|last=Starr|first=Michael|date=November 27, 2008|work=New York Post|accessdate=January 8, 2010[/tpl] Television, radio, bus and web advertising, created by the Los Angeles based Forza Migliozzi, featured the Devil urging people to reject "good TV" and instead watch "bad TV" like "reality shows with mindless plots" and "offensive" music videos. An interactive Devil from the award winning campaign can be seen at http://www.StopGoodTV.com. At the launch, the channel's goal was to feature programming that featured New York City as its canvas and appealed to a more-diverse audience than what is typical for many religious television channels.  In 2009, the channel launched its Catholic Daily News program Currents, a news-magazine program, which combines exclusive interviews and features that focus on stories of faith.
In 2010, the channel received its first Emmy Award nomination for its original program Mysteries of the Church in the religious-programming category.[ref][tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. New York Emmy Awards. N.p., Spring 2010.
