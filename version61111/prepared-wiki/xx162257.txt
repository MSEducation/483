==About==

Named for Alvin Saunders, Nebraska's last territorial governor and a member of the Board of Regents of Omaha High School, Saunders School was built in the Romanesque style in 1899. It was designed by prominent Omaha architect John Latenser, Sr. to reflect his interest in neo-classical form and detail. It was the first commission Latenser received for commissions for many of Omahaâ€™s civic and commercial buildings. The school's roof was torn off and the building was partially destroyed by the Easter Sunday Tornado of 1913."Wreckage left behind", Retrieved 2/18/08.
After operating as a school for more than 80 years, the two-story brick building was renovated for use as apartments in the late 1980s.(nd) Saunders School[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]. City of Omaha Landmark Heritage Preservation Commission. Retrieved 2007-05-31.
