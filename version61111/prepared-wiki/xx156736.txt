Aquinas High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in San Bernardino, California, USA.  It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino.

==Background==

Aquinas was established in 1955 as Aquinas Hall, an all-boys high school.  Aquinas Hall and St. Bernadines High School (all-girls) merged in 1971 to form a coeducational high school, Aquinas High School. 
In the 2005-2006 school year facility upgrades began.  In the spring of 2006 the football field was refurbished, bringing in a new playing surface and lighting.  A new fence, entry walls, student drop-off area, and landscaping were completed in 2006.  This was followed by the construction of the Fr. Devine Tennis Center.  This facility provided Aquinas with six lit courts for their league champion Lady Falcon tennis team. Other improvements include the remodeling of the Bill Lemman Baseball Complex, the Lady Falcon softball field, the renovation of the quad area, and remodels of most of the restrooms on campus.  
The 2011-2012 school year saw the dedication of the Rezek Student Center and the Matich Science Center.  Both facilities allow students the use of technology to enhance their educational experience.

The 2012-2013 school marked a dramatic renovation to the gymnasium and surrounding areas.  A landscaping wall was constructed around the north and east side of the gym allowing for a new landscaped entry way.  This entry is accessed through the Jim Ragan Parent Patio.  The patio serves as a new entrance to the athletic facilities as well as providing a sitting area for parents, students and visitors.  Adjacent to the parent patio is a new outdoor basketball court that allows students to play before, during and after school.  This court also serves as a practice court for the junior varsity teams.  Inside the gym, new motorized bleachers were installed along with a new sound system and a 20ft projection screen and projector. [tpl]cn|date=May 2013[/tpl]
