CATEGORIES: Line codes

A Gold code, also known as Gold sequence, is a type of binary sequence, used in telecommunication (CDMA)[tpl]cite web |last1=George |first1=M. |last2=Hamid |first2=M. |last3=Miller |first3=A. |title=Gold Code Generators in Virtex Devices |publisher=Xilinx.com |url=http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp217.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] and satellite navigation (GPS).[tpl]cite web |author= |title=Transmitted GPS Signals |date= |work=The GPS System |publisher=kowoma.de |url=http://www.kowoma.de/en/gps/signals.htm[/tpl] Gold codes are named after Robert Gold.[tpl]cite web |title=Robert Gold, BS, MS, Ph.D. |date=2011 |publisher=Robert Gold Comm Systems |url=http://www.rgcsystems.com/ppl1_gold.htm[/tpl] Gold codes have bounded small cross-correlations within a set, which is useful when multiple devices are broadcasting in the same frequency range.  A set of Gold code sequences consists of 2n − 1 sequences each one with a period of 2n − 1.
A set of Gold codes can be generated with the following steps.  Pick two maximum length sequences of the same length 2n − 1 such that their absolute cross-correlation is less than or equal to 2(n+2)/2, where n is the size of the LFSR used to generate the maximum length sequence (Gold '67).  The set of the 2n − 1 exclusive-ors of the two sequences in their various phases (i.e. translated into all relative positions) is a set of Gold codes.  The highest absolute cross-correlation in this set of codes is 2(n+2)/2 + 1 for even n and 2(n+1)/2 + 1 for odd n.
The exclusive or of two different Gold codes from the same set is another Gold code in some phase.
Within a set of Gold codes about half of the codes are balanced[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]the number of ones and zeros differs by only one.[tpl]harvnb|Holmes|2007|p=100[/tpl]
