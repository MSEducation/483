Giovanni Trapattoni and Marco Tardelli visited Finn Park on 20 July 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.donegaldaily.com/2012/07/21/trap-brings-festival-fever-to-finn-park-in-pictures/|title=Trap brings festival fever to Finn Park - in pictures|work=Donegal Daily|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=21 July 2012|quote=The Irish soccer boss and his number two Marco Tardelli chatted with hundreds of fans including Harps boss Peter Hutton.[/tpl]

==Facilities==

The ground is in a relatively dilapidated condition, although upgraded to modern safety standards. Only three sides are officially open, the covered "Shed" with mixed seating/terracing on the Navenny Road side, the large "Town End" terrace on the Chestnut Road side, and the "Gantry" viewing slope, which is rarely used by home fans and houses the television/radio gantry. The "River End" embankment is officially closed and is generally used for ambulance parking. Fan segregation is rarely officially in existence and effectively unenforced.
Finn Park hosted the amateur Republic of Ireland national football team against Yugoslavia in a qualifier for the 1972 Summer Olympics in April 1971.

==Upgrade==

Finn Harps have plans at an advanced stage to move to a new 6,800 seater stadium across the River Finn in Stranorlar, within sight of their current home. Construction began in October 2008.[tpl]Citation | url=http://www.finnharps.com/News/08Oct13WorkBegins.htm | title=Construction starts on Harps Stadium | accessdate=08-05-2009[/tpl] This will lead to the demolition of Finn Park once the new Finn Harps Stadium is completed.
Construction work began in October 2008 with the official 'turning of the sod' by then Minister for the State Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher. 
Land filling and top soil work began in late 2011 with concrete foundations going in early 2012. 
Steel structures are due to be put in place over June/July 2012 with building work to begin soon after.
The club hope to be in the new 6,800 all seater stadium by summer 2013.
