[[Words of Mormon]]

CATEGORIES: Books of the Book of Mormon

The Words of Mormon is one of the books that make up the Book of Mormon. It consists of a single chapter of eighteen verses. According to the text, it is a comment inserted by the prophet Mormon while compiling the records which became the Book of Mormon.
Mormon writes that King Benjamin stood against the Lamanites wielding the very sword of Laban which had been captured by Nephi after he killed Laban to obtain from him the brass plates that contained the Law of Moses. With his efforts, and wisdom, the help of the prophets, and by slaying thousands of Lamanites, King Benjamin established peace in the land. 
Textually, Words of Mormon serves to link the Small Plates of Nephi, which precede it, with the rest of the Book of Mormon.
