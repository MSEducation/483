==Background==

In 1991, rapper GZA assisted Method Man in shopping him to label executives at Cold Chillin' Records.[tpl]cite web | last = Cowie | first = Del F. | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days Of The Wu | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 15, 2006[/tpl] Though this would turn out to be unsuccessful, he formed the Wu-Tang Clan with his cousins RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Method Man was included in the group. Method Man went on to perform on eight of the twelve tracks on the group's acclaimed 1993 debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), and even had a solo song entitled "Method Man". That song as well as "C.R.E.A.M.", on which he performed the chorus line, reached #69 and #60 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100.[tpl]cite web | last = | first = | url = [tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r189247/charts-awards/billboard-single|pure_url=yes[/tpl] | title = Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) Billboard Singles at AllMusic.com | format =  | work = | publisher = | accessdate = November 15, 2006[/tpl] These two songs had higher chart positions than any other tracks on the album, and thus caused much anticipation for Method Man's solo career. At the time of Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Method Man's rhymes, charisma, and smooth, deep voice made him the group's most visible, popular member.
With the exception of "Sub Crazy" and "P.L.O. Style", which were co-produced by 4th Disciple and Method Man respectively, group member RZA produced Tical in its entirety - leading Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic to refer to the album as "a two-man show".[ref]
