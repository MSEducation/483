==History==

===Early years and mergers===

The firm was established in 1870 when William Barclay Peat formed an accounting firm in London.[tpl]cite web | url=http://rd.kpmg.co.uk/WhoWeAre/16532.htm |title=KPMG – History |publisher=Rd.kpmg.co.uk [/tpl] In 1877 accountancy firm Thomson McLintock opened an office in Glasgow.
Meanwhile in 1917 Piet Klijnveld opened his accounting firm in Amsterdam.  Later he merged with Kraayenhof to form Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co.
In 1925 William Barclay Peat & Co. and Marwick Mitchell & Co. (a firm founded by James Marwick and Roger Mitchell in New York), merged to form Peat Marwick Mitchell & Company (later known simply as Peat Marwick).Family tree: Peat Marwick McLintock ICEAW
In 1979 Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. (Netherlands), McLintock Main Lafrentz (United Kingdom / United States) and Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft (Germany) formed KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) as a grouping of independent national practices to create a strong European-based international firm. Then in 1987 KMG and Peat Marwick joined forces in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms and formed a firm called KPMG in the US, and most of the rest of the world, and Peat Marwick McLintock in the UK.
In 1990 the two firms settled on the common name of KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock but in 1991 the firm was renamed KPMG Peat Marwick, and in 1999 the name was reduced again to KPMG.Note: KPMG derived from predecessor company founders: Piet Klijnveld, William Barclay Peat, James Marwick, and Reinhard Goerdeler.
In 1997 KPMG and Ernst & Young announced that they were to merge. However, while the merger to form PricewaterhouseCoopers was granted regulatory approval, the KPMG/Ernst & Young tie-up was later abandoned.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Oct_20/ai_19892580 |title=Ernst & Young, KPMG merger to create US juggernaut |publisher=Findarticles.com [/tpl]

KPMG's member firms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein merged to form KPMG Europe LLP in October 2007. These member firms were followed by Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, CIS (Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia), Turkey, Norway, and Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consultant-news.com/article_display.aspx?p=adp&id=7325 |title=Norway and Saudi Arabia to join KPMG Europe LLP |publisher=Consultant-news.com [/tpl] They appointed joint Chairmen, John Griffith-Jones and Ralf Nonnenmacher.

==Global structure==

Each national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Cooperative, a Swiss entity registered in the Swiss Canton of Zug. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a Swiss Verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003.Handelsregister des Kantons Zug (Registration Number CH-020.6.900.276-5)
This structure in which the Cooperative provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other professional services networks. The member firms provide the services to client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.This is illustrated in the cases involving Parmalat where clients sought to hold Deloitte (the Swiss Verein)and Grant Thornton International (a UK company providing administrative services to its members) liable for the negligence of other member firms.
Michael Andrew, previously Chairman of KPMG in Australia, assumed the Global Chairmanship in September 2011 and is based in Hong Kong. This is the first time a Big Four accounting organisation has had its global leader based in Asia Pacific.[tpl]cite web|url=http://m.ibtimes.com/australia-s-michael-andrew-named-kpmg-s-global-chairman-144581.html |title=Australia's Michael Andrew named KPMG's global chairman |work=International Business Times [/tpl] On February 28, 2014 it was announced that Michael Andrew was retiring as Chairman due to illness.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304071004579409360272825776|title=KPMG: Michael Andrew Retiring as Chairman; Has 'Serious Medical Condition'|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=4 March 2014[/tpl]
