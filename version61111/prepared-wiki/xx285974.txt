Veronika Scott is an American social entrepreneur and CEO and founder of The Empowerment Plan. Based in Detroit, this non-profit humanitarian organization works to address homelessness by creating jobs for those who want them and providing coats for those that need them.  By age 23, Scott had already received various awards, including the JFK New Frontier Award (2012), and has been featured at multiple events, including at The United Nations Young Women’s Change Makers Conference (2011) held at the UN Headquarters and at the Clinton Global Initiative (2012).

==Personal Life and Education==

Scott was born on June 27 in Orange, California, but was raised in Huntington Woods, Michigan. She has a younger brother named Luke and a younger sister named Cleo.  She attended Clarkston High School and continued her academic studies at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit where she studied industrial design, with a focus on critical theory and cultural phenomenology.  Scott was a member of the IDSA (Industrial Design Society of America), and in 2011 was awarded the IDSA: IDEA (International Design Excellence Award) Gold Award and was also nominated for the World Design Impact Prize.  She graduated in December 2011 with a degree in Product Design.

==Career==

During college, Veronika worked as a design intern for The Little Tikes Company (2009-2010) and for ECCO design (2010).  In the fall of 2010, in response to a class assignment to design something to fill a social need, Scott reached out to the homeless community in Detroit and after five months of working with individuals at a local homeless shelter, she had made a heat-trapping jacket that can transform into a self-heated and waterproof sleeping bag. At the end of the semester, Scott continued to work with the homeless population to create other prototypes and to improve the quality and design of the jacket.  Scott went on to hire and train homeless mothers to make the coats.
Scott's idea for her class project quickly evolved into a non-profit organization known as The Empowerment Plan. Her organization is unique as it not only focuses on the coat that is being made, but it highlights the importance of bringing women out of poverty by helping them to build a better life and to gain back their independence.  Scott has established a non-profit organization that is gaining national and international attention and she is able to work with successful humanitarians and entrepreneurs to ensure the growth of The Empowerment Plan. In addition to running the organization, Scott is also in charge of the design work, business development, speaking engagements, and sustainability planning.  In the future, Scott hopes to launch a buy-one-give-one model.Womenetics Interview
