Ray Mountain is a subglacial mound in Wells Gray Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. Ray Mountain last erupted during the Pleistocene. It is part of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field.
Lava from a conical vent on the southwest side of Ray Mountain flowed down Falls Creek for 6 or more miles almost to the outlet of Clearwater Lake.
