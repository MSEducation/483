† Bembexia is a genus of fossil sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks. This genus is placed in the subfamily Eotomariinae, of the family Eotomariidae. The shell characters resemble those of Balbinipleura. These snails have been interpreted as herbivorous, probably grazing on algae. 
These fossils are found in sedimentary rocks deposited from 340 to [tpl]Ma|420[/tpl], including the Hamilton Group of eastern North America. Other fossil sites include Alaska, Western Europe including the UK, Venezuela, China and Australia.
