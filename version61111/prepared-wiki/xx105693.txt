Jeanne Thérèse du Han de Martigny  (30 October 1707, Lunéville – 7 May 1748, Nancy) was born and baptized the same day in Lunéville, in the duchy of Lorraine, now part of France. She was the daughter of Philippe-Louis du Han, comte de Martigny (1678 – 1733) and his wife Catherine Françoise de Roquefeuil de Puydebar (c.1680 – 1764). The Du Han de Martigny were an important noble family of Lorraine, with estates in the north of the duchy. 
Louis-Philippe held posts as conseiller d'état, Chamberlain and Grand Veneur under Duke Léopold I, and his daughters were among the court beauties. In 1731, Jeanne-Thérèse was maid of honour to the Dowager Duchess and Regent of Lorraine, Léopold's widow. 
After the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession, Granville Elliott spent most of his time away fighting.
Jeanne Thérèse and her husband Granville appear regularly in the Madame de Graffigny correspondence.Correspondence of Mme de Graffigny
