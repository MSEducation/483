Just War theory (jus bellum iustum) is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics studied by theologians, ethicists, policy makers and military leaders. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. The criteria are split into two groups: ‘the right to go to war’ (jus ad bellum) and ‘right conduct in war’ (jus in bello). The first concerns the morality of going to war and the second with moral conduct within war.[tpl]cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=Charles |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael |date=26 Sep 2007 |title=Just War: The Just War Tradition: Ethics in Modern Warfare  |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC |isbn=978-0747595571 |pages=11–15 |chapter=III: The Structure of the Tradition [/tpl]  Recently there have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory - jus post bellum - dealing with the morality of post-war settlement and reconstruction.
Just War theory postulates that war, while very terrible, is not always the worst option. There may be responsibilities so important, atrocities which can be prevented or outcomes so undesirable they justify war.[tpl]cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=Charles |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael |date=26 Sep 2007 |title=Just War: The Just War Tradition: Ethics in Modern Warfare |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC |isbn=978-0747595571 |pages=11–15 |chapter=III: The Structure of the Tradition [/tpl]

==Origins==

The Indian epic, the Mahabharata, offers one of the first written discussions of a 'just war'. In it, one of five ruling brothers asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified, and then a long discussion ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like proportionality (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots, no attacking people in distress), just means (no poisoned or barbed arrows), just cause (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded.Just War in Comparative Perspective
The war in Mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the "just cause" for the war including last minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war.  At the beginning of the war, there is the discussion of "just conduct" appropriate to the context of war.
In ancient Rome, a "just cause" for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion, or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty.Livy 9.1.10; Cicero, Divinatio in Caecilium 63; De provinciis consularibus 4; Ad Atticum VII 14, 3; IX 19, 1; Pro rege Deiotauro 13; De officiis I 36; Philippicae XI 37; XIII 35; De re publica II 31; III 35; Isidore of Seville, Origines XVIII 1, 2; Modestinus, Libro I regolarum = Digesta I 3, 40; E. Badian, Roman Imperialism in the Late Republic (Ithaca 1968, 2nd ed.), p.11. War was always potentially nefas, "wrong, forbidden", and risked religious pollution and divine disfavor.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London 1925), pp. 33ff.; M. Kaser, Das altroemische Ius (Goettingen 1949), pp. 22ff; P. Catalano, Linee del sistema sovrannazionale romano (Torino 1965), pp. 14ff.; W. V. Harris, War and imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 B.C. (Oxford 1979), pp. 161 ff. A just war (bellum iustum) thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial priests.Livy 1.32; 31.8.3; 36.3.9 More broadly, conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the ius gentium, the "law of nations", the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings.Cicero, De officiis 3.17.69; Marcia L. Colish, The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages (Brill, 1980), p. 150.
The quintessential explanation of just war theory in the ancient world is found in  Cicero's De Officiis, Book 1, sections 1.11.33–1.13.41

===Saints Augustine and Aquinas===

Christian theory of the just war begins with Augustine of HippoChristians and War: Augustine of Hippo and the "Just War Theory"[tpl]dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] and Thomas Aquinas.Christians and War: Thomas Aquinas refines the "Just War" Theory[tpl]dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl]
Augustine of Hippo, generally considered one of the first and greatest Christian theologians, was one of the first to assert that a Christian could be a soldier and serve God and country honorably. He claimed that, while individuals should not resort immediately to violence, God has given the sword to government for good reason (based upon Romans 13:4).  Christians as part of government should not be ashamed to protect peace and punish wickedness.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Augustine asserted that this was a personal, philosophical stance:
Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority:
While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work The City of God:
Many give reference of Augustine's theological virtues towards the leader's primary messenger, Grant Ethiticus. Common stories from the time tell that Ethiticus was a brave warrior that fought for the weak under the grace of God (many believe him to be the foundations for the Robin Hood). His motto that has stretched many centuries quoted:

====Thomas Aquinas====

Nine hundred years later, Thomas Aquinas — an immensely influential philosopher and theologian in the tradition of scholasticism — used the authority of Augustine's arguments as he laid out the conditions under which a war could be just:The Just War

===School of Salamanca===

Growing from Aquinas arguments was the School of Salamanca, which expanded on Thomistic understanding of natural law and just war. Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary in order to prevent an even greater evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. Examples of "just war" are:
A war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:
Under this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert infidels or pagans, and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.

===Formally described Just War===

The first work dedicated specifically to it was De bellis justis of Stanisław of Skarbimierz (1360-1431), who justified war of the Kingdom of Poland with Teutonic Knights.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] Francisco de Vitoria criticized the conquest of America by the Kingdom of Spain.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] With Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius just war theory was replaced by international law theory, codified as a set of rules, which today still encompass the points commonly debated, with some modifications.Gutman R, Rieff D. Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company; 1999 The importance of the theory of just war faded with revival of classical republicanism beginning with works of Thomas Hobbes.
Although the criticism can be made that the application of Just War is relativistic, one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the Ethic of Reciprocity, particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle. If one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect, then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation, (a concept not unrelated to the considerations of Game Theory).
Just War theorists combine both a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary. The criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid to determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible. Just War theories are attempts "to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces"; they attempt "to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained, made more humane, and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justwartheory.com |title=JustWarTheory.com |publisher=JustWarTheory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl]
The Just War tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts: when it is right to resort to armed force (the concern of jus ad bellum) and what is acceptable in using such force (the concern of jus in bello).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eppc.org/publications/pubID.1998/pub_detail.asp |title=Home > Publications > |publisher=Eppc.org |date=1998-09-01 |accessdate=2010-03-16[/tpl] In more recent years, a third category — jus post bellum — has been added, which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals.
Anarcho-capitalist scholar Murray Rothbard stated, "a just war exists when a people tries to ward off the threat of coercive domination by another people, or to overthrow an already-existing domination. A war is unjust, on the other hand, when a people try to impose domination on another people, or try to retain an already existing coercive rule over them."http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard20.html This article is based on the talk given by the late Murray N. Rothbard at the Mises Institute’s Costs of War conference in Atlanta, May 1994. It was published in the book of the same name.

Jonathan Riley-Smith writes,
 
 The consensus among Christians on the use of violence has changed radically since the crusades were fought. The just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries — that violence is an evil which can in certain situations be condoned as the lesser of evils — is relatively young. Although it has inherited some elements (the criteria of legitimate authority, just cause, right intention) from the older war theory that first evolved around A.D. 400, it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars, including crusades: first, that violence could be employed on behalf of Christ's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him; and second, that it was a morally neutral force which drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators.[tpl]cite web |title=Rethinking the Crusades |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center |first=Jonathan R. |last=Smith |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/history/world/wh0042.html[/tpl]

==Criteria of Just War theory==

Just War Theory has two sets of criteria, the first establishing jus ad bellum (the right to go to war), and the second establishing jus in bello (right conduct within war).[tpl]Cite journal | author = Childress, James F. | title = Just-War Theories: The Bases, Interrelations, Priorities, and Functions of Their Criteria | journal = Theological Studies | volume = 39 | year = 1978 | pages = 427–45 | authorlink = James Childress [/tpl]

===Jus ad bellum===

In modern terms, just war is waged in terms of self-defense, or in defense of another (with sufficient evidence).

===Jus in bello===

Once war has begun, just war theory (Jus in bello) also directs how combatants are to act or should act:

In April 1917, two weeks after President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany, Cardinal James Gibbons of Baltimore, the de facto head of the U.S. Catholic church, issued a letter that all Catholics were to support the war.[tpl]cite web|title=Ben Salmon and the Army of Peace |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/ben-salmon-and-army-peace |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |author=John Dear |date=February 23, 2010[/tpl] The Episcopalian bishop of New York, William Manning said the following:
[tpl]quote|If by Pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable, then, however well meant, it is mistaken, and it is hurtful to the life of our country. And the Pacifism which takes the position that because war is evil, therefore all who engage in war, whether for offense or defense, are equally blameworthy, and to be condemned, is not only unreasonable, it is inexcusably unjust.[tpl]cite book|title=A History of the Parish of Trinity Church in the City of New York: The rectorship of Dr. William Thomas Manning 1908 to 1921|author=C.

==Ending a war: Jus post bellum==

In recent years, some theorists, such as Gary Bass, Louis Iasiello and Brian Orend, have proposed a third category within Just War theory. Jus post bellum concerns justice after a war, including peace treaties, reconstruction, war crimes trials, and war reparations. Orend, for instance, proposes the following principles:
