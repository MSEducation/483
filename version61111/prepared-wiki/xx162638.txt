==Career==

In his youth, Porter was part of the Tottenham Hotspur and Southend United set-ups before signing a professional contract with Cambridge United but merely stayed for eight games. He then moved to Bishop's Stortford, where he saw more game time, and his good form for the Blues attracted the attention of Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who signed Porter in May 2007.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnet/6703811.stm | title = Porter leaves Stortford for Bees | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 30 May 2007 | accessdate =27 May 2009 [/tpl] He spent two seasons with Barnet, but in April 2009 he was told he would be released at the end of the season.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11770_5285292,00.html | title = Hendon embarks on overhaul | publisher = Sky Sports | author = James Dall | date = 5 May 2007 | accessdate =27 May 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.barnetfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10431~1638250,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090426153432/http://www.barnetfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10431~1638250,00.html | title = Max Porter released | publisher = Barnet F.C. | author = Dennis Signy | date = 24 April 2007 | archivedate = 26 April 2009[/tpl] In May 2009, Porter signed a one year contract with Conference National side Rushden & Diamonds,[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rushden_and_diamonds/8069873.stm | title = Diamonds sign Downer and Porter | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 27 May 2009 | accessdate =27 May 2009 [/tpl] and played in almost every league game as the Diamonds reached the play-offs.
