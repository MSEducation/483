==The Emigrants series==

Moberg's most famous work is The Emigrants series of four novels written between 1949 and 1959 that describe one Swedish family's migration from Småland to Chisago County, Minnesota in the mid-19th century. This was a destiny shared by almost one million Swedish people, including several of the author's relatives.  These novels have been translated into English: The Emigrants (1951), Unto a Good Land (1954), The Settlers (1961), The Last Letter Home (1961). His literary depiction of the Swedish-American immigrant experience is comparable to O.E. Rolvaag's work depicting the experience of Norwegian-American immigrants.

===Films and musical===

Swedish film director Jan Troell 1971-72 turned the books into two major feature films, The Emigrants and The New Land, starring Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann as Karl Oskar and Kristina, and nominated for several Academy Awards and winner of Golden Globe Awards.
The musical Kristina från Duvemåla (English title Kristina) (1995) by ex-ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson is based on Moberg's The Emigrants Series..Synopsis of Four Novels The Emigrants Series (Jim Colyer Papers by Jim Colyer) http://jimcolyer.com/papers/entry?id=56
