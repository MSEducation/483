==Congress==

On 11 September, the parliamentary election took place. Of 158 congressmen to be elected, 126 congressmen sought re-election but only 56 were re-elected and 102 new congressmen were elected for the first time since democratic election took root in Guatemala. About 65% of MPs were first time representatives, which was the first time this occurred since the 1995 election.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Campaign==

Guatemala's high crime rate was a major issue in the campaign as it sits near the Mexican border that is a conduit for drug traffiking.
Baldizon campaigned on the premise of having Guatemala's football team to the World Cup. Additionally he also promised to tackle poverty and crime, as well as assure workers an extra month's salary every year. He also said he would reinstate the death penalty and televise executions.

==Observers==

Amongst the oberservers for the election were Oscar Almengor, who led a team University of San Carlos.

==Controversies==

According to Article 186(c) of the Constitution, the relatives of the President cannot participate in the Presidential election when the relative holds the Presidency. Sandra Torres, former wife of the current president, got divorced to run for the presidency. There were several requests to have a warrant to forbid Sandra Torres from participating in the election. On 9 August 2011, the Constitutional Court upheld a sentence of the Supreme Court preventing Torres from running.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

==Results==

Former Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez said that "the polling methods are inadequate. They've failed to capture how between 25 and 30 per cent of the people intend to vote."
Preliminary vote counting suggested that Molina has the highest count of the votes, having 37% support with more than 80% of the votes counted.http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/12/us-guatemala-election-idUSTRE78B0KE20110912 Therefore, it is highly likely that none of the presidential candidates will obtain an absolute majority of votes in this election (50% + 1 vote), therefore prompting a run-off election (second round) on 6 November 2011.http://correos.com.gt/web/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=14
On 6 November, Molina declared victory in the election saying that: "For all the Guatemalans who have put their trust in me, I thank you very much. To those Guatemalans who did not vote for Otto Perez, I make a call to unite and to work together in the next four years, leaving aside party colours." Turnout for the runoff was half that of the first round in some regions.http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2011/11/2011117131144103.html

==Analysis==

Molina would be the first former military officer to be democratically elected, which was helped by Guatemala's young population that do not remember the events of the Guatemalan civil war.
