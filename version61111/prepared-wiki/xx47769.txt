In the United States, newspaper proprietors—a role distinct from its owner[tpl]cite book| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=EB4VAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA217| pages= 217-218 | chapter= Ch.

In the 20th century, proprietorship expanded to include ownership of radio and television networks, as well as film studios, publishing houses and more recently internet and other forms of multimedia companies. The term "press baron" was replaced by "media baron", reflecting this and the term "media mogul" was popularized.
