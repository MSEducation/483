The Liberal Democrats is a socially liberal political party in the United Kingdom, supporting constitutional and electoral reform,[tpl]cite web|title=Political Reform|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/political_reform.aspx|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=2 September 2011[/tpl] progressive taxation,[tpl]cite web|last=Cable |first=Vince |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4d45837e-9396-11e0-922e-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Ybc2wsY4 |title=We agree to differ on restoring economy |publisher=Financial Times |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] environmentalism, human rights laws,[tpl]cite news|last=Stratton|first=Allegra|title=Nick Clegg: I will refuse to let human rights laws be weakened|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/25/nick-clegg-human-rights-laws|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2011|location=London[/tpl] banking reform[tpl]cite news|last=Wachman|first=Richard|title=City hits back at Vince Cable over banking reform comments|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/01/city-vince-cable-banking-reforms|accessdate=2 September 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 September 2011|location=London[/tpl] and civil liberties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/civil_liberties.aspx |title=The Liberal Democrats on Civil Liberties |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26[/tpl] The party was formed in 1988 by a merger of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. The two parties had formed the electoral SDP–Liberal Alliance for seven years prior. The Liberals had been in existence for 129 years and in power under leaders such as Gladstone, Asquith and Lloyd George. During these times in government, the Liberals are credited with the Liberal Reforms, which saw the creation of the welfare state. In the 1920s, the Labour Party replaced the Liberals as the largest opponent of the Conservative Party.
Nick Clegg was elected Leader in 2007. At the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats won 57 seats with 23% of the vote, making them the third-largest party in the House of Commons behind the Conservatives with 307 and Labour with 258.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/ | work=BBC News[/tpl] No party having an overall majority, the Liberal Democrats joined a coalition government with the Conservatives, with Clegg becoming Deputy Prime Minister and other Liberal Democrats taking up ministerial positions.[tpl]cite news|work= bbc.co.uk |title= David Cameron is UK's new prime minister |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8675265.stm |accessdate = 2010-05-12 | date=2010-05-12[/tpl]

==Ideology==

The opening line to the preamble of the Liberal Democrats constitution is "The Liberal Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/constitution.aspx |title=Liberal Democrat Federal Constitution |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date= |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] Most commentators describe the party as centrist. In 2011 party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said "But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal."[tpl]cite web|last=Clegg |first=Nick |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/03/government-liberal-politics |title=Full Transcript: Speech to Liberal Democrat spring conference |publisher=NewStatesman |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl]
There are two main strands of distinct ideology within the party, social liberals and the economic liberals, more commonly known as Orange Bookers. The social liberals are seen as being the more traditionally centre-left end of the party with Orange Bookers being more towards the centre. The principal difference between the two is that the Orange Bookers tend to support greater choice and competition and as such aiming to increase social mobility through increasing economic freedom and opportunity for those with more disadvantaged backgrounds. Whereas the social liberals are more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state means. Correspondingly, Orange Bookers tend to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity contrasting with social liberals who would rather see higher spending on the disadvantaged to reduce income inequality.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/debtext/100526-0001.htm#10052612000637 |title=Commons Debates: Government Spending Cuts |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl]
Being an Orange Booker and a social liberal within the party are not mutually exclusives. David Laws, one of the most economically liberal MPs in the party said in Parliament "I am grateful to my Hon. friend for his kind comments about Gladstonian Liberalism. I hope that this is not only Gladstonian Liberalism, but liberalism tinged with the social liberalism about which my party is so passionate."[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100526/debtext/100526-0001.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 26 May 2010 (pt 0001) |publisher=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster |date=26 May 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl] Indeed the Orange Book, to which the term refers, discusses the need for a more complete liberalism for the party, more fully supporting the liberalism as a whole including social liberalism.
The social liberalism in the party stems from the start of the 20th-century when the Liberal party were bringing about many reforms, known as Liberal reforms which are often viewed as the creation of the modern public welfare system in the UK. A major part of creating the liberal welfare reforms was done by David Lloyd George, who later went on to become Prime Minister. They may also often look to William Beveridge who is credited with drafting further advancements of the welfare state and especially the National Health Service (NHS) and also social liberal economist John Maynard Keynes. In February 2009, many social liberals founded an internal party pressure group, the Social Liberal Forum to pursue social liberal policies within the party.
In a poll of Liberal Democrat members on 30 April 2011 64% classed themselves as social liberal with 35% counting themselves as economic liberals. Others high on the list were progressive with 65%, social democrat 34%, 45% centre-left, 60% internationalist, 44% radical, 41% green.How Lib Dem members describe their political identity: 'liberal', 'progressive' and 'social liberal' top the bill, Stephen Tall, Liberal Democrat Voice, 30 April 2011
In December 2011, in a speech to the Demos think tank and the Open Society Foundation Clegg put forward his definition of the three main political traditions in Britain, saying:
 "Socialists support the idea of the good society, typically judged in terms of equality of income. In order to bring about this end they use the state quite aggressively in terms of labour market regulation, centralised public services and through tax and benefits.
 Conservatives support the idea of a big society, with responsibility shared throughout society - people are responsible both for themselves and each other. The emphasis is naturally on non-state institutions such as marriage, the family, churches and voluntary organisations.
The liberal ideal is of the open society, where power is vested in people, not in the state or other institutions. This means that individuals need the capabilities and opportunities to chart their own course through life, and to hold institutions to account. So while the good society needs a strong state, and the big society needs strong social institutions, the open society needs strong citizens."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/latest_news_detail.aspx?title=Deputy_Prime_Minister_speech_to_Demos_and_the_Open_Society_Foundation&pPK=787e3f14-2b05-4a06-9469-1c9306da08e6 |title=Deputy Prime Minister speech to Demos and the Open Society Foundation |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===Founding===

The Liberal Democrats were formed on 3 March 1988 by a merger between the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, which had formed a pact nearly seven years earlier as the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The Liberals descended from the Whigs, Radicals and Peelites, while the SDP were a party created by former Labour members, MPs and cabinet ministers, but also gained defections from Conservatives.[tpl]cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=4&item=history|title =A concise history of the Liberal Parties, SDP and Liberal Democrats|publisher=Liberal Democrat History Group|accessdate =2008-01-28[/tpl]
Having declined to third party status after the rise of the Labour Party from 1918 and especially during the 1920s, the Liberals were challenged for this position in the 1980s when a group of Labour MPs broke away and established the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP and the Liberals realised that there was no space for four political parties and entered into the SDP–Liberal Alliance so that they would not stand against each other in elections. The Alliance was led by David Steel (Liberal) and Roy Jenkins (SDP); Jenkins was replaced by David Owen. The two parties had their own policies and emphases, but produced a joint manifesto for the 1983 and 1987 general elections.
Following disappointing results in the 1987 election, Steel proposed to merge the two parties. Although opposed by Owen, it was supported by a majority of members of both parties, and they formally merged in March 1988, with Steel and Robert Maclennan (who had become SDP leader in August 1987) as joint interim leaders. The new party was initially named Social and Liberal Democrats (SLD) with the unofficial short form The Democrats being used from September 1987.The Alliance: a chronology, 13 April 2009, Mark Pack.org.uk The name was subsequently changed to Liberal Democrats in October 1989, which is frequently shortened to Lib Dems.
A new party logo, the Bird of Liberty, was adopted in 1989. This was famously dismissed by Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister at the time, as being "as dead as John Cleese's parrot".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl]
The minority of the SDP who rejected the merger remained under Owen's leadership in a rump SDP; the minority of the Liberal Party divided, with some retiring from politics immediately and others (led by former Liberal MP Michael Meadowcroft) creating a new 'Liberal Party' that claimed to be the continuation of the Liberal Party which had just dissolved itself. Michael Meadowcroft eventually joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007 but some of his former followers continue still as the Liberal Party, most notably in a couple of electoral wards of the City of Liverpool.

===Post-1988 history===

====Ashdown (1988–99)====

The then-serving Liberal MP Paddy Ashdown was elected leader in July 1988. At the 1989 European Elections, the party received only 6% of the vote, putting them in fourth place after the Green Party. They failed to gain a single Member of the European Parliament at this election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.org.uk/section/1989-figures/european-elections-1989 |title=The European Elections in 1989 | UK Office of the European Parliament |publisher=Europarl.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Over the next three years, the party recovered under Ashdown's leadership. They performed better at the 1990 local elections and in by-elections—including at Eastbourne in 1990, Ribble Valley in 1991 and Kincardine & Deeside in 1991.
The Lib Dems did not reach the share of national votes in the 1990s that the Alliance had achieved in the 1980s. At their first election in 1992 (which ended in a fourth successive Conservative win), they won 17.8% of the vote and twenty seats.[tpl]cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=82|title =Statistics 1990s|publisher =Electoral Reform Society|accessdate =2008-04-13[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] They more than doubled their representation at the 1997 general election, when they gained 46 seats—through tactical voting and concentrating resources in winnable seats.
In the 1994 European Elections, the party gained its first two Members of European Parliament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.org.uk/section/1994-figures/european-elections-1994 |title=The European Elections in 1994 | UK Office of the European Parliament |publisher=Europarl.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
Following the election of Tony Blair as Labour leader in July 1994 after the death of his predecessor John Smith, Ashdown pursued co-operation between the two parties because he wanted to form a coalition government should the next general election end without any party having an overall majority.[tpl]cite news|year =2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/522526.stm|title=Blair considered coalition after 1997|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-23 | date=1999-11-16[/tpl] This Lib-Lab pact failed to form because Labour's massive majority after the 1997 general election made it an irrelevance for Labour, and because Labour were not prepared to consider the  introduction of proportional representation and other Lib Dem conditions. The election was, however, something of a turning point for the Liberal Democrats. They took a smaller share of the vote than at the previous election, but they managed to more than double their representation in parliament.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1997_over.stm |title=Election battles 1997: Blair's landslide |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=30 December 2011[/tpl]

Under Kennedy's leadership the Pro-Euro Conservative Party merged into the Liberal Democrats on the 10th of December 2001.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/10/eu.politics|title=Pro-European Tories join Lib Dems|publisher=The Guardian|date=2001-12-10|last=Glover|first=Julian|accessdate=2014-03-10[/tpl]
At the 2005 general election, the Lib Dems gained their highest share of the vote since the SDP–Liberal Alliance (22%) and won 62 seats. Many had anticipated that this election would be the Lib Dem's breakthrough at Westminster; party activists hoped to better the 25% support of the 1983 election, or to reach 100 MPs. Much of the apparent lack of success resulted from the first-past-the-post electoral system: the party got 22% of the votes nationally but only 10% of the seats in the Commons. Controversy became associated with the campaign when it became known that Michael Brown had donated £2.4 million to the Liberal Democrats. Brown, who lived in Majorca, Spain at the time, was charged in June 2008 with fraud and money laundering and subsequently jumped bail and fled the country.
In November 2008 he was convicted in his absence of thefts amounting to £36 million and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.[ref]

The 2005 election figures revealed a trend of the Lib Dems replaced the Conservatives as Labour's main opponents in urban areas. Many gains came in previously Labour-held urban constituencies (e.g. Manchester Withington, Cardiff Central, Birmingham Yardley), many of which the Conservatives had held in the 1980s, and Lib Dem aspirants had over 100 second-place finishes behind Labour candidates. The British electoral system makes it hard for the Conservatives to form a government without winning some city seats outside of its rural heartlands, such as the Lib Dem Bristol West constituency, where the Conservatives came third in 2005 after holding the seat until 1997.[ref]

In a statement on 5 January 2006, Charles Kennedy admitted to a long battle with alcoholism and announced a leadership election in which he intended to stand for re-election, while Sir Menzies Campbell took over as acting leader.[ref]

For several years rumours had alleged that Kennedy had problems with alcohol—the BBC's Nick Robinson called it "Westminster's worst-kept secret".[ref]

[/ref] Kennedy had on previous occasions denied these rumours, and some suggested that he had deliberately misled the public and his party.

====Campbell (2006–2007)====

Kennedy initially planned to stand as a candidate, but he withdrew from the election citing a lack of support among Lib Dem MPs. Sir Menzies subsequently won the contest, defeating Chris Huhne and Simon Hughes, among others, in a very controversial race. Mark Oaten withdrew from the contest because of revelations about visits to male prostitutes. Simon Hughes came under attack regarding his sexuality while Chris Huhne was accused live on The Daily Politics of attempting to rig polls.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4765710.stm|title =Timeline: Lib Dem election|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-23 | date=2006-03-02[/tpl]
Despite the negative press over Kennedy's departure, the leaderless party won the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election over Labour in February 2006. This result was viewed as a particular blow for Gordon Brown, who lives in the constituency, represents the adjacent seat and featured in Labour's campaign.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4695270.stm|title =Lib Dems deliver blow to Labour|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-23 | date=2006-02-10[/tpl] The party also came second place by 633 votes in the Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, threatening the safe Conservative seat and pushing Labour into fourth place behind the UK Independence Party.[tpl]cite news|year = 2006|url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,9338,-769,00.html|title =Bromley and Chislehurst|publisher =The Guardian|accessdate =2008-03-23 | location=London|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] In July 2007, Sir Menzies announced that the party wished to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20 to 16p per pound—the lowest rate since 1916—and wanted to finance the cut using green taxes and other revenues, including making gains from UK properties owned by non-UK residents eligible for capital gains tax.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6293958.stm|title =Lib Dems plan 4p cut in tax rate|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-01-28 | date=2007-07-12[/tpl]

====Clegg (2007–present)====

On 18 December 2007, Nick Clegg won the leadership election, becoming the party's fourth leader. Clegg won the leadership with a majority of 511 votes (1.2%) over his opponent Chris Huhne, in a poll of party members.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7148367.stm|title =Nick Clegg is new Lib Dem leader|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-02-06 | date=2007-12-18[/tpl] Clegg is the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Hallam, and was an MEP for the East Midlands from 1999 to 2004.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7046587.stm|title =The Nick Clegg story|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-02-06 | date=2007-12-19[/tpl]
In his acceptance speech, Clegg declared that he was "a liberal by temperament, by instinct and by upbringing" and that he believes "Britain is a place of tolerance and pluralism". He claimed that his priorities were defending civil liberties; devolving the running of public services to parents, pupils and patients; and protecting the environment,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7150595.stm|title=Nick Clegg's speech in full|publisher =BBC|accessdate=2007-11-22 | date=2007-12-18[/tpl] and that he wanted to forge a "liberal alternative to the discredited policies of big government". He also proposed a target to double the number of Lib Dem MPs within two elections, and before the 2008 local elections confirmed that he was pleased with their performance in the polls.

Shortly after election, Clegg reshuffled the party's frontbench team, making Chris Huhne the replacement Home Affairs spokesperson, Ed Davey the Foreign Affairs spokesperson, and keeping Vince Cable as Shadow Chancellor.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7153890.stm|title=Clegg reveals his frontbench team|publisher =BBC|accessdate=2008-03-23 | date=2007-12-20[/tpl] His predecessors were also given roles: Campbell joined the all-party Commons foreign affairs select committee, and Kennedy campaigned nationwide on European issues, as president of the European Movement UK.
Political commentators have identified Clegg's leadership as promoting a shift to the radical centre in the Liberal Democrat Party, bringing a little more emphasis on to the economically liberal side of social liberalism.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

===In coalition government (2010–present)===

After the first of three general election debates on 15 April 2010, a ComRes poll put the Liberal Democrats on 24%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/page184332236.aspx |title=ITV News Instant Poll Results 15 April 2010 |publisher=Comres|date= |accessdate=18 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] On 20 April, a YouGov poll put the Liberal Democrats on 34%, the Conservatives on 33% and Labour on 28%.[tpl]cite web|author=Anthony Wells |url=http://www.today.yougov.co.uk/politics/latest-voting-intention-20-april |title=Latest voting intention 20 April 2010 |publisher=YouGov|date= |accessdate=20 April 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
In the general election held on 6 May 2010, the Liberal Democrats won 23% of the vote and 57 seats in the House of Commons. The election returned a hung parliament with no party having an absolute majority. Negotiations between the Lib Dems and the two main parties occurred in the following days. David Cameron became Prime Minister on 11 May after Gordon Brown's resignation and the Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government with the Conservative Party, with Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister and other Liberal Democrats in the cabinet.

According to The Guardian  
 "They lost control of Sheffield council – the city of Clegg's constituency – were ousted from Liverpool, Hull and Stockport, and lost every Manchester seat they stood in. Overall, they got their lowest share of the vote in three decades".
Clegg admitted that the party had taken "big knocks" due to a perception that the coalition government had returned to the Thatcherism of the 1980s.Liberal Democrats Have Taken Big Knocks Says Clegg, Guardian 6 May 2011: guardian.co.uk
As part of the deal that formed the coalition, it was agreed to hold a referendum on the Alternative Vote, in which the Conservatives would campaign for First Past the Post and the Liberal Democrats for Alternative Vote. The referendum, held on 5 May 2011, resulted in First Past the Post being chosen over Alternative Vote by approximately two-thirds of voters.

==Parliamentary party committees==

In mid-2010, after the formation of the coalition, several parliamentary party committees were created to effectively shadow government departments, in order for the party to keep a distinct and separate set of polices to that of the Conservative Party. These committees work together with ministers in order to keep joined up policy and democratic policy making decisions. There must be one co-chair for each of the committees from each House. The list of committees and co chairs as of 23 March 2012 is detailed in the table below:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/co-chairs.aspx |title=Liberal Democrat Co-Chairs |publisher=Libdems.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-15[/tpl]

==Electoral results==

In 1992 General Election, the Lib Dems succeeded the Liberal–SDP Alliance as the 3rd most popular party, behind Labour and the Conservatives. Their popularity initially declined from the levels attained by the Alliance, but their seat count rose, a feat that has been credited to more intelligent targeting of vulnerable seats. The vote percentage for the Alliance in 1987 and the Lib Dems in 2005 is similar, yet the Lib Dems won 62 seats to the Alliance's 22.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/constituencies/default.stm|title =Blair wins historic third term – majority of 66|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-21 | date=2005-09-08[/tpl]
The first-past-the-post electoral system used in UK General Elections is not suited to parties whose vote is evenly divided across the country, resulting in those parties achieving a lower proportion of seats in the Commons than their proportion of the popular vote (see table and graph). The Lib Dems and their Liberal and SDP predecessors have suffered especially,[tpl]cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/votingsystems/systems2.htm|title =Voting Systems|publisher =Electoral Reform Society|accessdate =2008-01-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080120194844/http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/votingsystems/systems2.htm  |archivedate = 2008-01-20[/tpl] particularly in the 1980s when their electoral support was greatest while the disparity between the votes and the number of MPs returned to parliament was significantly large. The increase in their number of seats in 1997, 2001 and 2005 was attributed to the weakness of the Conservatives and the success of their election strategist Lord Rennard.[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/jul/17/uk.liberaldemocrats|title =No rest yet for wily architect of poll triumph|publisher =The Guardian|accessdate =2008-02-18 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Hall | date=2004-07-17[/tpl] Lib Dems state that they want 'three-party politics' in the Commons;[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7284019.stm|title = Expect more protests, says Clegg|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-13 | date=2008-03-08[/tpl] the most realistic chance of power with first past the post is for the party to be the kingmakers in a hung parliament.[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/19/politics.liberaldemocrats|title =If Clegg gets it right in 2008, he could bring the Lib Dems into government|publisher =The Guardian|accessdate =2008-03-23 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Freedland | date=2007-12-19[/tpl] Party leaders often set out their terms for forming a coalition in such an event—Nick Clegg stated in 2008 that the policy for the 2010 general election is to reform elections, parties and Parliament in a "constitutional convention".[tpl]cite news|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/mar/10/liberaldemocrats.nickclegg|title =Clegg's terms for deal in hung parliament|publisher =The Guardian|accessdate =2008-03-15 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Sparrow | date=2008-03-10[/tpl]

In council elections held in May 2011, the Liberal Democrats suffered heavy defeats in the Midlands, North and Scotland. They also lost heavily in the Welsh assembly and Scottish Parliament. In local elections held in May 2012, the Lib Dems lost more than 300 councillors, leaving them with fewer than 3000 for the first time in the party's history. In the 2013 local elections, they lost more councillors.

===European elections===

The party has generally not performed as well in elections to the European Parliament. In the 2004 local elections, their share of the vote was 29% (placing them second, ahead of Labour)[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3797049.stm|title =Lib Dems hail three-party contest|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-21 | date=2004-06-11[/tpl] and 14.9% in the simultaneous European Parliament elections (putting them in fourth place behind UK Independence Party (UKIP)).[tpl]cite news|year =2004|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2004/vote_2004/|title =Vote 2004|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-21 | date=2007-08-15[/tpl]  The results of the 2009 European elections were similar with the party achieving a vote of 28% in the county council elections yet achieving only 13.7% in the Europeans despite the elections taking place on the same day.  The 2009 elections did however see the party gain one seat from UKIP in the East Midlands region taking the number of representatives in the parliament up to 11.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/euro/09/html/ukregion_31.stm|title=European Election 2009: East Midlands|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2009-06-08 | date=2009-04-19[/tpl]

===Scottish Parliament elections===

The first elections for the Scottish parliament were held in 1999 and resulted in the Liberal Democrats forming a coalition government with Labour from its establishment until 2007.[tpl]cite web|year =2007|url =http://www.institute-of-governance.org/onlinepub/election2007_devolutionofage.html|title =Election 2007 – Devolution Come of Age?|publisher =Institute of Governance|accessdate =2008-03-21[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace became Deputy First Minister, a role he continued until his retirement as party leader in 2005.

For the first three Scottish Parliament elections, the Lib Dems maintained a consistent number of MSPs. From the 17 elected in 1999, they retained this number in 2003 and went down one to 16 in 2007.[tpl]cite web|year=2007|url=http://election.theherald.co.uk/results/|title=Holyrood Results|publisher=The Herald|accessdate =2008-05-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423095338/http://election.theherald.co.uk/results/  |archivedate = 2008-04-23[/tpl] However, this fell to only 5 seats after the 2011 election as a result of the widespread unpopularity of their coalition with the Conservative party at the UK level.
The current leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats is the MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, Willie Rennie, who took up his role in 2011.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-13411906 | work=BBC News | title=Willie Rennie named new Scottish Lib Dem leader | date=2011-05-17[/tpl]

===Welsh Assembly elections===

Elections to the newly created National Assembly for Wales also took place for the first time in 1999 and saw the Liberal Democrats take six seats in the inaugural Assembly, with Welsh Labour winning a plurality of seats in the assembly, but not enough to win an outright majority. In October 2000, following a series of close votes, the parties formed a coalition that saw the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, Michael German, become the Deputy First Minister.[tpl]cite news|year=2000|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/oct/16/wales.devolution |title=Lib Dems agree Welsh Assembly power deal|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-06-09 | location=London | first=Geoffrey | last=Gibbs | date=2001-03-21[/tpl]  The deal lasted until the election of 2003, when Labour won enough seats to be able to govern outright.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3007665.stm|title=Morgan pledges to govern alone|publisher=BBC|accessdate =2008-03-21 | date=2003-05-07[/tpl]
The Party has polled consistently in all four elections to the National Assembly, returning six representatives in the first three elections and five in the 2011 Election, thereby establishing itself as the fourth party in Wales behind Labour, the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. The current leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats is Kirsty Williams, the assembly member for Brecon & Radnorshire, the Assembly's first female leader.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7771745.stm|title=Williams election breaks mould|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-06-09 | date=2008-12-08[/tpl]

==Structure==

The Liberal Democrats are a federal party of the parties of England, Scotland and Wales. The English and Scottish parties are further split into regions. The parliamentary parties of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly form semi-autonomous units within the party. The leaders in the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament are the leaders of the federal party and the Scottish Party; the leaders in the other two chambers, and the officers of all parliamentary parties, are elected from their own number. Co-ordination of all party activities across all federated groups is undertaken through the Federal Executive. Chaired by the party leader, its 30+ members includes representatives from each of the groups and democratically elected representatives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/party_organisations_detail.aspx?title=Federal_Executive&pPK=8dae9f78-9643-4cbd-a41e-1d3e37521826|title=Federal Executive|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=2010-05-10[/tpl]
The Lib Dems had around 65,000 members at the end of 2010 and in the first quarter of 2008, the party received £1.1 million in donations and have total borrowings and unused credit facilities of £1.1 million (the "total debt" figure reported by the Electoral Commission includes, for example, unused overdraft facilities). This compares to Labour's £3.1 million in donations and £17.8 million of borrowing/credit facilities, and the Conservatives' £5.7 million in donations and £12.1 million of borrowing/credit facilities.[tpl]cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/new-figures-published-showing-political-parties-donations-and-borrowings|title =New figures published showing political parties' donations and borrowing|publisher =Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|accessdate =2008-09-22[/tpl]

Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems organise in Northern Ireland, though they do not contest elections in the province: they work with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, de facto agreeing to support the Alliance in elections.[tpl]cite news|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1545103.stm|title =Alliance Party faces uphill battle|publisher =BBC|accessdate =2008-03-21 | date=2001-09-14[/tpl] There is a separate local party operating in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Liberal Democrats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/41338619 |title=Scribd |publisher=Scribd |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Several individuals, including Alliance Party leader David Ford, hold membership of both parties. Alliance members of the House of Lords take the Lib Dem whip on non-Northern Ireland issues, and the Alliance Party usually has a stall at Lib Dem party conferences.
The party is a member of Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, and their 11 MEPs sit in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group in the European Parliament.
