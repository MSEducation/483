CATEGORIES: Sports magazines

Guantes is the name of a Spanish language boxing magazine that is produced from Panama.
For years, the magazine's editor has been the well-known writer Chu Romero. Guantes covers news from the boxing world, but it concentrates on hispanic boxing news.
Guantes had top competition from Ring En Espa√±ol. But that magazine stopped production in 1985.
Guantes holds yearly award ceremonies to reward reigning world boxing champions at the end of each year. These ceremonies have usually been celebrated at New York's restaurant, Victor's Cafe. Many corporate giants have sponsored the event: for many years, the event was called the Timex|Guantes awards, other times, the Roblex|Guantes award and so on.
The magazine's name, Guantes, means gloves in Spanish.
