==Etymology==

The word queue comes, via French, from the Latin cauda, meaning tail.  The spelling "queueing" over "queuing" is typically encountered in the academic research field.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] One of the flagship journals of the research area is named Queueing Systems.

==Single queueing nodes==

Single queueing nodes are usually described using Kendall's notation in the form A/S/C where A describes the time between arrivals to the queue, S the size of jobs and C the number of servers at the node.Tijms, H.C, ''Algorithmic Analysis of Queues", Chapter 9 in  A First Course in Stochastic Models, Wiley, Chichester, 2003[tpl]cite doi|10.1214/aoms/1177728975[/tpl] Many theorems in queue theory can be proved by reducing queues to mathematical systems known as Markov chains, first described by Andrey Markov in his 1906 paper.[ref]A.A. Markov, Extension of the law of large numbers to dependent quantities, Izvestiia Fiz.-Matem. Obsch. Kazan Univ., (2nd Ser.), 15(1906), pp. 135–156 [Also 37, pp.
339–361].[/ref]
Agner Krarup Erlang, a Danish engineer who worked for the Copenhagen Telephone Exchange, published the first paper on what would now be called queueing theory in 1909.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pass.maths.org.uk/issue2/erlang/index.html |title=Agner Krarup Erlang (1878 - 1929) | plus.maths.org |publisher=Pass.maths.org.uk |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s11134-009-9151-8[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | title = The theory of probabilities and telephone conversations | journal = Nyt Tidsskrift for Matematik B | volume = 20 | pages = 33–39 | url = http://oldwww.com.dtu.dk/teletraffic/erlangbook/pps131-137.pdf | year = 1909[/tpl] He modeled the number of telephone calls arriving at an exchange by a Poisson process and solved the M/D/1 queue in 1917 and M/D/k queueing model in 1920.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s11134-009-9147-4[/tpl] In Kendall's notation
The M/M/1 queue is a simple model where a single server serves jobs that arrive according to a Poisson process and have exponentially distributed service requirements. In an M/G/1 queue the G stands for general and indicates an arbitrary probability distribution. The M/G/1 model was solved by Felix Pollaczek in 1930, a solution later recast in probabilistic terms by Aleksandr Khinchin and now known as the Pollaczek–Khinchine formula. After World War II queueing theory became an area of research interest to mathematicians.[tpl]cite doi|10.1287/opre.50.1.227.17792[/tpl]
Work on queueing theory used in modern packet switching networks was performed in the early 1960s by Leonard Kleinrock. It was in this period that John Little gave a proof of the formula which now bears his name: Little's law.[tpl]cite doi|10.1287/opre.9.3.383[/tpl] In 1961 John Kingman gave a formula for the mean waiting time in a G/G/1 queue: Kingman's formula.[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S0305004100036094[/tpl]
The matrix geometric method and matrix analytic methods have allowed queues with phase-type distributed interarrival and service time distributions to be considered.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/15326348808807077[/tpl]
Problems such as performance metrics for the M/G/k queue remain an open problem.

==Service disciplines==

Various scheduling policies can be used at queuing nodes:

==Queueing networks==

Networks of queues are systems in which a number of queues are connected by customer routing. When a customer is serviced at one node it can join another node and queue for service, or leave the network. For a network of m the state of the system can be described by an m–dimensional vector (x1,x2,...,xm) where xi represents the number of customers at each node. The first significant results in this area were Jackson networks,[tpl]cite doi|10.1287/opre.5.4.518[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Jobshop-like Queueing Systems|first=James R.|last=Jackson|journal=Management Science|volume=10|number=1|date=Oct 1963|pages=131–142|doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0268|jstor=2627213[/tpl] for which an efficient product-form stationary distribution exists and the mean value analysis[tpl]cite doi|10.1145/322186.322195[/tpl] which allows average metrics such as throughput and sojourn times to be computed.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0169-7552(93)90073-D[/tpl]
If the total number of customers in the network remains constant the network is called a closed network and has also been shown to have a product–form stationary distribution in the Gordon–Newell theorem.[tpl]cite doi|10.1287/opre.15.2.254[/tpl] This result was extended to the BCMP network[tpl]Cite journal | last = Baskett | first = F. | author-link = | last2 = Chandy | first2 = K. Mani | author2-link = K. Mani Chandy | last3 = Muntz | first3 = R.R. | last4 = Palacios | first4 = F.G. | title = Open, closed and mixed networks of queues with different classes of customers | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–260 | year = 1975 | doi = 10.1145/321879.321887 [/tpl] where a network with very general service time, regimes and customer routing is shown to also exhibit a product-form stationary distribution.
Networks of customers have also been investigated, Kelly networks where customers of different classes experience different priority levels at different service nodes.[tpl]cite jstor|3212869[/tpl]
Another type of network are G-networks first proposed by Erol Gelenbe in 1993:[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3214781 | title = G-Networks with Triggered Customer Movement | first = Erol | last = Gelenbe | authorlink = Erol Gelenbe | journal = Journal of Applied Probability | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | date = Sep 1993 | pages = 742–748 | jstor = 3214781 [/tpl] these networks do not assume exponential time distributions like the classic Jackson Network.

==Mean field limits==

Mean field models consider the limiting behaviour of the empirical measure (proportion of queues in different states) as the number of queues (m above) goes to infinity. The impact of other queues on any given queue in the network is approximated by a differential equation. The deterministic model converges to the same stationary distribution as the original model.[tpl]cite doi|10.1109/QEST.2008.47[/tpl]

==Fluid limits==

Fluid models are continuous deterministic analogs of queueing networks obtained by taking the limit when the process is scaled in time and space, allowing heterogeneous objects. This scaled trajectory converges to a deterministic equation which allows us stability of the system to be proven. It is known that a queueing network can be stable, but have an unstable fluid limit.[tpl]cite doi|10.1214/aoap/1029962815[/tpl]

==Heavy traffic/diffusion approximations==

In a system with high occupancy rates (utilisation near 1) a heavy traffic approximation can be used to approximate the queueing length process by a reflected Brownian motion,[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/BF01149260[/tpl] Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process or more general diffusion process.[tpl]cite doi|10.1214/aoap/1177004602[/tpl] The number of dimensions of the RBM is equal to the number of queueing nodes and the diffusion is restricted to the non-negative orthant.
