Yuen Long District ([tpl]zh|t=元朗區[/tpl], Jyutping: jyun4 long5, pinyin: Yuánlǎng, formerly known as Un Long) is one of the districts of Hong Kong. Located in the northwest of the New Territories, it had a population of 449,070 in 2001. The district has the youngest population of Hong Kong.

==Geography==

Yuen Long District contains the largest alluvial plain in Hong Kong, the Yuen Long-Kam Tin plain. With an area of 144 km², the district covers many traditional villages including Ping Shan Heung, Ha Tsuen Heung, Kam Tin Heung, Pat Heung, San Tin Heung and Shap Pat Heung, as well as Yuen Long Town and Tin Shui Wai.
Two new towns have been developed within this district. Yuen Long New Town was developed from the traditional market town of Yuen Long Town from the late 1970s. Tin Shui Wai New Town has developed since the early 1990s, and is built on land reclaimed from former fish ponds once common in the district.

==History==

Since the Tang Dynasty, the Tang's clan has been living in Pat Heung. Like Tai Po, Yuen Long used to be a traditional market town.

===Hong Kong Wetland Park===

Hong Kong Wetland Park (香港濕地公園) is located at the northern part of Tin Shui Wai. It was intended to be an ecological mitigation area (EMA) for the wetlands lost due to Tin Shui Wai New Town development. In 1998, a project named as "International Wetland Park and Visitor Centre Feasibility Study" was initiated by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Hong Kong Tourism Board with a view to expanding the EMA to a wetland ecotourism attraction. After concluding that it was feasible to develop a wetland park at the EMA site without compromising its intended ecological mitigation functions and the development of the Wetland Park will also enhance the ecological function of the EMA to a world-class conservation, education and tourism facility, the concerned parties started the Wetland Park Project, which is regarded as one of the Millennium projects by the Administrations.

===Kat Hing Wai===

Kat Hing Wai (吉慶圍) in Kam Tin is one of the District's best-known walled villages. It is the ancestral home of the Tangs, one of the "Five Great Clans" in the territory. Built by the Tangs 500 years ago, it is a rectangular walled village with an area of 100 metres by 90 metres. As a family stronghold, Kat Hing Wai has served the Tangs well through centuries. In the Qing Dynasty, a five metre high blue brick wall and four cannon towers were added to defend bandits.

It is a fine example of traditional Chinese dwellings of the scholar-gentry class and is certainly one of the most elegant buildings throughout the territory.

===Tai Lam Country Park===

Tai Lam Country Park is at the west of New Territory with an area of 54 km². Tai Lam has a small area of porphyry in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly erodible decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the water catchment area. In spite of the poor soil conditions and the setbacks of fire damage over the years, mature stands of Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii and Eucalyptus species now cover most of the area. In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.

Entering into the 2004, development in Yuen Long has been carried out very rapidly. The West Rail project and other major infrastructural projects have all changed the face of Yuen Long from an old market town into a vibrant and dynamic district.
