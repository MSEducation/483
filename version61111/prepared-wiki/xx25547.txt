==History==

===Founding, expansion, and tradition===

The Mississippi Legislature chartered the University of Mississippi on February 24, 1844.  The university opened its doors to its first class of 80 students four years later in 1848.  For 23 years, the university was Mississippi's only public institution of higher learning, and for 110 years it was the state's only comprehensive university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/info/history.html |title=The University of Mississippi - History |publisher=Olemiss.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl]
When the university opened, the campus consisted of only six buildings: two dormitories, two faculty houses, a steward’s hall, and the Lyceum at the center.  Constructed from 1846 to 1848, the Lyceum is the oldest building on campus.  Originally, the Lyceum housed all of the classrooms and faculty offices of the university.  The building’s north and south wings were added in 1903, and the Class of 1927 donated the clock above the eastern portico.  The Lyceum is now the home of the university's administration offices.  The columned facade of the Lyceum is represented on the official crest of the university, along with the date of establishment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olemiss.edu/tours/lm-text.html |title=Virtual Tours - The University of Mississippi |publisher=Olemiss.edu |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl]
In 1854, the university established the fourth state-supported, public law school in the United States and began offering engineering education.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_law_schools_in_the_United_States |title=List of law schools in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engineering.olemiss.edu/about/index.html |title=School of Engineering • About Us |publisher=Engineering.olemiss.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl]
With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, classes were interrupted when the entire student body from the University of Mississippi enlisted in the Confederate army. Their company, Company A, 11th Mississippi Infantry, was nicknamed the University Greys, and suffered a 100% casualty rate during the Civil War.11th Mississippi Infantry: A Brief History" by Steven Davis http://faculty.swosu.edu/scott.long/11thmiss/homepage/history.htm A great number of those casualties occurred during Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, when the University Greys made the deepest encroachment into Union territory. Some of the soldiers actually crossed the Union defensive fortification wall, only to be killed, wounded or captured. On the very next day, July 4, Confederate forces surrendered at Vicksburg, Mississippi; the two battles together are commonly viewed as the turning point in the war.  When Ole Miss re-opened, only one member of the University Greys was able to visit the university to address the student body.
The Lyceum was used as a hospital during the Civil War for both Union and Confederate soldiers, especially those who were wounded at the battle of Shiloh.  Two hundred and fifty soldiers who died in the campus hospital were buried in a cemetery on the grounds of the university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=Confederate+Cemetery&hl=en&cid=1000215249802079370 |title=Confederate Cemetery - About - Google |publisher=Maps.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl]http://www.civilwarcenter.olemiss.edu/cemeteries_csa.html

The student yearbook was published for the first time in 1897.  A committee was formed to suggest names suitable for the new annual.  Elma Meek, a student at the time, suggested "Ole Miss."   Meek took the name from the language of slaves on the Ante-bellum plantation who would refer to the owner's wife as "Ole Miss" The Mississippian, May 13, 1939, "Ole Miss Takes Its Name From Darky Dialect, Not Abbreviation of State"[tpl]cite book |first=J.

The university began medical education in 1903, when the University of Mississippi School of Medicine was established on the parent campus in Oxford.  In that era, the university only provided two-year pre-clinical education certificates, and graduates went out of state to complete their doctor of medicine degrees.  In 1950, the Mississippi Legislature voted to create a four-year medical school.  On July 1, 1955, the University Medical Center opened in Jackson, Mississippi, as a four-year medical school.  In 1955, the University of Mississippi School of Medicine  moved to Jackson where its curriculum was expanded to four years in the brand-new Medical Center.  The University of Mississippi Medical Center, as it is now called, is the health sciences campus of the University of Mississippi and houses the University of Mississippi School of Medicine along with five other health science schools: nursing, dentistry, health related professions, graduate studies and pharmacy. (The School of Pharmacy is headquartered on the Oxford campus)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu/medical_center/overview.html |title=Overview - University of Mississippi Medical Center |publisher=Umc.edu |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2012-12-14[/tpl]
During the 1930s, an attempt by Mississippi Governor Theodore G. Bilbo to move The University of Mississippi to Jackson, was prevented by then Chancellor Alfred Hume by giving Mississippi legislators a grand tour of Ole Miss and the surrounding city of Oxford. It so impressed the legislators that the move was defeated.

===Integration of 1962 and legacy===

Desegregation came to Ole Miss in the early 1960s with the activities of United States Air Force veteran James Meredith from Kosciusko, Mississippi.  Even Meredith's initial efforts required great courage. All involved knew how violently Dr. William David McCain and the white political establishment of Mississippi had recently reacted to similar efforts by Clyde Kennard to enroll at Mississippi Southern College (now the University of Southern Mississippi).The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund by William H.

Meredith won a lawsuit that allowed him admission to The University of Mississippi in September 1962. He attempted to enter campus on September 20, September 25, and again on September 26,[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] only to be blocked by Mississippi Governor Ross R. Barnett, who proclaimed that "...No school in our state will be integrated while I am your Governor. I shall do everything in my power to prevent integration in our schools."[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
After the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held both Barnett and Lieutenant Governor Paul B. Johnson, Jr. in contempt with fines of more than $10,000 for each day they refused to allow Meredith to enroll,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/07/obituaries/ross-barnett-segregationist-dies-governor-of-mississippi-in-1960-s.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Ross Barnett, Segregationist, Dies; Governor of Mississippi in 1960's | date=November 7, 1987 | accessdate=May 27, 2010[/tpl] Meredith, escorted by a force of U.S. Marshals, entered the campus on September 30, 1962.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Segregationists had gathered and rioted at the school; there were more people from around the South than students. Thousands of students, residents from the surrounding area and many from out of state, many armed, were involved.  Many Mississippi citizens joined in on "their battle against 'Catholic, Communist, Northern'" intervention in Mississippi white people's business. The protesters swarmed the campus in a violent effort to prevent Meredith's enrollment and enforce segregationist laws of Mississippi at the time.
Two people were killed by gunfire during the riot, a French journalist, Paul Guihard and an Oxford repairman, Ray Gunter.[tpl]cite book|last=Doyle|first=William|title=An American Insurrection|year=2001|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0385499699|page=215[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=The Civil Rights Movement: Struggle and Resistance |author=Riches, William T.

After control was re-established by federal forces, Meredith, thanks to the protection afforded by federal marshals, was able to enroll and attend his first class on October 1. Following the riot, elements of an Army National Guard division were stationed in Oxford to prevent future similar violence. While most Ole Miss students did not riot prior to his official enrollment in the university, many harassed Meredith during his first two semesters on campus.
According to first person accounts chronicled in Nadine Cohodas's book The Band Played Dixie, students living in Meredith's dorm bounced basketballs on the floor just above his room through all hours of the night. When Meredith walked into the cafeteria for meals, the students eating would all turn their backs. If Meredith sat at a table with other students, all of whom were white, the students would immediately get up and go to another table.  Many of these events are featured in the 2012 ESPN documentary film "The Ghosts of Ole Miss"
In 2002 the university marked the 40th anniversary of integration with a year-long series of events.  It was entitled, " Open Doors: Building on 40 Years of Opportunity in Higher Education, and included an oral history of Ole Miss, various symposiums, the April unveiling of a $130,000 memorial and a reunion of the federal marshals. It culminated in September 2003 with an international conference on race." That year 13% of the student body was African American, and Meredith's son Joseph graduated as the top doctoral student at the School of Business Administration.[tpl]cite web | author= Shelia Hardwell Byrd |title = Meredith ready to move on | work = Associated Press, at Athens Banner-Herald (OnlineAthens) | url = http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/092102/new_20020921041.shtml | date= 21 September 2002 |accessdate = 2007-10-02 [/tpl]

The tradition of Greek life on the Oxford campus is a deep-seated one. In fact, the first fraternity founded in the South was the W.W.W. (or Rainbow Society), founded at Ole Miss in 1848. The fraternity merged with Delta Tau Delta in 1886.The New York Times: Two secret societies united, Delta Tau Delta and the Rainbow Society join hands; Published March 28, 1885; Accessed December 08, 2007 Delta Kappa Epsilon followed shortly after at Ole Miss in 1850, as the first to have a house on campus in Mississippi. Delta Gamma Women's Fraternity was founded in 1873 at the Lewis School for Girls in nearby Oxford. All Greek life at Ole Miss was suspended from 1912 to 1926 due to statewide anti-fraternity legislation.Lee Maurice Russell: Fortieth Governor of Mississippi: 1920-1924
Today, sorority chapters are very large, with many boasting of around 300 + active members. Recruitment is fiercely competitive and potential sorority members are encouraged to secure personal recommendations from Ole Miss sorority alumnae in order to increase the chances of receiving an invitation to join one of the 9 NPC sororities on campus.  Fraternity recruitment is also fierce with only 14 active IFC Fraternity chapters on campus.
In 2014, the Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter of the University of Mississippi was closed after three of its members were accused of draping a noose around the statute of James Meredith, the first black student to attend the university.
