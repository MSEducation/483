==Design and development==

The A-36 is a development of the Aeroprakt A-26 Vulcan. The design goals for the A-36 include operations over hostile terrain, the ability to take-off and land with only one engine running and the ability to operate from short runways. The resulting design features a strut-braced high-wing, T-tail, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed conventional landing gear with wheel pants and twin engines in pusher configuration.
The aircraft is of mixed construction, with the forward fuselage made from fibreglass and the tail cone from aluminum sheet. The wings and tail are aluminum, while the main landing gear legs, engine cowlings and fairings are fibreglass. Its [tpl]convert|11.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on[/tpl] span wing has an area of [tpl]convert|15.7|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl] and mounts flaps. The standard engines used are the [tpl]convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Rotax 912S four-stroke powerplant.
The A-36 has an empty weight of [tpl]convert|450|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and a gross weight of [tpl]convert|750|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], giving a useful load of [tpl]convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].
