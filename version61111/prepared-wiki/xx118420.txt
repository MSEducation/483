==Work==

"The Sixties: Photographs” is a  point of reference for Acid culture, Summer of Love, Rock, and Flower Power generation.Limnios, Michalis. Novemeber 12, 2012. Blues GR Website Blog. http://blues.gr/profiles/blogs/photographer-robert-altman-talks-about-his-amazing-career-the This collection of photographs portrays iconic musicians, celebrities, rock stars and fans together. Altman’s work captures the free flow atmosphere of this 1960’s time period. His exploration in this collection book compliments WoodStock, and all the unique, emotion that it consisted of.
Such photographs are of documented live footage of audiences explorations of themselves and being free-spirited individuals.  The themes of summer love are heavily implied through the “oneness” each individual feels. The connections between fans to their favourite performer illustrates the significance of Woodstock as a milestone in history.
Altman’s work consists of presenting what is bare, raw, and natural to the viewer. The 1960’s was a decade filled with protest, revolutionary ideologies, and freedom. His style of work presents experience. The livelihood of the Hippie Movement displayed simply through the photographic composition that Altman has learned from Ansel Adams.InfoPlease Database http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/anseladams.html
The most prominent rule of composition that defines Robert Altman’s art in photography is his perspective. The angles that are staged to capture moments are what signifies Altman’s work and influence as successful.
The camera is the viewer’s eyes. They connect the viewer with the subjects, and build a relationship off of that. 

==Personal Views==

When asked to compare today’s society with the 1960’s, Altman replies:
“ Knowing that it's not really fair to compare the 60s with today I'll attempt to address this most natural of questions.
The similarities?
Well, youth is youth and youth will always be idealistic, restless and hopefully enthusiastic. In the United States during the 60s, and that includes the early 70s, there was one major difference confronting young men ... and that was the military draft was imposed on us. That meant that one could be yanked out of one's peaceful life and placed in harm's way 6000 miles from home. Unless you've lived that, unless you've felt that all pervasive fear in your core in your stomach, you can only imagine it's impact. That was the wedge and the major driving force which fueled the antiwar movement to a nuclear degree in the 60’s.”
