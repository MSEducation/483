Pasquale Ottino (Verona, 1578 – Verona, 1630) was an Italian painter.

==Biography==

Ottino was a pupil, alongside Alessandro Turchi, in the studio of Felice Brusasorci. After the master's death in 1605, he completed alongside Turchi the large canvas depicting Fall of Manna in the church of San Giorgio in Braida in Verona, left unfinished on the master’s death in 1605. His early works attest to the decidedly Mannerist character of the initial phase of his career. The sources indicate fairly constant activity in his hometown, even though there are still some doubts as to the reconstruction of his artistic career, especially incongruities regarding a trip to Rome that may have taken place with his companions Turchi and Marcantonio Bassetti around 1615.Le vite de' pittori, degli scultori, et architetti veronesi, by Bartolomeo Dal Pozzo (1718), page 167. He died of plague in Verona in 1630.
