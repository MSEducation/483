</ref> using material grown by Heim from specimens collected by the Wassons, identified the [[chemical structure]] of the active [[Chemical compound|compounds]], [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]]. Hofmann and Wasson were also among the first Westerners to collect specimens of the Mazatec hallucinogen ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'', though these specimens were later deemed not suitable for rigorous scientific study or [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic classification]].<ref>http://www.sagewisdom.org/salviahistory.html</ref> Two species of mushroom, ''Psilocybe wassonii'' R.Heim and ''Psilocybe wassoniorum'' Guzman & S.H.Pollock, were named in honor of Wasson by Heim and [[Gastón Guzmán]], the latter of whom Wasson met during an expedition to [[Huautla de Jiménez]] in 1957.
Wasson's next major contribution was a study of the ancient Vedic intoxicant soma, which he proposed was based on the psychoactive fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) mushroom. This hypothesis was published in 1967 under the title Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality. His attention then turned to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony of the ancient Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone. In The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries (1978), co-authored with Albert Hofmann and Carl A. P. Ruck, it was proposed that the special potion "kykeon", a pivotal component of the ceremony, contained psychoactive ergoline alkaloids from the fungus Ergot (Claviceps spp.).
His last completed work, The Wondrous Mushroom, will be republished by City Lights Publishers in 2014.http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=87286100587160&fa=details According to the Barnes and Noble digital catalog, however, it is slated for a release date of December 2013.

==Ethnography==

Prior to his work on soma, theologians had interpreted the Vedic and Magian practices to have been based on alcoholic beverages that produced inebriation.  Wasson was the first researcher to propose that the actual form of Vedic intoxication was entheogenic.
