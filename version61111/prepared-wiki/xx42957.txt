==Early life==

Walters was born and raised in the south-west London district of Mitcham, to a British Jamaican family. He was blinded in the right eye by broken glass as an infant, and has worn an eyepatch ever since.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p97|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Slick Rick Biography |accessdate=2008-05-24 |first=John |last= Bush |work=allmusic |publisher=Macrovision Corporation[/tpl] He and his family moved to The Bronx in 1977. As a child, he met Dana Dane, with whom he later formed a hip hop duo known as the Kangol Crew.

==Initial fame==

Walters first gained success in the rap industry after joining Doug E. Fresh's Get Fresh Crew, using the stage name MC Ricky D. He was featured on the single "The Show" and its even more popular B-side, "La Di Da Di".  La Di Da Di featured Walters' rapping over Doug E. Fresh's beatbox.  Both tracks gained some mainstream attention.  In 1988 Walters' solo debut The Great Adventures of Slick Rick came out on Def Jam Records.  The album was very successful, reaching the #1 spot on Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s R&B/Hip-Hop chart.  It also featured three charting singles: "Children's Story", "Hey Young World", and "Teenage Love".

==Incarceration and subsequent albums==

In 1990, Walters shot his cousin, Mark Plummer, and a bystander. Plummer had previously been Walters' bodyguard and later admitted to having Walters shot outside a club. Walters was indicted on two counts of attempted murder and pled guilty to all charges, which included assault, use of a firearm, and criminal possession of a weapon. He spent five years in prison, two for the then second degree attempted murder charges he received for the shooting, and three for his struggle with the Immigration and Naturalization Services over his residency in the US. He was bailed out by Russell Simmons, head of Def Jam Records.
After being bailed out Walters recorded his second album, The Ruler's Back.  The album got mixed reviews and wasn't as commercially successful as his debut. In the documentary film, The Show, Russell Simmons interviewed Walters while he was imprisoned on Rikers Island.[tpl]cite web|title=Slick Rick Interview|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1shUovH_hao&feature=related|work="The Show"|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2012-03-18[/tpl] 
Walters' third studio album Behind Bars was released in 1994, while he was still incarcerated. It was met with lukewarm sales and reviews. He was released from prison in 1996.
Walters remained with the Def Jam label, and on May 25, 1999, released a fourth album entitled The Art of Storytelling. Generally considered the authentic follow up to his 1988 debut, The Art of Storytelling was an artistically successful comeback album that paired him with prolific MCs like Nas, OutKast, Raekwon, and Snoop Dogg among others.

==Subsequent legal issues==

After performing on a Caribbean cruise ship in June 2001, Walters was arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as he re-entered the United States through Florida. He was promptly told that he was being deported under a law allowing deportation of foreigners convicted of felonies.  Rick was continuously refused bail, but after 17 months in prison he was released on November 7, 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480288/20031107/story.jhtml |title=The Great Adventures Can Resume: Slick Rick Is A Free Man |accessdate=2008-05-24 |first=Joseph |last=Patel |date=2003-11-07 |work=MTV.com[/tpl] In October 2006, the Department of Homeland Security began a new attempt to deport Walters back to England,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/10/slick_rick_facing_deportation_again/ |title=Slick Rick Facing Deportation, Again |accessdate=2008-05-24 |first=Alexis |last=Jeffries |date=18 October 2006 |work=Vibe |publisher=Vibe Media Group, Inc[/tpl] moving the case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit based in New York to the more conservative Eleventh Circuit. The court is based in Atlanta, Georgia but the trial was expected to proceed in Florida, where immigration agents originally arrested Walters.
On May 23, 2008, New York Governor David Paterson granted Slick Rick a full and unconditional pardon on the attempted murder charges.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=202932 |title=NY governor pardons rapper 'Slick Rick' Walters |accessdate=2008-05-25 |author=Associated Press |date=2008-05-24 |work= Telegraph Herald| location= Dubuque, Iowa[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] The governor was pleased with his behavior since the mishap.

The opening track on Jay-Z's Blueprint album is a cover of Slick Rick's "The Ruler's Back" and borrows heavily from the original lyrics.

==Honors==

On October 6, 2008, Rick was honoured on the VH1 Hip Hop Honors show.

==Rapping style==

Slick Rick’s style is commended by music critics. Music journalist Peter Shapiro says, “'Children's Story' was important because of its narrative structure and Rick’s understanding of how crucial little sonic details—such as his use of a female voice and his yawning rap—were to hip hop style.”Shapiro, Peter. The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, 2005, p.336.
He is largely known for his story raps, such as ‘Children’s Story’ and ‘La Di Da Di'. Shapiro writes that he "largely introduced the art of narrative into hip hop… none of the spinners of picaresque rhymes who followed did it with the same grace or humor.”Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 337. Allmusic states that he has the “reputation as hip hop's greatest storyteller.” In the book Check the Technique, Slick Rick says, “I was never the type to say freestyle raps, I usually tell a story, and to do that well I’ve always had to work things out beforehand.”Coleman, Brian. Check The Technique: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 319. Kool Moe Dee comments, “Slick Rick raised the lost art of hip hop storytelling to a level never seen again.”Kool Moe Dee. There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2003, p.63. Devin the Dude notes that Slick Rick’s ‘Indian Girl’ is a good example of the type of humor that existed in hip hop’s golden era,Edwards, Paul. How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 39. and Peter Shapiro says that “he was funnier than Rudy Ray Moore or Redd Foxx.”
Slick Rick uses very clear enunciation and raps with the “Queen’s English”. O.C. states: “The Great Adventures of Slick Rick is one of the greatest albums ever… the stuff he was just saying on there, it was so clear… the clear syllable dude was Slick Rick for me”.Edwards, Paul, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 244. He is also renowned for his unique “smooth, British-tinged flow” which contains distinct structures. In the book How to Rap, it is noted that on the song ‘I Own America’, he “puts a rest on almost every other 1 beat so that each set of two lines begins with a rest.”Edwards, Paul, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 129. Kool Moe Dee stated that, “Rick accomplished being totally original at a time when most MCs were using very similar cadences.”Kool Moe Dee. There's A God On The Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2003, p.64. He has what is described as “singsong cadences”; Andy Cat of Ugly Duckling mentions that Slick Rick uses a melodic delivery on the track ‘Hey Young World’.Edwards, Paul. How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 253. Slick Rick is also known to extensively use punch ins, especially in his story rhymes as different characters;Edwards, Paul. How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, 2009, p. 276. Kool Moe Dee says Rick used “multi-voices to portray multiple characters.”
