[[Cotangent bundle]]

CATEGORIES: Vector bundles, Differential topology

In mathematics, especially differential geometry, the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold is the vector bundle of all the cotangent spaces at every point in the manifold. It may be described also as the dual bundle to the tangent bundle.

==The cotangent sheaf==

Smooth sections of the cotangent bundle are differential one-forms.

===Definition of the cotangent sheaf===

By Taylor's theorem, this is a locally free sheaf of modules with respect to the sheaf of germs of smooth functions of M.  Thus it defines a vector bundle on M:  the cotangent bundle.

==The cotangent bundle as phase space==

Since the cotangent bundle X=T*M is a vector bundle, it can be regarded as a manifold in its own right.  Because of the manner in which the definition of T*M relates to the differential topology of the base space M, X possesses a canonical one-form θ (also tautological one-form or symplectic potential).  The exterior derivative of θ is a symplectic 2-form, out of which a non-degenerate volume form can be built for X.  For example, as a result X is always an orientable manifold (meaning that the tangent bundle of X is an orientable vector bundle). A special set of coordinates can be defined on the cotangent bundle; these are called the canonical coordinates. Because cotangent bundles can be thought of as symplectic manifolds, any real function on the cotangent bundle can be interpreted to be a Hamiltonian; thus the cotangent bundle can be understood to be a phase space on which Hamiltonian mechanics plays out.

===The tautological one-form===

The cotangent bundle carries a tautological one-form θ also known as the Poincaré 1-form or Liouville 1-form. (The form is also known as the canonical one-form, although this can sometimes lead to confusion.) This means that if we regard T*M as a manifold in its own right, there is a canonical section of the vector bundle T*(T*M) over T*M.
This section can be constructed in several ways.  The most elementary method is to use local coordinates.  Suppose that xi are local coordinates on the base manifold M.  In terms of these base coordinates, there are fibre coordinates pi:  a one-form at a particular point of T*M has the form pidxi (Einstein summation convention implied).  So the manifold T*M itself carries local coordinates (xi,pi) where the x are coordinates on the base and the p are coordinates in the fibre.  The canonical one-form is given in these coordinates by 
Intrinsically, the value of the canonical one-form in each fixed point of T*M is given as a pullback.  Specifically, suppose that [tpl]nowrap|π : T*M → M[/tpl] is the projection of the bundle. Taking a point in Tx*M is the same as choosing of a point x in M and a one-form ω at x, and the tautological one-form θ assigns to the point (x, ω) the value
That is, for a vector v in the tangent bundle of the cotangent bundle, the application of the tautological one-form θ to v at (x, ω) is computed by projecting v into the tangent bundle at x using [tpl]nowrap|dπ : TT*M → TM[/tpl] and applying ω to this projection.  Note that the tautological one-form is not a pullback of a one-form on the base M.
