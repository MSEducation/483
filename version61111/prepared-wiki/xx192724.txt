CATEGORIES: Serbia and Montenegro

The flag of Serbia and Montenegro was adopted on 27 April 1992 originally as the flag of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003) and remained in use after the state was renamed to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 and until the country's dissolution in 2006.http://flagspot.net/flags/cs.html
It is the same flag used by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1943–1992) but without the red star in the center.
