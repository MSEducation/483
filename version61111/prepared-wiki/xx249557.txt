==Other People's Money==

Forsyth's first book Other People's Money told the true story of the Scottish fraudster Elliot Castro. Forsyth was living in Scotland and writing for men's magazines when he read about Castro's fraud conviction in a newspaper. He wrote to Castro in prison and gained his permission to write the biography. At publication Other People's Money received a large amount of coverage and while the book was well received, some newspapers questioned the book's moral purpose. "They thought it was wrong that we should profit from Elliot's crimes," Forsyth said in an interview, "But that's always something I protested against quite vigorously. Elliot was caught, and sentenced, and paid for his crimes." The film rights to Other People's Money were purchased by the producers of The Last King Of Scotland.[ref]
