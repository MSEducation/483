All five volumes of Paradise Kiss have been released in English by Tokyopop, with a new edition to be published by Vertical, Inc. Nana was formerly running in Shojo Beat and is now being released by Viz Media, bi-monthly.

Yazawa's works are most popular among people who love fashion. The storylines generally are centered on young women and their relationships, something with which her young fanbase identifies. The characters are always very stylish, and she is known especially for her hip sense of fashion. Yazawa herself attended a fashion school after high school but did not complete her studies there. Another key point is her strikingly unique, often rebellious characters, who tend to be juxtaposed against the more traditional ones.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/cartoon-friends-strike-a-blow-for-japanese-women-505337.html | title=Cartoon friends strike a blow for Japanese women | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=2005-09-03 | location=London | first=David | last=McNeill | date=2005-09-03[/tpl][tpl]dead|date=December 2011[/tpl]
She has also published three artbooks.

==Personal life==

Yazawa is a fan of Rumi Shishido and routinely promotes her works; in one of the volumes of Gokinjo Monogatari, she promoted Shishido's first indies album, Set Me Free, and likewise designed the cover for her third indies album, Rumi Roll, which was promoted in volume 9 of NANA.
