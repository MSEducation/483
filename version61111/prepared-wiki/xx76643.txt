A Klondike derby is an annual event held by some Boy Scouts of America and Scouts Canada districts during the winter months and is based on the heritage of the Klondike Gold Rush.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scoutdocs.ca/Klondike/ |title=Klondike, Ho! |accessdate=2007-10-09 |author=Morland, Liam |work=Scoutdocs [/tpl] BSA units have been running Klondike derbies since 1949.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Grandaddy of Klondike Derbies|journal=Scouting|date=|first=|author=Peterson, Robert|issue=Januaryâ€“February 1999|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/9901/a-klon.html|accessdate=2007-10-09 [/tpl]
The event varies by district, but the typical Klondike derby consists of 10 stations where patrols/units must test their Scoutcraft skills and their leadership abilities, earning points towards a total score.[tpl]cite web|url=http://boyslife.org/outdoors/outdoorarticles/2638/plan-and-run-a-klondike-derby/ |date=November 2007 |title=Plan and Run a Klondike Derby |author=Derr, Aaron |accessdate=2010-10-07 |work=Boys' Life [/tpl]
The unit must transport their gear on a homemade sled pulled by the Scouts. Districts may have specific guidelines for the construction of sleds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/about/download/klondike.pdf |title=Plans for Klondike Derby Sled (Sledge) |accessdate=2007-10-09 |work=Scouting [/tpl]
