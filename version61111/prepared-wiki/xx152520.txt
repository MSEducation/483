[[Rheonomous]]

CATEGORIES: Mechanics, Classical mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics

A mechanical system is rheonomous if its equations of constraints contain the time as an explicit variable.[tpl]cite book |last=Goldstein |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Goldstein |title=Classical Mechanics |year=1980 |location=United States of America |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=2nd |isbn=0-201-02918-9 |page=12 |quote=Constraints are further classified according as the equations of constraint contain the time as an explicit variable (rheonomous) or are not explicitly dependent on time (scleronomous).[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Spiegel |first=Murray R. |title=Theory and Problems of THEORETICAL MECHANICS with an Introduction to Lagrange's Equations and Hamiltonian Theory |year=1994 |series=Schaum's Outline Series |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=0-07-060232-8 |page=283 |quote=In many mechanical systems of importance the time t does not enter explicitly in the equations (2) or (3). Such systems are sometimes called scleronomic. In others, as for example those involving moving constraints, the time t does enter explicitly. Such systems are called rheonomic.[/tpl]  Such constraints are called rheonomic constraints. The opposite of rheonomous is scleronomous.

==Example: simple 2D pendulum==

As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string has a constant length. Therefore this system is scleronomous; it obeys the scleronomic constraint
The situation changes if the pivot point is moving, e.g. undergoing a simple harmonic motion
Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same. Therefore this system is rheonomous; it obeys the rheonomic constraint
