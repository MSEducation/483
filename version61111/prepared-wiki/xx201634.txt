Edgar Fogel Magnin ( July 1, 1890 - July 17, 1984 ) was rabbi and spiritual leader of Congregation B’nai B’rith/ Wilshire Boulevard Temple, and was considered “Rabbi to the Stars.”[tpl]cite book|last=Gabler |first=Neal |authorlink=Neal Gabler |title=An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood | publisher=Crown |year=1988 |isbn=0-517-56808-X[/tpl] p. 266. Born in San Francisco to relatives that founded the Magnin department store chain, Magnin was ordained in Judaism's Reform movement by the Hebrew Union College in 1914 and became rabbi of Congregation B’nai B’rith in Los Angeles in 1915. After becoming senior rabbi of the oldest Jewish congregation in Los Angeles in 1919, Rabbi Magnin distinguished his 69-year tenure at Wilshire Boulevard Temple through close ties with the motion picture and television industry. Among the many life-cycle events he performed were the wedding of Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg and the funerals of numerous entertainment figures and movie moguls. Responsible for the construction and opening of the current, Gothic-style Wilshire Boulevard Temple with its Warner murals in 1929, now a national historic monument, Rabbi Magnin was active in Los Angeles civic affairs and in interfaith dialogue. He participated in the inaugural ceremonies of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and served on more than 20 executive boards and advisory councils. He is interred at Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California.
