Porta became the national captain in 1977, and in his first game in charge, led the Pumas against France. Argentina lost 3-26, with Porta getting Argentina's only points through a penalty goal. However, in the following match, the nations drew 18-all, Hugo providing all of Argentina's points through six penalties, as, for France, did Jean-Michel Aguirre, who also kicked six penalties.
Porta led Argentina in two matches during October 1978; against an England XV (non-cap) and Italy. The following season he led the Pumas against a New Zealand XV (non-cap) in a two match series.
