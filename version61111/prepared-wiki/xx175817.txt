[[Heterogyna]]

CATEGORIES: Spheciformes

The Heterogynaidae are a small family (only seven described species in a single genus, Heterogyna) of small spheciform, apoid wasps occurring in Madagascar, Botswana, and the eastern Mediterranean area. Heterogynaid females are typically brachypterous, and their biology is completely unknown. They are generally considered the sister taxon to the remainder of the Apoidea.
