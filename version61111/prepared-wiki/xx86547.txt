[[WS-I Basic Profile]]

CATEGORIES: Web service specifications, Interoperability

The WS-I Basic Profile (official abbreviation is BP), a specification from the Web Services Interoperability industry consortium (WS-I), provides interoperability guidance for core Web Services specifications such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. The profile uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to enable the description of services as sets of endpoints operating on messages.
To understand the importance of WSI-BP, note that it defines a much narrower set of valid services than the full WSDL or SOAP schema. Many common platforms (listed below) support WSI-BP but do not support services outside of it. Compare the WSDL 1.1 specification to the subset permitted in WSI-BP.  Also note that WSI-BP generally narrows the SOAP specification.  There is a notable exception where WSI expands on the SOAP standard, and that is in adding xml:lang attribute on fault elements.
