[[Bodil Award for Best American Film]]

CATEGORIES: Awards for best film, Lists of films by award, Bodil Awards

The Bodil Award for Best American Film is one of the categories for the Bodil Awards presented annually by the Danish Union of Film Critics ([tpl]lang-da|Filmedarbejderforeningen[/tpl]). It was created in 1948 and is one of the oldest film prizes in Europe. The category was named "Best American Film" until 1961, when it became the "Best Non-European Film". In 2001, the name of the award changed back to "Best American Film", and the European category was changed to "Best Non-American Film".
The judging committee may choose not to present an award if there isn't a worthy film. This has happened twice: In 1957, when American producers boycotted Denmark; and in 1964, when two Bodils were awarded to European Films.
