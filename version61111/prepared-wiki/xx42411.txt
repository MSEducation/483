It was released on May 15, 2001 through Volcano Entertainment. The album was recorded at Cello Studios in Hollywood and The Hook, Big Empty Space, and The Lodge, in North Hollywood, between October 2000 and January 2001. David Bottrill, who had produced the band's two previous releases Ænima and Salival, produced the album along with the band. On August 23, 2005, Lateralus was released as a limited edition two-picture-disc vinyl LP in a holographic gatefold package.
The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified double platinum by the RIAA on August 5, 2003. On August 30, 2004, the album was certified silver by the BPI. It was also certified platinum in Australia, and double platinum in Canada. The band won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song "Schism" in 2002. Lateralus was ranked No. 123 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "Definitive 200" list.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.listsofbests.com/list/28003-definitive-200?page=3 |title= The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's "Definitive 200." |year= UNK |accessdate=22 February 2011[/tpl]

==Background==

Lateralus emerged after a four-year legal dispute with Tool's label, Volcano Entertainment.[tpl]cite web |last=Akhtar |first=Kabir |title=The Tool FAQ |publisher=toolshed.down.net |url=http://toolshed.down.net/faq/faq.html |accessdate=14 September 2008 [/tpl] In January 2001, the band announced that their new album's title would be Systema Encéphale and provided a 12-song tracklist with titles such as "Riverchrist", "Numbereft", "Encephatalis", "Musick", and "Coeliacus". File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names.[tpl]cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/news/oldnews/old0101.html | title=Old News. January — March 2001 | publisher=toolshed.down.net | accessdate=6 March 2006 | first=Kabir |last=Akhtar [/tpl] At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to the negative impact on artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career. Keenan had this to say during an interview with NY Rock in 2000: "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2000/apc_int.asp | title=Interview with Maynard James Keenan of A Perfect Circle | work=NY Rock | accessdate=28 April 2006 |date=September 2000 | author=Gabriella[/tpl] A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus (supposedly named in combination with the words "Vastus lateralis", a human leg muscle and lateral thinking)[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=grWO5XKtbCoC |title= Nu-Metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |author= Joel McIver |publisher= Omnibus |year= 2002 |pages= 137 |accessdate=27 January 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7119-9209-2 [/tpl] and that the name Systema Encéphale and the tracklist had been a ruse.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439483/02152001/tool.jhtml | title=Tool Tinker With Album Title, Set Track List | work=MTV News | publisher = MTV.com | accessdate=6 March 2006 | first=Joe | last=D'Angelo[/tpl]

Rolling Stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that "Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent death march... The prolonged running times of most of Lateralus' thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose." Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club in turn expressed his opinion that Lateralus, with its 79-minute running time and relatively complex and long songs — topped by the ten-and-a-half minute music video for "Parabola" — posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/tool-lateralus,22001/ | title=Tool: Lateralus | work=The A.V. Club | date=15 May 2001 | accessdate=25 May 2007 | first=Joshua | last=Klein[/tpl] Drummer Danny Carey said, "The manufacturer would only guarantee us up to 79 minutes... We thought we'd give them two seconds of breathing room." Carey aspired to create longer songs like those by artists he grew up listening to. The band had segues to place between songs, but had to cut out a lot during the mastering phase. The CD itself was mastered using HDCD technology.
Just as Salival was initially released with several errors on the track listing, early pressings of Lateralus had the ninth track incorrectly spelled as "Lateralis". The original title of "Reflection" was "Resolution" before being changed three months prior to the album's release.
The track listing is altered on the vinyl edition, with "Disposition" appearing at track 8. Because of the long running time, the double vinyl edition could not be released like the disc since the songs would not fit on each disc side in that order. By moving "Disposition" to an earlier point, the sides were balanced and could fit the material. However, this edit breaks the segue that occurs between "Disposition" and "Reflection" which, along with "Triad", are often grouped together.
Two of the singles from the album, "Parabola" and "Schism", are featured in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour.
The insert is translucent and flips open to reveal the different layers of the human body. Disguised in the brain matter on the final layer is the word "God". The artwork was done by artist Alex Grey, who would later design the 3D edition cover for their fourth album 10,000 Days.

==Composition and content==

Drummer Danny Carey sampled himself breathing through a tube to simulate the chanting of Buddhist monks for "Parabol", and banged piano strings for samples on "Reflection". "Faaip de Oiad" samples a recording of a 1997 call on Art Bell's radio program Coast to Coast AM. "Faaip de Oiad" is Enochian for The Voice of God.
"Disposition", "Reflection", and "Triad" form a sequence that has been performed in succession live with occasional help from various tourmates such as Mike Patton, Buzz Osborne, Tricky, and members of Isis, Meshuggah, and King Crimson.
The title track, "Lateralus", incorporates the Fibonacci sequence.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.upvenue.com/music-news/blog-headline/1142/fibonacci-in-tool-s-lateralus.html |title=Fibonacci in Tool's Lateralus|publisher=UpVenue|accessdate=9 August 2011[/tpl] The theme of the song describes the desire of humans to explore and to expand for more knowledge and a deeper understanding of everything. The lyrics "spiral out", refers to this desire and also to the Fibonacci spiral, which is formed by creating and arranging squares for each number in the sequence's 1,1,2,3,5,8,... pattern, and drawing a curve that connects to two corners of each square. This would, allowed to continue onwards, theoretically create a never-ending and infinitely-expanding spiral. Related to this, the song's main theme features successive time signatures 9/8, 8/8, and 7/8.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guitaretab.com/t/tool/21818.html|title=Tool - Lateralus tab|publisher=GuitareTab!|accessdate=9 August 2011[/tpl]

==Special editions==

A vinyl edition and two DVD singles from the album were released later. The "double vinyl four-picture disc" edition of Lateralus was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. Two music videos were produced; one for "Schism" (with the short ambient segue "Mantra" at the beginning) and one for "Parabol/Parabola". These were subsequently released as two separate DVD singles on December 20, 2005, featuring remixes of the tracks by Lustmord.

Well received by both fans and most critics, it was named Kerrang!'s album of the year in 2001, and the band received the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song "Schism".
