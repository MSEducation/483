The Columbia Record was an afternoon daily newspaper published in Columbia, South Carolina.  It was established in 1897.  In 1945 it was purchased by The State which is the morning daily paper in Columbia to form the State-Record Company.  The company was purchased by Knight-Ridder in 1986 and publication of the Columbia Record ceased on April 1, 1988.  One of the quirks of the paper was that it printed the weekly entertainment section on green newsprint.
