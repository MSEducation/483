Oliver Wolf Sacks, CBE (born 9 July 1933) is a British-American neurologist, writer, and amateur chemist who is Professor of Neurology at New York University School of Medicine. Between 2007 and 2012, he was professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia University, where he also held the position of "Columbia Artist". Before that, he spent many years on the clinical faculty of Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  He also holds the position of visiting professor at the United Kingdom's  University of Warwick."NYU Langone Medical Center Welcomes Neurologist and Author Oliver Sacks, MD". newswise.com.

Sacks is the author of numerous best-selling books,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/sacks/index.html|title=Borzoi Reader [tpl]![/tpl] Authors [tpl]![/tpl] Oliver Sacks|work=About the Author|publisher=Random House|accessdate=5 March 2009[/tpl] including several collections of case studies of people with neurological disorders. His 1973 book Awakenings was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film of the same name in 1990 starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. He and his book Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain were the subject of "Musical Minds", an episode of the PBS series Nova.

==Early life==

Sacks was the youngest of four children born to a North London Jewish couple: Samuel Sacks, a physician (died June 1990),An Anthropoligist on Mars (Knopf, 1995), p. 70 and Muriel Elsie Landau, one of the first female surgeons in England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/05/booksonhealth.whauden|title=Oliver Sacks Profile: Seeing double |author=Brown, Andrew|work=The Guardian|date=5 March 2005|accessdate=10 August 2008[/tpl] Sacks has a large extended family, and his first cousins include Israeli statesman Abba Eban, writer and director Jonathan Lynn, and economist Robert Aumann.
When Sacks was six years old, he and his brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the Blitz, retreating to a boarding school in the Midlands where he remained until 1943. Unbeknownst to his family, at the school, he and his brother Michael ".. subsisted on meager rations of turnips and beetroot and suffered cruel punishments at the hands of a sadistic headmaster."Nadine Epstein, (2008), Uncle Xenon: The Element of Oliver Sacks Moment Magazine He attended St Paul's School in London. During his youth he was a keen amateur chemist, as recalled in his memoir Uncle Tungsten.[tpl]Cite book|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-375-40448-1|year=2001[/tpl] He also learned to share his parents' enthusiasm for medicine and entered The Queen's College, Oxford University, in 1951, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physiology and biology in 1954.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/cv.htm|title=Oliver Sacks, MD, FRCP|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Official site[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] At the same institution, in 1958 he went on to undertake a Master of Arts and earn a BM BCh, thereby qualifying to practice medicine.  Sacks left England for Canada then made his way from there to the United States for a different career path. He undertook residencies and fellowship work at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco and at UCLA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/facdb/profile_list.asp?uni=os2177&DepAffil=Psychiatry |title=Columbia University website, section of Psychiatry |publisher=Asp.cumc.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29[/tpl]

==Career==

After converting his British qualifications to American recognition (i.e., an MD as opposed to BM BCh), Sacks moved to New York, where he has lived and practised neurology since 1965.
Sacks began consulting at chronic care facility Beth Abraham Hospital (now Beth Abraham Health Services, a member of CenterLight Health System) in the Bronx, in 1966.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/about.htm|title=Biography . Oliver Sacks, MD, FRCP|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Official website[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] At Beth Abraham, Sacks worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness, encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. These patients and his treatment of them were the basis of Sacks' book Awakenings.
Sacks served as an instructor and later clinical professor of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 1966 to 2007, and also held an appointment at the New York University School of Medicine from 1992 to 2007. In July 2007 he joined the faculty of Columbia University Medical Center as a professor of neurology and psychiatry. At the same time, he was appointed Columbia University's first "Columbia University Artist" at the University's Morningside Heights campus, recognising the role of his work in bridging the arts and sciences.
Since 1966 Sacks has served as a neurological consultant to various New York City nursing homes that are run by the Little Sisters of the Poor, and from 1966 to 1991 was a consulting neurologist at Bronx Psychiatric Center. Sacks returned to New York University School of Medicine in 2012, serving as both a professor of neurology and consulting neurologist in the center's epilepsy center.
Sacks' work at Beth Abraham helped provide the foundation on which the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function (IMNF) is built; Sacks is currently an honorary medical advisor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bethabe.org/About_the_Institute100.html|title=About the Institute|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=Institute for Music and Neurologic Function[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] The Institute honoured Sacks in 2000 with its first Music Has Power Award.[tpl]cite journal|date=1 January 2006|title=Henry Z.

Sacks remains a consultant neurologist to the Little Sisters of the Poor, and maintains a practice in New York City. He serves on the boards of the The Neurosciences Institute and the New York Botanical Garden.

===Writing===

Beginning in 1970, Sacks wrote of his experience with neurological patients. His books have been translated into over 25 languages. In addition to his books, Sacks is a regular contributor to The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, as well as other medical, scientific, and general publications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/search/?bylquery=%22Oliver%20Sacks%22|title=Archive: Search: The New Yorker—Oliver Sacks|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/oliver-sacks/|title=Oliver Sacks—The New York Review of Books|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/peri1.htm|title=Oliver Sacks .

Sacks' work has been featured in a "broader range of media than those of any other contemporary medical author"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/sacks_pr.html|author=Silberman, Steve|title=The Fully Immersive Mind of Oliver Sacks|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=10 August 2008[/tpl] and in 1990, The New York Times said he "has become a kind of poet laureate of contemporary medicine".[tpl]cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D8103FF932A35757C0A966958260|date=1 April 1990|title=Good books abut (sic) being sick|author=Broyard, Anatole|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 August 2008[/tpl] His descriptions of people coping with and adapting to neurological conditions or injuries often illuminate the ways in which the normal brain deals with perception, memory and individuality.
Sacks considers that his literary style grows out of the tradition of 19th-century "clinical anecdotes," a literary style that included detailed narrative case histories. He also counts among his inspirations the case histories of the Russian neuropsychologist A. R. Luria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/mind/stories/s1334384.htm|title=The Inner Life of the Broken Brain: Narrative and Neurology|publisher=All in the Mind|work=Radio National|date=2 April 2005|accessdate=10 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Sacks describes his cases with a wealth of narrative detail, concentrating on the experiences of the patient (in the case of his A Leg to Stand On, the patient was himself). The patients he describes are often able to adapt to their situation in different ways despite the fact that their neurological conditions are usually considered incurable.[tpl]cite book|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|title=An Anthropologist on Mars|origyear=1995|edition=New|year=1996 |publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=0-330-34347-5|pages=xiii–xviii|chapter=Preface|quote="The sense of the brain's remarkable plasticity, its capacity for the most striking adaptations, not least in the special (and often desperate) circumstances of neural or sensory mishap, has come to dominate my own perception of my patients and their lives."|nopp=true[/tpl] His most famous book, Awakenings, upon which the 1990 feature film of the same name is based, describes his experiences using the new drug L-Dopa on Beth Abraham post-encephalitic patients. Awakenings was also the subject of the first documentary made (in 1974) for the British television series Discovery.
In his other books, he describes cases of Tourette syndrome and various effects of Parkinson's disease. The title article of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is about a man with visual agnosia  and was the subject of a 1986 opera by Michael Nyman. The title article of An Anthropologist on Mars, which won a Polk Award for magazine reporting, is about Temple Grandin, a professor with high-functioning autism. Seeing Voices, Sacks' 1989 book, covers a variety of topics in deaf studies.
In his book The Island of the Colorblind Sacks writes about an island where many people have achromatopsia (total colorblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia), and describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have a high incidence of a neurodegenerative disease known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia, and parkinsonism). Along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks has published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the cluster, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.[tpl]cite journal|author=Murch SJ, Cox PA, Banack SA, Steele JC, Sacks OW|title=Occurrence of beta-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in ALS/PDC patients from Guam|journal=Acta Neurol.

In November 2012 Oliver Sacks released his latest book, Hallucinations. In this work Sacks takes a look into why ordinary people can sometimes experience hallucinations and removes the stigma placed behind the word. He explains, “Hallucinations don’t belong wholly to the insane. Much more commonly, they are linked to sensory deprivation, intoxication, illness or injury.”.[tpl]cite web|last=Sacks|first=Oliver|title=Hallucinations|url=http://www.oliversacks.com/books/hallucinations/[/tpl] Sacks writes about the not so well known phenomenon called Charles Bonnet Syndrome, which has been found to occur in elderly people who have lost their eyesight. The book has been described by Entertainment Weekly as, “Elegant… An absorbing plunge into a mystery of the mind,”[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Stephan|title=Book Review: Hallucinations|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20643720,00.html|accessdate=2012-09-20[/tpl]
Sacks has sometimes faced criticism in the medical and disability studies communities. During the 1970s and 1980s, his book and articles on the "Awakenings" patients were criticized or ignored by much of the medical establishment, on the grounds that his work was not based on the quantitative, double-blind study model. His account of abilities of autistic savants has been questioned by the researcher Makoto Yamaguchi,[tpl]cite journal|author=Yamaguchi M|title=Questionable aspects of Oliver Sacks' (1985) report|journal=J Autism Dev Disord|volume=37|issue=7|pages=1396; discussion 1389–9, 1401|date=August 2007|pmid=17066308|doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0257-0[/tpl] for free access http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/mrwatkin/isoc/sacks-yamaguchi.htm and Daniel Tammet shared this view. According to Yamaguchi, Sacks' mathematical explanations are also irrelevant.Polish Psychological Bulletin, 40, 69–73 Arthur K. Shapiro—described as "the father of modern tic disorder research"[tpl]cite journal|author=Gadow KD, Sverd J|title=Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic tic disorder, and methylphenidate|journal=Adv Neurol|year=2006|volume=99|pages=197–207|pmid=16536367[/tpl]—referring to Sacks' celebrity status and that his literary publications received greater publicity than Shapiro's medical publications, said he is "a much better writer than he is a clinician".Kushner, HI.

ISBN 0-674-00386-1 Howard Kushner's A Cursing Brain?: The Histories of Tourette Syndrome, says Shapiro "contrasted his own careful clinical work with Sacks' idiosyncratic and anecdotal approach to a clinical investigation".Kushner (2000), p. 204
More sustained has been the critique of his political and ethical positions. Although many characterise Sacks as a "compassionate" writer and doctor,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1044036.html|title=Oliver Sacks: Hero of the Hopeless; The Doctor of 'Awakenings,' With Compassion for the Chronically Ill|last=Weinraub|first=Judith |date=13 January 1991|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/08/25/1998-08-25_healthy_dose_of_compassion_i.html|title=Healthy Dose of Compassion in Medical 'Mind' Series|last=Bianculli|first=David|date=25 August 1998|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDB1330F937A25751C0A963958260|title=Finding the Advantages in Some Mind Disorders|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=14 February 1995|work=New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2008[/tpl] others feel that he exploits his subjects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cms.mit.edu/research/theses/Kestrell2006.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080703181440/http://cms.mit.edu/research/theses/Kestrell2006.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-03|title=Decloaking Disability: Images of Disability and Technology in Science Fiction Media|author=Verlager, Alicia|date=August 2006|format=Master's thesis|publisher=MIT.edu|accessdate=10 August 2008|quote=However, Sacks' use of his preoccupation with people with disabilities as the foundation for his professional career has led many disability advocates to compare him to P. T. Barnum, whose own professional career (and its subsequent monetary profit) was based to a large degree upon his employment of PWD as 'freaks.' ... Note also the science fiction aspect to the title of Sacks' book, which frames the disabled people he writes about as 'aliens' from a different planet. One issue in the dynamic of the expert who appoints himself as the official storyteller of the experience of disability is that both the professional and financial success of the storyteller often rely upon his framing of the disabled characters as extraordinary, freakish, or abnormal. This is what disability studies scholars and disability advocates term the 'medicalization of disability' (Linton 1998, 1–2).[/tpl] Sacks was called "the man who mistook his patients for a literary career" by British academic and disability-rights activist Tom Shakespeare,[tpl]cite journal|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=14027836&site=ehost-live|journal=Disability and Society|volume=11|issue=1|pages=137–142|title=Book Review: An Anthropologist on Mars|year=1996|accessdate=11 August 2008|doi=10.1080/09687599650023380[/tpl] and one critic called his work "a high-brow freak show".[tpl]cite web|url=http://poynter.indiana.edu/files/4213/4513/2230/m-couser.pdf|format=PDF|author=Couser, G.

Sacks describes a transformative incident he had after taking a massive dose of amphetamine, then reading a book by the 19th century migraine physician Edward Liveing (father of George Downing Liveing).
