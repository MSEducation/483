From there, the route travels east along Centerville Road through farmlands. After about [tpl]convert|1|mi|km[/tpl], the highway passes near homes on the northwest edge of the Gardnerville Ranchos area. Around the second mile, SR 756 turns northward and again passes through farm fields. The route crosses over the east fork of the Carson River and then enters the town limits of Gardenerville.

==History==

The present-day highway first appears on official state maps in 1937. At that time, the road was paved and carried the State Route 56 designation.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Road Map of the State of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,469 |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |year=1937 |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] The routing appears to have remained unchanged since that time.
Nevada began renumbering its state highways on July 1, 1976. In that process, SR 56 was re-designated as State Route 756.[tpl]cite book|title=Nevada's State Maintained Highways: Descriptions, Index and Maps|year=2001|publisher=Nevada Department of Transportation|pages=101[/tpl] This change was not made to the official Nevada map right away, as the 1978–1979 edition of the state's tourist map (which detailed many route number conversions) continued to show SR 56 without the new SR 756 designation.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,535 |publisher=Nevada Department of Highways |inset=Lake Tahoe Region |year=1978 |edition=1978-1979 |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] By 1982, the road was still shown on state maps, albeit without a route number.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,539 |publisher=Nevada Department of Transportation |inset=Lake Tahoe Region |year=1982 |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl] SR 756 was finally shown as a numbered highway on the 1991–1992 Nevada map.[tpl]cite map |title=Official Highway Map of Nevada |url=http://contentdm.library.unr.edu/u?/hmaps,549 |publisher=Nevada Department of Transportation |inset=Lake Tahoe Region |year=1990 |edition=1991-1992 |accessdate=19 June 2011[/tpl]
