===Rao Tularam and the Indian rebellion of 1857===

Rao Tula Ram, a Yadav King,  was one of the key leaders of the Indian rebellion of 1857, in Haryana, where he is considered a state hero. He is credited with temporarily driving all of the British rule from the region that today is southwest Haryana during the Rebellion, and also helping rebel forces fighting in the historic city of Delhi with men, money and material. Noted as a good administrator and military commander, after the 1857 uprising ended, he left India, met rulers of Iran and Afghanistan and also established contacts with the Tsar of Russia, to seek their help to fight a war to free India from the British. His plans were cut short by his death in Kabul.

===Formation of Haryana===

Haryana state was formed on 1 November 1966. The Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice JC Shah on 23 April 1966 to divide the existing Punjab and determine the boundaries of new state Haryana giving consideration to the language spoken by the people. The commission gave its report on 31 May 1966. According to this report the then districts of Hisar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Rohtak and Karnal were to be a part of the new state of Haryana.

==Geography==

Haryana is a landlocked state in northern India. It is located between 27°39' to 30°35' N latitude and between 74°28' and 77°36' E longitude. The altitude of Haryana varies between 700 to 3600 ft (200 metres to 1200 metres) above sea level. An area of 1,553 km2 is covered by forest. Haryana has four main geographical features.

===Rivers of Haryana===

The river Yamuna flows along its eastern boundary. The ancient Sarasvati River is said to have flowed from Yamuna Nagar, but it has now disappeared.
The river Ghaggar is Haryana's main seasonal river. The Ghaggar rises in the outer Himalayas, between the Yamuna and the Sutlej and enters Haryana near Pinjore, Panchkula district. Passing through Ambala and Hissar, it reaches Bikaner in Rajasthan and runs a course of [tpl]convert|460|km|abbr=on[/tpl] before disappearing into the deserts of Rajasthan. An important tributary is the Tangri.
The Markanda river is also a seasonal stream. Its ancient name was Aruna. It originates from the lower Sivalik Hills and enters Haryana west of Ambala. During monsoons, this stream swells into a raging torrent notorious for its devastating power. The surplus water is carried on to the Sanisa lake where the Markanda joins the Saraswati and later Ghaggar. Shahbad Markanda town is situated on its bank.
The Sahibi River, also called Vedic Drishadwati as mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana originates in the Distt. Jaipur in Rajasthan at present times. However before seismic activities some 7500 years ago in Aravalli Hills, the river brought water even from Ajmer district.  Gathering volume from about a hundred tributaries in Rajasthan and Mewat areas, it reaches voluminous proportions, forming a broad stream around Alwar and Patan. Further flowing via Rewari District and Dharuhera, reaching Jhajjar it branches off into two smaller streams, finally reaching the outskirts of Delhi and flowing into Najafgarh lake that flows into the Yamuna through the Najafgarh drain. However, of late, hardly any water flows in Sahibi as most of the water is impounded in small check dams uptream in Alwar district of Rajasthan and the Masani barrage in Rewari district, built on this river on NH 8 (Delhi-Jaipur highway) remains dry.
There are three other rivulets in and around the Mewat hills – Indori, Dohan and Kasavati and they all flow from East to West and once were tributories of Drishadwati/Saraswati rivers.Geography of Haryana - Map, Shivaliks, Ghaggar, Yamuna, Saraswati, Morni - India

==Culture==

Haryana has a rich cultural heritage that goes back to the Vedic times. Dhosi Hill, the ashram of revered Rishi Chyawyan is an important site where Chyawanprash was formulated for the first time.
The last Hindu emperor of India who belonged to Rewari in Haryana, Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, also called Hemu, taking a cue from Vedic times declared himself a 'Vikramaditya' king after defeating Akbar's forces in Delhi in 1556. It amounted to establishing a vedic 'Hindu Raj' in North India during medieval period after a gap of more than 350 years. The age-old customs of meditation, Yoga and chanting of Vedic mantras are still observed by the masses. Famous yoga guru Swami Ramdev is from Mahendragarh in Haryana. Seasonal and religious festivals glorify the culture of this region. Haryana has a variety of folk dances.
The people of Haryana have preserved their old religious and social traditions. The culture of Haryana and the humour is very much similar to that of Punjab (as Haryana was a part of Punjab state). They celebrate festivals with great enthusiasm and traditional fervor. Their culture and popular art are saangs, dramas, ballads and songs in which they take great delight. Regarding eating habits, there is an idiom that says, Hara-Bhara Haryana, Jit Doodh-Dahi ka Khana (meaning a lush-green state where milk and curd are the food). Food and cuisines of Haryana are almost same as the ones in Punjab (Greater Punjab); popular Haryanavi dishes include makke di roti (grounded dry corn) and sarso da saag, lassi (sweet yogurt), rajma, cholay-bhature, etc.
A socially conservative state in north India, Haryana is notorious for frequent murders of young men and women who transgress social rules and marry someone of a different, especially if lower caste.http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-9

===Languages===

Haryanavi has traditionally been the dominant mother tongue in Haryana. Haryanvi has no official status, as it is seen as a dialect of Punjabi. Therefore, Punjabi is the primary language and Hindi is the secondary language. Since it was the Punjabi suba agitation that had led to formation of Haryana, Bassi Lol thought, ‘Let any language other than Punjabi be the second language of the state’. Hence, Tamil became the second state language even though there might not have been even a single Tamil native family in the state at that point of time.http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-punjabi-edges-out-tamil-in-haryana-1356124 Since 1947, Punjabi has also been spoken by a lot of people in Haryana especially by those Hindus and Sikhs who came over from the older Punjab region at the time of partition and there was pressure on the government to make it an official language too. As such, Punjabi edged out Tamil as the second official language of the state in 2010. Haryana is the second-largest Punjabi-speaking state after Punjab.
The most striking feature of Haryana is its language itself or, rather, the manner in which it is spoken. Popularly known as Haryanavi, the language of Jat people, with Bangaru, spoken in the Heart of Haryana, being the most widely spoken dialect. Bagri is the 2nd largest dialect of Hindi spoken in Haryana largely in Sirsa, Fatehabad and Hissar. And Ahirwati spoken in Ahirwal belt. With rapid urbanization, and due to Haryana's close proximity to Delhi, the cultural aspects are now taking a more modern hue.
Haryana has its own type of poetry known as raagni, which is very popular in Haryana, Delhi, Eastern Rajasthan and Western Uttar Pradesh. Surya Kavi Pt. Lakhmi Chand is considered as the "Shakespeare of Haryana". Most of his raagnis are still very popular among Haryanvi People. He has been conferred with the honour of "Surya Kavi" (Sun Poet) of Haryana.
