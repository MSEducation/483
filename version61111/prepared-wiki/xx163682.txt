==History==

Without some specific historical reports, the age of the village has been calculated and found to exceed 500 years, since it had already been constituted before the Turkish slavery (1453). Its early inhabitants went there, from Evrytania, Agrinio, Trikala, from the villages of Fthiotida, or from Agrafa mountains (soldiers during the Turkish slavery, who served the Greek post, which had been later recast to the chapel of Saint Paraskevi). The maximum number of inhabitants that has been recorded is about 430 in the late 19th century.
In modern age, an abandonment of the village appeared, as the latest census show, however during summer seasons, it gets again some life, and can be an exceptional escape from the ciy routine. This happens because it is built in the Southern banks of the beautiful and verdant mountain "Lykomnimata", which is placed near the Tymphristos mountain complex. A few kilometers away from Pitsiota, one of the World Rally Championship's-Rally Acropolis- tracks passes through.
