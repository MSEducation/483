Spaceballs is a 1987 American comic science fiction parody film co-written and directed by Mel Brooks and starring Brooks, Bill Pullman, John Candy and Rick Moranis. It also features Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, and the voice of Joan Rivers. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It later became a cult classic[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/spaceballs-45901 |title=Spaceballs - Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards - AllRovi |publisher=Allmovie.com |date=1987-06-24 |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl] on video and one of Brooks's most popular films. Its plot and characters parody the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises including Star Trek, Alien, and the Planet of the Apes films.

==Plot==

Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob (Brooks), has wasted all of its air. Skroob schemes to steal air from the planet Druidia by kidnapping the daughter of King Roland (Van Patten), Princess Vespa (Zuniga), on the day of her pre-arranged wedding to the narcoleptic Prince Valium. Skroob sends Dark Helmet (Moranis) to complete this task with Spaceball One, an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa herself abandons her marriage and flees the planet in her personal Mercedes spaceship along with her Droid of Honor, Dot Matrix (Rivers).
King Roland contacts mercenary Lone Starr (Pullman) and his mawg (half-man, half-dog) sidekick, Barf (Candy), offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the space gangster Pizza the Hutt. Lone Starr and Barf, in their Winnebago space ship (Eagle 5), reach Vespa before Spaceball One, rescue both her and Dot, and escape into hyperspace. Running out of fuel, they crash on the nearby "desert moon of Vega", and find their way to a cave occupied by the wise and old Yogurt (Brooks). Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to the power of "The Schwartz". Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign, which becomes prevalent throughout the rest of the film. During their respite on the moon, Lone Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.
Spaceball One, by breaking the fourth wall (by obtaining a VHS copy of the film and fast-forwarding to the part where the heroes crash-land), tracks down Lone Starr, captures Vespa, and returns with her to planet Spaceball. The Spaceballs threaten to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to give over the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Dark Helmet takes Spaceball One to Druidia, and transforms the ship into Mega Maid, a giant robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner that begins sucking the air from the planet. Lone Starr, after repairing his ship and training in the Schwartz with Yogurt's help, races to planet Spaceball to rescue Vespa, and then returns to Druidia, using the Schwartz to reverse the robot's sucking action and returning the air to the planet. Lone Starr and his allies enter the Mega Maid to attempt to destroy the robot. Lone Starr is forced to fight against Dark Helmet near the ship's self-destruct button, and manages to best him, causing Dark Helmet to accidentally strike it himself. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship, while Skroob, Dark Helmet, and Colonel Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, and are left stranded aboard the robot's head as it explodes. They land on a nearby planet, much to the regret of its ape population.
His debt to Pizza nullified after the gangster's untimely death, Lone Starr returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner, he finds a final message from Yogurt informing him that he is a prince and thus eligible to marry Vespa. Lone Starr reaches Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, and marries Vespa himself.

==Development==

When Mel Brooks developed Spaceballs, he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Ironically, however, even though Yogurt mentioned merchandising during the movie, Brooks's deal with George Lucas on parodying Star Wars was that no Spaceballs action figures be made.  According to Brooks, "Lucas said, 'Your figures are going to look like mine.' I said OK."
Brooks also had Lucas's company handle the post-production of Spaceballs, saying, "I was playing ball with the people who could have said no."  Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved Spaceballs and that he "was afraid he would bust something from laughing."
Bill Pullman got the part of Lone Starr when Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft saw a play that he was in.  Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks for the film.  Pullman said, "I think Mel was hurt that they didn't take him up on it... but then it attracted two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. Once that was secured, then he said, 'heck, I'll get somebody nobody knows!' And I got a chance to do it."
Daphne Zuniga initially found Brooks's movie parodies "too crass and not too funny," but after working with Brooks, she said, "I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he's also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond."

==Music==

When the film was released, Spaceballs: The Soundtrack was also released on Atlantic Records, featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by composer John Morris.
For the "19th Anniversary", La-La Land Records released a "limited edition" CD presenting the score in its entirety for the first time, with bonus tracks featuring alternate takes and tracks composed for, but not used in the film.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/SpaceBalls.html |title=Spaceballs press release at La-La Land Records |publisher=Lalalandrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl]

====Spaceball One====

The Spaceballs' weapon of conquest, Spaceball One, is a powerful spaceship and the equivalent of the Death Star in the movie, although in appearance it much more closely resembles an Imperial Star Destroyer. The opening scene with the ridiculously long, wide angle continuous shot of Spaceball One is an homage to the opening scene of Star Wars—which itself is an homage to the first shot of the  Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The length of the ship may also be an homage to the Nostromo of Alien, or the Sador's ship in the Roger Corman film Battle Beyond The Stars. Its shape resembles the battlestar Galactica and the Super Star Destroyers, while its name is a pun on Air Force One, the U.S. president's airplane. The Spaceballs' attitude toward others is expressed by the ship's large bumper sticker: "We brake for nobody."  In the DVD commentary, Mel Brooks mentions that he wanted the introductory 'spaceship' scene to be much longer, but changed his mind when it was pointed out that at the length he wanted, that one scene would become the entire movie.
The ship's absurd size is a frequent point of reference:
Spaceball One is capable of traveling at four different speeds: When a situation requires it to travel faster than its normal "sub-light" speed, it can accelerate to light speed, "ridiculous speed", and "Ludicrous Speed". When going to Ludicrous Speed, all crew members must use a seat belt for their own safety. Ludicrous Speed results in the ship leaving a trail of plaid, parodying the "warp trail" seen in the first few Star Trek films and 2001.
Spaceball One's secret weapon is its ability to transform, in parody of various transforming robot toys (Barf describes it as "a Transformer"), into Mega Maid, a colossal cleaning woman holding a gigantic vacuum cleaner used to extract air from other planets and take it back to planet Spaceball. It can also reverse that process, expelling air (thus changing modes from "suck" to "blow"). When Spaceball One begins to undergo its transformation into "Mega Maid," Dark Helmet exclaims "Ready, Kafka?", an allusion to Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis.
The ship's destruction mixes-and-mashes the destruction of the Death Star in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi with that of Unicron in Transformers: The Movie. Lone Starr's ship flies through a small hole in Mega Maid's ear to reach the self-destruct button, then escapes out the other ear only seconds before the ship explodes. Mega Maid's head, and the hand holding the vacuum-cleaner handle, crash on a nearby planet's sandy ocean beach with Sandurz, Skroob and Helmet still aboard (but escaping shortly after the landing), with the pieces resembling the Statue of Liberty as seen in the final scene of Planet of the Apes.

===Other parodies===

===The Schwartz===

Primarily, "the Schwartz" is a play on "the Force", from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The lightsabers emanating from the Schwartz-rings held in front of the crotch are phallic symbols. Schwarz (an adjective) is German for "black" and a common Ashkenazic Jewish surname.  The Light and Dark sides of the Force are parodied by being called the "up side" and the "down side". In the first episode of the animated series, the Dark Side is called "the Schwarz side of the Schwartz". The Schwartz maybe could be also a reference to FAO Schwartz, a toystore chain that at the time the official distributor of Star Wars toys(Infact, there's a part of the movie where Yogurt promotes the various Spaceballs merchandising). It has also been widely reported that "the Schwartz" is a reference to Mel Brooks's lawyer, Alan U. Schwartz.David Margolick, "LAW: AT THE BAR; More lawyers are less happy at their work, a survey finds", New York Times, August 17, 1990.David A. Kaplan, "Requiem for a law firm", Newsweek, January 7, 1991.Emily Bryson York, "Writers' rights: L.A. attorney Alan Schwartz has represented Truman Capote and Mel Brooks," Los Angeles Business Journal, August 14, 2006.  The word is also reminiscent of the Yiddish word Schwanz, "tail", which is Yiddish/German slang for "penis".  This is also implied by the phallic symbolism and jokes ("I see your Schwartz is as big as mine.")

===Box office===

The budget for Spaceballs was an estimated $22.7 million. The film grossed $38,119,483 during its run in the United States, taking in $6,613,837 on its opening weekend, finishing behind Dragnet.[tpl]cite web | author=| year=2006| title=Spaceballs | work=boxofficemojo.com| url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spaceballs.htm | accessdate=2010-02-12[/tpl]

===Critical reception===

The film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave positive reviews based on 35 reviews with an average rating of 6.2/10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spaceballs/ | title=Spaceballs Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=IGN Entertainment | work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2011-02-05[/tpl] At another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 46%, based on 14 reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/spaceballs | title=Spaceballs (1987): Reviews | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=2009-05-16[/tpl] Many critics agreed that, while it was funny, doing a Star Wars parody ten years after the original film had been released seemed slightly pointless.  Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked "I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival. (Spaceballs) should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for Star Wars satires had been completely exhausted."[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870624/REVIEWS/706240301/1023|title= Spaceballs — rogerebert.com | work=Chicago Sun-Times[/tpl]

==Sequel and animated series==

Breaking the fourth wall, the possibility of a sequel was already included in the film itself, with Yogurt's quote: "God willing, we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money". In September 2004, news about a sequel, parodying the Star Wars prequel trilogy, appeared on the internet.Slashdot September 29, 2004 A follow on to Spaceballs was eventually developedElizabeth Guider, "'Spaceballs' rolls to TV", Variety, January 19, 2005."'Spaceballs' to become TV cartoon", CNN, September 21, 2006. into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as Spaceballs: The Animated Series on G4 and the Canadian Super Channel.
Rick Moranis claimed in an interview that he pitched a potential sequel idea to Mel Brooks called, "Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II." However, Moranis added that he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/rick-moranis-discusses-sequels-to-spaceballs-and-being-approached-for-ghostbusters-3/|title=Rick Moranis Discusses Sequels To ‘Spaceballs’ and Being Approached for ‘Ghostbusters 3′|publisher=slashfilm.com|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl] 
In 1989, the movie Martians Go Home was distributed in the Italian market as Balle Spaziali 2 - La vendetta (Balle Spaziali being the localized title of Spaceballs).
