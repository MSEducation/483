[[1943 college football season]]

CATEGORIES: 1943 NCAA football season

The 1943 NCAA football season concluded with the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame crowned as the nation’s #1 team by a majority of the voters in the AP Poll, followed by the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks as the runner-up.  For the third time in the history of the AP Poll, a team that had lost a game was named mythical national champion; (Minnesota 1936 and Ohio State 1942). Notre Dame lost its final game of the season, a Chicago contest against the Great Lakes Naval Training Center.  Along the way, however, the Fighting Irish had played one of the toughest college schedules ever, beating two #2 ranked teams (Michigan and Iowa Pre-Flight) and two #3 ranked teams (Navy and Army).
In 1943, as many as 131 sportswriters participated in the AP poll, which included, for the first time, “service teams“.  Drawn from flight schools and training centers for participants in World War II, the service teams played against the colleges.  At the same time, a number of universities suspended their football programs.  Most of the members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) -- Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Mississippi State, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt -- did not field teams in 1943.  In addition, Pacific Coast Conference teams Oregon, Oregon State, Washington State, and Stanford, did not play, nor did Boston College, the Citadel, Duquesne, Fordham, Harvard, Michigan State, Syracuse, and William & Mary.
