Thomas Aloysius Burke (October 30, 1898[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]December 5, 1971) was a Democratic Party politician from Ohio.  He served as the 48th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio and in the United States Senate from November 10, 1953 until December 2, 1954. Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport is named after him.
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Burke served in the U.S. Army before attending the College of the Holy Cross and Western Reserve University Law School. After serving in various capacities in the law offices of the city of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, and the state of Ohio, Burke was elected Mayor of Cleveland in 1945. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Frank Lausche upon the death of Robert A. Taft. Burke lost a special election for the remainder of the term in late 1954 to George H. Bender by a very narrow margin.  Bender in turn lost to Lausche in 1956.
Burke resumed the practice of law forming the influential Cleveland law firm of Burke, Haber and Berick (now McDonald Hopkins Burke and Haber).
