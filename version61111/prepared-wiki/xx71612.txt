==Career==

===The Clash===

Terry Chimes was a member of the proto-punk band London SS, which also featured Mick Jones and Paul Simonon who, with Chimes, would team up with Joe Strummer and Keith Levene to form The Clash.
Both Chimes and Levene subsequently left, but Chimes was brought back to record the band's self-titled debut album, The Clash. On the album sleeve he was credited as Tory Crimes. After recording the album Chimes left the band once again and was replaced by Topper Headon.
In 1982, Headon was forced out of the band and Chimes was asked to rejoin for a U.S. tour, a brief tour supporting The Who, and the following UK tour. He was in the music video for the single, "Rock the Casbah".

===Other bands===

After leaving The Clash, Chimes drummed in bands including Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers briefly in 1977 and 1984, Cowboys International in 1979, Generation X from 1980 to 1981, Hanoi Rocks in 1985, The Cherry Bombz in 1986 (with ex Hanoi Rocks members Andy McCoy and Nasty Suicide and ex Sham 69/Wanderers/The Lords of the New Church Dave Tregunna) and Black Sabbath on their Eternal Idol Tour in 1987–88.[ref]blacksabbath.com – Band member page for Terry Chimes includes a photo of Chimes in a Black Sabbath video; he did not appear on any Sabbath recordings.
