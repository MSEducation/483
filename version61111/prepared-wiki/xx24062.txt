In 1762, Lomonosov presented an improved design of a reflecting telescope to the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. His telescope had its primary mirror adjusted at an angle of four degrees to the telescope's axis. This made the image focus at the side of the telescope tube, where the observer could view the image with an eyepiece without blocking the image. However, this invention was not published until 1827, so this type of telescope has become associated with a similar design by William Herschel, the Herschelian telescope."On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

===Chemist===

Lomonosov was the first person to record the freezing of mercury.  Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous evolution, he demonstrated the organic origin of soil, peat, coal, petroleum and amber. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of icebergs.[tpl]sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=[/tpl]

===Geographer===

Lomonosov's observation of iceberg formation led into his pioneering work in geography. Lomonosov got close to the theory of continental drift,Life and Death of Alfred Wegener by Alexey Fedorchuk [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] theoretically predicted the existence of Antarctica (he argued that icebergs of the South Ocean could be formed only on a dry land covered with ice),Eduard Belcher Prediction of Antarctica by Lomonosov  [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] and invented sea tools which made writing and calculating directions and distances easier. In 1764, he organized an expedition (led by Admiral Vasili Chichagov) to find the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by sailing along the northern coast of Siberia.[tpl]sfn|Menshutkin|1952|p=[/tpl]

===Mosaicist===

thumb|left|Grave of Lomonosov in Lazarev Cemetery, Alexander Nevsky Lavra, Saint PetersburgLomonosov was proud to restore the ancient art of mosaics. In 1754, in his letter to Leonhard Euler, he wrote that his three years of experiments on the effects of chemistry of minerals on their colour led to his deep involvement in the mosaic art. In 1763, he set up a glass factory that produced the first stained glass mosaics outside of Italy. There were forty mosaics attributed to Lomonosov, with only twenty-four surviving to the present day. Among the best is the portrait of Peter the Great and the Battle of Poltava, measuring 4.8 × 6.4 meters.[tpl]cite web|author=Elena Lavrenova |url=http://www.foxdesign.ru/aphorism/biography/lomonosov.html |title=Lomonosov biography |publisher=Foxdesign.ru |date= |accessdate=2 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.narfu.ru/lomonosov |title=М.

===Poet===

In 1755, he wrote a grammar that reformed the Russian literary language by combining Old Church Slavonic with the vernacular tongue. To further his literary theories, he wrote more than 20 solemn ceremonial odes, notably the Evening Meditation on the God's Grandeur. He applied an idiosyncratic theory to his later poems– tender subjects needed words containing the front vowel sounds E, I, Y and U, whereas things that may cause fear (like "anger", "envy", "pain" and "sorrow") needed words with back vowel sounds O, U and Y. That was a version of what is now called sound symbolism. Lomonosov published a history of Russia in 1760. In addition, he unsuccessfully attempted to write an epic about Peter the Great, to be based on the Aeneid by Vergil.

==Legacy==

His granddaughter Sophia Konstantinova (1769–1844) married Russian military hero and statesman General Nikolay Raevsky. His great-granddaughter was Princess Maria (Raevskaya) Volkonskaya, the wife of the Decembrist Prince Sergei Volkonsky.[tpl]cite book |last=Sutherland |first=Christine |title=The Princess of Siberia: The Story of Maria Volkonsky and the Decembrist Exiles |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-374-23727-1 [/tpl]
A lunar crater bears his name, as does a crater on Mars. In 1948, the underwater Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean was named in his honor.  Moscow State University was renamed '’M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University'’ in his honor in 1940.
The Lomonosov Gold Medal was established in 1959 and is awarded annually by the Russian Academy of Sciences to a Russian and a foreign scientist.
During the Soviet era a main street in Tallinn, Estonia, was named in his honor as "Lomonossovi M." but from 1991 it was renamed Gonsiori after Jakob Johann Gonsior a 19th Century alderman and lawyer.[tpl]cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Simon|title=A Rambling Dictionary of Tallinn Street Names|url=http://www.tallinnstreets.com/[/tpl]
