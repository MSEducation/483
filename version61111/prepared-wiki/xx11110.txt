CATEGORIES: Demographics of Sweden

The demography of Sweden is monitored by Statistics Sweden (SCB). As of 31 December 2013, Sweden's population was estimated to be 9.64 million people,[tpl]cite web|title=Statistikdatabasen|url=http://www.scb.se/|publisher=Statistics Sweden|accessdate=6 March 2014[/tpl] making it the 90th most populous country in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html |title=U.S. & World Population Clocks |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-06[/tpl] The three biggest cities are Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö.

===Sweden census 2005===

The 2005 Swedish census showed an increase of 475,322 compared to the 1990 census, an average increase of 31,680 annually. During the 1990s, birth rate increased by more than 100,000 children per year while death rates fell and immigration surged. In the early 2000s, birth rate declined as immigration increased further, with the context of unrest in the Middle East, upholding steady population growth.http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb/article.aspx?id=10161[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/meetings/egm/Symposium2001/docs/symposium_13.htm Note Second link is as accessed November 2011: Only a paper "The 2005 population and housing census in Sweden will be totally register-based" on how the census was done, no information on results.

===Ethnicity===

The majority of the population are Swedes. The Sweden Finns are the largest ethnic minority comprising approximately 50,000 along the Swedish-Finnish border, and 450,000 first and second generation immigrated ethnic Finns, mainly living in the Mälaren Valley region. In addition, Sweden's indigenous population groups includes the Sami people, historically a nomadic raindeer herding group that has been native to Fenno-Scandinavia for at least 5000 years.[tpl]Cite book|title=Lapps and Labyrinths: Saami Prehistory, Colonization, and Cultural Resilience |last=Broadbent|first=Noel |authorlink= |date=March 16, 2010 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-9788460-6-0|page= 304|url=[/tpl] Today, the Sami language holds the status of official minority language in four municipalities in the Norrbotten county.

==Migration==

===Immigration===

As of 2011, Statistics Sweden reported that around 19.6% or 1.858.000 inhabitants of Sweden had foreign background, defined as born abroad or born in Sweden by two parents born abroad.http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart26041.aspx Foreign background include foreign-born and Swedish-born with two foreign-born parents

====Demographics====

According to Eurostat, in 2010, there were 1.33 million foreign-born residents in Sweden, corresponding to 14.3% of the total population. Of these, 859,000 (9.2%) were born outside the EU and 477,000 (5.1%) were born in another EU Member State.6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad, Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.http://www.ssd.scb.se/databaser/makro/SaveShow.asp

The seven successor states of Yugoslavia (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro) has a combined population of 159,302 persons residing in Sweden which would make them the second most numerous after Finland.
The number of Assyrians in Sweden is about 100,000 – 120,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurfedling.org/Sweden.htm |title=Sweden National Institutions for Language |publisher=Eurfedling.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/brief.html |title=History of Assyrians |publisher=Aina.org |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl]
The ten fastest growing groups of foreign-born residents in Sweden between 2012 and 2013 were the following nationalities:

====History====

Immigration increased markedly with World War II. Historically, the most numerous of foreign born nationalities are ethnic Germans from Germany and other Scandinavians from Denmark and Norway.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] In short order, 70,000 war children were evacuated from Finland, of which 15,000 remained in Sweden. Also, many of Denmark's nearly 7,000 Jews who were evacuated to Sweden decided to remain there.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
A sizable community from the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) arrived during the Second World War.The Swedish Integration Board (2006). Pocket Facts: Statistics on Integration. Integrationsverket, 2006. ISBN 91-89609-30-1. Available online in pdf format. Retrieved 14 February 2007.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the recruitment of immigrant labor was an important factor of immigration. The Nordic countries signed a trade agreement in 1952, establishing a common labour market and free movement across borders. This migration within the Nordic countries, especially from Finland to Scandinavia,  was essential to create the tax-base required for the expansion of the strong public sector now charactreristic of Scandinavia.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] 
This continued until 1967, when the labour market became saturated, and Sweden introduced new immigration controls.
On a smaller scale, Sweden took in political refugees from Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia after their countries were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1956 and 1968 respectively.

====Contemporary immigration====

Since the early 1970s, immigration to Sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in the Middle East and Latin America.Sweden: Restrictive Immigration Policy and Multiculturalism, Migration Policy Institute, 2006.

Immigration of Iraqis increased dramatically during the Iraq War, during 2003 to 2007.  A total of  8,951 Iraqis came to Sweden in 2006, accounting for 45% of the entire Iraqi migration to Europe. By 2007, the community of Iraqis in Sweden numbered above 70,000. In 2008, Sweden introduced tighter rules on asylum seekers.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL06873099 | title =Sweden tightens rules on Iraqi asylum seekers | date=2007-07-06 | accessdate =2010-12-14 | publisher =reuters.com[/tpl]

===Emigration===

In the 19th century, Sweden's yearly population growth rate peaked at 1.2% (i.e. it doubled in less than 60 years), compared to 1% today (migration excluded). This considerable population growth rate led, before the Industrial Revolution, to a pauperization of the rural population, for each generation inherited smaller and smaller shares. Due to years of crop failure in the 1840s and 1860s, the U.S. Homestead Act of 1862, and to a lesser extent religious persecution, emigration started and grew. Between 1850 and 1930 1,050,000 Swedes emigrated (re-migration excluded), chiefly to Canada, U.S. and to Denmark. If they had not left, Sweden's population would have been about 2,000,000 higher today, assuming famine and civil war would not have resulted from their staying. (After 1929 the net-migration has been directed towards Sweden.)
The re-migration of Swedish nationals from the U.S. was culturally more important than the absolute figures reveal. The re-migrants often re-settled in their native parish, where their relative wealth and foreign experience ensured a prestigious position in the community. U.S. views, values and not the least world-view followed the re-migrants, ensuring a popular perception of closeness to U.S., contrary to the situation in for instance neighbouring Denmark or Finland (and contrary to the Swedish elite's closeness to Germany and Continental Europe).

==Language==

The Swedish language is by far the dominating language in Sweden, and is used by the government administration.
Since 1999, Sweden has five officially recognized minority languages: Sami, Meänkieli, Standard Finnish, Romani chib and Yiddish.
The Sami language, spoken by about 7,000 people in Sweden, may be used in government agencies, courts, preschools and nursing homes in the municipalities of Arjeplog, Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Kiruna and its immediate neighbourhood.
Similarly, Finnish and Meänkieli can be used in the municipalities of Gällivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and Övertorneå and its immediate neighbourhood. 
Finnish is also official language, along with Swedish, in the city of Eskilstuna[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl].
During the mid to late 20th century, immigrant communities brought other languages, among others being Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, Arabic, Neo-Aramaic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SE |title=Sweden |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl]

==Religion==

Although only one fifth of Swedes in one investigation chose to describe themselves as believing in a god,Sifo, Din egen livsåskådning the majority (67.5%) of the population belongs to the Church of Sweden,Church of Sweden: Svenska kyrkans medlemsutveckling år 1972-2012 the Lutheran church that was disestablished in 2000. This is because until 1996, those who had family members in the church automatically became members at birth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Other Christian denominations in Sweden include the Roman Catholic Church (see Catholic Church of Sweden), several Orthodox churches in diaspora, Baptist, Pentecostal, Neo-pietistic (nyevangeliska) and other evangelical Christian churches (frikyrkor = "free churches"). Shamanism persisted among the Sami people up until the 18th century, but no longer exists in its traditional form as most Sami today belong to the Lutheran church.
Jews were permitted to practice their religion in five Swedish cities in 1782, and enjoy full rights as citizens since 1870. The new Freedom of Religion Bill was passed in 1951, and former obstacles against Non-Lutherans working in schools and hospitals were removed. Further, that bill made it legal to leave any religious denomination, without entering another. There are also a number of Muslims, Buddhists, and Bahá'í in Sweden, mainly from immigration.
