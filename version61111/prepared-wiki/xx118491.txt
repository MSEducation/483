Samphrey ([tpl]lang-non|Sandfriðarey[/tpl]) is an uninhabited island in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. One of Fair Isle's old names is "Friðarey" which is of similar origin.
It is situated in the southern end of Yell Sound, between the Mainland, Shetland at Mossbank and the island of Yell. On the O-S 1:50,000 map it covers an area of about 66 ha (including the once separate island of Bunglan}.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst15077.html | title=Samphrey| publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland| accessdate=18 December 2009[/tpl] It is in the parish of Delting.
To the north west of Samphrey is Bunglan, which was once an island in its own right, but has become silted up by two tombolos, which now connect it to Samphrey. There is a small loch between Bunglan and Samphrey proper, which can just about be seen on the aerial picture.
Blaeu[tpl]dn|date=November 2012[/tpl] calls the island "Sancterre" (Holy Land) in the 17th century, lending the island another intriguing etymology.
