The United States House of Representatives election in Vermont, 2006 was held on November 7, 2006 for representation of Vermont's at-large congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from January 3, 2007 to January 3, 2009.
Incumbent Congressman Bernie Sanders, an independent member of Congress who caucused with the Democrats, did not seek a ninth term in the House, instead embarking on a successful run for the United States Senate.
To replace Congressman Sanders, Democrat Peter Welch defeated Republican Martha Rainville by a surpisingly narrow margin in staunchly-liberal Vermont.
