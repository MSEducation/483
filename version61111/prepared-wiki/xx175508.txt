The Lynwood Theatre is a moviehouse in Bainbridge Island, Kitsap County, Washington.  The theatre specializes in showcasing independent and foreign films.
The Lynwood Theatre opened its doors on July 3, 1936.  It was the first theatre on Bainbridge Island to show "talkies."  The founders of the Lynwood Theatre, Edna and Emmanuel Olson, wanted to provide a modern alternative to the silent-picture cinemas which existed on Bainbridge Island in 1936.  Today, the alternative spirit of the Lynwood Theatre is still alive.  In addition to showing independent and foreign films which rarely get played at large, mainstream multiplexes, the Lywood Theatre operates with only one screen.  
The Lynwood Theatre is located at 4569 Lynwood Center Road in Bainbridge Island.
