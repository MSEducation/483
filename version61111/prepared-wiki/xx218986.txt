CATEGORIES: Princes of Anhalt-Zerbst, 1316 deaths, Year of birth unknown

Albert I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst (died 17 August 1316) was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. 
He was the eldest son of Siegfried I, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, by his wife Katharina, daughter of Birger jarl and sister of Kings Waldemar and Magnus III of Sweden.

==Life==

In 1290, after his father abdicated to become a preaching monk (German: [tpl]lang|de|Predigermönch[/tpl]), Albert inherited the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst and the towns of Dessau and Köthen. He later obtained a part of Zerbst still controlled by the Margraves of Brandenburg as a fiefdom. In 1295, Albert was the first member of the House of Ascania who entered "Burg" Köthen.
Together with Abbot Konrad of Nienburg he abolished the use of the Wendish language in his domains in 1293. He also participated in the siege of the Schloss Herlingsberg against Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Grubenhagen in 1291. 
After the murder of Albert I of Habsburg in 1308 he was suggested by his brother-in-law Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal, as a new German King, but had no success in obtaining this dignity.
