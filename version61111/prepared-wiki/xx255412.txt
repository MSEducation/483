Jack Falls is a British independent feature film starring Simon Phillips, Jason Flemying, Dexter Fletcher, Alan Ford, Adam Deacon, Martin Kemp, Tamer Hassan, Olivia Hallinan, Doug Bradley, Jing Lusi and Zach Galligan and the third installment in the Jack Says Trilogy, the first ever British film trilogy according to the British Film Institute. Based on the graphic novel of the same title by Paul Tanter, the movie is a contemporary film noir shot in London in high contrast black and white with splashes of colour particularly reminiscent of the Robert Rodriguez film Sin City, but with a harder, grittier edge. Although a stand-alone film, it follows on from the films Jack Says and Jack Said.
