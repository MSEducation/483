The Murinsel (German, literally Mur island) in Graz, Austria, is actually not an island at all, but an artificial floating platform in the middle of the Mur river. This landmark of Graz was designed by New York artist Vito Acconci on the occasion of Graz becoming the 2003 European Capital of Culture.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.graztourismus.at/cms/beitrag/10030647/2866010/ | title = Murinsel | publisher = Graz Tourism | accessdate = 2003-06-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0023872 | title = Mur Island (Graz, 2003) | work = Structurae | publisher = Wilhelm Ernst & Sohn Verlag | accessdate = 2003-06-28[/tpl]
The building is in the form of a giant sea shell and measures [tpl]convert|47|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Two footbridges connect it with both banks of the Mur. The center of the platform forms an amphitheatre. Below a twisted round dome there is a caf√© and a playground.
