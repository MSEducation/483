The Panavia Tornado Air Defence Variant (ADV) is a long-range, twin-engine interceptor version of the swing-wing Panavia Tornado. The aircraft's first flight was on 27 October 1979, and it entered service in 1986. It was retired on 22 March 2011 by the Royal Air Force, and is currently in service only with the Royal Saudi Air Force. It was also previously operated by the Italian Air Force.
The aircraft was originally designed to intercept Soviet bombers if they came in from the East to strike the United Kingdom. The Tornado ADV for the Royal Saudi Air Force were produced to F3 standard. Both the RAF and RSAF have or are replacing the Tornado ADV with the Eurofighter Typhoon.

==Design and development==

===Origins===

The Tornado ADV had its origins in an RAF requirement (Air Staff Requirement 395 or ASR.395), which called for a long-range interceptor to replace the Lightning F6 and Phantom FGR2. The requirement for a modern interceptor was driven by the threat posed by the large Soviet long-range bomber fleet, in particular the supersonic Tupolev Tu-22M.[tpl]harvnb|Eden|2004|p=370[/tpl] From the beginning of the Tornado IDS's development in 1968, the possibility of a variant dedicated to air defence had been quietly considered; several American aircraft had been evaluated but found to be unsuitable.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 3. The concept was not attractive to other European partners, thus UK proceeded alone; development of the Tornado ADV was approved on 4 March 1976, with British Aerospace (BAe, now BAE Systems) to provide 3 prototypes.[tpl]cite book |last=Taylor |year=2001 |pages=189–190[/tpl]Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 1.
The first prototype was rolled out at Warton on 9 August 1979, before making its maiden flight on 27 October 1979. The second and third development aircraft made their first flights on 18 July and 18 November 1980, respectively. During the flight testing, the ADV demonstrated noticeably superior supersonic acceleration to the IDS, even while carrying a full weapons loadout.Eagles 1991, p. 91. The testing of the prototypes was greatly aided by the use of real-time telemetry being broadcast back to ground technicians from aircraft in flight.Eagles 1991, pp. 90-91. The third prototype was primarily used in the testing of the new Marconi/Ferranti AI.24 Foxhunter airborne interception radar.Eagles 1991, p. 92.
The Tornado ADV's differences compared to the IDS include a greater sweep angle on the inboard fixed wing sections, deletion of the Krueger flaps and the port cannon, a longer radome for the Foxhunter radar, and a fuselage stretch of 1.36 m to allow the carriage of four Skyflash semi-active radar homing missiles.Laming 1996, p. 97. The stretch was applied to the Tornado front fuselage being built by the UK, with a plug being added immediately behind the cockpit, which had the incidental benefit of reducing drag and making space for an additional fuel tank (Tank '0') carrying [tpl]convert|200|impgal|L U.S.gal|0[/tpl] of fuel.Evans 1999, p.121 The artificial feel of the flight controls was lighter on the ADV than on the IDS.Eagles 1991, p. 89. Various internal avionics, pilot displays, guidance systems and software also differed; including an automatic wing sweep selector not fitted to the strike aircraft.Aeroguide 21 1988, pp. 6-7.
The Tornado F2 (sometimes written as F.2) was the initial version of the Tornado ADV in Royal Air Force service, with 18 being built. It first flew on 5 March 1984 and was powered by the same RB.199 Mk 103 engines used by the IDS Tornado, capable of four wing sweep settings, and fitted to carry only two underwing Sidewinder missiles.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 7. Serious problems were discovered with the Foxhunter radar, which meant that the aircraft were delivered with concrete and lead ballast installed in the nose as an interim measure until they could be fitted with the radar sets. The ballast was nicknamed Blue Circle, which was a play on the Rainbow Codes nomenclature, and a British brand of cement called Blue Circle.
A total of 165 Tornado ADVs were ordered by Britain, the majority being the Tornado F3.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 9.

===Further developments===

The Tornado F3 made its maiden flight on 20 November 1985. Enhancements over the F2 included RB.199 Mk 104 engines, which were optimised for high-altitude use with longer afterburner nozzles, the capacity to carry four underwing Sidewinder missiles rather than two, and automatic wing sweep control.Evans 1999, p. 126 The F3's primary armament when it was introduced into service was the short-range Sidewinder and the medium-range Skyflash missiles, a British design based on the American AIM-7 Sparrow.Butler 2001, p. 101.
In order to maintain the Tornado F3 as an effective platform up to its planned out-of-service date of 2010, the Ministry of Defence initiated the Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP). This project, announced on 5 March 1996, involved many elements, including the integration of ASRAAM and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, and radar upgrades to improve multi-target engagement. Additionally, pilot and navigator displays would be improved, along with the replacement of several of the onboard computer systems.Nicholas 2000, pp. 29–30. The CSP would see the removal of a non-standard state of aircraft; various upgrades, in particular to the Foxhunter radar, had led to a situation described as "fleets within fleets." The Foxhunter radar was a source of difficulties in the upgrade programme, in particular the integration of the new AMRAAM missile.Hall, Macer "RAF abandons missile system after near miss." The Telegraph, 23 January 2002.
The Tornado F3 was not able to exploit the full capabilities of either the AMRAAM or ASRAAM missiles. AMRAAM uses two mid-course updates after launch to refresh target information prior to its own seeker taking over, however the CSP did not include the datalink to provide this capability, as it was considered to be too expensive. In addition, the ASRAAM was not fully integrated, which prevented the full off-boresight capability of the missile being exploited.Nicholas 2000, p. 30. On 8 June 2001, the MoD signed a contract for a further upgrade to the F3 force to allow these midcourse updates. The upgrade to give full AMRAAM capability, together with updated IFF, known as the AMRAAM Optimisation Programme (AOP) was incorporated in the remaining F3 fleet between December 2003 and September 2006.[tpl]Cite news |last=Willis |first=David |date = December 2007|title=Tornado F.3 – At its Peak |periodical=Air International |place=Stamford, Lincs, England |publisher=Key Publishing |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=22–26 |issn=0306-5634[/tpl]
A further upgrade, disclosed in early 2003, was the integration of the ALARM anti-radiation missile to enable several Tornado ADVs to conduct suppression of enemy air defence (SEAD) missions.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/tornadof3.cfm|title= Tornado F3|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=26 March 2008 [/tpl] The F3's existing radar warning receivers formed the basis of an Emission Location System (ELS), which can be employed to detect and locate operational radar systems in the aircraft's vicinity. These modified aircraft were re-designated Tornado EF3 and operated by RAF No. 11 Squadron RAF.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vraf.org/11sqn.php|title=Welcome to the VRAF: Number XI Squadron|publisher=VRAF.org|accessdate=13 August 2011[/tpl]

===Performance===

The Tornado ADV was designed to serve in the role of an interceptor against the threat of Soviet bombers, rather than as an air superiority fighter for engaging in prolonged air combat manoeuvering with various types of enemy fighters.Eagles 1991, p. 88. In order to perform its anti-bomber primary mission, it was equipped with long range beyond visual range missiles such as the Skyflash, and later the AMRAAM; the aircraft also had the ability to stay aloft for long periods and remain over the North Sea and Northern Atlantic in order to maintain its airborne patrol.Butler 2001, [tpl]page needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] The Ministry of Defence acknowledged the Tornado ADV was not significantly superior as an aircraft to the Phantoms it had replaced in the air-defence role, however the capability of its weapon systems was a dramatic improvement; in particular the radar and onboard computer facilities.Smith 1980, p. 134. Compared with the Phantom, the ADV had greater acceleration, twice the range and loiter time, and was more capable of operating from short 'austere' air strips.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 2.
The Tornado's advanced avionics meant it could be more effective than previous British interceptors like the Lightning. While older aircraft were reliant on a network of ground-based radar stations, the onboard Foxhunter radar was capable of performing much longer and wider scans of surrounding airspace; the Tornado could track and engage targets at far greater distances. The Tornado also had the ability to share its radar and targeting information with other aircraft via JTIDS Link 16 and was one of the first aircraft to have a digital data bus, used for the transmission of data between onboard computers.Moir and Seabridge 2011, pp. 447–448.Aeroguide 21 1988, p. 6.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===

The Tornado F2 was first delivered to the RAF on 5 November 1984, and its short career came to an end after the Tornado F3 entered service. These aircraft were used primarily for training by No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit RAF until they were placed in storage. The F2s were intended to be updated to Tornado F2A standard (similar to the F3 but without the engine upgrade) but only one F2A, the Tornado Integrated Avionics Research Aircraft (TIARA) was converted, having been customised by QinetiQ for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trials at MoD Boscombe Down."Pilotless Passenger Jet Flown Remotely By RAF." Royal Air Force, 3 April 2007. Additionally, in 2007, QinetiQ rented four Tornado F3s from the MOD to support weapons testing activities."QinetiQ wins contract to use Tornado F3 for BVRAAM trials." QinetiQ, 16 May 2007.
Entering service in July 1986, 152 Tornado F3s were ordered. The Tornado F3 made its combat debut in the 1991 Gulf War with 18 aircraft deployed to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The aircraft deployed to the region were later upgraded in a crash program with improved radar and engines, better defensive countermeasures and several adaptions to the weapons systems to improve combat performance in the Iraqi theatre;Szejnmann 2010, pp. 214-215. however they still lacked modern IFF and secure communications equipment. They therefore flew patrols further back from Iraqi airspace where encounters with enemy aircraft were less likely, and did not get the opportunity to engage any enemy aircraft.Lake 1997, p. 126. From August 1990 to March 1991, the RAF's F3 detachment flew more than 2000 combat air patrol sorties.Szejnmann 2010, p. 216.
Following the Gulf War, the RAF maintained a small squadron of F3s in Saudi Arabia to continue routine patrols of Iraqi no-fly zones. The Tornado F3 saw further combat service, from 1993 to 1995 as escort fighters in Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia, and in 1999 flying combat air patrols during Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia;McGrath, Mark. "Tornado F3 Bows Out." Fence Check, Retrieved: 11 July 2012. during these extended overseas deployments, the F3 proved troublesome to maintain at operational readiness when based outside the UK.Szejnmann 2010, pp. 221-222. Following lengthy delays in the Eurofighter programme to develop a successor to the F3 interceptor, in the late 1990s the RAF initiated a major upgrade program to enhance the aircraft's capabilities, primarily by integrating several newer air-to-air missiles.Szejnmann 2010, p. 222.
In 2003, the Tornado F3 was one of the assets used in Operation Telic, Britain's contribution to the Iraq War. An expeditionary force composed of 43 and 111 Squadrons (known as Leuchars Fighter Wing) was deployed to the region to carry out offensive counter-air operations. The Tornado F3's of Leuchars Fighter Wing operated all over Iraq, including missions over and around Baghdad, throughout Operation Telic. Due to a lack of airborne threats materialising in the theatre, the F3s were withdrawn and returned to European bases that same year."U.K. Begins Moving Some Forces Home." newsmax.com, 12 April 2003.
As part of Delivering Security in a Changing World, the British Government's 2003 Defence White Paper, on 21 July 2004, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the number of Tornado F3 squadrons by one to three squadrons."Hoon announces broad military cuts." The Scotsman, 21 July 2004. This represented 16 aircraft and was the first stage in the transition to the F3's replacement, the Eurofighter Typhoon, which entered operational service with the RAF in 2005. In April 2009, it was announced that the Tornado F3 force would be reduced to one squadron of 12 aircraft in September 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/britisharmedforces/Historic-squadron-is-disbanded-.5179515.jp|title=Historic squadron is disbanded – but Fighting Cocks may fly again|last=Urquhart|first=Frank|date=17 April 2009|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=13 May 2009[/tpl] The last operational Tornado F3s in RAF service were retired when No. 111 Squadron RAF, located at RAF Leuchars, was disbanded on 22 March 2011.Hoyle, Craig. "UK retires last Tornado F3 fighters." Flight International, 22 March 2011.
QinetiQ's four F3s remained flying after the RAF's retirement of the type, being used for testing of the MBDA Meteor air-to-air missile, and thus were the only flying examples in the UK. The final mission was flown on 20 June 2012, and the last three flown to RAF Leeming for scrapping on 9 July 2012.Lake, Jon. "Meteor Development Complete".

===Italian Air Force===

In the early 1990s the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana, or AMI) identified a requirement for a fighter to boost its air defence capabilities pending introduction of the Eurofighter Typhoon. These fighters were to operate alongside the service's obsolescent F-104ASA Starfighters. The Tornado ADV was selected from, amongst others, the F-16. On 17 November 1993, Italy signed an agreement with the RAF to lease 24 Tornado F3s from the RAF for a period of ten years.[tpl]cite news |last= Sacchetti |first= Renzo |title= Italy's British Tornados |work=AirForces Monthly |page= 50 |publisher=Key Publishing |date = October 2003|accessdate=2 October 2006[/tpl] At this time the Eurofighter Typhoon was expected to begin entry into service around 2000.Bevins, Anthony and Chris Godsmark. "£15bn go-ahead for Eurofighter." The Independent, 3 September 1996.
First training of AMI pilots began in March 1995 at RAF Coningsby while technicians gained experience at RAF Cottesmore and Coningsby. The first aircraft was accepted on 5 July 1995 and flown to its Italian base the same day. Delivery of the first batch was completed by 1996; these aircraft were deployed at Gioia del Colle in Southern Italy."Italian air force faces tough 12 months as cash cuts bite." Flight International, 11 January 1995. The second batch was delivered between February and July 1997, these aircraft were of a slightly higher specification. In early 1997, the AMI cancelled a series of scheduled upgrades to its Tornado fleet, stating that it was placing priority for funding on the developing Eurofighter instead."Italy cuts projects to protect EF2000 interest". Flight International, 12 March 1997.
In 2000, with major delays hampering the Eurofighter, the AMI began a search for another interim fighter. While the Tornado itself was considered, any long term extension to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States."Italy to lease 35 F-16 jets from USA until Eurofighter operational". ANSA News Agency, 1 February 2001. The AMI returned its Tornados to the RAF, with the final aircraft arriving at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004. One aircraft was retained by the Italian Air Force for static display purposes.[tpl]cite news |title= Final AMI Tornados F3s Returned |work=AirForces Monthly |page=9 |publisher=Key Publishing |date = February 2005|accessdate=20 October 2006[/tpl]

===Royal Saudi Air Force===

On 26 September 1985, Saudi Arabia and Britain signed a memorandum of understanding towards what would be widely known as the Al-Yamamah arms deal, for the provision of various military equipment and services."Briefing for the Prime Minister's Meeting with Prince Sultan." Ministry Of Defence, 26 September 1985. The September 1985 deal involved the purchase of a large number of Tornado aircraft; including the Tornado ADV variant, along with armaments, radar equipment, spare parts and a pilot-training programme for the inbound fleet, in exchange for providing 600,000 barrels of oil per day over the course of several years.Cordesman 2003, pp. 217-218. The first Al-Yamamah agreement ordered 24 Tornado ADVs and 48 Tornado IDSs. The RSAF received its first ADV on 9 February 1989.
Historian Anthony Cordesman commented that "the Tornado ADV did not prove to be a successful air defence fighter... The RSAF's experience with the first eight Tornado ADVs was negative".Cordesman 2003, pp. 218-219. In 1990, the RSAF signed several agreements with the US to later receive deliveries of the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, and thus had a reduced need for the Tornado ADV;"BAE official denies reports of Tornado sale cancellation." Defense Daily, 5 October 1990. Saudi Arabia chose to convert further orders for up to 60 Tornado ADVs to the IDS strike variant instead.Cordesman 2003, pp. 219.
In 1991, during Operation Desert Storm over neighbouring Iraq, RSAF Tornado ADVs flew 451 air-defence sorties, operating in conjunction with RSAF F-15s.Al Saud, Turki K. "The Royal Saudi Air Force and Long-term Saudi National Defence: A Strategic Vision." United States Marines Corps Command and Staff College, 6 May 2002. In 2006, it was announced that, in addition to Saudi Arabia's contract to purchase the Eurofighter Typhoon, both the Tornado IDS and ADV fleets would undergo a £2.5 billion program of upgrades, allowing them to remain in service to at least 2020."The 2006 Saudi Shopping Spree: BAE Wins Tornado Fleet Upgrade Contract." Defense Industry Daily, 12 September 2006. As of 2011, the RSAF's long-term plan to retire the Tornado ADV, the Eurofighter is the intended successor in the air-defence role.
