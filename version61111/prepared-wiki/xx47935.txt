CATEGORIES: Districts of North Rhine-Westphalia, Coesfeld (district)

Coesfeld ([tpl]IPA-de|ˈkoːsfɛlt[/tpl]) is a Kreis (district) in the northwestern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, west of the city of Münster. Neighboring districts are Steinfurt, district-free Münster, Warendorf, district-free Hamm, Unna, Recklinghausen, Borken.

==History==

In medieval times the region was subordinate to the bishopric of Münster. When the area became part of the Prussian province Westphalia in 1816 the new administration created two districts, Coesfeld and Lüdinghausen. Except minor changes they stayed until the major reorganization in 1975 when both were merged to form the current district. A few municipalities from the district Münster were also added, while others formerly belonging to the district were moved to neighboring districts.

==Geography==

The district is located in the Münsterland, a mostly rural area. The Lippe River forms part of the border of the district in the south.
