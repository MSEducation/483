==College career==

Upon graduating from Detroit Henry Ford High School in 1975, Kelser was brought to Michigan State by Gus Ganakas, who left the head coach position after Kelser's freshman season. His impressive on-court skills earned him the sobriquet "Special K", after a popular, locally-made cereal. In his junior year (the freshman year for Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Jay Vincent) under coach Jud Heathcote, the Spartan squad had an impressive season, racking up a 25â€“5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA tournament,Michigan State Michigan State University Spartans, Official Athletic Site - Michigan State where they made it to the regional finals before losing narrowly to eventual champion Kentucky.1978 NCAA Basketball Tournament (ShrpSports.Com) As a senior, he along with Johnson led the Spartans to the 1979 NCAA tournament championship, the first in the school's history. He was often on the receiving end of spectacular alley-oop passes from Johnson. He later wrote a book about his basketball experiences at MSU.[ref]
