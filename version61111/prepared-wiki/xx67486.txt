[[Manchu family name]]

CATEGORIES: Kinship and descent, Manchu people, Chinese history stubs

Like the Mongols, the Manchus were simply called by given name but they had their own clan names (hala in Manchu). Hala consisted of several mukūn, the unit of exogamy. Unlike hala, mukūn did not have corresponding names.
The Comprehensive Book of the Eight Manchurian Banners' Surname-Clans (八旗滿洲氏族通譜 Baqi Manzhou Zhizu Tongpu), compiled in the middle 18th century, records many Manchu clan names. Among more than a thousand names, about 600 names are the Manchus'.
Gioro, one of major names, is the only name that has various suffix such as Irgen, Silin and Šušu, possibly to distinguish from the imperial family name Aisin-Gioro.  Since the mid-to-late Qing Dynasty, Manchus have increasingly adopted Chinese surnames, and today, very few Manchus bear traditional Manchu family name.
