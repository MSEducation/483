A follow-up was released in Japan titled SNK Arcade Classics 0. The reason for the title having a "0" is because the titles in this collection were introduced before the Neo Geo was established.'SNK Arcade Classics 0' for PSP goes deep into the back catalog

All the games are modified to work with in-game medals as well as some controls displayed on screen.
Between the three versions, the Wii version is considered the definitive one. The PS2 and PSP versions had considerable amounts of slowdown (especially with Shock Troopers on the PSP), compared to the slowdown-free Wii version.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/893/893259p1.html |title=SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 Review - IGN |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15[/tpl] The Wii version also supported 480p and 4 different control schemes.
