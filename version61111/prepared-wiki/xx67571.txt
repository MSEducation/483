==History==

Plans for an airport in Kalamazoo began in 1925. In May 1926 the City of Kalamazoo purchased [tpl]convert|383|acre|km2[/tpl] near Portage and Kilgore roads and an airport opened. The first regular air mail service started in July 1928. In February 1929 the field was licensed as the first municipal airport in Michigan.Kalamazoo Gazette August 8, 1989, p. D2 It was named Lindbergh Field in honor of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh.
Airline service came to Kalamazoo in May 1944. Two commuter airlines, Francis Airways and Northern Skyways, provided service to other Michigan cities, then ceased after two years. From 1946 and 1955, several small airlines offered commuter flights to nearby cities.
In May 1955, North Central Airlines began daily service to Detroit, and Chicago. North Central eventually became Republic Airlines, which became Northwest Airlines, and finally merged with Delta Air Lines - which serves the airport today.
In 1961 an air traffic control tower was built and the main runway was extended from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963 an instrument landing system was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977 the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet.
In 1975 the regional air traffic control facility was moved from Battle Creek to Kalamazoo, and in 1978, a radar facility was installed. The airport eventually won an award for the safest and most efficient air traffic control system in the Great Lakes region.
In 1982 the Core Council decided that the City of Kalamazoo should no longer bear the full cost of operating the airport, and in 1984, the City transferred ownership to the County of Kalamazoo. In 1989, the name was changed from Kalamazoo County Airport to Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International to stimulate economic growth in the Battle Creek area. That year, the County also renovated the terminal, doubling its size and expanding the ramp. Over the next four years, annual passenger traffic grew from 200,000 to more than 500,000.Kalamazoo Gazette December 20, 1989 p. A1
In 2011 the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport was served by two major airlines who fly passengers to major hubs with worldwide connections. There was also a public charter airline operating twice weekly from Kalamazoo to locations in Florida.Kalamazoo/ Battle Creek International Airport (AZO)
As of May 2012 the airport is served by two major commercial airlines who fly passengers to three major hubs. The public charter Direct Air was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012, and has since ceased all operations.

===Major jetport===

In the 1970s there were discussions between airline and local city officials about building a new airport to serve Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. Since the two airports are close, it was not economical for the airlines to fully serve both of the airports. North Central airlines proposed a "Major Jetport" in the Kalamazoo area, which might have become the third-busiest commuter airport in the nation. No location could be agreed upon, and no planning was ever completed beyond the preliminary proposals and meetings. Soon after the concept failed, most airline service was shifted to Kalamazoo, as the Kalamazoo airport had higher passenger counts and more demand for flights.''Kalamazoo Gazette April 14, 1971 p.1

==Operations==

===General aviation===

Kalamazoo Airport is used by transient and local private pilots flying for personal reasons, business, or recreation. Many local pilots keep their aircraft in the south tee hangar complex.
In 1955 the Kalamazoo-based Upjohn pharmaceutical company began operating aircraft for its executives from the airport.
This continued after the firm was acquired by Pfizer. In 1997 after Pharmacia & Upjohn moved its North American sales office from Michigan to New Jersey, the company made daily service to New Jersey available to all employees on a 10-seat jet. Pfizer expanded the service after acquiring Pharmacia Corp. in 2003, and based two 36-passenger jets at the airport. But in June 2008, the aviation unit was closed after 53 years to save money. The move axed 27 jobs; the aircraft were moved to Trenton, N.J. As of April 2009, the hangar and property at the Kalamazoo Airport were up for sale.
General aviation aircraft are served by many fixed base operators (FBOs).
There are currently four organizations at the airport that offer fixed based operator services for general aviation users. One name familiar to the area we live in also resides in Kalamazoo. Duncan Aviation, which is located on the west side of the airfield, offers a large variety of services as it is the only full-service fixed based operator on the field. Duncan handles the traditional FBO services such as fueling. Maintenance, hangaring, aircraft movement, and many other ground services while also providing weather equipment and crew rest areas for pilots. They also offer passenger service such as rental and courtesy cars, restrooms vending, and a lobby area. The Duncan facility is the terminal for entrance to the general aviation side of the airport. Kalamazoo Aircraft is another major fixed based operator at the airport that offers maintenance services to smaller general aviation aircraft; they offer inspections, maintenance, repairs, and alterations. The third FBO on the field is the Kalamazoo Pilots Association which operates a self-service fueling pump in the hangar area. The last fixed based operator is Aviation Assets which conducts a flight training school on the north side of the airport.

===Flight training===

As of 2011, flight training is offered through Great Lakes Aviation Service.
The Western Michigan University College of Aviation, founded in 1939, used the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport as a base for its flight school until 1997. In the early 1990s, the flight school began to outgrow the facilities, and in 1997, the college moved to Battle Creek's W. K. Kellogg Airport, where all operations are presently housed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/aviation/about.html |title=About | Aviation | Western Michigan University |publisher=Wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2012[/tpl] The WMU aviation unit at Kalamazoo has been used from time to time by the college, but not since May 2006.
In the 1970s, private flight training operations were restricted to two local FBOs: Kal Aero, and Lakala Aviation. The county government received many complaints about unauthorized lessons from private parties. Upon these reports, the county government added to the flight training ordinance that violators could be fined $500, or jailed for 90 days if found guilty of offering flight lessons illegally.Kalamazoo Gazette July 1, 1971 This restriction has since been lifted, and flight lessons can be offered by any party who wishes to do so.

===TRACON===

As of March 2014, Air Traffic Control services for aircraft operating within the lateral and vertical limits of the Kalamazoo TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) are being provided from a new ATC facility located at the east side of the airport.  Edward Bowe, a Front Line Manager at the AZO ATC facility, will retire April 1st, 2014 after serving the community at Kalamazoo for 30 years and 10 months.

==Airlines and destinations==

The airport is currently served by two commercial passenger airlines which operate service to three hubs. Several airlines such as United and USAirways have ceased service to Kalamazoo in the last several years. 

On March 13, 2012, Direct Air suspended all their flights until May 15 because their fuel supplier stopped supplying fuel.[tpl]cite news |last= Bomkamp |first= Samantha |url= http://www.woodtv.com/dpp/news/local/kalamazoo_and_battle_creek/Direct-Air-suspends-flights |title= Direct Air suspends flights til mid-May |work= WOOD-TV |date= March 13, 2012 |accessdate= March 13, 2012[/tpl]  The charter carrier, who offered flights from Kalamazoo to Orlando and Punta Gorda, was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012.[tpl]cite news |last= Heath |first= Dan |url= http://pressrepublican.com/breaking2/x1968911547/Direct-Air-bankruptcy-goes-to-Chapter-7 |title= Direct Air bankruptcy goes to Chapter 7 |work= Plattsburgh Press-Republican |date= April 12, 2012 |accessdate= April 12, 2012[/tpl]

===Competition===

The facility competes with airports in nearby communities such as South Bend, Grand Rapids and Detroit. Furthermore, the airport has used several grants and incentives to attract and retain additional flights and carriers in recent years.

==Terminal==

The original Kalamazoo terminal was a small building made with scrap materials left over from other local projects. In 1958 a new terminal was constructed to replace the 1920s terminal. The growth led to a terminal expansion in 1979 and the building increased from 12,000 to [tpl]convert|30000|sqft|m2[/tpl]. The terminal was completely renovated in 1989, with the addition of a new concourse, an enlarged boarding area, and a new baggage claim area.
The Kalamazoo Airport's 1958 terminal had two jetways and housed the air traffic control tower. A Non-Radar Approach Control, located in Battle Creek and servicing Kalamazoo, was Commissioned in 1969.  The air traffic control tower provides ATC services between the hours of 6:00-23:00 local time. When the control tower is operational, the airport lies within FAA Class "D" airspace.  When the approach control is operational pilots may elect to receive radar services associated within a Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA).  The Terminal Control Center (TRACON) facility was not established until 1975, and radar was not installed until 1978.
In 2009 construction on a new terminal began next to the existing facility. The new terminal, designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills, opened in April 2011, and accommodates additional passenger gates, security lanes, and baggage carousels.http://www.kalcounty.com/board/meetings/mincow/11-01-05mincow.pdfRusson, Gabrielle.

==Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum==

Commonly referred to as the "Air Zoo", the museum offers many historic aircraft, simulators, restaurant, and one of the regions only 4-D theater. The museum is housed in two buildings, and is located on the south section of the field. It is an attraction for the public, and for pilots. The museum also has a fly in ramp, making it an attraction for many visiting pilots.  In June and October 2011 the Air Zoo opened a new [tpl]convert|50000|ft2|m2[/tpl]  building connecting it to the main building allowing all the attractions and exhibits to be in one easy to see location.  The original building (East Campus) was renovated to house the restoration center.Air Zoo :: General Information :: Admission info, business conference rental, memberships, about Kalamazoo and contact informationGoogle Maps
