===Vietnam===

The commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the President of Vietnam, through his post as Chairman of the Defense and Security Council, though this position is nominal and real power is assumed by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The secretary of Central Military Commission (usually the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam) is the de facto Commander. The Minister of Defence oversees operations of the Ministry of Defence, and the VPA. He also oversees such agencies as the General Staff and the General Logistics Department. However, military policy is ultimately directed by the Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam.

==Others as commanders-in-chief==

===Ethiopia===

The 1995 Constitution designates the Prime Minister of Ethiopia as "Commander-in-Chief of the national armed forces" in Article 74(1).[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.hofethiopia.gov.et/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=13311&folderId=94921&name=DLFE-322.pdf | title = Constitution of Ethiopia | publisher = House of Federation | accessdate = 2014-01-21 [/tpl]

===Germany===

Upon the re-militarization of West Germany in 1955, when it joined NATO, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany was amended in 1956 to include constitutional provisions for the command of the armed forces.
The rationale for placing the command authority over the armed forces directly with the responsible minister in charge of the military establishment, and thus breaking with the German constitutional tradition (in both earlier monarchical and republican systems) of placing it with the head of state, was that in a democratic parliamentary system the command authority should directly reside where it would be exercised and where it is subject to the parliamentarian control of the Bundestag at all times. By assigning it directly to the responsible minister, instead of with the Federal Chancellor at all times, also meant that military policy is but one part of the many integrated responsibilities of the government; in contrast of earlier times when the separate division of the military from the civil administration allowed it to act as a state within a state.[tpl]de icon[/tpl] Die Befehls- und Kommandogewalt des Art. 65a GG im Lichte ..., Retrieved on 2013-08-21.[tpl]de icon[/tpl] Politik und Militär in Deutschland: die Bundespräsidenten und Bundeskanzler und ihre Beziehung zu Soldatentum und Bundeswehr, 2011.

====Pre-1945====

During the Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, Weimar Republic and the Nazi era, whoever was the head of state—the King of Prussia/German Emperor (under the Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia/Constitution of the German Empire) to 1918, the Reichspräsident (under the Weimar Constitution) to 1934, and the Führer from 1934—was the Head of the Armed Forces. The Each branch had its own commander-in-chief, holding the highest rank; in the case of the Reichsheer, a Generaloberst; in the Reichsmarine, an Admiral.
When Adolf Hitler assumed power, he granted his war minister, Generalfeldmarschall Werner von Blomberg, the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. However, in 1938, Hitler withdrew the Commander-in-Chief title, abolished the war ministerial post and assumed personal command of the Armed Forces.

====East Germany====

The parliament of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Volkskammer, enacted on 13 February 1960 the "Law on the Formation of the National Defense Council of the GDR", which established a council consisting of a chairman and at least 12 members.  This was later incorporated into the GDR Constitution in April 1968.  The National Defense Council held the supreme command of the National People's Army (including the internal security forces), and the Council's chairman (usually the General Secretary of the ruling Socialist Unity Party) was considered the GDR's commander-in-chief.  The GDR joined with the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990, upon which the GDR's constitution and armed forces were abolished.

===Israel===

In Israel, the applicable basic law states that the ultimate authority over the Israel Defense Forces rests with the Government of Israel (chaired by the Prime Minister) as a collective body. The authority of the Government is exercised by the Minister of Defense on behalf of the Government, and subordinate to the Minister is the Chief of General Staff who holds the highest level of command within the military.Basic Law of Israel: The Military, Knesset.

===Japan===

In Japan, prior to the Meiji Restoration the role of the commander-in-chief was vested in the Shogun (The most militarily powerful Samurai daimyo). After the dissolution of the Tokugawa Shogunate the role of the commander-in-chief, resided with the Emperor of Japan. The present-day constitutional role of the Emperor is that of a ceremonial figurehead without any military role.
After Japan's move towards democracy, the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Self-Defence Forces is held by the Prime Minister of Japan. Military authority runs from the Prime Minister to the cabinet-level Minister of Defense of the Japanese Ministry of Defense.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Japan | title = Self Defense Forces | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ | accessdate = 2012-07-15 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | oclc = 56431036[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url = http://www.mod.go.jp/e/about/organization/reorganized/p4-5.pdf | title = The Ministry of Defense Reorganized: For the Support of Peace and Security | year = 2007 | publisher = Japan Ministry of Defense | location = Tokyo | pages = 4–5| format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mod.go.jp/gsdf/about/branches/index.html | title = 職種　Branches of Service | year = 2012 | publisher = Japan Ground Self-Defense Force | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | accessdate = 15 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Nihon Daihyakka Zensho (Nipponika) | title = 自衛隊: 組織  | url = http://rekishi.jkn21.com/| accessdate = 2012-07-15 | year = 2012 | publisher = Shogakukan | location = Tokyo | language = Japanese | trans_title = JSDF: Organization | oclc = 153301537[/tpl]

===Netherlands===

The Constitution of the Netherlands states, in article 97, that "the Government shall have supreme authority over the armed forces". Article 42 defines the Government as the Monarch and the ministers, and that only ministers are responsible for acts of government. Article 45 further defines the ministers as constituting the Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, with "authority to decide upon overall government policy".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.government.nl/files/documents-and-publications/regulations/2012/10/18/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-the-netherlands-2008.pdf | title = The Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 2008 | publisher = Government of the Netherlands | accessdate = 2014-02-10 [/tpl]

===North Korea===

The Constitution of North Korea is ambiguous about which official really is the country’s head of state. 
In any case, the North Korean constitution, in article 102, is quite explicit regarding which official commands the armed forces:
[tpl]Quote|The Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the supreme commander of the whole armed forces of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and commands and directs all the armed forces of the State.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/great/constitution.php?8 | title = DPRK Constitution (Chapter VI State Organs, Section 2.

===People's Republic of China===

Article 93 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China places the authority to direct the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of China on the Central Military Commission; composed of a Chairman, and an unspecified number of Vice-Chairmen and members. The same article also states that the Chairman of the Central Military Commission assumes overall responsibility for the work of the Central Military Commission, and that it is responsible to the National People’s Congress and its Standing Committee.[tpl]cite web | url = http://english.gov.cn/2005-08/05/content_20813.htm | title = Constitution | publisher = Government of the People's Republic of China | accessdate = 2014-01-21 [/tpl]
Furthermore, Article 80 gives the President of the People's Republic of China (in addition to representational head of state duties) the power to proclaim martial law, proclaim a state of war, and to issue mobilisation orders upon the decision of National People's Congress and its Standing Committee.
The CMC Chairman and the President of the People’s Republic are distinctly separate offices and they have not always been held by the same persons. However, beginning in 1993, during the tenure of Jiang Zemin as CMC Chairman and General Secretary of the Communist Party, it has been standard practice to have the President, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and the General Secretary of the Communist Party to be normally held by the same person; although the slight differences in the start and end of terms for those respective offices means that there is some overlap between an occupant and his predecessor.

====Hong Kong SAR====

When Hong Kong was under British authority, civilian Governor was ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong. After the territory's handover to the People's Republic of China in 1997, the commander of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison are PLA personnel from the mainland China.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, with the Ordinance of Alsnö in 1280, nobles were exempted from land taxation if they provided cavalrymen to the King's service. Following the Swedish War of Liberation (1521–53) from the Kalmar Union, a Guards Regiment was formed under the King and from there the modern Swedish Army has its roots. During the age of the Swedish Empire, several kings—Gustavus Adolphus, Charles X, Charles XI & Charles XII—personally led their forces into battle. Under the Instrument of Government of 1809, which was in force until the current Instrument of Government of 1974 went into force on 1 January 1975; the Monarch was in §§ 14-15 explicitly designated as the Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces ([tpl]lang-sv|Högste befälhavare[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20100831012655/http://www.sns.se/zino.aspx?articleID=839 | title = Regeringsformen 1809 med ändringar 1809-1974 | publisher = Studieförbundet Näringsliv och Samhälle | | language = Swedish | accessdate = 2014-02-10 [/tpl]
At present, the Government ([tpl]lang-sv|Regeringen[/tpl]) as a collective body, chaired and formed by the Prime Minister of Sweden, holds the highest Executive Authority, subject to the will of the Riksdag; and is thus the present day closest equivalent of a command-in-chief, although not explicitly designated as such.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.riksdagen.se/Global/dokument/dokument/laws/the-instrument-of-government-2012.pdf | title = The Instrument of Government | publisher = The Riksdag | accessdate = 2014-02-10 [/tpl] The reason for this change was, apart from the fact that the King was since 1917 no longer expected to make political decisions without ministerial advice, that the new Instrument of Government was intended to be made as descriptive on the workings of the State as possible, and reflective on how decisions are actually made. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer further remarked in the government bill that any continued pretensions of royal involvement in government decisions would be of a "fictitious nature" and "highly unsatisfactory".[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] Prop. 1973:90.
