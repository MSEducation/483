Lynch moved to New York in late 1981 and was soon hired by Bill Kirchner, performing and recording with Kirchner's nonet. He was a member of the Horace Silver Quintet (1982-1985) and the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra (1982-1988). Simultaneously, he played and recorded on the Latin scene with salsa bandleader Angel Canales (1982-83) and legendary cantante Hector LaVoe (1983-87). He began his association with Eddie Palmieri in 1987, and at the end of 1988 joined what turned out to be the final edition of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. He began his association with Phil Woods in 1992, and also worked frequently with Benny Golson around this time.

==Projects==

In 1986, Lynch recorded his first album as a leader, Peer Pressure, for Criss-Cross. There followed Back Room Blues and At The Main Event (Criss-Cross), In Process (Ken Music), Keep Your Circle Small (Sharp Nine)), and a string of sideman dates with Art Blakey and Phil Woods. 
A 1997 recording called Spheres of Influence (Sharp Nine), became the first of several Lynch projects displaying a strong Afro-Cuban influence. During these years he documented cross-cultural investigations with Eddie Palmieri's seminal Afro-Caribbean Jazz Octet on Arete, Palmas and Vortex (Nonesuch and RMM). As the ‘90s progressed, he steadily refined his concept, eventually collaborating with Palmieri as an arranger, co-composer and musical director.  Palmieri collaborated with Lynch again on Simpático, his project  for ArtistShare.
Lynch has continued to advance the Spheres of Influence concept through collaborations with young Afro-Cuban musicians. These include drummers Dafnis Prieto, Horacio Hernandez, Robby Ameen and Ernesto Simpson; percussionists Richie Flores, Pedro Martinez and Roberto Quintero; pianists Luis Perdomo, Edsel Gomez, Manuel Valera and David Kikoski; bassists John Benitez, Ruben Rodriguez and Hans Glawischnig; and saxophonists Miguel Zenón and Yosvany Terry.

==Teaching==

Lynch has turned increasingly to teaching in recent years. He currently holds faculty positions at University of Miami, New York University, and the North Netherlands Conservatory.  He has taught at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, and  conducted workshops in numerous major institutes of learning, including The Eastman School of Music, Dartmouth College, the University of North Texas College of Music, and Columbia University, among many others.
