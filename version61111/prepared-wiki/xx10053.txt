On 5 February 2012, there were munitions explosions at a tank regiment (seemingly 'Regiment Blinde') barracks located in Brazzaville's fifth arrondissement, Ouenze. Some 206 people were initially reported killed. There are five military barracks in the city, and after the explosion officials said the government had promised to move all munitions out of the capital.http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/206-people-dead-arms-depot-explodes-republic-congo-article-1.1033182, accessed 6 February 2012
