Musketeer Records, an independent record label based in Johannesburg, South Africa which releases mainstream rock, adult contemporary and solo acts.  It was formed in August 2000 by Brian O'Shea and Peter Lacey.  Currently Musketeer has South African representation and offices in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, as well as international representation and offices in London. In addition to this Musketeer has marketing and legal representation in New York.
The philosophy of the company is to identify the best local South African artists and music, sign and develop it to an international standard and to sell its music around the world.
Musketeer gained almost immediate success by signing, producing and releasing the debut album by Seether (n√©e Saron Gas) into the South African market in June 2001. Seether were subsequently subject to a bidding war in the US and were eventually signed by Wind-Up Records, in October 2001, for launch into the U.S. market.
2004 and 2005 saw the company increase its roster to include numerous local acts, namely: Fevertree, Fahrenheit, State Far Better and Soul Proxy.
