[[Boletus luridiformis]]

CATEGORIES: Boletus, Fungi described in 1796, Fungi of Europe

Boletus luridiformis, formerly known as Boletus erythropus, is a fungus of the bolete family, all of which produce mushrooms with tubes and pores beneath their caps. It is found in Northern Europe and North America, and is commonly known as the dotted stem bolete. Although edible when cooked, it can cause gastric upset when raw and can be confused where the two species coincide with the poisonous Boletus satanas, which has a paler cap.

==Taxonomy==

Boletus luridiformis was originally described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1796 as Boletus erythropus - a name since reduced to synonymy - [tpl]cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6[/tpl]  which derived its specific name from the Greek ερυθρος ("red") and πους ("foot"),[tpl]cite book | author = Liddell, Henry George and Robert Scott | year = 1980 | title = A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition) | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4[/tpl] referring to its red coloured stalk. Its French name, bolet à pied rouge or 'red-foot bolete' is a literal translation.
Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that B. luridiformis and many (but not all) red-pored boletes are part of a dupainii clade (named for Boletus dupainii), well-removed from the core group of Boletus edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicates that it will most likely be placed in a new genus.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nuhn ME, Binder M, Taylor AFS, Halling RE, Hibbett DS. |year=2013 |title=Phylogenetic overview of the Boletineae |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2013 |volume=117 |issue=7–8 |pages=479–511 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2013.04.008 |pmid=23931115[/tpl]

==Description==

left|thumb|B. luridiformis, found in Ukraine. Yellow color become blue quickly on cuttingBoletus luridiformis is a large solid fungus with a bay-brown hemispherical to convex cap that can grow up to [tpl]convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide, and is quite felty initially. It has small orange-red pores that become rusty with age, and bruise blue to black. The tubes are yellowish-green, and become blue quickly on cutting. The fat, colourful, densely red-dotted yellow stem is 4–12 cm (2–5 in) high, and has no network pattern (reticulation). The flesh stains dark blue when bruised; broken, or cut. There is little smell. The spore dust is olive greenish-brown.
The similar Boletus luridus has a network pattern on the stem, and seems to prefer chalky soil.
Boletus satanas also has a stem network, and a very pale whitish cap.

==Distribution and habitat==

The fungus grows in deciduous or coniferous woodland, in summer and autumn, in Europe. It is often found in the same places as Boletus edulis. It is also widely distributed in North America, and is especially common under spruce in its range from Northern California to Alaska. In Eastern North America it grows with both soft, and hardwood trees.[tpl]cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4[/tpl] It seems to prefer acid soils.

==Toxicity==

Mild tasting, Boletus luridiformis is edible after cooking, though caution is advised as it resembles other less edible blue-staining boletes, and should thus be avoided by novice mushroom hunters.
