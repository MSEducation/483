==History==

Bruce Farr first achieved acclaim as a sailboat designer in the highly competitive 18 ft Skiff class, popular in Australia and New Zealand.  Farr designs won the 18 ft Skiff Giltinan World title several times in the early 70s.  Starting in 1973, Bruce was able to focus full-time on designing sailboats.  Another New Zealander active as both a designer and sailor in the 18 ft fleet, Russel Bowler, a civil engineer by training, introduced the fibreglass-foam sandwich construction technique to the 18 ft class in 1977 with a boat 1/3 lighter and possessing a lower wetted area than the competition. Starting in 1976, Bowler provided structural engineering services to Bruce as a consultant, and joined him full-time in 1980.  Within a year, they moved the office to Annapolis in order to get better access to the northern hemisphere yacht market.

The yachts designed by Farr are primarily light-displacement, fractional rig, wide sterned, shallow hulled yachts.  Many of his early designs were comparatively skiff-like in appearance, with shallow hulls, wide sterns and light displacement.  The result is a quicker, faster hull than more traditional racing yacht designs.  Over the years more and more designers have incorporated these ideas.  The latest Volvo Open 70 class yachts are examples of this trend.
In addition to one design yachts (table), Farr has designed a various yachts for Volvo Ocean Race (and earlier Whitbread) teams under the Volvo Open 70, Volvo Ocean 60 and Whitbread 60 rule. Furthermore major yacht builders such as Bavaria Yachtbau and Beneteau have commissioned Farr-designed yachts for their Cruiser and First lines respectively. Designs have been also made by Farr under the GP42 and TP 52 (yacht) rule and for racing based on IRC (sailing), International Measurement System rating. Other notable design include (super) Maxi's  and America's Cup yachts (for Team BMW Oracle Racing (2007, 2003), Young America (2000) Tag Heuer (1995), New Zealand (1992, 1988, 1987))[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.farrdesign.com/americas_history.htm |title= Challengers for the America's Cup Designed by Farr Yacht Design, Ltd|publisher=Farr Yacht Design, Ltd |accessdate=22 August 2011[/tpl]
