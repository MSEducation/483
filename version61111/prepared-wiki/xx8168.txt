===Open Screen Project===

On May 1, 2008, Adobe announced the Open Screen Project, with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics.[tpl]cite web|title=Adobe and Industry Leaders Establish Open Screen Project|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200805/050108AdobeOSP.html|accessdate=February 20, 2009|date=May 1, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090210215745/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200805/050108AdobeOSP.html| archivedate= February 10, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] When the project was announced, seven goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime, the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) file formats, the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices, and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.
[tpl]As of|February 2009[/tpl], the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV/F4V specs have been published.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uiresourcecenter.com/rich-internet-applications/articles/inside-the-open-screen-project.html?s=2_1 |title=Inside the Open Screen Project |first=Anup| last=Murarka|accessdate=February 21, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090210122744/http://uiresourcecenter.com/rich-internet-applications/articles/inside-the-open-screen-project.html?s=2_1| archivedate= February 10, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Flash Cast protocol—now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol—and AMF protocols have also been made available, with AMF available as an open source implementation, BlazeDS. Work on the device porting layers is in the early stages. Adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) for devices at their release for the Open Screen Project.
The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm, Motorola, and Nokia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.openscreenproject.org/partners/current_partners.html| title=Open Screen Project partners|accessdate=February 20, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090224150104/http://www.openscreenproject.org/partners/current_partners.html| archivedate= February 24, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] who, together with Adobe, have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund.[tpl]cite web|title=Adobe and Nokia Announce $10 Million Open Screen Project Fund|url =http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobeNokia.html|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 20, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090219070548/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobeNokia.html| archivedate= February 19, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], the Open Screen Project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner BSQuare. However paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use Adobe software.

===Flash for mobile platforms===

Flash Player for smart phones was made available to handset manufacturers at the end of 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobePalmOSP.html|title=Palm Latest Mobile Industry Leader to Join Open Screen Project|accessdate=February 20, 2009|date=February 16, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090223002124/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200902/021609AdobePalmOSP.html| archivedate= February 23, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Adobe stops supporting Flash Player for mobile device browsers after the release of 11.1. It continues to support deploying Flash based content as mobile applications via Adobe AIR.[tpl]cite web|last=Winokur |first=Danny |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html |title=Flash to Focus on PC Browsing and Mobile Apps; Adobe to More Aggressively Contribute to HTML5 (Adobe Featured Blogs) |publisher=Blogs.adobe.com |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2012[/tpl]

===Decline on mobile devices===

In November 2011 there were a number of announcements that demonstrated a possible decline in demand for rich Internet application architectures, and Flash in particular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theinfoboom.com/articles/adobe-flash-player-turfed-for-mobile-devices/|title=Adobe Flash Player Turfed for Mobile Devices |accessdate=November 11, 2011[/tpl]
Furthermore, in November 2011 Adobe announced the end of Flash for mobile platforms or TV, instead focusing on HTML5 for browser content and Adobe AIR for the various mobile application stores.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tideart.com/?id=4ebafb57|title=Web designers: Time to ditch Flash, Silverlight, and embrace HTML5[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/flash-is-dead-long-live-html5/1633|title=Flash is dead.

Adobe Flash Player's planned discontinuation as a separately available NPAPI browser plugin for Linux (see Availability on desktop operating systems), although technically just an API change, is notable in this context because availability of new Flash Players on Linux will be restricted to one browser.

===Other uses===

Adobe Flash continues to be a favored animation program for low-cost 2D television and commercial animation, in competition with Toon Boom Animation. Notable users of the software include DHX Media Vancouver for productions including Pound Puppies and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Nelvana for 6teen and Clone High, Williams Street for Metalocalypse and Squidbillies, and Nickelodeon Animation Studios for Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, Danny Phantom and Happy Tree Friends. Flash is less commonly used for feature-length animated films; however, 2009's The Secret of Kells, an Irish film, was animated primarily in Adobe Flash, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards.

==Format==

Flash files are in the SWF format, traditionally called "ShockWave Flash" movies, "Flash movies", or "Flash applications", usually have a .swf file extension, and may be used in the form of a web page plug-in, strictly "played" in a standalone Flash Player, or incorporated into a self-executing Projector movie (with the .exe extension in Microsoft Windows). Flash Video filesFLV and F4V Video File Format Specification Version 9 F4V is based on ISO base media file format standard, available as a free download http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .swf files or played through a flv-aware player, such as VLC, or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added.
The use of vector graphics combined with program code allows Flash files to be smaller—and thus allows streams to use less bandwidth—than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips. For content in a single format (such as just text, video, or audio), other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less CPU power than the corresponding Flash movie, for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades.
In addition to a vector-rendering engine, the Flash Player includes a virtual machine called the ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) for scripting interactivity at run-time, with video, MP3-based audio, and bitmap graphics. As of Flash Player 8, it offers two video codecs: On2 Technologies VP6 and Sorenson Spark, and run-time JPEG, Progressive JPEG, PNG, and GIF capability. In the next version, Flash is slated to use a just-in-time compiler for the ActionScript engine.

===Flash Video===

Virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and cross-platform, including Adobe's offering of Flash Video, which was first introduced with Flash version 6. Flash Video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of Flash. In 2010, Apple publicly criticized Adobe Flash, including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration, one reason Flash is not to be found on Apple's mobile devices. Soon after Apple's criticism, Adobe demoed and released a beta version of Flash 10.1, which takes advantage of GPU hardware acceleration even on a Mac. Flash 10.2 beta, released December 2010, adds hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline.

===Flash Audio===

Flash Audio is most commonly encoded in MP3 or AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) however it can also use ADPCM, Nellymoser (Nellymoser Asao Codec) and Speex audio codecs. Flash allows sample rates of 11, 22 and 44.1 kHz. It cannot have 48 kHz audio sample rate, which is the standard TV and DVD sample rate.
On August 20, 2007, Adobe announced on its blog that with Update 3 of Flash Player 9, Flash Video will also implement some parts of the MPEG-4 international standards. Specifically, Flash Player will work with video compressed in H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10), audio compressed using AAC (MPEG-4 Part 3), the F4V, MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14), M4V, M4A, 3GP and MOV multimedia container formats, 3GPP Timed Text specification (MPEG-4 Part 17), which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the 'ilst' atom, which is the ID3 equivalent iTunes uses to store metadata. MPEG-4 Part 2 and H.263 will not work in F4V file format. Adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the FLV format to the standard ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12) owing to functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264. The final release of the Flash Player implementing some parts of MPEG-4 standards had become available in Fall 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200708/082107FlashPlayer.html |title=Adobe Press release on MPEG-4 in Flash Player 9 |publisher=Adobe.com |accessdate=December 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101203071112/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200708/082107FlashPlayer.html| archivedate= December 3, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Adobe Flash Player 10.1 does not have acoustic echo cancellation, unlike the VoIP offerings of Skype and Google Voice, making this and earlier versions of Flash less suitable for group calling or meetings. Flash Player 10.3 Beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation.

===Scripting language===

ActionScript is the programming language used by Flash.  It is an enhanced superset of the ECMAScript programming language, with a classical Java-style class model, rather than JavaScript's prototype model.

===Vendor dependence===

The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a concern for advocates of open standards and free software — the completeness of its public specifications are debated, and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse. Generally, public specifications are what makes a format re-implementable (see future proofing data storage), and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator.
Adobe's restrictions on the use of the SWF/FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009 (see Adobe's Open Screen Project). However, despite efforts of projects like Gnash, Swfdec and Lightspark, a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen, as of September 2011. For example, Gnash cannot use SWF v10 yet. Notably, Gnash has been a long standing high priority project of the Free Software Foundation, since at least 2007 and it was ranked number one in September 2011.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/ | title=High Priority Free Software Projects | publisher=Free Software Foundation[/tpl]
Notable advocates of free software, open standards, and the World Wide Web have warned against the use of Flash:
Founder of Mozilla Europe, Tristan Nitot stated in 2008:
 Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich-media technologies like Adobe's Flash and Microsoft's Silverlight. (...) You're producing content for your users and there's someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content. 
Representing open standards, inventor of CSS and co-author of HTML5, Håkon Wium Lie explained in a Google tech talk of 2007, entitled "the <video> element", the proposal of Theora as the format for HTML5 video:[ref]
 (deadlink)[/ref]
 I believe very strongly, that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if video element is going to succeed. Flash is today the baseline format on the web. The problem with Flash is that it's not an open standard. 
Representing the free software movement, Richard Stallman stated in a speech in 2004 that:[ref]
 (deadlink)[/ref] "The use of Flash in websites is a major problem for our community."

===Disclosure===

In October 1998, Macromedia disclosed the Flash Version 3 Specification on its website. It did this in response to many new and often semi-open formats competing with SWF, such as Xara's Flare and Sharp's Extended Vector Animation formats. Several developers quickly created a C library for producing SWF. In February 1999, MorphInk 99 was introduced, the first third-party program to create SWF files. Macromedia also hired Middlesoft to create a freely available developers' kit for the SWF file format versions 3 to 5.
Macromedia made the Flash Files specifications for versions 6 and later available only under a non-disclosure agreement, but they are widely available from various sites.
In April 2006, the Flash SWF file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format (Flash 8). Although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats (On2, Sorenson Spark, etc.), this new documentation covered all the new features offered in Flash v8 including new ActionScript commands, expressive filter controls, and so on. The file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the Flash file format. The license forbids the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of Flash files. The Flash 9 specification was made available under similar restrictions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/ |title=Adobe File Format Specification FAQ |accessdate=November 15, 2007 |publisher=Adobe Systems |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071111094129/http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/faq/  |archivedate = November 11, 2007[/tpl]
In June 2009, Adobe launched the Open Screen Project (Adobe link), which made the SWF specification available without restrictions. Previously, developers could not use the specification for making SWF-compatible players, but only for making SWF-exporting authoring software. The specification still omits information on codecs such as Sorenson Spark, however.[tpl]cite web| title = Free Flash community reacts to Adobe Open Screen Project | url = http://www.openmedianow.org/?q=node/21 | accessdate =November 29, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2012[/tpl]

==Authoring tools==

===Adobe Flash Professional===

The Adobe Flash Professional multimedia authoring program is used to create content for the Adobe Engagement Platform, such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.

===Third-party tools===

Open source projects like Ajax Animator aim to create a Flash development environment, complete with a graphical user environment. Alternatively, programs such as Vectorian Giotto, swfmill, SWFTools, and MTASC provide tools to create SWF files, but do so by compiling text, ActionScript or XML files into Flash animations. It is also possible to create SWF files programmatically using the Ming library, which has interfaces for C, PHP, C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby. Haxe is an open source, high-level object-oriented programming language geared towards web-content creation that can compile Flash files.
Many shareware developers produced Flash creation tools and sold them for under US$50 between 2000 and 2002. In 2003 competition and the emergence of free Flash creation tools had driven many third-party Flash-creation tool-makers out of the market, allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices, although many of the products still cost less than US$100 and work with ActionScript. As for open source tools, KToon can edit vectors and generate SWF, but its interface is very different from Macromedia's. Another, more recent example of a Flash creation tool is SWiSH Max made by an ex-employee of Macromedia. Toon Boom Technologies also sells a traditional animation tool, based on Flash.
In addition, several programs create .swf-compliant files as output from their programs. Among the best-known of these is Screencast, which leverages the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content to produce demos, tutorials, or software simulations of programs. These programs are typically designed for use by non-programmers, and create Flash content quickly and easily, but cannot actually edit the underlying Flash code (i.e. the tweening and transforms, etc.). Screencam is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt Flash as the preferred output format, having been developed since the mid-90s. The fact that screencasting programs have adopted Flash as the preferred output is testament to Flash's presence as a ubiquitous cross-platform animation file format.
Other tools focus on creating specific types of Flash content. GoAnimate is a cloud-based platform for creating and distributing high-quality animated videos. Anime Studio is a 2D animation software package specialized for character animation that creates SWF files. Express Animator is similarly aimed specifically at animators. Question Writer publishes its quizzes to Flash file format.
Users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on-line tools that allow them to build full Flash-based websites. One of the oldest services available (1998) is FlashToGo. Such companies provide a wide variety of pre-built models (templates) associated to a Content Management System that empowers users to easily build, edit and publish their websites. Other sites, that allows greater customization and design flexibility are Wix.com and CirclePad.
Adobe wrote a software package called Adobe LiveMotion, designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats, including SWF. LiveMotion went through two major releases, but failed to gain any notable user base.
In February 2003, Macromedia purchased Presedia, which had developed a Flash authoring tool that automatically converted PowerPoint files into Flash. Macromedia subsequently released the new product as Breeze, which included many new enhancements. In addition, (as of version 2) Apple's Keynote presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to SWF.

===Availability on other computing devices===

Adobe Flash Lite is a lightweight version of Adobe Flash Player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like Chumby and iRiver.
On the emerging single-board enthusiast market, as substantially popularized by the Raspberry Pi, support from Adobe is lacking. However, Gnash have been ported and found useful.[tpl]cite web|author=Christopher Kramer|url=http://blog.christosoft.de/2012/08/flash-on-the-raspberry-pi|title=Flash on the Raspberry Pi|date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=May 12, 2013[/tpl]

===Accessibility===

Using Flash tends to break conventions associated with normal HTML pages. Selecting text, scrolling,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050711.html |title=Scrolling and Scrollbars (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=July 11, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2010[/tpl] form control and right-clicking act differently from with a regular HTML webpage. Many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer. Usability expert Jakob Nielsen published an Alertbox in 2000 entitled, Flash: 99% Bad, which listed issues like these.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html|title=Flash: 99% Bad|last=Nielsen|first=Jakob|date=October 29, 2000 |accessdate=February 21, 2009[/tpl] Some problems have been at least partially fixed since Nielsen's complaints:

===Performance===

====Complications to video acceleration====

Any Flash player must be able to animate on top of video renderings, necessitating an intermediate color space conversion between video decoding and presentation, that a traditional multimedia player would leave for hardware to do at a later stage. This intermediate step splits the hardware acceleration pipeline in two.Solving Different Problems « Penguin.SWF. Blogs.adobe.com. Retrieved on November 9, 2010. Depending on the hardware acceleration APIs exposed by the operating system, doing either part separately in hardware may be unsupported or complicated. For example, on Linux, native Xv video scaling can not be used because it is made to take video in the form that comes from the decoder – in YUV color space. However, Adobe Flash Player is able to make use of VDPAU for decoding (provided that the computer has an Nvidia GPU), making the Linux client partially hardware accelerated. The same challenge arises with native video capability in the browser, however the implementor may choose a different compromise between features and performance. For example, the KHTML layout engine does use Xv, and so cannot draw on top of the video. Rather than displaying its video controls on top of the video, the video scaling is reduced to fit them below.
Flash Player build 11.2.202.228 for Linux has introduced a video rendering bug with Nvidia hardware acceleration, resulting in discoloured Flash videos.  This bug is caused by the red palette being rendered as blue.  The problem has been confined to Flash Player and remains unfixed as of April 2012. A workaround has been implemented in VDPAU.

====Empirical tests====

In tests done by Ars Technica in 2008 and 2009, Adobe Flash Player performed better on Windows than Mac OS X and Linux with the same hardware.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2008/10/benchmarking-flash-player-10.ars|title=Flash benchmarks on different operating systems[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Paul |first=Ryan |url=http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/10/hands-on-hulu-desktop-for-linux-beta-a-big-resource-hog.ars |title=Hands-on: Hulu Desktop for Linux beta a big resource hog |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2010[/tpl]

===Flash blocking in web browsers===

Flash content is usually embedded using the object or embed HTML element.[tpl]cite web|url=http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#faq-flash |title=Help for The W3C Markup Validation Service |publisher=Validator.w3.org |accessdate=January 26, 2012[/tpl] A web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text, if supplied by the web page.  Often, a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements, though some users cannot or will not install it.
Since Flash can be used to produce content (such as advertisements) that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download, some web browsers default to not play Flash content before the user clicks on it, e.g. Konqueror, K-Meleon.
Most current browsers have a feature to block plugins, playing one only when the user clicks it. Opera versions since 10.5 feature native Flash blocking. Opera Turbo requires the user to click to play Flash content, and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently. Both Chrome[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/58058/how-to-enable-flashblock-in-chrome-and-make-it-5000-more-secure/ |title=How to Enable Flashblock in Chrome (And Make it 5000% More Secure) |date=8 April 2011 |publisher=How-to Geek |accessdate=18 August 2012[/tpl] and Firefox[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ghacks.net/2012/03/29/firefox-14-to-get-click-to-play-plugin-feature/ |title=Firefox 14 To Get Click To Play Plugin Feature|date=29 March 2012 |publisher=ghacks.net |accessdate=18 August 2012[/tpl] have an option to enable "click to play plugins". Equivalent "Flash blocker" extensions also exist for many popular browsers: Firefox has Flashblock and NoScript, Internet Explorer has Foxie, which contains a number of features, one of them named Flashblock. WebKit-based browsers under Mac OS X, such as Apple's Safari, have ClickToFlash.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/|title=ClickToFlash|accessdate=July 27, 2011[/tpl]

===Local Shared Objects (“Flash cookies”)===

Like the HTTP cookie, a flash cookie (also known as a “Local Shared Object”) can be used to save application data. Flash cookies are not shared across domains. An August 2009 study by the Ashkan Soltani and a team of researchers at UC Berkeley found that 50% of websites using Flash were also employing flash cookies, yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them, and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862|title=Soltani, Ashkan, Canty, Shannon, Mayo, Quentin, Thomas, Lauren and Hoofnagle, Chris Jay: Flash Cookies and Privacy|date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2009[/tpl] Most browsers' cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect Flash Player's writing Local Shared Objects to its own cache in version 10.2 and earlier, at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of Flash cookies than HTTP cookies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html|title=Local Shared Objects – "Flash Cookies"|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center|date=July 21, 2005|accessdate=March 8, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100416041024/http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html| archivedate= April 16, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Thus, users with those versions, having deleted HTTP cookies and purged browser history files and caches, may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact Flash browsing history remains. Adobe's own Flash Website Storage Settings panel, a submenu of Adobe's Flash Settings Manager web application, and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete Flash Local Shared Objects.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html|title=How to manage and disable Local Shared Objects|publisher=Adobe Systems Inc.|date=September 9, 2005|accessdate=March 8, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100218135619/http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html| archivedate= February 18, 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
On Windows systems, LSOs are stored in the directory: "%appdata%\Macromedia\Flash Player" Deleting the contents of this directory should remove the LSOs (flash cookies) for the current user.

==Alternatives==

===HTML5===

HTML5 is often cited as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology usage on web pages. Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5,Flash to HTML5 | Learn more about the CreateJS toolkit and Google also released an experimental tool that does the same.Google Swiffy
Pixelplant.com is a commercial online service to convert Flash to HTML5 on the fly and the JavaScript output can be modified using the open-source BonsaiJS graphics library.Pixelplant.comBonsaiJS

===Tools===

Commercial software packages that can create SWF files include Toon Boom, Xara Photo & Graphic Designer, Vectorian Giotto, CelAction2D, Toufee, KoolMoves, Express Animator, Alligator Flash Designer, Amara Web and Anime Studio. These applications provide additional capabilities for creating cartoons, especially with tools more tailored to traditionally trained animators, as well as additional rigging for characters, which can speed up character animation considerably. Additionally, there are programs available which translate 3D information into 2D vectors for display in Flash Player.
Several third-party tools are able to use and generate SWF files, and some tools such as IrfanView are capable of rendering SWF files, through the use of Flash Player. Flash Player cannot ship as part of a pure open source, or completely free operating system, as its distribution is bound to the Macromedia Licensing Program and subject to proposition first from Adobe.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] There is no complete free and open source software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.[tpl]cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1647626314188526128&ei=LkqgSbfhIYva2gLUotGRDg&hl=un|title=Richard Stallman on The free software movement and its challenges|accessdate=2009-02-21|publisher=Google Video|location=Australian National University, Canberra, Australia[/tpl]
Open-source Flash content creation software includes Ajax Animator, Clash, OpenOffice Impress, KToon, Salasaga, and Synfig.

===Compilers===

swfc is an open-source ActionScript 3.0 compiler which generates SWF files from script files, which includes SVG tags. It is currently the most complete alternative for building Flash content in Linux, despite being entirely script-based and not having a GUI.
The Ming library is able to import and export graphics from XML into SWF. Ming has bindings for popular scripting languages such as PHP and Python.

===Flash 4 Linux===

The Flash 4 Linux project was an initiative to develop an open source Linux application as an alternative to Adobe Flash Professional. Development plans included authoring capacity for 2D animation, and tweening, as well as outputing SWF file formats. F4L evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring 2D animation and publishing of SWF files. Flash 4 Linux was renamed UIRA. UIRA intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the F4L project and the Qflash project, both of which were Open Source applications that provided (to some extent) an alternative to the proprietary Adobe Flash. UIRA was free software, but was never truly completed. It reached a stage of being no more than a shell of a UI with limited functionality. Due in part to the adoption of the DADVSI law in France, the UIRA project was shut down in January 2008, according to the project's page in SourceForge.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
