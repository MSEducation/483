HORIZONS is Hong Kong's second oldest gay group after Hong Kong Ten Percent Club.
The organisation runs the Chinese Special Administrative Region's oldest counseling hotline for people affected by sexual orientation issues, which began operation months before HORIZONS was formally registered as a non-governmental organisation under Hong Kong's Societies Ordinance in February 1992. There three founding officers were Barrie Brandon, Samson Chan and Simon Chan.
HORIZONS' other missions include educating Hong Kong's public about sexual orientation issues and promoting equal opportunities for people of different sexual orientations.
HORIZONS was a driving force behind Hong Kong's first gay parade on October 15, 2004.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl]
