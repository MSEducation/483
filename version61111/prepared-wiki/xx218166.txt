[[Granulometry (morphology)]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical morphology

In mathematical morphology, granulometry is an approach to compute a size distribution of grains in binary images, using a series of morphological opening operations. It was introduced by Georges Matheron in the 1960s, and is the basis for the characterization of the concept of size in mathematical morphology.

==Granulometry generated by a structuring element==

==Sieving axioms==

The above common method is a particular case of the more general approach derived by Matheron.
The French mathematician was inspired by sieving as a means of characterizing size. In sieving, a granular sample is worked through a series of sieves with decreasing hole sizes. As a consequence, the different grains in the sample are separated according to their sizes.
A granulometry-generating family of operators should satisfy the above three axioms.
