Forever Changes is the third album by the American rock band Love. It was released by Elektra Records in November 1967 and would be the final album by the original band, as subsequent albums featured leader Arthur Lee backed by a variety of new players.
Forever Changes failed to achieve commercial success when it was first released in 1967, but it has since become recognized as one of the finest albums to come out of the Summer of Love, ranking 40th on Rolling Stone magazine's 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/forever-changes-love-19691231 |title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 2003 |issue=Special Issue |at=40 | Forever Changes - Love |accessdate=[tpl]date|2011-09-26[/tpl][/tpl] being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008 as well as being added to the National Recording Registry in May 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://psychedelicsight.com/recording-registry/ |title=Love, Dead in National Recording Registry |publisher=psychedelicsight.com |accessdate=[tpl]date|2012-05-23[/tpl][/tpl]

==Recording==

After the previous album, Da Capo, keyboardist/drummer Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer and flautist/saxophonist Tjay Cantrelli were dropped from the band, leaving Love a quintet. The remaining personnel performed on nine of the eleven tracks on Forever Changes. The album was the first to be produced by Arthur Lee, with assistance from Bruce Botnick. Originally, the album was to be produced by Botnick and Neil Young, but Young bowed out due to his commitments to Buffalo Springfield. According to the liner notes of the 1995 compilation Love Story, Young stuck with the album project long enough to arrange the track "The Daily Planet." Young, however, has denied such involvement.[tpl]cite book |title= Shakey: Neil Young's biography|last= McDonough|first= Jimmy|year= 2002|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-679-42772-8|oclc= 47844513[/tpl] pp 160 footnote
The title of the album came from a story that Lee had heard about a friend-of-a-friend who had broken up with his girlfriend. She exclaimed, "You said you would love me forever!," and he replied, "Well, forever changes." Lee also noted that since the name of the band was Love, the full title was actually Love Forever Changes.Einarson, John. Forever Changes: Arthur Lee and the Book of Love.

The sessions began in June 1967, with the group (except for Lee and Maclean) replaced by well-known Los Angeles session musicians Billy Strange (guitar), Don Randi (piano), Hal Blaine (drums) and most likely Carol Kaye (bass, guitar). This line-up was put in place due to the regular line-up's alleged inability to function in the studio. The two tracks recorded during these sessions, "Andmoreagain" and "The Daily Planet," were later given sparing overdubs by the actual members of Love, who felt the tracks otherwise sufficed. Drummer Michael Stuart says that bassist Kaye actually played acoustic guitar on "The Daily Planet" [tpl]cite book |title= Love: Behind the Scenes: On the Pegasus Carousel with the Legendary Rock Group Love|last= Stuart-Ware|first= Michael|year= 2003|publisher= Helter Skelter Publishing|isbn= 978-1-900924-59-7[/tpl] but that Ken Forssi taught her the part.
Botnick recalls that the use of session musicians "sparked" the band, and they "realized they had blown it, got their act together and recorded the rest of the album." After much rehearsal, the group returned to the studio in August and continued through September, quickly laying down the remaining nine tracks, at a total estimated cost of $2,257.
Lee spent three weeks with David Angel, the arranger of the strings and horns, playing and singing the orchestral parts to him. Contrary to what has been reported in other places, Lee envisioned the horns and strings from the beginning, and they were not added as an afterthought.
A September 18 recording session finished the album, adding the horns and strings, as well as some additional piano from Randi, who played all the keyboard parts on the album as the band now had no keyboard player.

==Reception==

Upon its release in late 1967, Forever Changes was largely unsuccessful commercially. It spent 10 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart, according to Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Albums, peaking at #154 in 1968, by far the worst showing among Love's first three albums. (According to the same book, Love's next album, Four Sail, fared better on the Billboard 200, peaking at #102 in 1969.) Forever Changes had a much stronger showing in Great Britain, where it reached #24 on the UK album chart in 1968. It peaked at #63 when it re-entered the chart in 2001.
Initial critical reviews were positive. Pete Johnson of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the album "can survive endless listening with no diminishing either of power or of freshness", while noting "parts of the album are beautiful; others are disturbingly ugly, reflections of the pop movement towards realism." Gene Youngblood of LA Free Express also praised the album, calling it "melancholy iconoclasm and tasteful romanticism."
The Bonzo Dog Band's contemporary track We Are Normal contains a section parodying ''The Red Telephone': "We are normal and we dig Bert Weedon"
