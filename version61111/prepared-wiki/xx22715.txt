Waikīkī ([tpl]IPAc-en|w|aɪ|k|iː|ˈ|k|iː[/tpl]; Hawaiian: [tpl]IPA-haw|vɐiˈkiːˈkiː|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-haw|wɐiˈkiːˈkiː|[/tpl]) is a beachfront neighborhood of Honolulu, on the south shore of the island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu, in Hawaii, United States. Waikiki is best known for Waikīkī Beach, the white sand beach shoreline fronting the neighborhood.
Waikīkī is home to public places including Kapi[tpl]okina[/tpl]olani Park, Fort de Russy Military Reservation, Kahanamoku Lagoon, Kūhiō Beach Park, and Ala Wai Harbor.

==Etymology==

The name Waikīkī means spouting fresh water in  the Hawaiian language, for springs and streams that fed wetlands that once separated Waikīkī from the interior.[tpl]Hawaiian Dictionaries |waikiki |HASH835ff9bba55d4820b22304 |dic=hpn |accessdate= December 13, 2010 [/tpl]

==History==

The area was a retreat for Hawaiian royalty in the 1800s who enjoyed surfing there on early forms of longboards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaii-post.com/2008-05AUG.html |title=Longboards used by royalty |publisher=Hawaii-post.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl]
A few small hotels opened in the 1880s. In 1893, Greek-American George Lycurgus leased the guest house of Allen Herbert and renamed it the "Sans Souci" (French for "without worries") creating one of the first beach resorts. Later that year Robert Louis Stevenson stayed at the resort; subsequently it became a popular destination for tourists from the mainland.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10524/422 |title=The Queen's "Greek Artillery Fire": Greek Royalists in the Hawaiian Revolution and Counterrevolution |author=Helen G.

Today, the area is filled with large resort hotels, such as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Halekulani hotel, the Hyatt Regency Waikīkī, the Sheraton Waikīkī, and historic hotels dating back to the early 20th century (such as the Moana Surfrider Hotel and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel). The beach hosts many events a year, including surf competitions, outdoor performances, hula dancing and outrigger canoe races.

==Geography==

The neighborhood extends from the Ala Wai Canal (a channel dug to drain former wetlands) on the west and north, to Diamond Head  (Lē[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahi) on the east.  Waikīkī Beach is noted for its views of the Diamond Head tuff cone, its usually warm and cloud-free climate and its surf break.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.waikikihistorictrail.com/waikikimap.html |title=Waikiki Historic Trail - Map  |publisher=Hawaii Tourism Authority |accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://totakeresponsibility.blogspot.com/2012/05/waikiki-before-ala-wai.html |title=Ho‘okuleana: Waikīkī – Before the Ala Wai |first=Peter T |last=Young |date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite thesis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/9303 |title=The Development of Waikiki, 1900–1949: The Formative Period of an American Resort Paradise |first=Masakazu |last=Ejiri |publisher=University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa |location=Honolulu |chapter=1: Introduction |page=1 |year=1996 |accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl]
The Waikīkī skyline is now dotted with an abundance of both high-rises and resort hotels.  The beach is actually fairly short, with half of it marked off for surfers.  For some distance into the ocean the water is quite shallow, although there are numerous rocks on the bottom.  As with most ocean beaches the waves can have some force, particularly on windy days. The surf at Waikīkī is known for its long rolling break, making it ideal for long boarding, tandem surfing and beginners.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
