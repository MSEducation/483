</ref> Orford missed the conversion, and the score was 16-4 in favour of the visiting team. The Sea Eagles scored again one minute later as they were returning the ball from the kick-off. Michael Robertson made another break down the right wing and centre kicked ahead for Brett Stewart who got a perfect bounce and came close to scoring before being brought down by Ryan Hall. This then gave Watmough the chance to score his second try from first receiver before Leeds' defence could regather. Orford kicked the extras so Manly had gotten away to a 22-4 lead. When returning the following kick-off as well the Sea Eagles scored again, this time [[Shane Rodney]] made a break 25m from his own line and got to the Leeds 40m line before finding L'Estrange in support who in turn popped a pass to [[Steve Matai]] who had an easy 20m run to the line (even had Matai been caught, he still had an un-marked Robertson in support). Manly had scored their 3rd try in only 6 minutes and 45 seconds of the second half which had taken the game away from Leeds and silenced the pro Rhinos crowd. Orford missed the conversion so Manly lead was 26-4.
In the 64th minute, after Leeds got repeat sets of six down near Manly's line, they moved the ball from one side of the field out to the other, a quick no-look pass from Ali Lautiiti sending Keith Senior over the line. Sinfield kicked the extras so the Rhinos were down 16 points with fifteen minutes remaining.[ref]
</ref> After 71 and a half minutes, 30 metres out from Manly's line, Lautiiti made a run from dummy-half down the left side and threw another deft no-look pass to Ryan Hall who scored in the corner. Sinfield's kick from the sideline bounced through off one of the posts, so Leeds were 10 points down with seven minutes of the match remaining. Another fight broke out in the 75th minute and again Leeds were penalised. The Sea Eagles opted to take the kick for goal, which Orford did successfully. This made their lead 12 points with only 3 minutes remaining. Leeds got one more try in the final minute of the game, Keith Senior making a break from 60 metres out down the left wing before finding Danny McGuire in support to score in the corner just seconds before the final hooter. Sinfield's sideline conversion attempt was missed, so the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles had won the World Club Challenge for the first time, by a score of 28-20. Second-rower Anthony Watmough was named man-of-the-match.<ref>
