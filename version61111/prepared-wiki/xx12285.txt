[[War hammer]]

CATEGORIES: Hammers, Medieval weapons, Pole weapons

A war hammer is a late medieval weapon of war intended for close combat action, the design resembles the hammer. Its appearance is similar to that of an ice axe.
The war hammer consists of a handle and a head. The handle may be of different lengths, the longest being roughly equivalent to the halberd, and the shortest about the same as a mace.
Long war hammers were pole weapons (polearms) meant for use against riders, whereas short ones were used in closer quarters and from horseback.
Later war hammers often had a spike on one side of the head, making it a more versatile weapon.
War hammers were developed as a consequence of the prevalence of surface-hardened steel surfacing of wrought iron armours of the late medieval battlefields during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The surface of the armour was now as hard as the edge of a blade, so a blade tended to ricochet. Swords, or the blade of a battleaxe, were likely only to give a glancing blow, losing much of the impact, especially on the high curvature of the helmet. The war hammer could deliver the full force to the target. 
War hammers, especially when mounted on a pole, could damage without penetrating the armour. In particular, they transmitted the impact through even the thickest helmet and caused concussions. A blade or spike tended to be used against other parts of the body where the armour was thinner, and penetration was easier, than through the helmet. The spike end could be used for grappling the target's armour, reins, or shield, or could be turned in the direction of the blow to pierce even heavy armour. Against mounted opponents, the weapon could also be directed at the legs of the horse, toppling the armoured foe to the ground where he could be more easily attacked.

==Maul==

The maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy metal head, either of lead or iron. Similar in appearance and function to a modern sledgehammer, it is sometimes shown as having a spear-like spike on the fore-end of the haft. 
The use of the maul as a weapon seems to date from the later 14th century. In 1382, rebellious citizens of Paris seized 3,000 mauls (fr. maillet) from the city armoury, leading to the rebels being dubbed Maillotins.[tpl]cite book |title= A distant Mirror |last= Tuchman |first= Barbara|authorlink= Barbara Tuchman |year=1979 |publisher=Penguin |location= London |isbn=0140054073 |page= 380[/tpl] Later in the same year, Froissart records French men-at-arms using mauls at the Battle of Roosebeke, demonstrating it was not simply a weapon of the lower classes.[tpl]cite book |title=Chronicles of Froissart |last=Bourchier |first=John |year= 1523|editor1-first=G.C. |editor1-last=Macaulay|publisher= |location=London|page=288|edition=1924 edition |url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/books/Froissart/index.cfm?page=0288 |accessdate=2/8/09[/tpl]
A particular use of the maul was by archers in the 15th and 16th centuries. At the Battle of Agincourt, English longbowmen are recorded as using lead mauls, initially as a tool to drive in stakes but later as an improvised weapon.[tpl]cite book |title= The Great Warbow|last=Strickland |first= Matthew|coauthors= Hardy,Robert |year=2005 |publisher= Sutton|location=Stroud |isbn= 0750931671|page=337[/tpl] Other references during the century (for example, in Charles the Bold's 1472 Ordinance) suggest continued use.Strickland & Hardy (2005), p.364 They are recorded as a weapon of Tudor archers as late as 1562.Strickland & Hardy (2005), p337
