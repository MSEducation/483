[[Paracortex]]

CATEGORIES: Lymphatic organ anatomy

Paracortex is the portion of a lymph node immediately surrounding the medulla. Unlike the cortex, which has mostly immature T cells, or thymocytes, the paracortex has a mixture of immature and mature T cells. Lymphocytes enter the lymph nodes through specialized high endothelial venules found in the paracortex.
