A liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences, with some offering numerable graduate programs that lead to a master's degree or doctoral degree in subjects such as business administration, nursing, medicine, and law.
Students in the liberal arts generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts.
A "liberal arts" institution can be defined as a "college or university curriculum aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum."[tpl]cite web|title=Liberal Arts: Encyclopædia Britannica Concise|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts[/tpl] Although what is known today as the liberal arts college began in Europe,[tpl]cite web|first=Philip|last=Harriman|title=Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College|work=The Journal of Higher Education|year=1935|url=http://www.jstor.org/view/00221546/di962074/96p0148k/0[/tpl] the term is commonly associated with the United States.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] Prominent examples in the United States include the so-called Little Three, Colby-Bates-Bowdoin, and Little Ivy colleges in New England, the surviving, predominantly female Seven Sisters colleges along the northeastern seaboard, Norwegian-influenced Lutheran liberal arts college St. Olaf College as well as Augsburg College in Minnesota, and the Claremont Colleges in Southern California, but similar institutions are found all over the country. Most are private institutions, but a handful of public liberal arts schools exist, for instance the University of Mary Washington.
Liberal arts colleges are found in all parts of the world. Examples of such colleges are Mount Allison University, Bishop's University, and St. Thomas University in Canada; John Cabot University in Rome, Italy; European College of Liberal Arts in Germany; Lingnan University in Hong Kong; University College Maastricht in the Netherlands, Foundation for Liberal and Management Education in Pune, India, Shalem College in Jerusalem, Israel, Campion College in Sydney, Australia; Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane, Morocco, etc. However, especially in Europe, many topics covered in the general education conveyed at American liberal arts colleges are also addressed in specialized secondary schools.
The "liberal arts college experience" in the United States is characterized by three main aspects that demarcate it from undergraduate experiences in other countries:[tpl]dubious|date=October 2011[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
