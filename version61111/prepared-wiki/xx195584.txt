"Rosetta Genomics' IPO Raising $26.3M For MicroRNA Work."BioWorld Today, February 28, 2007. Using a single microRNA, the highly sensitive, highly specific test for squamous and non-squamous lung cancer has passed the prevalidation phase  and has been submitted for approval to the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program in April 2008.
In April 2008, Nature Biotechnology published a study by Rosetta Genomics’ scientists whose findings demonstrate microRNAs' significant potential to act as effective  biomarkers that may be applied in a diagnostic test designed to identify the primary tumor site in patients CUP.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Rosenfeld N, Aharonov R, Meiri E, et al. |title=MicroRNAs accurately identify cancer tissue origin |journal=Nat.

==Platform technologies==

Rosetta Genomics has developed several proprietary technologies that enable the Company to work with microRNAs. At the basis of these technologies are proprietary microRNA extraction protocols that include sensitive extraction of microRNAs from most body fluids, including serum, urine, saliva, with virtually no microRNA lost in the extraction process."Other News To Note," Bioworld Today, April 3, 2007. The company has also developed a microRNA extraction protocol from Formalin Fixed Paraffin
Embedded, or FFPE, samples. This allows extraction of microRNAs from samples preserved at room temperature."Henry Ford Hospital and Rosetta Genomics To Develop MicroRNA-based Diagnostics For Brain Cancer," Company Reports, January 14, 2008.
Once microRNAs are extracted, Rosetta Genomics’ technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the microRNAs using two custom designed platform technologies which utilize Quantitative Real Time PCR (or qRT-PCR) and microarrays.[ref]"Nanogen, Inc. Licenses MGB Probe Technology To Rosetta Genomics, Ltd.," Reuters Significant Developments, December
11, 2007.[/ref]
The Company’s proprietary microarray platform covers approximately 850 human microRNAs, including approximately 180 microRNAs "Rosetta and Rockefeller Enter MicroRNA Agreement," Datamonitor News and Comment, June 16, 2006. which are Rosetta Genomics’ proprietary microRNAs. The array’s high specificity allows discriminating homologous family members.

==Licenses and collaborations==

In January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced a collaboration agreement with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan to develop microRNA-based diagnostics and prognostics for brain cancer."Business Diary: Acquisitions," Crain's Detroit Business, February 25, 2008. Also in January 2008, Rosetta Genomics announced that its subsidiary, Rosetta Genomics Inc. has received a license to use Roche Molecular Systems' PCR technology in microRNA-based diagnostic tests.http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?articleId=102868&issueId=11189 "Rosetta Genomics Licenses Roche PCR Technology", FDAnews Device Daily Bulletin, January 9, 2008 In September 2007, Rosetta Genomics said it will work with New York University Medical
Center to develop a microRNA-based diagnostic test for melanoma.Everitt, Jay. "Rosetta Genomics, Ltd--ROSG: To Work In Collaboration With NYU Medical Center," Knobias, September 7, 2007.
In May 2007, Rosetta Genomics announced Columbia University Medical Center would utilize its Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform the clinical validation of Rosetta Genomics’ diagnostics program for cancer of unknown primary.[ref]"Rosetta Genomics Ltd. Signs Agreement With Columbia University Medical center,"
Reuters, May 21, 2007.[/ref]
In February 2006, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Rosetta Genomics said they will collaborate to develop antisense drugs that inhibit microRNA in the liver to treat cancers there. Antisense drugs are a class of compounds that interfere with genetic material that gets translated into harmful proteins.[ref]"Isis, Rosetta Join On Cancer Treatment,"
Associated Press, February 22, 2006.[/ref]

==History==

Rosetta Genomics was founded by Isaac Bentwich in 2000[ref]

Hoovers Web site; "Rosetta Genomics Company Description."[/ref] The company had its IPO on March 6, 2007 and is traded on the NASDAQ."Alnylam Pharma Shares Rise On Cantor Fitgerald's microRNA Technology Outlook," Associated Press, September 11, 2007. Rosetta Genomics expects the funds raised to advance its microRNA-based diagnostic and therapeutic cancer products through initial clinical validation, defined as success in identifying the specific biomarker panels via blinded tests of samples supplied
by medical institutions.
