[[Whisky]]

CATEGORIES: Whisky

Whisky or whiskeyOxford English Dictionary, Second Edition: "In modern trade usage, Scotch whisky and Irish whiskey are thus distinguished in spelling; whisky is the usual spelling in Britain and whiskey that in the U.S." is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Different grains are used for different varieties, including barley, malted barley, rye, malted rye, wheat, buckwheat and corn. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, made generally of charred white oak.
Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.

==Etymology==

The word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Gaelic word uisce/uisge meaning water. Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ("water of life"). This was translated to Gaelic as [tpl]lang-ga|uisce beatha[/tpl] and [tpl]lang-gd|uisge beatha[/tpl]="lively water" or "water of life". Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), usquebae (1715).New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, entries for "usquebaugh" and "whisky".

===Names and spellings===

Much is made of the word's two spellings: whisky and whiskey. There are two schools of thought on the issue. One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word, indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer (like the difference between color and colour; tire and tyre; or recognize and recognise),Charles K. Cowdery, Why Spelling Matters, The Chuck Cowdery Blog, 24 February 2009.Charles K. Cowdery, New York Times Buckles To Pressure From Scotch Snobs, The Chuck Cowdery Blog, 11 February 2009. and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described. There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label, the spelling on the label should not be altered. Some writers refer to "whisk(e)y" or "whisky/whiskey" to acknowledge the variation.
The spelling whisky is generally used in Canada, Japan, Scotland, England, and Wales—while whiskey is more common in Ireland and the United States. The usage is not always consistent. For example, some prominent American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker's Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the 'whisky' spelling on their labels, and the US legal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits document also uses the 'whisky' spelling.
"Scotch" is the internationally recognized term for "Scotch whisky".

==History==

It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilledMartin Levey (1956). "Babylonian Chemistry: A Study of Arabic and Second Millennium B.C. Perfumery", Osiris 12, p. 376-389. but this is subject to uncertain and disputable interpretation of evidence. The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in about the 3rd century (AD), but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.Book A Short History of the Art of Distillation, by Robert James Forbes (year 1948). That book covers distillation in general. For the early history of the distillation of alcohol specifically, search for the word "alcohol" in that book here http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=alcohol&f=false.[tpl]cite book|title=Whisky: technology, production and marketing|isbn=978-0-12-669202-0|page=366|last=Russell|first=Inge|year=2003|page=14|publisher=Academic Press[/tpl] The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 – 1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries,The History of Whisky History, The Whisky Guide. largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Scotch Whisky|url=http://whisky.com/history.html|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl]
The art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling ‘Aqua Vitae’ or spirit alcohol primarily for medicinal purposes.Whisky: Technology, Production and Marketing: Handbook of Alcoholic Beverages Series p2 Academic Press 2003 The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Surgeon Barbers. The first confirmed written record of whisky comes from 1405 in Ireland. In the Irish Annals of Clonmacnoise in 1405, the first written record of whisky attributes the death of a chieftain to "taking a surfeit of aqua vitae" at Christmas.Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, p.785, footnote for year 1405. This is likewise in the Annals of Connacht entry for year 1405: Annals of Connacht. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent "To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae", enough to make about 500 bottles.[tpl]cite book|title=Whisky|isbn=0-7100-6685-6|page=158|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Routledge[/tpl]
James IV of Scotland (r. 1488–1513) reportedly had a great liking for Scotch whisky, and in 1506 the town of Dundee purchased a large amount of whisky from the Guild of Surgeon Barbers, which held the monopoly on production at the time. Between 1536 and 1541, King Henry VIII of England dissolved the monasteries, sending their monks out into the general public. Whisky production moved out of a monastic setting and into personal homes and farms as newly independent monks needed to find a way to earn money for themselves.
The distillation process was still in its infancy; whisky itself was not allowed to age, and as a result tasted very raw and brutal compared to today’s versions.  Renaissance-era whisky was also very potent and not diluted.  Over time whisky evolved into a much smoother drink.
With a licence to distil Irish whiskey from 1608, the Old Bushmills Distillery in the north coast of Ireland is the oldest licenced whiskey distillery in the world.Ciaran Brady (2000). Encyclopedia of Ireland: an A-Z guide to its people, places, history, and culture. Oxford University Press, p.11
In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and thereafter taxes on it rose dramatically.[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Whisky|url=http://www.thewhiskyguide.com/Facts/History.html[/tpl]
thumb|left|upright|A man pours some whisky into a flask in this 1869 oil painting by Scottish artist Erskine Nicol.After the English Malt Tax of 1725, most of Scotland’s distillation was either shut down or forced underground. Scotch whisky was hidden under altars, in coffins, and in any available space to avoid the governmental Excisemen. Scottish distillers, operating out of homemade stills, took to distilling whisky at night when the darkness hid the smoke from the stills. For this reason, the drink became known as moonshine.Peggy Trowbridge Filippone, Whiskey History - The history of whisky, About.com. At one point, it was estimated that over half of Scotland’s whisky output was illegal.
In America, whisky was used as currency during the American Revolution. It also was a highly coveted sundry and when an additional excise tax was levied against it, the Whiskey Rebellion erupted in 1791.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alcoholreviews.com/wp/?p=1237 |title=Kevin R.

In 1823, the UK passed the Excise Act, legalizing the distillation (for a fee), and this put a practical end to the large-scale production of Scottish moonshine.
In 1831, Aeneas Coffey patented the Coffey still, allowing for cheaper and more efficient distillation of whisky. In 1850, Andrew Usher began producing a blended whisky that mixed traditional pot still whisky with that from the new Coffey still. The new distillation method was scoffed at by some Irish distillers, who clung to their traditional pot stills. Many Irish contended that the new product was, in fact, not whisky at all.[tpl]cite book|title=Irish Whiskey - A 1000 year tradition|isbn=0-86278-228-7|page=144|last=Magee|first=Malachy|year=1980|publisher=O'Brien press[/tpl]
By  the 1880s, the French brandy industry was devastated by the phylloxera pest that ruined much of the grape crop; as a result, whisky became the primary liquor in many markets.
During the Prohibition era in the United States lasting from 1920 to 1933, all alcohol sales were banned in the country. The federal government made an exemption for whisky prescribed by a doctor and sold through licensed pharmacies. During this time, the Walgreens pharmacy chain grew from 20 retail stores to almost 400.When Capitalism Meets Cannabis

==Production==

===Distillation===

A still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink.  Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.
Column stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and is the most commonly used type of still in the production of Bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40-50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 96%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.

===Aging===

Whiskies do not mature in the bottle, only in the cask, so the "age" of a whisky is only the time between distillation and bottling. This reflects how much the cask has interacted with the whisky, changing its chemical makeup and taste. Whiskies that have been bottled for many years may have a rarity value, but are not "older" and not necessarily "better" than a more recent whisky that matured in wood for a similar time. After a decade or two, additional aging in a barrel does not necessarily improve a whisky.

===Packaging===

Most whiskies are sold at or near an alcoholic strength of 40% abv, which is the statutory minimum in some countries – although the strength can vary, and cask-strength whisky may have as much as twice that alcohol percentage.

===Exports===

Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland's manufactured products. Exports have increased by 87% in the past decade and it contributes over £4.25 billion to the UK economy, making up a quarter of all its food and drink revenues.[tpl]cite web |title=Scotch Whisky Exports Hit Record Level |author=Scotch Whisky Association |url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/documents/scotch-whisky-exports-hit-record-level/ |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] In 2012, the US was the largest market for Scotch whisky (£655 million), followed by France (£535 million).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/03/foodanddrinkexports270312 | title=Record high for food and drink | publisher=Government of Scotland | date=27 March 2012 | accessdate=17 January 2014[/tpl] It is also one of the UK's overall top five manufacturing export earners and it supports around 35,000 jobs.[tpl]cite web |title=Scotch Whisky Briefing 2013 |author=Scotch Whisky Association |url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/news-media/media-press/publications/publication/2039/scotch-whisky-briefing-2013/ |accessdate=12 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay, where there are eight distilleries providing a major source of employment.

==Types==

Whisky or whisky-like products are produced in most grain-growing areas. They differ in base product, alcoholic content, and quality.
Malts and grains are combined in various ways:

===American===

American whiskey is distilled from a fermented mash of cereal grain. It must have the taste, aroma, and other characteristics commonly attributed to whiskey.
Some types of whiskey listed in the United States federal regulations[tpl]cite web|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/27cfr5.22.pdf|title=Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations, Pt. 5.22|accessdate=17 October 2008[/tpl] are:
These types of American whiskey must be distilled to no more than 80% alcohol by volume, and barrelled at no more than 125 proof. Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of moonshine.
If one of these whiskey types reaches two years aging or beyond, it is additionally designated as straight, e.g., straight rye whiskey. A whiskey that fulfils all above requirements but derives from less than 51% of any one specific grain can be called simply a straight whiskey without naming a grain.
US regulations recognize other whiskey categories, including:
American blended whiskeys combine straight whiskey with neutral grain spirit (NGS), flavourings and colourings. The percentage of NGS must be disclosed on the label and may be as much at 80% on a proof gallon basis. Blended whiskey has the same alcohol content as straight whiskey but typically has a milder flavour.
Another important labelling in the marketplace is Tennessee whiskey, of which Jack Daniel's, George Dickel, Collier and McKeel,Collier and McKeel company web site. and Benjamin Prichard's[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prichardsdistillery.com/whiskey/tennessee-whiskey.cfm|title=Benjamin Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey|accessdate=January 2011[/tpl] are the only brands currently bottled. The main difference defining a Tennessee whiskey is its use of the Lincoln County Process, which involves filtration of the whiskey through charcoal.  In practice, it is essentially identical to bourbon whiskey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chuckcowdery.blogspot.com/2009/12/favorite-whiskey-myths-debunked.html|title=Favorite whiskey myths debunked|author=Charles K.

===Canadian===

By Canadian law Canadian whiskies must be produced and aged in Canada, be distilled from a fermented mash of cereal grain, be aged in wood barrels with a capacity limit of [tpl]convert|700|L|USgal impgal|0[/tpl] for not less than three years, and "possess the aroma, taste and character generally attributed to Canadian whisky"."Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) - Canadian Whisky, Canadian Rye Whisky or Rye Whisky (B.02.020)". (Access date 30 December 2013) The terms "Canadian Whisky", "Rye Whisky", and "Canadian Rye Whisky" are legally indistinguishable in Canada and do not require any specific grain in their production. Canadian whiskies may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits, and there is no maximum limit on the alcohol level of the distillation. To be exported under one of the "Canadian Whisky" designations, a whisky cannot contain more than 9.09% imported spirits.[tpl]cite web|title=Terms and Conditions for the Issuance of Certificates of Age and Origin for Distilled Spirits Produced or Packaged in Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-2009-61/page-2.html#sched1|publisher=Canada - Justice Laws Website|accessdate=1 January 2013[/tpl]

===Danish===

Denmark began producing whisky early in the 21st century. The first Danish single malt to go on sale was Lille Gadegård from Bornholm, in 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Bornholm/2009/05/05/05110016.htm |title=(in Danish) |publisher=Dr.dk |accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] Lille Gadegård is a winery as well, and uses its own wine casks to mature whisky.
The second Danish distilled single malt whisky for sale was Edition No.1 from the Braunstein microbrewery and distillery. It was distilled in 2007, using water from the Greenlandic ice sheet, and entered the market in March 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/dansk-whisky-destilleres-paa-indlandsis |title=B.T., "Dansk whisky destilleres på indlandsis", (in Danish)|publisher=Bt.dk |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]

===English===

There are currently three distilleries producing English whisky. Though England is not very well known for making whisky there were distillers previously operating in London, Liverpool and Bristol until the late 19th century, after which production of English single malt whisky ceased until 2003.Cornish take on Scotch, BBC news, Thursday, 1 May 2003.

===German===

German whisky production is a relatively recent phenomenon having only started in the last 30 years. The styles produced resemble those made in Ireland, Scotland and the United States: single malts, blends, wheat, and bourbon-like styles. There is no standard spelling of German whiskies with distilleries using both "whisky" and "whiskey". In 2008 there were 23 distilleries in Germany producing whisky.[tpl]cite book|title=Whiskey| last=MaClean|first=Charles|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-3349-3|pages=254–265 [/tpl]

There are several types of whiskey common to Ireland: single malt, single grain, blended whiskey and pure pot still whiskey.

===Japanese===

The model for Japanese whiskies is the single malt Scotch, although there are also examples of Japanese blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted barley, dried in kilns fired with a little peat (although considerably less than in Scotland), and distilled using the pot still method. Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. Japanese whiskies, such as Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2012, they and other Japanese whiskeys have earned a reputation as a high quality product.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html |title=Awards Won by Nikka Whisky | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217035526/http://www.nikka.com/eng/award/index.html | archivedate = 2013-12-17 |publisher=Nikka.com |accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Nicholas Coldicott|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fg20080523lc.html | archiveurl = | archivedate = |title= Japanese malt scotches rivals |website=The Japan Times Online |date= 23 May 2008[/tpl]

The basic types of Scotch are malt and grain, which are combined to create blends. The distinctive smoky flavour that can often be found in Scotch is due to the use of peat smoke to treat their malt. Scotch malt whiskies are divided into five main regions: Highland, Lowland, Islay, Speyside and Campbeltown.

==Chemistry==

Whiskies and other distilled beverages, such as cognac, and rum are complex beverages that contain a vast range of flavouring compounds, of which some 200 to 300 are easily detected by chemical analysis. The flavouring chemicals include "carbonyl compounds, alcohols, carboxylic acids and their esters, nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, tannins and other polyphenolic compounds, terpenes, and oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds" and esters of fatty acids.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=0-8247-8390-5|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=548[/tpl]  The nitrogen compounds include pyridines, picolines and pyrazines.[tpl]cite book|title=Food Chemistry|isbn=3-540-40818-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_QWbLTSL6HoC|page=936|last=Belitz|first=Hans-Dieter|coauthors=Peter Schieberle &  Werner Grosch |year=2004|publisher=Springer[/tpl]

===Flavours from distillation===

The flavouring of whisky is partially determined by the presence of congeners and fusel oils. Fusel oils are higher alcohols than ethanol, are mildly toxic, and have a strong, disagreeable smell and taste. An excess of fusel oils in whisky is considered a defect. A variety of methods are employed in the distillation process to remove unwanted fusel oils.  Traditionally, American distillers focused on secondary filtration using charcoal, gravel, sand, or linen to remove undesired distillates.
Canadian distillers traditionally employ column stills, which can be controlled to produce an almost pure (and less flavourful) ethanol known as neutral grain spirit or grain neutral spirit (GNS).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pharmco-prod.com/pages/ep1.pdf|title=Pure Alcohol (Ethanol)|format=PDF|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl] Flavour is restored by blending the neutral grain spirits with flavouring whiskies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thespiritworld.net/2007/08/25/canadian-whisky/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103210147/http://thespiritworld.net/2007/08/25/canadian-whisky/|archivedate=3 January 2009|title=Canadian Whisky|publisher=The Spirit World|date=25 August 2007|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Robert Hess[/tpl]
Acetals are rapidly formed in distillates and a great many are found in distilled beverages, the most prominent being acetaldehyde diethyl acetal (1,1-diethoxyethane). Among whiskies the highest levels are associated with malt whisky.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=0-8247-8390-5|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=553[/tpl] This acetal is a principal flavour compound in sherry, and contributes fruitiness to the aroma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beerbrewer.co.uk/2007/06/|title=June 2007|publisher=The Beer Brewer|accessdate=8 December 2007[/tpl]
The diketone diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) has a buttery aroma and is present in almost all distilled beverages. Whiskies and cognacs typically contain more of this than vodkas, but significantly less than rums or brandies.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=0-8247-8390-5|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=554[/tpl]

===Flavours from oak===

Whisky that has been aged in oak barrels absorbs substances from the wood. One of these is cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide, known as the "whisky lactone" or "quercus lactone", a compound with a strong coconut aroma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wine-pages.com/guests/tom/taste5.htm|title=Aromas and Flavours|publisher=Wine-Pages.com|accessdate=8 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Food Chemistry|isbn=3-540-40818-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_QWbLTSL6HoC|page=383|last=Belitz|first=Hans-Dieter|coauthors=Peter Schieberle &  Werner Grosch |year=2004|publisher=Springer[/tpl]
Commercially charred oaks are rich in phenolic compounds. One study identified 40 different phenolic compounds. The coumarin scopoletin is present in whisky, with the highest level reported in Bourbon whiskey.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_OvXjhLUz-oC|title=Volatile Compounds in Foods and Beverages|isbn=0-8247-8390-5|last=Maarse|first=H. |year=1991|publisher=CRC Press|page=574[/tpl]

===Flavours and colouring from additives===

Depending on the local regulations, additional flavourings and colouring compounds may be added to the whisky. Canadian whisky may contain caramel and flavouring in addition to the distilled mash spirits. Scotch whisky may contain added (E150A) caramel colouring, but no other additives. The addition of flavourings is not allowed in American "straight" whiskey, but is allowed in American blends.

===Chill filtration===

Whisky is often "chill filtered": chilled to precipitate out fatty acid esters and then filtered to remove them. Most whiskies are bottled this way, unless specified as unchillfiltered or non chill filtered. This is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. Unchillfiltered whiskeys often turn cloudy when stored at cool temperatures or when cool water is added to them, and this is perfectly normal.[tpl]cite web|title=Chill Filtration|url=http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/chill_filtration.html|work=Whiskey Basics|publisher=Whisky for Everyone|accessdate=21 March 2013[/tpl]
