==History==

Kominkan were in use in the early 1940s, although many were established after World War II under the Social Education Act of 1947.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Iwasa |first1=Takaaki |last2= |first2= |year=2010 |title=It is Time for Japanese Kominkan to Flower Again |journal=Adult Education and Development |volume=74 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.iiz-dvv.de/index.php?article_id=1075&clang=1 |accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]  Kominkan were explicitly intended to provide cultural support for post-war communities, for "activities that contributed to re-building the communities after the devastation and upheavals of the war aftermath."

According to the text of the Japanese Social Education Act, they “provide the people living in specific areas such as a city, town or village with education adapted to meet the demands of actual life and implement academic and cultural activities. Kominkan shall contribute to the cultivation of residents, improve health, develop character, enliven daily culture, and enhance social welfare.” Social Education Act, Article 20, as quoted in Iwasa 2012.
In establishing Kominkan, the national government of Japan has invested substantial financial resources since the 1940s. In 1979, the national government spent 10 billion yen for infrastructure and administration.Maruyama Hideki, http://www.nier.go.jp/English/EducationInJapan/Education_in_Japan/Education_in_Japan_files/201109LLL.pdf
