Mohawk [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|h|ɔː|k[/tpl]Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh (Mohawk:  Kanien’kéha, "gan-yun-GEH-ha"[tpl]clarify|date=May 2013[/tpl]) is an Iroquoian language spoken by around 3,000 people of the Mohawk nation in the United States (mainly western and northern New York) and Canada (southern Ontario and Quebec).

==Dialects==

Mohawk has three major dialects: Western (Ohswé:ken and Kenhté:ke), Central (Ahkwesáhsne), and Eastern (Kahnawà:ke and Kanehsatà:ke); the differences between them are largely phonological.  These are related to the major Mohawk territories since the eighteenth century.  The pronunciation of [tpl]IPA|/r/[/tpl] and several consonant clusters may differ in the dialects.

==Status==

Mohawk has the largest number of speakers of the Northern Iroquoian languages; today it is the only one with greater than a thousand remaining.  At Akwesasne, residents have begun a language immersion school (pre-K to grade 8) in Kanien’kéha to revive the language.  With their children learning it, parents and other family members are taking language classes, too.
In 2006, over 600 people were reported to speak the language in Canada, many of them elderly.Statistics Canada, 2006 Census of Population, Statistics Canada catalogue no. 97-558-XCB2006015

==Phonology==

The phoneme inventory is as follows (using the International Phonetic Alphabet). Phonological representation (underlying forms) are in /slashes/, and the standard Mohawk orthography is in bold.

===Consonants===

An interesting feature of Mohawk (and Iroquoian) phonology is that there are no labials, except in a few adoptions from French and English, where [tpl]IPA|m[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|p[/tpl] appear (e.g., mátsis matches and aplám Abraham); these sounds are late additions to Mohawk phonology and were introduced after widespread European contact.  The word "Mohawk" is an exonym.
The Central (Ahkwesáhsne) dialect has the following consonant clusters:
All clusters can occur word-medially; those on a red background can also occur word-initially.
The consonants [tpl]IPA|/k/, /t/[/tpl] and the clusters [tpl]IPA|/ts kw/[/tpl] are pronounced voiced before any voiced sound (i.e. a vowel or [tpl]IPA|/j/[/tpl]). They are voiceless at the end of a word or before a voiceless sound. [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] is voiced word initially and between vowels.
Note that th and sh are pronounced as consonant clusters, not single sounds like in English thing and  she.

===Vowels===

i, e, a, and o are oral vowels, while [tpl]IPA|ʌ̃[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ũ[/tpl] (see help:IPA) are nasalized; oral versions of [tpl]IPA|ʌ̃[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|ũ[/tpl] do not occur in the language.

==Orthography==

The Mohawk alphabet consists of these letters: a e h i k n o r s t w y along with ’ and :. The orthography was standardized in 1993."Mohawk Language Standardization Project", Kanienkehaka The standard allows for some variation of how the language is represented, and the clusters [tpl]IPA|/ts(i)/[/tpl], [tpl]IPA|/tj/[/tpl], and [tpl]IPA|/ky/[/tpl] are written as pronounced in each community. The orthography matches the phonological analysis as above except:
The low-macron accent is not a part of standard orthography and isn't used by the Central or Eastern dialects.
In standard orthography, /h/ is written before /n/ to create the en or on: kehnhó:tons 'I am closing it'.

===Stress, length, and tone===

Stress, vowel length and tone are linked together in Mohawk. There are three kinds of stressed vowels: short-high tone, long-high tone, and long-falling tone. Stress is always written and occurs only once per word.

==Grammar==

Mohawk expresses a large number of pronominal distinctions: person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), gender (masculine, feminine/indefinite, feminine/neuter) and inclusivity/exclusivity on the first person dual and plural.  Pronominal information is encoded in prefixes on the verbs; separate pronoun words are used for emphasis. There are three main paradigms of pronominal prefixes: subjective (with dynamic verbs), objective (with stative verbs), and transitive.

==Current number of speakers==

As of 1994, there were approximately 3,000 speakers of Mohawk, primarily in Quebec, Ontario and western New York.Moseley, Christopher and R. E. Asher, ed. Atlas of World Languages (New York: ROutelege, 1994) p. 7  Immersion (monolingual) classes for young children at Akwesasne and other reserves are helping to train new first-language speakers. Kahnawake and  Kanatsiohareke offer immersion classes for adults. As of 2006, less than 300 people in Canada (Quebec and Ontario) have any knowledge of the language. About 250 of which lived off-reserve in urban areas.

==Alexander Graham Bell==

The Scottish scientist Alexander Graham Bell, one of the inventors of the telephone, was greatly interested in the human voice, and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its then unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.Groundwater, Jennifer.

==In popular culture==

Mohawk dialogue features prominently in Ubisoft Montreal's 2012 action-adventure open world video game Assassin's Creed III, through the game's main character, the half-Mohawk, half-English Ratonhnhaké:ton ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ə|d|uː|n|h|ə|g|'|eɪ|d|uː|n[/tpl]; "ra-doon-ha-GAY-doon"), also called Connor, and members of his native Kanièn:ke village around the times of the American revolution. Ratonhnhaké:ton was voiced and modelled by Crow actor Noah Bulaagawish Watts.
