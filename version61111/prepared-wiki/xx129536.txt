===Lorain High School===

Lorain High School reopened in the fall of 2010. The original Lorain High School was located on Washington Avenue and 6th Street and was demolished in the summer of 2010. The original school colors were lavender and purple; its fight colors were black and gold. The original mascot was the Steelmen which until the mid to late '80s was represented by a robot-type figure which was later replaced by a muscular steel worker. The current school is a product of the merger of Lorain Admiral King High School and Lorain Southview High School. It has been announced that the school's mascot will be the Titans with the school colors being navy blue and silver.
As of 2010, Lorain High School was housed in the former Lorain Admiral King High School building. Beginning in the fall of 2012, Lorain High School was rehoused in the former Lorain Southview High School and Southview Middle School to make way for the development of the new high school.

====Fight Song====

''The fight song is set to "Our Director" by F.E Bigelow.  
As of 2010, the fight song was rearranged by Timothy Sivik and Dave Hager; percussion parts by Andy Bennekamper.'' 
Fight on, you Mighty Titans, 
Silver and blue 
for Lorain High School 
Loyal, Brave, and True 
 
On the march to victory, 
Noble and strong 
To Lorain High School 
We raise our song

===Lorain Admiral King High School===

Formerly the largest high school in the Lorain City School District, Admiral King High School opened in 1961.  Admiral King High School was named for Lorain native Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King a former Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet. 
The high school was renamed Lorain Admiral King High School when it was merged with Lorain High School in 1995. The school's colors were navy blue and gold.  The mascot was the ram, and the sports teams were known as the Admirals.  The school was previously a member of the Lake Erie League.  The tunes to the school's alma mater and fight song were "Eternal Father, Strong to Save" and "Anchors Aweigh", respectively.  The words to the alma mater are:

====Alma Mater====

Lyrics by Marjean Ross, Class of 1964 
 
Hail to our Colors Gold and Blue,  
Hail to our Alma Matter True... 
throughout the Years we shall stand by,  
with PRIDE we'll keep your Standards High,  
The Values we established here will make our Memories ever Dear.  
 
Oh, Admiral King, so Strong and Bold our Endless Love can ne'er be told,  
the Light that you established here  
will be a Beacon through the years  
and bring us Always Home to Sing...The Glories of Our ADMIRAL KING! 
 

===Lorain Southview High School===

Southview High School was completed in 1969. Its school colors were red, white and originally baby blue (which was later changed to navy). The sports teams were known as the Saints. The mascot was a young boy dressed as an angel with a black eye and a patch on his elbow. The school's fight song was "When the Saints Go Marching In." 
The school was previously a member of the Lake Erie League. Their Model UN, Army JROTC, wrestling team, and marching band have been given many honors. During the short lived small school years, the small schools were called: Leadership, Pride and Arts. 
The school board decided to close Southview High School at the end of the 2009-2010 school year and merge the Saints with the Admirals from Lorain Admiral King High School. Starting for the 2012 school year, Southview High School will be the temporary home of Lorain High School. Once the new high school is erected on the site of the former Admiral King High School, all students will then transfer there.
