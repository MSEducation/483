</ref> Due to their penetrating ability hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects, e.g. in [[medical radiography]] and [[airport security]]. As a result, the term ''X-ray'' is [[metonymy|metonymically]] used to refer to a [[radiographic]] image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms they are also useful for determining crystal structures by [[X-ray crystallography]]. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air and the [[attenuation length]] of 600 eV (~2&nbsp;nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ffast/ffast.pl?Formula=H2O&gtype=5&range=S&lower=0.300&upper=2.00&density=1.00 |title=Physics.nist.gov |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |accessdate=2011-11-08[/tpl]</ref>
There is no universal consensus for a definition distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays.  One common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus.[ref]
