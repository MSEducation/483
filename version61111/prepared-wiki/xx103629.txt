==History==

On February 15, 1972, Manabendra Narayan Larma founded the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (PCJSS), seeking to build an organisation representing all the tribal peoples of the Hill Tracts. Larma was elected to the Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad, the national legislature of Bangladesh as candidate of the PCJSS in 1973.[tpl]cite web |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/L_0068.htm |title=Larma, Manabendra Narayan|accessdate=2008-06-05 |publisher= Banglapedia - National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh[/tpl] When Larma's continued efforts to make the state recognise the rights of the tribal peoples failed, Larma and the PCJSS began organising the Shanti Bahini (Peace Corps), an armed force operating in the Hill Tracts area. Later on, this force began attacking state security forces in 1977. They carried out viscous kidnapping of civilians and extortion. Larma and his rebels still kept on fighting Bengali intrusion into tribal areas.[ref]

However, factionalism within the PCJS weakened Larma's standing and he was assassinated on November 10, 1983.
