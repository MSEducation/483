[[List of Brick Gothic buildings]]

CATEGORIES: Brick Gothic, Gothic architecture, Architecture lists, Bricks, Hanseatic League

Brick Gothic is a style of Gothic architecture widespread in the Northern Germany and the Baltic region. Its distinction from the preceding Brick Romanesque and succeeding Brick Renaissance is not always sharp. Often, Romanesque buildings were altered or added to in the Gothic style, others were begun while the Romanesque style prevailed, but completed in a Gothic fashion due to the slow building process. Such buildings can be classed equally with both styles. 
The distribution of Brick Gothic is largely identical with the sphere of influence of the Hanseatic League, with a preponderance in the younger cities east of the Elbe. Besides urban representative buildings, cathedrals and churches, monasteries of the Mendicant Orders and other communities, especially the Cistercians and the Premonstratensians, played an important role. Between Prussia and Estonia, the Teutonic Knights erected brick Ordensburgen. 
This list does not aim to be complete. It does not attempt to list all of the thousands of Brick Gothic buildings that exist or once existed. Instead, it aims to list significant structures, buildings that are considered especially important for stylistic, functional, or other reasons. The main criterion is a building's being listed in art historical survey works on Brick Gothice.g. Angela Pfotenhauer, Florian Monheim, Carola Nathan: Backsteingotik. Monumente-Edition. Monumente-Publikation der Deutschen Stiftung Denkmalschutz, Bonn 2000, ISBN 3-935208-00-6; Hans Josef BÃ¶ker: Die mittelalterliche Backsteinarchitektur Norddeutschlands. Darmstadt 1988. ISBN 3-534-02510-5 and/or that its outstanding role has been referred to in individual scientific publications.
The dates given here refer to the present extant Gothic structures. Predecessors or post-Gothic alterations are not normally mentioned, but can be assessed by following up the literature. The most influential structures are indicated by bold print. Romanesque and Renaissance structures are not listed. Similarly, Gothic Brick structures from outside the Baltic or North German regions, e.g. the Danubian ones, are omitted, as art historical terminology does not normally treat them as Brick Gothic. Neogothic edifices are also not listed.
