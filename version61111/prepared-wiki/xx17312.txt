==Infrastructure==

===Communication===

Chennai is one of the four cities in India through which the country is connected with the rest of the world through undersea fibre-optic cables, the other three being Mumbai, Kochi, and Tuticorin. The city is the landing point of major submarine telecommunication cable networks such as SMW4 (connecting India with Western Europe, Middle East and Southeast Asia), i2i (connecting India with Singapore), TIC (connecting India with Singapore), and BRICS (connecting India with Russia, China, South Africa, Brazil and the United States). The 3,175-km-long, 8-fiber-paired i2i has the world's largest design capacity of 8.4 terabits per second.[ref]

As of 2007, nine mobile phone service companies operate nine GSM networks and two CDMA networks in the city. There are four land line companies.[ref]
 Annexure lists these six entities as the licensed cellular operators for the Chennai circle. The CDMA Development Group's official website lists Tata Teleservices and Reliance Communications as the only operators to have deployed CDMA on cellular systems in India. 
[/ref] Commercial and domestic broadband Internet services are provided by all the four service providers and a majority of the mobile network service providers. Chennai was the first Indian city to have the Wi-Fi facility in a widespread manner.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-15/chennai/28210956_1_wi-fi-services-wi-fi-internet-router|title=Chennai is now wi-fi-enabled|work=The Times of India|accessdate = 28 December 2012|date=15 June 2009[/tpl] As of 2010, there were 9.8 million mobile phone users in Chennai.[ref]
</ref> In 2010, Chennai had the fourth highest number of active Internet users in India, with 2.2 million users.<ref>

===Power===

Major power plants in the city include North Chennai Thermal Power Station, GMR Vasavi Diesel Power Plant, Ennore Thermal Power Station, Basin Bridge Gas Turbine Power Station, Madras Atomic Power Station, Vallur Thermal Power Project, and North Chennai Power Company Limited.
According to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco), as of 2013, the city consumes about 20 percent of the electricity in the state of Tamil Nadu. The peak evening demand of the city is 1,500 MW which is about 50 percent of the state's peak evening demand of 3,000 megawatt. This includes 37 percent consumption by the industrial sector, 30 percent by the domestic sector, 18 percent by the agricultural sector, and 11.5 percent by the commercial sector. The peak power consumption is for four months between May and August, with the city consuming the highest during June because it is when the summer peaks. On 20 June 2013, the city consumed the highest of 52,785 MU.[ref]
</ref>

</ref> Availability of power in the city has become a concern in recent years due to increasing demand and slow paced addition of power plants, due to which scheduled power cuts have become increasingly common. However, this situation is expected to be rectified soon by the end of 2013.<ref>[tpl]cite web|author=PTI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-08/india/36992443_1_vallur-solar-power-thermal-power-projects |title=No power cuts in Tamil Nadu from this year end, says Jaya |work=The Times of India |accessdate=10 June 2013[/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite web|author=Padmini Sivarajah, TNN 5 Feb 2013, 05.28AM IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-05/madurai/36763347_1_uninterrupted-power-power-situation-power-crisis |title=Power crisis improving in southern Tamil Nadu |work=The Times of India |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013[/tpl]</ref> As of 2012, the total electricity consumption by the street lamps in the city is 19&nbsp;MW a day, costing about [tpl]INR[/tpl] [tpl]formatnum:20000000[/tpl] per month to run.<ref name="CC_Electrical">

===Banking===

The RBI ranked Chennai as fourth largest deposit centre and third largest credit centre nationwide as of June 2012. Prior to the advent of modern commercial banks, the banking services in the city were offered to the public by Nattukottai Chettiars or Nagarathars, chiefly in and around the neighbourhood of George Town, who offered loans as well as accepted money deposits from the public, in addition to offering liberal loans to the agricultural labourers. Even today, many of the banking offices are housed in heritage structures belonging to the Colonial era that are chiefly clustered around North Beach Road or Rajaji Salai in George Town.[ref]
</ref>
Chennai is home to the first European-style banking system in India with the establishment of the 'Madras Bank' on 21 June 1683, almost a century before the establishment of the first commercial banks, such as the Bank of Hindustan and the General Bank of India, which were established in 1770 and 1786, respectively. However, the bank proved a failure.[ref]
