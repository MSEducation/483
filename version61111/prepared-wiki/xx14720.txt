Columbia Business School (CBS) is the business school of Columbia University in Manhattan, New York City. It was established in 1916 to provide business training and professional preparation for undergraduate and graduate Columbia University students. It is one of six Ivy League business schools, and its admission process is among the most selective of top business schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://businessmajors.about.com/od/bschoolrankings/tp/TopSelectiveMBA.htm|title=Top 5 Most Selective Business Schools|publisher=About.com|accessdate=April 6, 2008[/tpl]
Columbia Business School is one of the world's leading business schools, and prides itself on its excellent faculty, who provide students with superior knowledge and thought leadership across divisions and disciplines. Its location in New York City and strong ties to industry promises students access to top business minds, and the diverse community spans sectors and nations, making an impact in small start-ups as well as established industries. Columbia Business School is perhaps best known for value investing and the seminal work completed in that area by professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. It is affiliated with 13 winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics including current professors Robert Mundell, Joseph Stiglitz and Edmund Phelps, more than any business school in the United States. The school has an international emphasis, and many alumni have achieved distinction in the public as well as the private sector.

==History==

A. Barton Hepburn, then president of Chase Manhattan Bank, founded the School in 1916 with 11 full-time faculty members and an opening class of 61 students, including 8 women. The School expanded rapidly, enrolling 420 students by 1920, and in 1924 added a PhD program to the existing BS and MS degree programs.http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/about/history
In 1945, Columbia Business School authorized the awarding of the MBA degree. Shortly thereafter, in the 1950s, the School adopted the Hermes emblem as its symbol, reflecting the entrepreneurial nature of the Greek god Hermes and his association with business, commerce and communication.http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/alumni/news/New-Visual-Identity
In 1952, CBS admitted its last class of undergraduates. The school currently offers executive education programs that culminate in a Certificate in Business Excellence (CIBE) and full alumni status, and several degree programs for the MBA and PhD degrees. In addition to the full-time MBA, the school offers four Executive MBA programs: the NY-EMBA Friday/Saturday program, the EMBA-Global program (launched in 2001 in conjunction with the London Business School), the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program (launched in 2002 in conjunction with the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley), and the EMBA-Global Asia program (launching in 2009 in conjunction with the London Business School and the University of Hong Kong Business School). Students in jointly run programs earn an MBA degree from each of the cooperating institutions.
On July 1, 2004, R. Glenn Hubbard became Columbia Business School's eleventh dean.  Hubbard, the former chair of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, has worked at the intersection of the private, government and nonprofit sectors and played an active role in shaping national and international economic policy, including the deregulation policy leading up Wall Street bank failures in 2008. In Charles Ferguson's 2010 documentary, Inside Job, when prompted, Hubbard strongly maintains that his political and financial connections to government and Wall Street firms do not create any potential academic conflict of interest.

==Campus==

Today, Columbia Business School is primarily housed in Uris Hall, a recently renovated 1960s structure at the center of Columbia's Morningside Heights campus. An auxiliary space, Warren Hall, is situated on Amsterdam Avenue and is shared with the law school. Eventually, the school will be moved to a new, more spacious facility at Columbia's planned new campus on 125th Street in Manhattanville,currently under construction.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/06/11/bschool.html|title=Columbia University Announces Business School Plan to Move in First Phase of Proposed Expansion in Manhattanville|accessdate=December 30, 2007|publisher=Columbia University[/tpl]

Columbia Business School has a firm grade non-disclosure policy, stating that students refrain from disclosing specific class grades, GPAs, or transcripts until they accept full-time, post graduation positions.http://cbsgba.com/culture/grade-non-disclosure-gnd Students enter Columbia's MBA program in two tracks.  The traditional fall term is approximately 550 students, while the January term "J-Term" is approximately 200 students.  Students entering in the fall are divided into eight clusters of approximately 65 students that take all first year core classes together. J-Term students are broken into three clusters.  The J-Term is aimed at students who want an accelerated 18 month program who usually plan to return to their previous job, are company sponsored, and will not pursue a summer internship because they take classes during the summer.
The recently launched Columbia CaseWorks program utilizes the faculty’s research and industry experience and brings that perspective into the classroom through the development of new cases and teaching materials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/caseworks/about|title=About CaseWorks|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008[/tpl] Beginning in orientation and continuing through core classes and electives, students are immersed in cases that use faculty research to address real-world business issues. Columbia CaseWorks challenges students to debate corporate decision making and to develop appropriate recommendations and solutions.  During their first year, students study and discuss an integrated case that focuses on a single company and is incorporated into several core courses.  This encourages students to think about a company holistically, analyzing it from the perspective of various disciplines.http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/academics/versatile

==Executive MBA programs==

Columbia offers various executive MBA programs.
The Executive MBA (EMBA) Friday/Saturday Program is a 20-month graduate program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education without interrupting their careers. The EMBA program is taught on campus at Columbia University by full-time faculty. The first year of classes consists of the same core curriculum as the Full-Time MBA program. Executive education is the focus of the second year.  This Friday/Saturday program is targeted at individuals with approximately 10 years of work experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/|title=Columbia Business School EMBA Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008[/tpl]
The Executive MBA (EMBA) Saturday Program is a 24 month graduate degree program designed for individuals that are looking to enhance their education, but cannot take any time away from work.  This program is the same as the Friday/Saturday program, with the exception that classes only meet on Saturdays over a longer period of time.
In addition to the New York–based EMBA Program, Columbia offers three partner programs to meet the differing needs and geographical distribution of prospective students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/emba/overview/partner/|title=EMBA: Partner Programs|year=2008|accessdate=April 26, 2008|publisher=Columbia University[/tpl] Because students in the partner EMBA programs must satisfy the separate requirements of each school, they earn an MBA degree from each participating university. Likewise, they become alumni of each university and business school and may avail themselves of all programs and privileges afforded to alumni.

Throughout the program, students become familiar with research methods and the literature of their major fields through research projects and directed reading.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/academics/overview|title=Columbia Business School Doctoral Program Overview|publisher=Columbia Business School|accessdate=April 4, 2008[/tpl] Doctoral candidates begin the program mastering basic research tools by studying subjects such as economics, behavioral science and quantitative methods, in addition to completing course work and examinations in the major field of study. The completion of course work and qualifying examinations normally requires two to three years.
The research phase begins as early as the first year, when students serve as research assistants, and continues throughout their time at the School. Students gradually become more involved in the design and execution of research and, by the end of the second year, have typically produced at least one paper suitable for publication, often as coauthor with a faculty member. The later years of the program are dedicated to original research and the creation of the dissertation.
