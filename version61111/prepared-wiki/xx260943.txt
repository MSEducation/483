Disposal of low-level radioactive waste will be in concrete containers buried 30 to 100 feet below the surface in tarp-lined cells in the red bed clay formations. Space between the containers will be grouted to help prevent shifting. As the cells are filled, they will be covered by more than 300 feet of liner material and red bed clay and the surface will be restored to its natural state.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wcstexas.com | title = Waste Control Specialists | archivedate= 2010-08-19 | archiveurl = http://www.wcstexas.com/ | quote = WCS is now the only facility in the United States licensed in the last 30 years, to dispose of Class A, B, and C low level radio active waste.[/tpl]

== Criticism == 
Critics allege that millions in donations by Harold Simmons to Texas Governor Rick Perry and other politicians influenced political support for the controversial project. 
After WCS drilled almost 600 wells to document the hydrology of the site, the state of Texas determined the WCS facility does not sit above or adjacent to any underground drinking water formations.The WCS website states that, although water is present at 800-1,000 feet below the surface, the water is considered "non potable and too salty for irrigation use". (http://www.wcstexas.com/fac_features.html) The Texas Water Development Board purportedly changed maps that had previously indicated the site lay above the Ogallala Aquifer.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/6075/how_does_your_water_glow/ | title = How Does Your Water Glow?[/tpl]  The individuals responsible for approving the facility's license at TCEQ, and those who revised aquifer maps, were appointed by Governor Perry. Members of the Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission, which voted to expand the facility, were also appointed by Governor Perry.

Critics also cite WCS' safety record after losing a 22-ton shipment of radioactive material in 2001 for almost a month.[tpl]cite web | url = http://texas.sierraclub.org/radwaste/highway.asp | title = Coming Soon To A Highway Near You[/tpl] The company was fined in 2004 & 2005 for a string of incidents including an employee improperly releasing radioactive material by flushing it down a toilet.  The company agreed to pay $161,000 in fines.[tpl]cite web | url = http://nukefreetexas.org/downloads/waste_dump_article_compilation.pdf | title = Good to Glow[/tpl]
