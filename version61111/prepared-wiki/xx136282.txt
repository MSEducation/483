[[Australian Flexible Learning Framework]]

CATEGORIES: Australian vocational education and training providers, Distance education in Australia

The Australian Flexible Learning Framework is a national strategy collaboratively funded by the Australian Government and all Australia's states and territories. 
It is intended to provide the vocational and technical education (VTE) system with e-learning skills, professional development opportunities, products, resources and support networks to meet today's increasingly technology-driven learning environment. The Framework has multiple strands, including Toolboxes, New Practices, Benchmarking, Client Engagement, Learnscope (professional development), Networks, and previously Flexible Learning Leaders. 
Its aim is to meet the e-learning needs of students and communities, business and industry, Indigenous learners and people with disabilities.
