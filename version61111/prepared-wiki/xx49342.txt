 In Rome, he was soon recognized by [[Cardinal Della Rovere]], shortly to become [[Pope Julius II]]. For Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile or possibly Julius II, Bramante designed one of the most harmonious buildings of the [[Renaissance]]: the [[Tempietto]] (1510) of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] on the [[Janiculum]]. Despite its small scale, the construction has all the rigorous proportions and symmetry of Classical structures, surrounded by slender Doric columns, surmounted by a dome. According to a later engraving by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], Bramante planned to set it within a colonnaded courtyard. In November 1503, Julius engaged Bramante for the construction of the grandest European architectural commission of the 16th century, the complete rebuilding of [[St Peter's Basilica]]. The cornerstone of the first of the great piers of the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]] was laid with ceremony on 17 April 1506. Very few drawings by Bramante survive, though some by his assistants do, demonstrating the extent of the team which had been assembled. Bramante's vision for St Peter's, a centralized Greek cross plan that symbolized sublime perfection for him and his generation (compare [[Santa Maria della Consolazione (Todi)|Santa Maria della Consolazione]] at [[Todi]], influenced by Bramante's work) was fundamentally altered by the extension of the [[nave]] after his death in 1514. Bramante's plan envisaged four great chapels filling the corner spaces between the equal [[transept]]s, each one capped with a smaller dome surrounding the great dome over the crossing. So Bramante's original plan was very much more Romano-Byzantine in its forms than the basilica that was actually built. (See [[St Peter's Basilica]] for further details.)

Bramante also worked on several other commissions. Among his earliest works in Rome, before the Basilica's construction was under way, is the cloister (1500â€“1504) of Santa Maria della Pace near Piazza Navona. The handsome proportions give an air of great simplicity.
