[[Geography of Benin]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Benin

Benin, a narrow, phallus-shaped, north-south strip of land in West Africa, lies between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer. Benin's latitude ranges from 6°30′ N to 12°30′ N and its longitude from 1° E to 3°40′ E. Benin is bounded by Togo to the west, Burkina Faso and Niger to the north, Nigeria to the east, and the Bight of Benin to the south.
With an area of [tpl]convert|112622|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl], it is slightly bigger than the nation of Bulgaria. Benin extends from the Niger River in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south, a distance of [tpl]convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Although the coastline measures [tpl]convert|121|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], the country measures about [tpl]convert|325|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at its widest point.
It is one of the smaller countries in West Africa, about one eighth the size of Nigeria, its neighbor to the east. It is, however, twice as large as Togo, its neighbor to the west. A relief map of Benin shows that it has little variation in elevation, averaging [tpl]convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in elevation.

==Biogeography==

The country can be divided into four main areas from the south to the north. The low-lying, sandy, coastal plain which has a highest elevation of [tpl]convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] is, at most, [tpl]convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons connected to the ocean. The plateaus of southern Benin, with an altitude ranging between [tpl]convert|20|and|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], are split by valleys running north to south along the Couffo, Zou, and Oueme Rivers, an area that has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion. Then an area of flat lands dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches [tpl]convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] extends around Nikki and Savé. Finally, the Atacora mountain range extends along the northwest border and into Togo with the highest point, Mont Sokbaro, at [tpl]convert|658|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Benin has fields lying fallow, mangroves, and remnants of large sacred forests. In the rest of the country, the savanna is covered with thorny scrubs and dotted with huge baobab trees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest of Benin the Reserve du W du Niger and Pendjari National Park attract tourists eager to see elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos and monkeys. Previously Benin offered habitat for the endangered Painted Hunting Dog, Lycaon pictus,C. Michael Hogan. 2009 although this canid is considered to have been extirpated from Benin, due to human population expansion. Woodlands comprise approximately 31 percent of the land area of Benin.Rebecca Kormos and Christophe Boesch. 2003

==Climate==

Benin's climate is hot and humid. Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages [tpl]convert|1360|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl], not particularly high for coastal West Africa. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In Cotonou, the average maximum temperature is [tpl]convert|31|C|F|1[/tpl]; the minimum is [tpl]convert|24|C|F|1[/tpl]. Variations in temperature increase when moving north through a savanna and plateau toward the Sahel. A dry wind from the Sahara called the harmattan blows from December to March. Grass dries up, the vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast. It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.
