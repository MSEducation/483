[[Renminbi]]

CATEGORIES: Currencies of China, 1949 introductions

The renminbi is the official currency of the People’s Republic of China.  The name ([tpl]zh|s=人民币|t=人民幣|p=rénmínbì[/tpl]) literally means "people's currency".
The yuan (元/圆) (sign: ¥) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but is also used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts. (The distinction between the terms "renminbi" and "yuan" is similar to that between sterling and pound, which respectively refer to the British currency and its primary unit.[tpl]cite news | title=Yuan or renminbi: what’s the right word for China’s currency? | first=Matt | last=Phillips | date=2010-01-21 | url=http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/06/21/yuan-or-renminbi-whats-the-right-word-for-chinas-currency/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | accessdate=2014-03-03 [/tpl])  One yuan is subdivided into 10 jiǎo (角), and a jiǎo in turn is subdivided into 10 fēn (分).
The ISO code for renminbi (which may also be used for the yuan) is CNY (an abbreviation for "Chinese yuan"), or also CNH when traded in Hong Kong.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-yuans-largest-drop-against-usd-since-2005-2014-2 | title=Chinese yuan's drop is largest since its 2005 currency revaluation | first=Mamta | last=Badkar | work=Business Insider | date=2014-02-27 | accessdate=2014-03-03 [/tpl] The currency is often abbreviated RMB, or indicated by the yuan sign ¥.   The latter may be written CN¥ to distinguish it from other currencies with same symbol (such as the Japanese yen). In Chinese texts the currency may also be indicated with the Chinese character for the yuan, 元 (or 圆 in traditional script), or rarely CN元. [tpl]citationneeded | CN元 seems infrequently used (maybe Chinese only?), not in any reliable sources; CN¥ seems to not turn up in Google or Bing due to technical issues. | date=March 2014[/tpl] 
The renminbi is legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Macau. Renminbi is sometimes accepted in Hong Kong and Macau, and are easily exchanged in the two territories, with banks in Hong Kong allowing people to maintain accounts in RMB. The currency is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China.[ref]Article 2, 
[/ref]
Until 2005, the value of the renminbi was pegged to the U.S. dollar.  As China pursued its historical transition from central planning to a market economy, and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity (see below).[tpl]cite journal|last=Lipman|first=Joshua Klein|title=Law of Yuan Price: Estimating Equilibrium of the Renminbi|journal=Michigan Journal of Business|date=April 2011|volume=4|issue=2|url=http://michiganjb.org/issues/42/text42b.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-23[/tpl] More recently, however, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/chinas-currency-rises-against-the-dollar/2012/09/28/790415be-099e-11e2-a10c-fa5a255a9258_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Howard | last=Schneider | title=Some experts say China's currency policy is not a danger to the U.S. economy | date=2012-09-29[/tpl]
Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it has become the world's 8th most traded currency.[tpl]cite web|title=RMB now 8th most traded currency in the world|url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/shownews?param_dcr=news.data/en/swift_com/2013/PR_RMB_september.xml|publisher=Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl]

==History==

A variety of currencies circulated in China during the Republic of China (ROC) era, most of which were denominated in the unit yuán (pronounced [tpl]IPA|jʏɛn˧˥[/tpl]). Each was distinguished by a currency name, such as the fabi ("legal tender"), the "gold yuan", and the "silver yuan".
As the Communist Party of China took control of ever larger territories in the latter part of the Chinese Civil War, its People's Bank of China began in 1948 to issue a unified currency for use in Communist-controlled territories. Also denominated in yuan, this currency was identified by different names, including "People's Bank of China banknotes" ([tpl]zh|t=中國人民銀行鈔票|s=中国人民银行钞票[/tpl]; from November 1948), "New Currency" ([tpl]zh|t=新幣|s=新币[/tpl]; from December 1948), "People's Bank of China notes" ([tpl]zh|t=中國人民銀行券|s=中国人民银行券[/tpl]; from January 1949), "People's Notes" (人民券, as an abbreviation of the last name), and finally "People's Currency", or "renminbi", from June 1949.[tpl]cite web|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/money/collection/youbika/20050901/15471935211.shtml |title=中华人民共和国第一套人民币概述 |publisher=Finance.sina.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06[/tpl]

==Convertibility==

During the era of the command economy, the value of the renminbi  was set to unrealistic values in exchange with western currency and severe currency exchange rules were put in place. With the opening of the mainland Chinese economy in 1978, a dual-track currency system was instituted, with renminbi usable only domestically, and with foreigners forced to use foreign exchange certificates. The unrealistic levels at which exchange rates were pegged led to a strong black market in currency transactions.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, China worked to make the RMB more convertible. Through the use of swap centres, the exchange rate was brought to realistic levels and the dual track currency system was abolished.
As of 2013, the renminbi is convertible on current accounts but not capital accounts. The ultimate goal has been to make the RMB fully convertible. However, partly in response to the Asian financial crisis in 1998, China has been concerned that the mainland Chinese financial system would not be able to handle the potential rapid cross-border movements of hot money, and as a result, as of 2012, the currency trades within a narrow band specified by the Chinese central government.

==Production and minting==

Renminbi currency production is carried out by a state owned corporation, China Banknote Printing and Minting (CBPMC; 中国印钞造币总公司) headquartered in Beijing.China Banknote Printing and Minting CBPMC uses several printing and engraving and minting facilities around the country to produce banknotes and coins for subsequent distribution. Banknote printing facilities are based in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, and Nanchang. Mints are located in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Also, high grade paper for the banknotes is produced at two facilities in Baoding and Kunshan. The Baoding facility is the largest facility in the world
dedicated to developing banknote material according to its website.保定钞票纸厂[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] In addition, the People's Bank of China has its own printing technology research division that researches new techniques forcreating banknotes and making counterfeiting more difficult.

===Current status===

As of 2013, renminbi banknotes are available in denominations from ¥0.1, ¥0.2, ¥0.5 (1, 2, and 5 jiao), ¥1, ¥2, ¥3, ¥5, ¥10, ¥20, ¥50, and ¥100 yuan. These denominations have been avaliable 1955, except for the 50 and 100 yuan notes (added in 1980) and 20 yuan notes (added in or after 1999).  Coins are available in denominations from 1 fen to 1 yuan (¥0.01–1). Thus some denominations exist in both coins and banknotes.
The denomination of each banknote is printed in Chinese. The numbers themselves are printed in financial Chinese numeral characters, as well as Arabic numerals. The denomination and the words "People's Bank of China" are also printed in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang on the back of each banknote, in addition to the boldface Hanyu Pinyin "Zhongguo Renmin Yinhang" (without tones). The right front of the note has a tactile representation of the denomination in Chinese Braille starting from the fourth series. See corresponding section for detailed information.
The fen and jiao denominations have become increasingly unnecessary as prices have increased. Coins under ¥0.1 are used infrequently. Chinese retailers tend to avoid decimal values (such as ¥9.99), opting instead for integer values of yuan (such as ¥9 or ¥10).[tpl]cite news | author = Coldness Kwan | title= Do you get one fen change at Origus? | url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/06/content_821037.htm | publisher= China Daily | date=2007-03-06 | accessdate=2007-03-26 [/tpl]

===Issuance history===

The currency was introduced by the People's Bank of China in December 1948, about a year before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It was issued only in paper money form at first, and replaced the various currencies circulating in the areas controlled by the communists. One of the first tasks of the new government was to end the hyperinflation that had plagued China in the final years of the Kuomintang (KMT) era. That achieved, a revaluation occurred in 1955, at the rate of 1 new yuan = 10,000 old yuan.

====Coins====

In 1955, aluminium 1, 2 and 5 fen coins were introduced. In 1980, brass 1, 2, and 5 jiao and cupro-nickel 1 yuan coins were added, although the 1 and 2 jiao were only produced until 1981, with the last 5 jiao and 1 yuan issued in 1985. In 1991, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of an aluminium 1 jiao, brass 5 jiao and nickel-clad-steel 1 yuan. Issuance of the 1 and 2 fen coins ceased in 1991, with that of the 5 fen halting a year later. The small coins were still made for annual mint sets, and from the beginning of 2005 again for general circulation. New designs of the 1 and 5 jiao and 1 yuan were introduced in between 1999 and 2002. The frequency of usage of coins varies between different parts of China.

====Banknotes====

As of 2013, there have been five series of renminbi banknotes issued by the People's Republic of China:

====Commemorative designs====

In 1999, a commemorative red ¥50 note was issued in honor of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China. This note features Mao Zedong on the front and various animals on the back.
An orange polymer note, and so far, China's only polymer note, commemorating the new millennium was issued in 2000 with a face value of ¥100. This features a dragon on the obverse and the reverse features the China Millennium monument (Center for cultural and scientific fairs).
For the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a green ¥10 note was issued featuring the Bird's Nest on the front with the back showing a classical Olympic discus thrower and various other athletes.

====Suggested future design====

On March 13, 2006, some delegates to an advisory body at the National People's Congress proposed to include Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping on the renminbi banknotes. However, the proposal was not adopted.[tpl]cite news|author= Quentin Sommerville|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4801486.stm|title=China mulls Mao banknote change|publisher=BBC News, Shanghai|date= 2006-03-13|accessdate=2007-03-18[/tpl]

==[tpl]Anchor|Minority[/tpl]Use in minority regions==

The renminbi yuan has different names when used in minority regions. 

==International use==

===International trade===

Before 2009, the Chinese renminbi had little to no exposure in the international markets because of strict government controls by the central Chinese government that prohibited almost all export of the currency, or use of it in international transactions. Transactions between Chinese companies and a foreign entity were generally denominated in US dollars. With Chinese companies unable to hold US dollars and foreign companies unable to hold Chinese yuan, all transactions would go through the People's Bank of China. Once the sum was paid by the foreign party in dollars, the central bank would pass the settlement in renminbi to the Chinese company at the state-controlled exchange rate.
In June 2009 the Chinese officials announced a pilot scheme where business and trade transactions were allowed between limited businesses in Guangdong and Shanghai municipalities and only counterparties in Hong Kong, Macau, and select ASEAN nations. Proving a success,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] the program was further extended to 20 Chinese provinces and counterparties internationally in July 2010, and in September 2011 it was announced that the remaining 11 Chinese provinces would be included.
In steps intended to establish the renminbi as an international reserve currency, China has agreements with Russia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Japan, allowing trade with those countries to be settled directly in renminbi instead of requiring conversion to US dollars, with Australia to follow soon."In China, Tentative Steps Toward a Global Currency" article by David Barboza in The New York Times February 11, 2011[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2012-05/30/c_131620286.htm |title=China, Japan to launch yuan-yen direct trading |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2012-05-30 |work= |publisher=Xinhuanet |accessdate=2012-06-10 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-08/pm-flags-dollar-yuan-currency-deal/4615882 |title=ANZ, Westpac to lead Chinese currency conversion|last1= |first1=|last2= |first2=|date=2013-04-08 |work=|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2013-04-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsl.gov.lk/pics_n_docs/09_lr/_docs/directions/bsd/BSD_2011/bsd_BO_2011_1.pdf |title=Designated Foreign Currencies - Central Bank of Sri Lanka |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2011-10-27 |work= |publisher=Central Bank of Sri Lanka |accessdate=2014-01-24 [/tpl]

Currency restrictions regarding renminbi denominated bank deposits and financial products were greatly liberalized in July, 2010."China revs up renminbi expansion" article by Robert Cookson in The Financial Times July 28, 2010 17:50, accessed 2013-10-07 In 2010 renminbi denominated bonds were reported to have been purchased by Malaysia's central bank"Malaysian bond boost for renminbi" article by Kevin Brown in Singapore, Robert Cookson in Hong Kong and Geoff Dyer in Beijing in The Financial Times September 19, 2010, accessed 2013-10-07 and that McDonald's had issued renminbi denominated corporate bonds through Standard Chartered Bank of Hong Kong."

Nevertheless, some national banks such as Bank of Thailand (BOT) have expressed a serious concern about RMB since BOT cannot substitute the depreciated US Dollars in the 200 billion dollar Foreign Exchange Reserves held by BOT with Renminbi Yuan as much as BOT wishes because:

Countries that are left-leaning in the political spectrum have also begun to use the Renminbi as an alternative reserve currency to the United States dollar; the Chilean central bank reported in 2011 to have US$91 million worth of Renminbi in reserves, and the president of the central bank of Venezuela, Nelson Merentes, made statements in favour of the Renminbi following the announcement of reserve withdrawals from Europe and the United States.Diego Laje, 29 September 2011, China's yuan moving toward global currency?, CNN Business

===Other markets===

Since currency flows in and out of mainland China are still restricted, RMB traded on the Hong Kong market (known as CNH) can have a different value to RMB traded on the mainland. Other RMB markets include the dollar settled non-deliverable forward (NDF) and the trade-settlement exchange rate (CNT).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.research.hsbc.com/midas/Res/RDV?p=pdf&key=UHa14N6Tu3&n=282753.PDF |title=The offshore renminbi| publisher=HSBC |accessdate=14 July 2012 |date=1 December 2010 |last1=Hui |first1=Daniel |last2=Bunning |first2=Dominic[/tpl]

==Value==

For most of its early history, the RMB was pegged to the U.S. dollar at 2.46 yuan per USD (note: during the 1970s, it was appreciated until it reached 1.50 yuan per USD in 1980). When China's economy gradually opened in the 1980s, the RMB was devalued in order to improve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. Thus, the official USD to RMB exchange rate declined from 1.50 yuan in 1980 to 8.62 yuan by 1994 (lowest ever on the record). Improving current account balance during the latter half of the 1990s enabled the Chinese government to maintain a peg of 8.27 yuan per USD from 1997 to 2005.
In December 2013, the yuan opened at a record high rate of 6.0703 to the U.S. dollar.[tpl]cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20131210-701777.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=China Yuan Hits Fresh Record High For Second Session[/tpl] Chinese leadership has been raising the yuan to tame inflation, a step U.S. officials have pushed for years to help repair the massive trade deficit with China.Yahoo Finance, Dollar extends slide on views of low US rates.

===Depegged from the U.S. dollar===

On July 21, 2005, the peg was finally lifted, which saw an immediate one-off RMB revaluation to 8.11 per USD.[tpl]cite web | date=2005-07-21 | url= http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english//detail.asp?col=6400&ID=542 | title= Public Announcement of the People's Bank of China on Reforming the RMB Exchange Rate Regime[/tpl] The exchange rate against the euro stood at 10.07060 yuan per euro.
However the peg was reinstituted unofficially when the financial crisis hit: "Under intense pressure from Washington, China took small steps to allow its currency to strengthen for three years starting in July 2005.

===Managed float===

The RMB is now moved to a managed floating exchange rate based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of foreign currencies. The daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the RMB in the inter-bank foreign exchange market would be allowed to float within a narrow band of 0.3% around the central parity published by the People's Bank of China; in a later announcement published on May 18, 2007, the band was extended to 0.5%.[tpl]cite web | date=2007-05-18 | url= http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english//detail.asp?col=6400&ID=837 | title= Public Announcement of the People's Bank of China on Enlarging the Floating Band of the RMB Trading Prices against the US Dollar in the Inter-bank Spot Foreign Exchange Market[/tpl] On April 14, 2012, the band was extended to 1.0%.[tpl]cite web | date=2012-04-14 | url= http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-04-14/markets/31340930_1_china-economist-yuan-renminbi | title= China to widen daily yuan band vs. dollar to 1%[/tpl] On March 17, 2014, the band was extended to 2%.[tpl]cite news|last=Wang|first=Wynne|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579450152960381232?KEYWORDS=yuan+2+band+march&mg=reno64-wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal[/tpl]  China has stated that the basket is dominated by the United States dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and South Korean won, with a smaller proportion made up of the British pound, Thai baht, Russian ruble, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Singapore dollar.[tpl]cite web | date=2005-08-10 | url= http://www.chinanews.com.cn/news/2005/2005-08-10/26/610367.shtml | title= 央行行长周小川在央行上海总部揭牌仪式上的讲话[/tpl]

The maximum withdrawal is 10,000 USD per day, the maximum purchase limit of USD is 500 per day. This stringent management of the currency leads to a bottled-up demand for exchange in both directions. It is viewed as a major tool to keep the currency peg, preventing inflows of 'hot money'.
A shift of Chinese reserves into the currencies of their other trading partners has caused these nations to shift more of their reserves into dollars, leading to no great change in the value of the Renminbi against the dollar.Frangos, Alex Don’t Worry About China, Japan Will Finance U.S. Debt The Wall Street Journal, September 16, 2010
