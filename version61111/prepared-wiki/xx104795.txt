==History==

The Green Park Stadium is named after Madam Green who used to practice Horse-Riding here in 1940's.
It is located in Civil Lines area in the north east part of Kanpur city near the banks of the river Ganges, which flows just behind the stadium.
This is the only stadium in India where Students Gallery is available. Green Park has the largest manually operated scoreboard in the world[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]. Besides it also has video screens which are used during international matches.
India's first Test win over Australia in December 1959 was at the Green Park ground. It was also the first match to be played on a turf wicket here.http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2008/apr/10biks.htm Off-spinner Jasubhai Patel's 14 wickets were instrumental in ensuring India's win.
In 1958/9 Subhash Gupte took nine West Indian wickets in an inning for 102 runs, and had Lance Gibbs – the only batsman he missed – dropped by wicket keeper Naren Tamhane.
Since 1957 India has lost only twice at Kanpur, to the West Indies on both occasions. When Subhash Gupte’s dream spell was overshadowed by Wes Hall’s 10 wickets in 1958 and later when India’s 1983 world cup euphoria was cut short by Malcolm Marshall’s fearsome bowling.
The most runs scored were by Gundappa Vishwanath(776 runs), Sunil Gavaskar(629 runs) and Mohammed Azharuddin(543 runs). The most wickets taken were by Kapil Dev(25 wickets), Anil Kumble(21 wickets) and Harbhajan Singh(20 wickets). The most runs scored were Sachin Tendulkar(314 runs), Vinod kambli(217 runs) and Sourav Ganguly.(208 runs). The most wickets taken were by Javagal Srinath(9 wickets), Ajit Agarkar(8 wickets) and Sourav Ganguly(7 wickets).
