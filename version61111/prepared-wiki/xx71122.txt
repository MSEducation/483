The Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the mountains of southern Europe and southern temperate Asia across to China. It is a short-distance migrant moving to wet open lowlands such as marshes and flooded fields in winter. Some birds migrate north to Britain for winter, taking advantage of the warm oceanic climate[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl].
Like most other pipits, this is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and dark streaked buff below. It has dark legs, white outer tail feathers and a longish dark bill. In summer it has a distinctive breeding plumage, with a pinkish breast, grey head and pale supercilium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Per Alström & Krister Mild |year=1996 |title=The identification of Rock, Water and Buff-bellied Pipits |journal=Alula |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=161–175[/tpl][tpl]cite conference |author=Per Alström & Krister Mild |year=1987 |title=Some notes on the taxonomy of the Water Pipit complex |conference=Proceedings of the 4th International Identification Meeting |location=Eilat |pages=47–48 |publisher=International Birdwatching Center[/tpl]
The Eurasian Rock Pipit's subspecies littoralis in summer plumage is very close in outward appearance to the Water Pipit however. They can be told apart by their song,[tpl]cite journal |author=V. V. Leonovich, G. V. Deminia & O. D. Veprintseva |year=1997 |title=On the taxonomy and phylogeny of pipits (Genus Anthus, Motacillidae, Aves) in Eurasia |journal=Biulleten Moskovskogo obshchestva ispytatelei prirody.

The Water Pipit is also much less approachable than the Eurasian Rock Pipit, rising high and quickly leaving the vicinity when approached. Water and Buff-bellied Pipit do not co-occur except in a small area in Central Asia.[tpl]cite journal |author=A. A.

This species is insectivorous. Its call is an explosive "fit", like Eurasian Rock Pipit. Its song is similar, but it consisting of maybe 5 "blocks" of just about half a dozen notes each (the Eurasian Rock Pipit has fewer, but longer blocks); it ends either with no or with repeated trills.[tpl]cite journal |author=R.

Formerly included in the Water Pipit were the subspecies now separated as Rock Pipit and Buff-bellied Pipit.[tpl]cite journal |author=George Sangster, Alan G. Knox, Andreas J. Helbig & David T.
