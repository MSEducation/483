Loyalty programs are structured marketing efforts that reward, and therefore encourage, loyal buying behavior – behavior which is potentially beneficial to the firm.Sharp, Byron and Anne Sharp (1997), "Loyalty Programs and Their on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns", International Journal of Research in Marketing, 14 (5), 473-86.
In marketing generally and in retailing more specifically, a loyalty card, rewards card, points card, advantage card, or club card is a plastic or paper card, visually similar to a credit card, debit card, or digital card that identifies the card holder as a member in a loyalty program.[tpl]cite web|title=Glossary L, Loyalty Program|url=http://www.elect-mer.com/glossary-l.html|publisher=Electronic Merchant Systems|accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl] Loyalty cards are a system of the loyalty business model.  In the United Kingdom it is typically called a loyalty card, in Canada a rewards card or a points card, and in the United States either a discount card, a club card or a rewards card.  Cards typically have a barcode or magstripe that can be easily scanned, and some are even chip cards.  Small keyring cards (also known as keytags) which serve as key fobs are often used for convenience in carrying and ease of access.
By presenting the card, the purchaser is typically entitled to either a discount on the current purchase, or an allotment of points that can be used for future purchases. Hence, the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers.  The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. These cards can be used to determine, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing of medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent flyer card).
Loyalty programs can be viewed as a form of centralized virtual currency, one with unidirectional cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a good or service but not  back into cash.

==History==

==By continent and country==

===North America===

====United States====

In the U.S., several major supermarket and fish market chains and the three major pharmacy chains[tpl]cite web|accessdate= 2 September 2011|publisher=Stop and Shop|title=Stop & Shop Card Holders Can Save $10 on Seasonal Immunization|date=10 September 2009|url=http://www.stopandshop.com/about_us/news_media/press_release.htm?p=467c3411-072c-4030-86a6-aae7506d8567[/tpl] require the cards in order for customers to receive the advertised loyalty price.  These include Smith's, Kroger and Safeway (each through both its own name and many of its regional chain names), Menard's, Winn-Dixie, Harris Teeter, Ingles, Giant Eagle, Tops, Price Chopper, ShopRite, A&P and its related chains Pathmark, SuperFresh and Waldbaums, Wegmans,  Stop & Shop and sister chains Giant-Carlisle and Giant-Landover, Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS/pharmacy. Many retailers allow accumulation of fuel discounts.  Some have tie-ins with airline frequent-flyer programs, and some agree to donate a percentage of sales to a designated charity.  Most notably, Wal-Mart does not have a loyalty card plan though anyone who purchases a gift card can generally get a 3 cent discount per gallon of gas at the fuel stations located on Wal-Mart premises.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The practice is also common among book and music retailers, from large chains to independent retailers.  In some instances, the customer purchases the card and receives a percentage discount on all purchases for a period of time (often one year), while in other instances, a customer receives a one-time percentage discount upon reaching a specified purchase level. (For example, a bookseller's loyalty card program might provide a customer with a 10% off coupon once the customer has spent $200 at the bookseller.) Major retailers Best Buy and Sears offer loyalty programs that offer points redeemable for dollar-amount discounts after accumulating a set number of points along with other discounts from time to time.
Independent hardware stores such as Ace Hardware and True Value added customer loyalty programs in order to compete more effectively against larger chains as well as gather customer data.  Ace's program also offers customers a way at the time of purchase to get items at a price which would normally require completing a mail in rebate.  In addition, office supply retailers Staples, Inc. and Office Depot started issuing club cards in 2005, which offer rewards in the form of credits towards future purchases on some or all items purchased in the store or online (which items and how much credit changes periodically).in
Almost all major hotel chains (Best Western, Choice Hotels, Holiday Inn, Marriott, Super 8 Motels, etc.) have cards that allow guests to earn either points (redeemable for discounts, future stays or other prizes) or airline miles (Hilton's HHonors program allows guests to earn both points and miles on the same stay, the only program to date that does so). All major US airlines also offer rewards credit cards. Other travel related reward programs include SeaMiles, with points that can be redeemed for cruises.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
For now, some American retailers have not implemented club cards, including some grocery stores Whole Foods and ALDI.  Between 2007 and 2013, Albertson's, Shaw's, Acme Markets, and Jewel-Osco (all owned by Albertsons LLC) eliminated their loyalty cards in favor of discounts for all shoppers and targeting inventory to particular neighborhoods.[tpl]cite news| url=http://business.time.com/2013/07/11/a-disloyalty-movement-supermarkets-and-customers-drop-loyalty-card-programs/ | work=Time | date=11 July 2013[/tpl]  In a few cases (e.g., Federated Department Stores, Kohl's) this is because the retailer already issues its own credit cards, and thus already has a direct relationship with the consumers most likely to shop at its stores.
Max & Erma's has a loyalty program called Good Neighbor Rewards.  Guests are rewarded based on their number of visits by either 5%, 10%, or 15%.  Additionally, guests are periodically given additional rewards by way of free items added to their loyalty card electronically.
Truck stop chain Pilot Travel Centers' program Driver Payback Points rewards truck drivers for fueling up by giving them points that can be used for purchase inside the store. Although it can be used for general merchandise, the program is specifically targeted to be redeemed at the restaurant chain located inside each location.
A few states regulate club cards. Supermarkets in California are subject to the Supermarket Club Card Disclosure Act of 1999.[tpl]cite web|publisher=FindLaw|title=Supermarket Club Card Disclosure Act of 1999|accessdate=2007-07-25|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/civ/1749.60-1749.66.html[/tpl]
Prominent online loyalty programs include MonaBar, Memolink, Mypoints, FatWallet, Perka, Belly, Vitacost Rewards,Vitacost Rewards Loyalty Program and Swagbucks.http://comparerewards.com/archives/10[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2011/12/14/belly-enters-loyalty-space-with-ipad-based-system/ |title=Belly Targets Paper Punch Card With iPad-Based Loyalty Service |last=Geron |first=Tomio |work=Forbes |date=2011-12-14[/tpl] Some online loyalty programs focus on "other-directed" consumers including Upromise, Schoolpop, The BSP Rewards Network and iGive.com.http://www.animalalliancenyc.org/help/other/igive.htm
Several banks also have rewards programs, including three of the Big Four banks of the United States – Wells Fargo being the lone exception, CapitalOne, and Citizens Financial Group. PNC Financial Services launched a program in 2009 as a direct result of its acquisition of National City Corp., which National City already had, along with a mortgage division – neither of which PNC had had before the deal.
Recently, a lot of attention has been paid[tpl]by whom|date=February 2012[/tpl] to the loyalty programs due to companies like Foursquare, Cardmobili and Shopkick providing new ways for consumers and businesses to communicate. All three companies focus on using smartphones such as the Android and iPhone – Foursquare partnered with AMEX to provide Foursquare points when using an American Express card,Foursquare partners with AMEX and Shopkick partnered with Visa to provide Shopkick points when using a Visa card at locations such as Best Buy, Toys "R" Us or Old Navy.Shopkick and Visa to Offer Retail Store Purchase Rewards

====Canada====

The oldest loyalty program in Canada is Canadian Tire money, in which the Canadian Tire company gives out coupons which look like currency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadaloyalty.com/Programs/canadian_tire_money.html |title=Canadian Tire Money loyalty program |publisher=CanadaLoyalty.com|accessdate=2007-11-23[/tpl] Air Miles is Canada's largest loyalty program – Air Miles[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] can be earned at more than 100 different sponsors and almost a thousand different rewards. Aeroplan began in 1984 as  Air Canada’s frequent flier program, but since 2008 has been owned by Aimia Inc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aimia.com/English/Media-Center/News-Releases/News-Release-Details/2011/Groupe-Aeroplan-Adopts-New-Name-and-Global-Brand-Identity1126807/default.aspx |title=Groupe Aeroplan Adopts New Name and Global Brand Identity |publisher=Aimia.com|accessdate=2013-11-22[/tpl] (previously Groupe Aeroplan Inc.) and operates as a more widely based coalition program.

PetPerks is PetSmart's reward program where members get a pre-determined discount on any item in the store that displays a PetPerks tag under the regular price tag. Vicinity is loyalty platform for small business retailers that was launched in May 2013 by Rogers Communications Inc.Almost every gas station in Canada offers some sort of loyalty program itself or in partnership. For example, Air Miles at Shell gas stations, Esso Extra at Esso, Petro Points at Petro-Canada, Save-On-More at some Chevron locations in BC, Canadian Tire money at Canadian Tire gas stations, or a coupon that grants the customer 3.5 cents off per litre of fuel purchased at Sobeys Fast Fuel locations that can be used at a Sobeys banner store. Loblaws grants a 1.5¢/L coupon similar to Atlantic Superstore, and Real Canadian Superstore that grants a 7¢/L (10.5¢/L in Manitoba) coupon that can be used at their stores. Sunoco has a Performance Points reward program.

===Europe===

====United Kingdom====

The loyalty card market in the UK is one of the most significant in the world, with most major chains operating some form of reward system. Passcard has been claimed to be the first reward scheme or discount card, created around by Gary Wilson in 1981[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] and later known as Passkey.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19890829&id=hBI1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=waULAAAAIBAJ&pg=3396,4676178|title=Reward for Young Scot|date=29 August 1989|publisher=The Glasgow Herald|accessdate=21 February 2010[/tpl] One of the first loyalty cards backed by a major chain is believed to be the Sainsbury's Homebase Spend and Save Card in 1982.http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/jul/26/how-loyal-are-you-to-your-reward-cards
Of the "big four" supermarkets, only Sainsbury's and Tesco operate loyalty cards for general supermarket shopping, and Morrisons offers a scheme based around purchasing fuel from their filling stations. Both Nectar and Tesco's Clubcard scheme have been criticised for not offering value for money.[tpl]Cite news|publisher = The Independent|date=14 August 2005|title=A trip to Alton Towers? That'll be £2,000, please|url=http://money.independent.co.uk/personal_finance/loans_credit/article305643.ece|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London[/tpl]  When Clubcard or Nectar points are used for money off supermarket shopping, they roughly equate to a 1% discount, although offers can increase this discount by as much as 4 times for certain rewards. Some retailers with banking operations also award points for every pound spent on their credit cards, as well as bonus points for purchasing financial services. A report in The Economist suggested that the real benefit of loyalty cards to UK outlets is the massive database potential they offer.[tpl]Cite news|title=How Tesco is changing Britain|publisher=The Economist|date=4 August 2005|accessdate=2007-07-25|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4247169[/tpl]
Morrisons operates "Morrisons Miles", whereby customers earn vouchers based on fuel purchases.  Unusually, customers' personal details are not collected so purchases appear not to be tracked.  Vouchers are delivered at point of sale.
After trials in 1994, Tesco launched its Clubcard program, the UK's first nationwide supermarket-only loyalty card scheme, in 1995 with dunnhumby.  Sainsbury's launched its Reward Card in 1996. This was replaced by the Nectar card in 2002, which was launched in partnership with other major brands.
Boots The Chemist first began planning a loyalty card in November 1993, but building a CRM-focussed loyalty program. With an investment in excess of 30 million GBP, the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is / was the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail loyalty scheme in the UK in terms of cards issued.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Advantage scheme currently has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers.  The scheme gives a cardholder 4 points for every pound spent in a boots store under normal shopping circumstances.  Most stores have kiosks which can be used in conjunction with the cards for "exclusive offers" which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till.  These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on the voucher, or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products.  For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent £50 in one transaction.  Points equal pence in store, and can be spent at any time and on anything in store, providing the card has enough points to cover the entire cost of the merchandise.
The patronage dividend rewarded the loyalty of the owner members of Britain's retail consumer co-operatives since the Rochdale Pioneers of the 1840s.  Paper record-keeping transformed in the 1960s into a trading stamp scheme managed by the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), which was gradually withdrawn as margins declined.  The loyalty card concept was used by some co-operatives to restore dividend payments at the turn of the 21st century, notably by the CWS's "Dividend" card, which was replaced by The Co-operative Membership card program, adopted by several larger co-operatives.
Safeway's ABC Card was discontinued in 2000.[tpl]Cite news|title=Safeway scraps loyalty card|date=5 May 2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-07-25|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/735835.stm[/tpl] Airlines, Hotels and other loyalty schemes also offer cards. Marks and Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership have credit cards which give vouchers in return for spending, and do not issue separate loyalty cards. GAME has a reward card scheme for which every pound spent a customer is rewarded 10 points; for every 1000 points that one collects, one gets £2.50 to redeem in the store, or online. Preorders earn a customer 20 points per pound. HMV has a reward card called purehmv which allows the customer to claim a variety of rewards, including in-store discounts.
The UK's largest retail bookmaker Ladbrokes launched the Odds ON! loyalty programme in late 2007, the first retail betting loyalty scheme in Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] Customers earn points on each bet which can be redeemed for bonus jokers and free bets.

The opening of the first Best Buy store in the UK — at Thurrock, Essex, in 2010 - was accompanied by the launch of a customer engagement program called My Best Buy. This was described as "a tiered, digital loyalty and customer engagement program that is designed to build a lifelong relationship with the customer by providing a personalized experience through which they can manage their digital and technology needs." However, this business ceased trading in 2012: the 11 stores were closed in January, and My Best Buy closed on February 29.
The Ice Organisation launched MyIce.com in 2010, a scheme which rewards consumers for shopping in a more sustainable way.  Ice's mission is ultimately to promote greener goods and services to mitigate climate change, and currently works with both national and local retailers to encourage more local, sustainable consumerism.

====Republic of Ireland====

In the Republic of Ireland loyalty cards have been in operation since 1993, when Superquinn introduced its SuperClub loyalty card scheme. This is regarded as having been the prototype for such schemes in Europe. However, loyalty cards did not expand until 1997, when Tesco Ireland introduced its Clubcard scheme, shortly after its purchase of Power Supermarkets. This was essentially a simple expansion of the UK scheme (see above) – cards for this are physically identical to those used by Tesco in the UK and they can be used in both countries. Dunnes Stores responded with the introduction of their own ValueClub scheme in June 1997. Today these are three main schemes operating in Ireland, although ValueClub has been withdrawn from Dunnes' Northern Ireland stores.
All five major petrol station chains in the country operated a scheme during the late 1990s – Esso had "Tiger Miles" (with Tesco ClubCard points offered as an alternative), Maxol had "Points Plus", both of which operated on the principle of getting items from a gift catalogue, with Shell using Dunnes' scheme, Texaco using the SuperQuinn system, and Statoil operating a cash-back system, "Premium Club". Due to increasing oil prices and tightening of margins, all of these schemes ended by the end of 2005. Tesco Ireland's petrol stations still, however, give Clubcard points.
GAME, a major computer game and hardware retailer also operate a cashback card scheme, which was merged with Electronics Boutique's programme following the separation of their northern European stores into the hands of GAME. The scheme returns one-fortieth of the spend, more than twice as generous as Tesco.

==Program management==

Across the globe loyalty programs are increasingly finding the need to outsource strategic and operational aspects of their programs, given the size and complexity a loyalty program entails. Program managers are typically agencies with specialist skilled in loyalty consulting, creativity, communication, data analytics, loyalty software, and back end operations.  The advent of Web 2.0 and SaaS online-based services has provided lower-cost options for small businesses to offer and manage their own loyalty programs. Moreover, there are many free and open source alternatives to manage user awards and incentives.
Loyalty cards are becoming mobile (i.e. Cardmobili, Loopt, and Nokadi).[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/technology/01loopt.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Cellphone in New Role: Loyalty Card | date=2010-05-31[/tpl]

==On-line and mobile loyalty programs==

Recently there has been a move away from traditional magnetic card, stamp or punchcard based schemes to online and mobile loyalty programs. While these schemes vary, the common element is a push toward eradication of a traditional card, in favour of an electronic equivalent. The choice of medium is often a QR code. Some prominent examples are Austrian based mobile-pocket est 2009,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.mobile-pocket.com[/tpl] the US-based Punchd (discontinued from June 2013[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/google-kills-punchd-mobile-loyalty-card-app/2012-12-17|date=2012-12-17|title=Google Kills Punchd Mobile Loyalty Card App[/tpl]), which became part of Google in 2011.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://venturebeat.com/2011/07/12/googles-punchd-acquisition-to-push-mobile-wallet-uptake|date=2011-07-12|title=Google’s Punchd acquisition to push mobile wallet uptake[/tpl] and also an Australian-based loyalty card application called Stamp Me[tpl]Cite news| url=http://qsrmedia.com.au/marketingadvertising/more-news/stamp-me-app-replaces-loyalty-cards|date=2012-11-26|title=Stamp Me app replaces loyalty cards[/tpl]  Others, like Perka (US), Loyalli (UK) and Maze (Aus) have offered similar programs.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/apr/12/10-best-money-saving-apps|date=2013-04-12|title=10 Best Money Saving Apps | location=London|work=The Guardian|first1=Patrick|last1=Collinson|first2=Emma|last2=Lunn[/tpl] Passbook by Apple is the first attempt to standardize the format of mobile loyalty cards.

==Disloyalty cards==

In three cities, some independent coffee shops have set up experimental 'disloyalty card' programs, which reward customers for visiting a variety of coffee shops.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.metro.us/boston/local/article/1051303--local-coffee-shops-start-disloyalty-card-campaign|title=Local coffee shops start "Disloyalty Card" campaign|author=Steve Annear|date=15 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/living/food/article/794054--disloyalty-has-its-privileges|title=Disloyalty has its privileges|author=Jennifer Bain|date=12 April 2010|location=Toronto|work=The Star[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Companies complain that these loyalty programs discount goods to people that are buying their goods anyway, and that the expense of doing these programs rarely show a good return on the investment. Other critics see the lower prices and rewards as bribes to manipulate customer loyalty and purchasing decisions, or in the case of infrequent-spenders, a means of subsidizing frequent-spenders. Commercial use of the personal data collected as part of the programmes has the potential for abuse. It is highly likely that consumer purchases are tracked and analyzed towards more efficient marketing and advertising; in fact, this can be one of the purposes of the loyalty card. To some, participating in a loyalty program (even with a fake or anonymous card) funds activities that violate privacy.[tpl]cite web| last=Albrecht | first=Katherine | publisher=Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion And Numbering | url=http://www.nocards.org/essays/nofakes.shtml | title=Why getting a shopper card under a fake name is not the answer | accessdate=2007-11-23 [/tpl] There has also been concern expressed regarding RFID technology being introduced to loyalty cards.[tpl]cite web| last=Blau | first=John | work=InfoWorld | url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/03/01/HNmetrostore_1.html | title=Metro Store bows to pressure from anti-RFID activists | date=2004-03-01 | accessdate=2007-11-23 [/tpl]
Loyalty and credit-card reward plans may be viewable as modern-day examples of a kickback. An employee who needs to buy something (such as a hotel room or an airline flight) for a business trip, but who has discretion to decide which airline or hotel chain to use, has an incentive to choose the payment method that provides the most credit card rewards or loyalty points, instead of minimizing cost for the organization.
Maximiles United Kingdom have been branded as one of the most hated companies in the Loyalty Scheme industry.
After taking over ipoints in the United Kingdom, customer service has been heavily criticised by users and former users whom, after contacting maximiles UK that they have not received their payments, have their accounts deleted, making unfair financial advantage for maximiles and distress for the victim. Some users are calling maximiles "a scam".
Users of Maximiles United Kingdom have also complained that their personal information have been unlawfully sold onto and then abused by third parties.  Again, maximiles have closed the accounts of users who complained even though they can prove that maximiles are responsible.
