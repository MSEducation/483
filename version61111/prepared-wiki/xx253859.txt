==Lyrics==

''
This simple tune is often used in old-time music circles to teach young folks how to play the fiddle, banjo, mountain dulcimer and/or guitar. The following is the basic tune with the lyrics of the chorus. These tabs assumes you have a diatonically fretted instrument tuned to one of the 1-5-8 open tunings like G-D-G or D-A-D such as you might find on a mountain dulcimer or a stick dulcimer.
Here's the same tune tabbed for a chromatically fretted instrument like a tenor guitar (or banjo) tuned GDgd (or other 1-5-8-12 tuning).
The tablature below is for violin (or viola), using the 2-3 finger pattern most students learn first. Only 2nd and 3rd fingers are close together. The numbers followed by a dash are held twice as long as the rest of the notes. It may be played on any string, though it is usually done on the D string.
There are many different verses to this song, and only a few popular ones are listed here:
