===2010 NFL Draft===

Leading up to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine, Trindon Holliday had hoped to set the record for the 40 yard dash,[tpl]cite web|author=Jason Feller |url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2010/02/25/lsus-holliday-has-big-plans-for-the-40/ |title=LSU’s Holliday has big plans for the 40 |publisher=NFL.com |date= 2010-02-25[/tpl] a feat that would have him eclipse Chris Johnson's record mark of 4.24. Furthermore, in training for the event Holliday had self-reported running times as fast as 4.21, which coupled with his extensive track background having already run the fastest 100m dash time of any football player in NCAA history,http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=233482>http://pathtothedraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/052808dodd-holliday.jpg had many anticipating him achieving said feat. At the combine, reports of Holliday's 40 yard dash time ranged from between 4.18 seconds and 4.34 seconds. Adam Schefter, an ESPN reporter on hand at the event, had reported on Twitter that NFL scouts had clocked Holliday in as low as 4.21 during the workout.https://www.twitter.com/#!/AdamSchefter/status/9730725229 However, the NFL Network broadcast team record Holliday's two tries at unofficial times of 4.27 and 4.32,[tpl]cite web|author=Frank Tadych |url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2010/02/27/holliday-misses-4-23-in-40-but-hes-still-plenty-fast/ |title=Holliday misses 4.23 in 40, but he’s still plenty fast |publisher=NFL.com |date= 2010-02-27[/tpl] respectively, and pending processing the NFL combine would report Holliday's official 40 yard dash time coming in at 4.34 seconds.[tpl]cite web|author=Jason Feller |url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2010/02/27/holliday-officially-clocked-at-434-campbell-485/ |title=Holliday officially clocked at 4.34, Campbell 4.85 |publisher=NFL.com |date= 2010-02-27[/tpl]

===Houston Texans===

Holliday was drafted in the 6th round of the 2010 draft. Despite his speed, Holliday struggled on kickoff returns in the preseason. He was placed on IR because of a fracture in his thumb. September 3, 2011 he was cut then placed on the practice squad. On October 5, his practice squad contract was terminated. He was later added to the active roster, but was waived on October 25. In the 2012 preseason week 1 match up versus the Carolina Panthers, he returned a kickoff return for a touchdown. The next week versus the San Francisco 49ers, he returned a punt for a touchdown. In the final preseason game versus the Minnesota Vikings, Holliday recorded his third touchdown in four games; this touchdown was a 76-yard punt return. Following the 2012 preseason, Holliday made the Houston Texans 53-man roster and was the starting punt and kick returner. Holliday was waived from the Texans on October 10, 2012 in a move to bolster an injury-depleted defense. Part of the reason Holliday was released was due to his fumbling problems. Trindon fumbled the ball 6 times in 2012, losing only one of them.http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/13386/year/2012/trindon-holliday

==Issues with size==

At 65 inches (165 cm), Holliday is the shortest player in the NFL, and Holliday had a difficult time getting started in football. His mother held him out of football until 7th grade, because she was afraid he would be injured. After several years of performing at a high level, his high school coaches finally let him start as a running back during his junior year. In his senior year he accumulated over 2,000 yards and over 30 touchdowns, leading Northeast High to back-to-back State Semi-Final appearances.
Fearing that college recruiters would not believe Holliday's actual running times, his high school coaches added to his recorded times before sending them in. Despite his speed records, several schools, including Duke and Louisiana-Lafayette, rejected Holliday due to his small size.
Holliday was never scheduled to appear at LSU's camp. LSU was interested in another Northeast player, (WR Aaron Brown) but that player didn't want to go to the camp alone. So David Masterson, Holliday's high school coach, took Holliday along also. After initial workouts, Holliday ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds wearing high top basketball shoes. The time was so outrageous that the LSU coaches began arguing if they had started their stopwatches on time. "They asked me if Trindon could run it again," Masterson said. "He didn't even get in a track stance. He ran the second 40 in 4.27. He's one of those little freaks of nature." Despite this, LSU coach Les Miles still considered canceling Holliday's scholarship offer until holdover offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher convinced Miles that Holliday could play at a college level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3048728 |title=Speedy Holliday provides LSU offense with another weapon |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14[/tpl]
