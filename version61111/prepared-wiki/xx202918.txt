==History==

Bocşa was first mentioned in documents in 1349 under the name Villa Baxa. In 1854, its name became Olah-Baksa or Bocşa Română. Borla was first mentioned in 1341, Câmpia in 1427 and Sălăjeni 1430.
After the conquest of the region by the Habsburgs, the inhabitants of Bocşa became, in majority, Greek Catholic. Communist government imposed a return to the Orthodox faith and a brick church replaced the ancient wooden church. At the end of the 1930s, the wooden church was transported to the Village Museum in Bucharest.
One famous Bocşa native is the great scholar Simion Bărnuţiu, a historical figure and hero who fought for popular sovereignty in the 19th century. He was one of the leaders of the Transylvanian revolution in 1848–49. Simion Bărnuţiu contributed to the development of the philosophic, politic and legal way of thinking of his people. He had lectures for pupils and students and some of his main works are still timely.
The settlements from Neolithic, Dacian state and the early Feudal period were found at the archeological site of Pietriş.
In the western part of Bocșa, toward Lompirt, on the Zalău River Valley, was found a prehistoric settlement and a pre-Feudal one.

==Villages==

===Borla===

The first written source about the village dates back to 1341 and refers to it under the name of Barla. Allegedly Barla is an allusion to ‘barlang’ (i.e. cave), where inhabitants used to retreat from waves of Tatar invasions. Excavations, however, revealed that the area was populated already in the Bronze Era, and some artifacts are even dated back to the Neolithic Era. The Szilágy-prefix was assigned when the train station was built in 1913, referring to the county.
Around 1450 the village was the property of the Bishop of Várad (Oradea), who participated on the side of Hunyadi in the battle of Belgrade, and fell hostage to the Turks. Afterwards the village was owned mostly by the Bánffy family until the early 20th century.
Borla is inhabited mainly by Reformed ethnic Hungarians, although Baptists and Romanian Orthodox are present, as well as Roma and a few ethnic Romanians.
Local education has its roots in church-owned educational institutions, with written records as of 1852. The present school was built in 1970, mainly by local effort. The old school building is used as nursery school. Classes are held mainly in Hungarian, except for the Roma community, for which one aggregate class of the first elementary grades is maintained in Romanian. Afterwards pupils travel to the school in neighboring Bocşa.
Viticulture is the traditional occupation, with the soil allegedly more acidic than in other parts of the county (Sărmăşag and Şamşud), which produces a more mature and full tasting wine than its local competitors.
