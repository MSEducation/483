The album features two top 10 singles including the number one single 'Money For Nothing'.

==History==

After having taken second place on Idol in 2004, Darin started recording his first studio album, working with producers such as RedOne, Ghost and Jörgen Elofsson. The album consists of 12 tracks, 10 new tracks, 1 bonus track and 1 reproduced tracks from Darin's debut independent album Darin Zanyar. The track What You're Made Of was recorded as a demo for Darin's previous album and written by Darin himself, it was known as What Ya Made Of. The bonus track on the album Coming True, a song written and produced by Jörgen Elofsson, was recorded by Darin and fellow Idol contestant Daniel Lindström and would serve as the single for the eventual winner. Since Lindström won the contest, Darin's version was added as a bonus track.
