Jacques Vergès (5 March 1925 – 15 August 2013) was a lawyer who earned fame continually from the 1950s, first as an anticolonialist communist figure and then for defending a long string of well-known clients, from an anticolonialist Algerian militant, Djamila Bouhired (his future wife) in 1957–1962 to former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan in 2008. His clients included both leftwing and rightwing terrorists, war criminals, and militants, including Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy, Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie (1987), and international terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez a.k.a. Carlos the Jackal (1994). In 2002, Vergès offered to represent former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, although Milošević declined any legal advice from any party. The media sensationalized Vergès's activities with the sobriquet "the Devil's advocate",The sobriquet The Devil's advocate was used by the European press to describe not only Jacques Vergès but also Giovanni Di Stefano. and he himself contributed to his "notorious" public persona by such acts as titling his autobiography The Brilliant BastardThe French epithet has sometimes been translated as "luminous bastard" and giving provocative replies in interviews. He claimed that when asked if he would have defended Hitler, he replied, "I'd even defend Bush! But only if he agrees to plead guilty."[ref]Event occurs at 01:58:42 - 
I can't stand a man being humiliated, even an enemy. For a lone man to be insulted by a lynch mob. I was asked: "Would you defend Hitler?" "I said I'd even defend Bush!

==Biography==

Born in Ubon Ratchathani, Siam, and brought up on the island of Réunion,[tpl]cite news |date= 29 March 2004|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3578421.stm|title = Jacques Vergès: 'The Devil's advocate'|publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 12 April 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl] Jacques Vergès was a son of Raymond Vergès, a French diplomat, and a Vietnamese mother. In 1942, with his father's encouragement, he sailed to Liverpool to become part of the Free French Forces under Charles de Gaulle, and to participate in the anti-Nazi resistance.[ref]Event occurs at 00:04:04 - 
"For France to disappear was intolerable to me. That's why I enlisted."[/ref] In 1945 he joined the French Communist Party. After the war he went to the University of Paris to study law (while his twin brother Paul Vergès went on to become the leader of the Reunionese Communist Party and a member of the European Parliament).[tpl]cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/inOut/viewOutgoing.do;jsessionid=12CB1C8C8232CDE7721859CCBCB0ED23.node1?id=1490&language=EN|title = MEP profile|publisher = European Union| accessdate = 13 April 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl] In 1949 Jacques became president of the AEC (Association for Colonial Students), where he met and befriended Pol Pot.[tpl]cite news |date=21 October 2007|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/magazine/21wwln-lede-t.html?_r=2&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/V/Verg&oref=slogin&oref=slogin#232;s,%20Jacques|title = Speak No ‘Evil’|publisher = New York Times| accessdate = 12 April 2008 | last=DAPHNE MERKIN |quote=[/tpl] In 1950, at the request of his Communist mentors, he went to Prague to lead a youth organization for four years.[tpl]cite web |year=2008|url = http://european-films.net/content/view/966/118/|title = review: L'avocat de la terreur (Terror's Advocate) (Rotterdam 2008)|publisher = european-films.net| accessdate = 13 April 2008 | last= Boyd van Hoeij|quote=Not mentioned either are his controversial defence of Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy and his formative work in Prague in the 1950s – in the middle of the Cold War, though possible connections with secret services and many underground organisations in countries ranging from Germany to Israel and Algeria are hinted at and explored.[/tpl]

===Algerian independence movement===

[tpl]Further|Jeanson network[tpl]![/tpl]Suitcase carriers[/tpl]
After returning to France, Vergès became a lawyer and quickly gained fame for his willingness to take controversial cases. During the struggle in Algiers he defended many accused of terrorism by the French government. He was a supporter of the Algerian armed independence struggle against France, comparing it to French armed resistance to the Nazi German occupation in the 1940s.
Vergès became a nationally-known figure following his defence of the anti-French Algerian guerrilla Djamila Bouhired on terrorism charges: she was convicted of blowing up a café and killing eleven people inside it.  This is where he pioneered the rupture strategy, in which he accused the prosecution of the same offenses as the defendants.[tpl]cite web |date=2 November 2008|url = http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/107/article_2030.asp |title = The Jackal's defender has his own one-man show |publisher = Radio France Internationale| accessdate = 9 November 2008 | last=MARCO CHOWN OVED |quote=[/tpl] She was sentenced to death but pardoned and freed following public pressure brought on by Vergès' efforts. After some years she married Vergès, who had by then converted to Islam. They had two children, Meriem and Liess Vergès, later followed by a granddaughter, Fatima Nur Vergès-Habboub, daughter of Meriem and her husband Fouad.[tpl]cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.alshindagah.com/novdec03/womanofdistinction.htm|title = Women of Distinction: Djamila Bouhired The Symbol of National Liberation|publisher = pub| accessdate = 12 April 2008 | last=Ma'n Abul Husn |quote=[/tpl]  In an effort to limit Vergès' success at defending Algerian clients, he was sentenced to two months in jail in 1960 and temporarily lost his licence to officially practice law for anti-state activities.[tpl]cite web |date=14 April 2004|url = http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20040414.americawar.radu.circusverges.html|title = Saddam Circus Is Coming to Town: the Strange Story of Jacques Vergès|publisher = Foreign Policy Research Institute| accessdate = 14 August 2008 | last=Michael Radu |quote=At a time when France was at war, Vergès openly supported and defended terrorists and their French accomplices— that is, traitors.

===Missing years===

From 1970 to 1978, Vergès disappeared from public view without explanation. He refused to comment about those years, remarking in an interview with Der Spiegel that "It's highly amusing that no one, in our modern police state, can figure out where I was for almost ten years."http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,591943-2,00.html Vergès was last seen on 24 February 1970. He left his wife, Djamila, and cut off all his ties, leaving friends and family to wonder if he had been killed.[ref]Event occurs at 00:50:29 - 
"He was last seen on 24 February 1970, at an anti-colonial rally in Paris. He made a speech and vanished. After three months, Djamila Bouhired and his friends, were sure he was dead."[/ref] His whereabouts during these years have remained a mystery. Many of his close associates of the time assume that he was in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, a rumour Pol Pot (Brother #1) and Ieng Sary (Brother #2)[ref]Event occurs at 00:52:56 - 
"The Brilliant Bastard In that book are two passages I remember. It says ... that Jacques Vergès could have been in Cambodia. I remember that Pol Pot wrote in the margin: No."[/ref] both denied. There have also been claims that Vergès was spotted in Paris as well as in Arab countries in the company of Palestinian militant groups.[ref]Event occurs at 00:55:44 - 
"It was in May 1973, ... several politicians ... were meeting at Arafat's HQ. ... Arafat suddenly looked at Hassan Salameh PLO security chief and asked: "Who is this Vergès? What is he?" Abou Hassan Salameh answered literally: "He's an important lawyer who defends the Palestinian cause." Arafat smiled and said: "Keep working with him." My codename was "Pascal". And Vergès? "Mansour"."[/ref]

===Defence===

After Vergès's return to normal life he resumed his legal practice, defending Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, convicted of terrorism, and Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie. The thrust of his defence in the latter case was that Barbie was being singled out for prosecution while the French state conveniently ignored other cases that qualified as crimes against humanity.
In 1999 Vergès sued Amnesty International on behalf of the government of Togo.[tpl]cite news |date= 20 May 1999 Published at 11:56 GMT 12:56 UK|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/348602.stm|title = Togo to sue Amnesty International|publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 12 April 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl]   In 2001, on behalf of Idriss Déby, president of Chad, Omar Bongo, president of Gabon, and Denis Sassou-Nguesso, head of the Republic of the Congo, he sued François-Xavier Verschave for his book Noir silence denouncing the crimes of the Françafrique on the charges of "offense toward a foreign state leader".[tpl]cite news |date= 25 April 2001|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1295740.stm|title = French author wins Africa book case|publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 12 April 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl] The attorney general observed how this crime recalled the lese majesty crime; the court thus deemed it contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, thus leading to Verschave's acquittal.
After the US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 and deposed Saddam Hussein, many former leaders in Saddam's regime were arrested. In May 2008, Tariq Aziz assembled a team that included Vergès as well as a French-Lebanese and four Italian lawyers.[tpl]cite news |date=09:33 GMT, Tuesday, 20 May 2008 10:33 UK|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7409933.stm|title = Tariq Aziz trial resumes in Iraq|publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 20 May 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl] In late 2003, Vergès also offered to defend Saddam if he was asked to.

In April 2008, former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan made his first appearance at Cambodia's genocide tribunal. Vergès represented him, using the defence that, while Samphan has never denied that many people in Cambodia were killed, as head of state he was never directly responsible.[tpl]cite news |date=07:33 GMT, Wednesday, 23 April 2008 08:33 UK|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7362248.stm|title = Khmer Rouge leader seeks release|publisher = BBC News| accessdate = 23 April 2008 | last= |quote=[/tpl]
