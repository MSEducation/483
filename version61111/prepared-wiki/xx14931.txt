[[Faery Wicca]]

CATEGORIES: Wiccan traditions

Faery Wicca, or Fairy Wicca is an umbrella term that refers to any tradition of modern Wicca that places an emphasis on the Fey (gnomes, elves, faeries, sprites, etc.), their lore, and their relation to the natural world. 
"Faery Wicca" may also refer to a specific tradition of Wicca, recently founded by author Kisma Stepanich. Adherents of Stepanich's Faery Wicca claim that it recovers the traditions of the Tuatha De Danaan, the mythological precursors to the Celtic people;Stepanich, Kisma K., The Irish American Faery-Faith Tradition  however, this is disputed by those familiar with ancient Celtic polytheism and mythology.Hautin-Mayer, Joanna. When is a Celt not a Celt: An Irreverent peek into Neopagan views of history Stepanich's Faery Wicca draws liberally on some degree of Irish mythology, from the author's interpretation of Celtic history, legend, pseudohistory, imagination, and a variety of non-Celtic sources. 
Faery Wicca is not related to the late Victor Anderson's Feri Tradition of witchcraft, which is sometimes also spelled Faery or Fairy, nor is it directly related to the gay men's group, the Radical Faeries.  Though Faery Wicca may draw inspiration from some of the customs practiced among the ancient and modern Celts, it shares more with other modern Wiccan and Neo-Wiccan traditions than with the "Fairy Faith" as it is known in traditional Gaelic cultures.
