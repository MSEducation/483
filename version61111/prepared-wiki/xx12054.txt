==History==

Welsh emerged in the 6th century from Common Brittonic, the common ancestor of Welsh, Breton, Cornish and the extinct language known as Cumbric.
Four periods are identified in the history of Welsh, with rather indistinct boundaries: The period immediately following the language's emergence from Brittonic is sometimes referred to as Primitive Welsh;[tpl]cite book |last= Koch|first= John T.|coauthors=  |title= Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia| publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2006|page=1757 |isbn=[/tpl] this was followed by the Old Welsh period, considered to stretch from the beginning of the 9th century to the 12th century. The Middle Welsh period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when the Modern Welsh period began, which in turn divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.
The name Welsh originated as an exonym given to its speakers by the Anglo-Saxons, meaning "foreign speech" (see Walha). The native term for the language is Cymraeg and Cymru for "Wales".

==Distribution of Welsh speakers==

Welsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history but by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5% of the population.[ref]
