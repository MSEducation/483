Sir Walter Noel Hartley F.R.S., D. Sc (1845-11 September 1913) was a chemist and Fellow of the Royal Society.  He was a pioneer of spectroscopy, and the first person to establish a relationship between the wavelengths of spectral lines of the elements and their positions in the periodic table[tpl]Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = UCD Merrion Street | url = http://www.ucd.ie/merrionstreet/1910_hartley.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 14 August 2013 [/tpl] (published in 1883), and he studied also the relationship between the structure and spectra of a wide variety of organic compounds.  In 1881, he hypothesized the presence of ozone in the atmosphere.[tpl]cite book|author=David Beerling|title=The Emerald Planet:How plants changed Earth's history|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=01EnRok7qtoC&pg=PA64|accessdate=13 August 2013|date=22 February 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-158017-8|pages=64–[/tpl] His work led to his election to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1884, and he was awarded a doctorate (D.Sc.) by the Royal University of Ireland in October 1901.[tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=26 October 1901 |page_number=7 |issue=36596| [/tpl] He was knighted in 1911.
