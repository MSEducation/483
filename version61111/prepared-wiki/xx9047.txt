[[Native Esperanto speakers]]

Native Esperanto speakers (in Esperanto denaskuloj or denaskaj esperantistoj) are people who have acquired Esperanto as one of their native languages.  As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of native Esperanto speakers, though estimates from associations indicate that there are currently around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children.Corsetti, Pinto, & Tolomeo (2004) "Regularizing the regular: The phenomenon of overregularization in Esperanto-speaking children", Language Problems and Language Planning, 28:261–282  In all known cases, speakers are natively bilingual, raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.Benjamin Bergen (2001), "Nativization processes in L1 Esperanto", Journal of Child Language 28:575–595 doi:10.1017/S0305000901004779
Raising children in Esperanto occurred early in the history of the language, notably with the five children of Montagu Butler (1884–1970).  Because of this, some families have passed Esperanto on to their children for several generations.For example, the Klünder family (interview with a second-generation native Esperanto-speaker, Esperanto Language Blog, 2013 Jun 13)  The most famous native speaker of Esperanto is businessman George Soros, son of Tivadar Soros, publisher and writer in Esperanto.[tpl]Cite news|title=How Do You Say 'Billionaire' in Esperanto?|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/how-do-you-say-billionaire-in-esperanto/|date=December 16, 2010|first=Alison Leigh|last=Cowan|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 27, 2011[/tpl] Also notable are young Holocaust victim Petr Ginz,Ginz, Petr.

Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region, outside of temporary gatherings (such as conventions like the World Congress of Esperanto) and isolated offices (such as the World Esperanto Association's central office in Rotterdam). Consequently, native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged.  For this reason, some parents consider it important to bring their children regularly to Esperanto conventions. Similarly, the annual [tpl]ill2|Children's Congress of Esperanto|eo|Internacia Infana Kongreseto[/tpl] happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention, the World Congress of Esperanto (Universala Kongreso).

==List of native speakers==

Below is a list of noted native Esperanto speakers.

==Grammatical characteristics==

The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents.  In some cases this is due to interference from their other native language (the adstrate), but in others it appears to be an effect of acquisition. 
Bergen (2001) found the following patterns in a study of eight native-speaking children, aged 6 to 14, who were bilingual in Hebrew (two siblings), Slovak (two siblings), French, Swiss German, Russian, and Croatian.
Among children that do use the accusative, its usage may be regularized from adult usage, at least at young ages. For example, when a screw dropped out of a lock, a young (≤ 5-year-old) child said it malvenis la pordo'n'. Besides the novel use of mal- with veni 'to come' to mean 'come away from', the accusative is not used in adult speech for motion away, but only motion towards.  However, in this case the child generalized the usage of the accusative for direct objects.

==Word derivation==

Native-speaking children, especially at a young age, may coin words that do not exist in the speech of their parents, often for concepts for which Esperanto has a word they do not yet know, by exploiting the morphology of the language.  This is analogous to what adult speakers do for concepts where Esperanto lacks a word, and indicates that some of the grammatical alterations that adult learners may find difficult come easily to native-speaking children.  For example,Corsetti, Pinto, & Tolomeo (2004) "Regularizing the regular The phenomenon of overregularization in Esperanto-speaking children", Language Problems & Language Planning, 28:3, pp. 261–282
