Lega Nord (North League, LN, Lega, often referred to as Northern League by English-language media), whose complete name is Lega Nord per l'Indipendenza della Padania (North League for the Independence of Padania), is a federalist and regionalist political party in Italy. It was founded by Umberto Bossi in 1991 as a federation of several regional parties of northern and central Italy, most of which had arisen and expanded their share of the electorate over the 1980s.
The founding parties of Lega Nord were Lega Lombarda, Liga Veneta, Piemont Autonomista, Uniun Ligure, Lega Emiliano-Romagnola, Alleanza Toscana, plus the newly formed regional parties of the other northern regions.
In popular usage the party is generally referred to simply as Lega and is frequently nicknamed il Carroccio in newspapers, after a four-wheeled war altar drawn by oxen, used by the medieval republics of northern Italy which formed the Lombard League in opposition to the imperialist design of Frederick I Barbarossa.
Lega Nord's political programme advocates the transformation of Italy into a federal state, fiscal federalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for the northern regions. At times it has advocated secession of the North, which it calls Padania. Prior to the party's adoption of the term, Padania was infrequently used to name the Padanian-Venetian Plain and was promoted since 1963 by sports journalist Gianni Brera as a modern name for Cisalpine Gaul.
The long-standing leader of the party has been Umberto Bossi, who was Minister for Federal Reform in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. From 2012 to 2013, the party secretary was Roberto Maroni, President of Lombardy and former Minister of the Interior, then in December 2013 Matteo Salvini became the new secretary after defeating Umberto Bossi in the leadership election. Leading members include Luca Zaia (President of Veneto), Roberto Cota (President of Piedmont), Flavio Tosi, Roberto Calderoli, Roberto Castelli, Francesco Speroni, Giancarlo Giorgetti, Massimo Bitonci, Lorenzo Fontana and Attilio Fontana.
At the 2010 regional elections Lega Nord was the largest party in Veneto, the second largest in Lombardy, the third largest in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria.

==History==

===Precursors and foundation===

At the 1983 general election Liga Veneta, based in Veneto, elected a deputy, Achille Tramarin, and a senator, Graziano Girardi. At the 1987 general election another regional party, Lega Lombarda, based in Lombardy, gained national prominence when its leader Umberto Bossi was elected to the Senate. The two parties, along with other regionalist outfits, ran as Alleanza Nord in the 1989 European Parliament election, gaining 1.8% of the vote.
Lega Nord, which was first launched as an upgrade of Alleanza Nord in December 1989, was officially transformed into a party in February 1991 through the merger of various regional parties, notably including Lega Lombarda and Liga Veneta. These continue to exist as "national sections" of the federal party, which presents itself in regional and local contests as "Lega Lombarda–Lega Nord", "Liga Veneta–Lega Nord", "Lega Nord–Piemont", and so on.[tpl]cite book |first1=Pietro |last1=Ignazi |title=Partiti politici in Italia |year=2008 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |page=88[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Ginsborg|title=L'Italia del tempo presente |year=1996 |publisher=Einaudi |location=Turin |pages=336–337, 534–535[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Giorgio |last1=Galli |title=I partiti politici italiani |year=2001 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=379–380, 384[/tpl]
The League exploited resentment against Rome (with the famous slogan Roma ladrona, which loosely means "Rome big thief") and the Italian government, common in northern Italy as many northerners felt that the government wasted resources collected mostly from northerners' taxes.[tpl]cite book |first1=Paolo |last1=Rumiz |title=La secessione leggera. Dove nasce la rabbia del profondo Nord |year=2001 |publisher=Feltrinelli |location=Milan |pages=10–13[/tpl] Cultural influences from bordering countries in the North and resentment against illegal immigrants were also exploited. The party's electoral successes began roughly at a time when public disillusionment with the established political parties was at its height. The Tangentopoli corruption scandals, which invested most of the established parties, were unveiled from 1992 on. However, contrarily to what many pundits observed at the beginning of the 1990s, Lega Nord became a stable political force.
Lega Nord's first electoral breakthrough was at the 1990 regional elections, but it was with the 1992 general election that the party emerged as a leading political actor. Having gained 8.7% of the vote, 56 deputies and 26 senators,[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano. Da Bossi a Bossi. Storia della Lega |year=2009 |publisher=Sperling & Kupfer |location=Milan |pages=263–266[/tpl] it became the fourth largest party of the country and within Parliament. In 1993 Marco Formentini, a left-wing leghista, was elected mayor of Milan, the party won 49.3% in the provincial election of Varese[tpl]cite book |first1=Pietro |last1=Ignazi |title=Partiti politici in Italia |year=2008 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |page=90[/tpl] and, by the end of the year, before Silvio Berlusconi launched his own political career and party, it was polled around 16–18% in electoral surveys.[tpl]cite book |first1=Ilvo |last1=Diamanti |authorlink=Ilvo Diamanti |title= Bianco, rosso, verde... e azzurro |year=2003 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |page=67[/tpl]

===First alliance with Berlusconi===

In early 1994, some days before the announcement of the Bossi–Berlusconi pact which led to the formation of the Pole of Freedoms, Roberto Maroni, Bossi's number two, signed an agreement with Mario Segni's centrist Pact for Italy, which was later cancelled.[tpl]cite book |first1=Giorgio |last1=Galli |title=I partiti politici italiani |year=2001 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=394–395[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=79–82[/tpl]
The party thus fought the 1994 general election in alliance with Berlusconi's Forza Italia party within the Pole of Freedoms coalition. Lega Nord gained just 8.4% of the vote, but, thanks to a generous division of candidacies in northern single-seats constituencies, its parliamentary representation was almost doubled to 117 deputies and 56 senators.[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano. Da Bossi a Bossi. Storia della Lega |year=2009 |publisher=Sperling & Kupfer |location=Milan |pages=267–273[/tpl] The post of President Chamber of Deputies was thus given to a leghista, Irene Pivetti, a young woman hailing from the Catholic faction of the party.
After the election, the League joined FI, National Alliance (AN) and the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD) to form a coalition government under Berlusconi and the party obtained five ministries in Berlusconi's first cabinet: Interior for Roberto Maroni (who was also Deputy Prime Minister), Budget for Giancarlo Pagliarini, Industry for Vito Gnutti, European affairs for Domenico Comino and Institutional Reforms for Francesco Speroni. However, the alliance with Berlusconi and the government itself were both short-lived: the latter collapsed before the end of the year, with the League being instrumental in its demise.
When, in December, Bossi finally decided to withdraw from the government over a controversial pension reform, Maroni vocally disagreed. In January 1995 the League gave a vote of confidence to the newly formed cabinet led by Lamberto Dini, alongside with the Italian People's Party and the Democratic Party of the Left. This caused several splinter groups to leave the party, including the Federalist Party (which was actually founded in June 1994) of Gianfranco Miglio, the Federalists and Liberal Democrats of Franco Rocchetta, Lucio Malan and Furio Gubetti[tpl]cite news |first=Gianna |last=Fregonara |title=Maroni e Bossi vanno alla conta |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/gennaio/09/Maroni_Bossi_vanno_alla_conta_co_0_9501094060.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1995-01-09[/tpl] and the Federalist Italian League of Luigi Negri and Sergio Cappelli. All these groups later merged into FI, while a few other MPs, including Pierluigi Petrini, floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies, joined the centre-left. By 1996 total of 40 deputies and 17 senators had left the party. After months of coldness with Bossi, Maroni had instead returned to the party's fold.[tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=94–999[/tpl]
Between 1995 and 1998 Lega Nord joined centre-left governing coalitions in many local contexts, notably including the Province of Padua to the city of Udine.

===Padanian separatism===

[tpl]Main|Padanian Independence Declaration|Padanian nationalism[/tpl]
After a huge success at the 1996 general election, its best result ever (10.1%, 59 deputies and 27 senators),[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano. Da Bossi a Bossi. Storia della Lega |year=2009 |publisher=Sperling & Kupfer |location=Milan |pages=273–276[/tpl] Lega Nord announced that it wanted the secession of northern Italy under the name of Padania. The party gave to the expression, previously referring to the Padanian-Venetian Plain, a broader meaning that has steadily gained currency, at least among its followers. The party even organised a referendum on independence and elections for a "Padanian Parliament" (see below).
The years between 1996 and 1998 were particularly good for the League, which was the largest party in many provinces of northern Italy and was able to win in single-seat constituencies and provincial elections by running alone against both the centre-right and the centre-left.
However, after the 1996 election, which Lega Nord had fought outside the two big coalitions, the differences between those who supported a new alliance with Berlusconi (Vito Gnutti, Domenico Comino, Fabrizio Comencini, etc.) and those who preferred to enter Romano Prodi's Olive Tree (Marco Formentini, Irene Pivetti, etc.) re-emerged. A total of 15 deputies and 9 senators left the party to join either centre-right or centre-left parties.[tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=120–121[/tpl] Pivetti left a few months after the election.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |title=Pivetti: sono disgustata.

As a result, the party suffered a huge setback at the 1999 European Parliament election, in which it garnered a mere 4.5% of the vote. Since then the League de-emphasised demands for independence in order to rather focus on devolution and federal reform, paving the way for a return to coalition politics.

===House of Freedoms===

After the defeat at the 2009 European Parliament election, senior members of the party thought it was not possible to achieve anything if the party continued to stay outside the two big coalitions. Some, including Maroni, who, despite 1994–1995 row with Bossi, had always been left-leaning in the heart, preferred an alliance with the centre-left. Bossi asked Maroni to negotiate an agreement with Massimo D'Alema, who had described Lega Nord as "a rib of the left". These talks were successful and Maroni was indicated as the joint candidate for President of Lombardy for the 2000 regional election. Despite this, Bossi decided instead to reproach Berlusconi, who was the front-runner in the upcoming 2001 general election.[tpl]cite book |first1=Giorgio |last1=Galli |title=I partiti politici italiani |year=2001 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=432–433[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=122–127, 307–312[/tpl] The centre-right coalition won the 2000 regional elections and the League entered the regional governments of Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Liguria.
One year later, Lega Nord was part of Berlusconi's House of Freedoms in the 2001 general election. The coalition won handily the election, but the party was further reduced to 3.9%, while being returned in Parliament thanks to the victories scored by Leghisti in single-seat constituencies. In 2001–2006, although severely reduced in its parliamentary representation, the party controlled three key ministries: Justice with Roberto Castelli, Labour and Social affairs with Roberto Maroni, and Institutional Reforms and Devolution with Umberto Bossi (replaced by Roberto Calderoli in June 2004). In March 2004 Bossi suffered a stroke that led many to question over the party's survival, but that ultimately confirmed Lega Nord's strength. The party was widely considered the staunchest ally of Berlusconi and formed the so-called "axis of the North"[tpl]cite news |first=Massimo |last=Franco |title=L'ultima trincea dell'Udc contro l'asse del Nord |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2004/gennaio/27/ultima_trincea_dell_Udc_contro_co_9_040127035.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2004-01-27[/tpl] along with FI, opposed to the axis formed by AN and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), which were stronger in the South and generally represented southern interests.
During the five years in government with the centre-right, the Parliament passed an important constitutional reform, which included federalism and more powers for the Prime Minister. The alliance that Lega Nord forged with the Movement for Autonomy (MpA) and the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az) for the 2006 general election was not successful in convincing southern voters to approve the reform, which was rejected in the 2006 constitutional referendum.

===Fourth Berlusconi government===

In the aftermath of the fall of Romano Prodi's government in January 2008, which led President Giorgio Napolitano to call an early election, the centre-right was re-organised by Berlusconi as The People of Freedom (PdL), now without the support of the UDC. Lega Nord ran the election in coalition with the PdL and the MpA, gaining a stunning 8.3% of the vote (+4.2%) and obtaining 60 deputies (+37) and 26 senators (+13).
Following this result, since May 2008 Lega Nord was represented in Berlusconi's fourth cabinet by four ministers (Roberto Maroni, Interior; Luca Zaia, Agriculture; Umberto Bossi, Reforms and Federalism; Roberto Calderoli, Legislative simplification) and five under-secretaries (Roberto Castelli, Infrastructures; Michelino Davico, Interior; Daniele Molgora, Economy and Finances; Francesca Martini, Health; Maurizio Balocchi, Legislative simplification).
In April 2009 a bill introducing a path towards fiscal federalism was approved by the Senate, after having passed by the Chamber. The bill gained bipartisan support by Italy of Values, that voted in favour, and the Democratic Party, that chose not to oppose the measure.[tpl]cite news |first=Paolo |last=Foschi |title=Ultimo sì al Senato, via al federalismo fiscale |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/aprile/30/Ultimo_Senato_via_federalismo_fiscale_co_8_090430002.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2009-04-30[/tpl] As of late March 2011 all the most important decrees of the reform were approved by the Parliament and Bossi publicly praised the Democrats' leader Pier Luigi Bersani for not having opposed the decisive decree on regional and provincial fiscality.[tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Cremonesi |title=Calderoli: noi e il Pd?

Both Zaia and Cota were elected. The party became the largest in Veneto with 35.2% and the second-largest in Lombardy with 26.2%, while getting stronger all around the North and in some regions of central Italy.
In November 2011 Berlusconi resigned and was replaced by Mario Monti. The League was the only major party to oppose Monti's "technocratic" government.

===Maroni vs. "magic circle"===

Throughout 2011 the party was riven in internal disputes, which Bossi's weak-as-ever leadership was not able to stop. Roberto Maroni, a moderate figure who had been the party's number two since the start, was clearly Bossi's most likely successor, due to his political history (he had been a close associate of Bossi since 1979, before Lega Lombarda was formed) and the support he received among grassroots. The rise of Maroni and his fellow Maroniani was obstacled by a group of Bossi's loyalists, whom journalists called the "magic circle". One of the leaders of this group was Marco Reguzzoni, floor leader in the Chamber of Deputies.
On 13 January 2012 the dispute went so far that the executive of Lega Lombarda, ironically led by Giancarlo Giorgetti, a maroniano, forbade Maroni from speaking at public meetings organised by the party. Maroni protested vehemently[tpl]cite news |first=Marco |last=Cremonesi |title=Bossi, l'offensiva anti Maroni Vietati tutti gli incontri pubblici |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/gennaio/14/Bossi_offensiva_anti_Maroni_Vietati_co_8_120114027.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2012-01-14[/tpl] and, in a few hours, hundreds of local sections invited him to speak in their towns, ignoring the diktat. The reaction of the party's base was so strong that Bossi revoked the decision, told Maroni that there had been a "misunderstanding" and blamed "muddle-headed intermediates".[tpl]cite news |first=Paolo |last=Bracalini |title=Bossi stoppa la rivolta della Lega e firma un armistizio con Maroni |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/bossi_stoppa_rivolta_lega_e_firma_armistizio_maroni/15-01-2012/articolo-id=566965-page=0-comments=1 |publisher=Il Giornale |location=Milan |date=2012-01-15[/tpl]
On 17 January, thousands of people participated to a factional rally in Varese. At the presence of Bossi, Maroni launched direct attacks on Reguzzoni and Rosi Mauro, who were considered by many the inspirers of the diktat, called for the celebration of party congresses and closed his speech paraphrasing Scipio Slataper and Che Guevara (the latter being one of his youth's heroes): "We are barbarians, dreaming barbarians. We are realistic, we dream the impossible".[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |title=Per una Lega unite e per una Padania libera e indipendente |url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/343749 |publisher=Radio Radicale |date=2012-01-18[/tpl] On 20 January Bossi replaced Reguzzoni as leader in the Chamber with Gianpaolo Dozzo, a Venetian who was neither a maroniano nor an affiliate of the magic circle.[tpl]cite news |first=Sergio |last=Rame |title=Dozzo è capogruppo al posto di Reguzzoni: la Lega ritrova l'unità? |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/dozzo_e_capogruppoal_posto_reguzzonila_lega_ritrova_unita/manifestazione-marco_reguzzoni-umberto_bossi-roberto_maroni-lega_nord/20-01-2012/articolo-id=567982-page=0-comments=1 |publisher=Il Giornale |location=Milan |date=2012-01-20[/tpl] Two days later the federal council of the party scheduled provincial congresses by April and national (regional) congresses by June.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |title=Maroni annuncia su Facebook "Ora i congressi" |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/milano/maroni_annuncia_facebook_ora_congressi/23-01-2012/articolo-id=568397-page=0-comments=1 |publisher=Il Giornale |location=Milan |date=2012-01-23[/tpl] Maroni, whose flock included people as diverse as Flavio Tosi, a conservative-liberal, and Matteo Salvini, a left-winger,[tpl]cite news |first1=Maurizio |last1=Giannattasio |title=Salvini, leghista-comunista: ho "convertito" 10 religiosi |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/aprile/26/Salvini_leghista_comunista_convertito_religiosi_co_9_080426116.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2008-04-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Antonino |last1=D'Anna |title=La rivincita dei cattolici leghisti Borghezio il tramite col Vaticano |url=http://affaritaliani.libero.it/politica/la-rivincita-dei-cattolici-leghisti240312.html |publisher=Affaritaliani |date=2012-03-22[/tpl] strengthened his grip on the party.

===Umberto Bossi's demise===

On 3 April 2012 a corruption scandal hit the magic circle and, consequently, the whole League. Francesco Belsito, party's treasurer and close associate of Bossi, was charged of money-laundering, embezzlement and fraud at the expenses of the League.

More shockingly, on 5 April, Bossi resigned from federal secretary and the party's federal council appointed a triumvirate composed of Maroni, Calderoli and Manuela Dal Lago, who would lead the party until a new federal congress was held. Bossi was however elected federal president.

===Leadership of Roberto Maroni===

On 1 July 2012 Maroni was almost unanimously elected federal secretary. The party's constitution was changed in order to make Bossi federal president for life, to restructure the federal organization and to give more autonomy to the national sections, in fact transforming the federation into a confederation.[tpl]cite news |first1=Claudio |last1=Del Frate |title=Maroni leader della Lega: "Via da Roma" |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/luglio/02/Maroni_leader_della_Lega_Via_co_9_120702035.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2012-07-02[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Cremonesi |title=La regia di Zaia per il cambio di stagione "Basta riserva indiana, ora concretezza" |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2012/luglio/02/regia_Zaia_per_cambio_stagione_co_9_120702026.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2012-07-02[/tpl]
At the 2013 general election, which saw the rise of the Five Star Movement, the League won a mere 4.1% of the vote (–4.2% from 2008).Corriere della Sera. Corriere.it. Retrieved on 2013-08-24. However, in the simultaneous Lombard regional election, the party won the big prize: Maroni was elected President, by defeating his Democratic opponent 42.8% to 38.2%. The League, which obtained 12.9% in Lombardy in the general election, garnered 23.2% (combined result of party list, 13.0%, and Maroni's personal list, 10.2%) in the regional election.LOMBARDIA: Risultati elezioni regionali - Elezioni 2013.

==Ideology==

The party's ideology is a combination of political federalism, fiscal federalism, regionalism and defense of northern traditions. The historical goal of the party is to transform Italy into a federal state, letting Padania keep more tax revenues collected there under a regime of fiscal federalism. Thus, through Lega Nord, federalism has become a major issue in the country. This is also the main difference between the League and most European regionalist parties (South Tyrolean People's Party,[tpl]cite book |first1=Paolo |last1=Rumiz |title=La secessione leggera. Dove nasce la rabbia del profondo Nord |year=2001 |publisher=Feltrinelli |location=Milan |page=171[/tpl] Basque Nationalist Party, Republican Left of Catalonia, Scottish National Party, Vlaams Belang, etc.), which focus on special rights for their own regions.[tpl]cite book |first1=Umberto |last1=Bossi |authorlink1=Umberto Bossi |first2=Daniele |last2=Vimercati |title= Vento dal Nord.

Sometimes it seemed possible that the League might also unite with similar leagues in central and southern Italy, but it did not succeed in doing so. The party continues dialogue with regionalist parties throughout Italy, notably the South Tyrolean People's Party, the Valdotanian Union, the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party, the Movement for Autonomy and the Sardinian Action Party, and has some figures from the South in its parliamentary ranks. Notably, Angela Maraventano, former deputy mayor of Lampedusa, has been a senator of Lega Nord. Although it is no more a member of the European Free Alliance, the party has ties with many regionalist parties around Europe, including left-wing parties such as the Republican Left of Catalonia.[tpl]cite news |first=Marco |last=Cremonesi |title=Bossi, show su Padania e Cavaliere: lo controlliamo, senza Lega va a casa |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/dicembre/02/Bossi_show_Padania_Cavaliere_controlliamo_co_9_091202003.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2009-12-02[/tpl] Lega Nord has some ties also with the Swiss Ticino League.
Lega Nord's political culture is a mix of northern Italian pride, resentment for some southern Italian habits and Roman authorities, distrust of Italy and especially its flag, some support for the free market, anti-statism, independentism, and claims of a Celtic heritage. The party boasts historical references to the anti-imperialist Lombard League and to Alberto da Giussano (stylized in the symbol), the hero of the wars against Frederick I Barbarossa.[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano. Da Bossi a Bossi. Storia della Lega |year=2009 |publisher=Sperling & Kupfer |location=Milan |pages=23–24[/tpl] These historical references are the base for the party's anti-monopolism and anti-centralism.
The original program of the party identified "federalist libertarianism" as ideology.[tpl]cite book |first1=Francesco |last1=Jori |title=Dalla Łiga alla Lega. Storia, movimenti, protagonisti |year=2009 |publisher=Marsilio |location=Venice |page=77[/tpl] In fact the party has often varied its tone and policies, replacing its original libertarianism and social liberalism with a more socially conservative approach, alterning anti-clericalism with a pro-Catholic Church stance, Europeanism with a marked Euroscepticism,[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano.

Parla Davide Romano |publisher=Politica e Società 2.0 |date=2009-09-29[/tpl] In 2008 Bossi explained in an interview that Lega Nord is "libertarian, but also socialist" and that the right-wing he likes is anti-statist and with a "libertarian idea of a state which does not weigh on citizens". When asked to tell his most preferred politician of the 20th Century he said Giacomo Matteotti, a Socialist MP who was killed by Fascist squads in 1925, and remembered his anti-fascist and left-wing roots.[tpl]cite web |first=Umberto |last=Bossi |authorlink=Umberto Bossi |title=Ecco l'intervista integrale della Iena Enrico Lucci a Umberto Bossi |url=http://www.affaritaliani.it/politica/iene-bossi-intervista300908.html |publisher=Affaritaliani |date=2008-09-30[/tpl]

===Catch-all nature===

Lega Nord aims at uniting all those northern Italians who support autonomy and federalism for their land. For this reason it tends to be a multi-ideological catch-all party, following what Umberto Bossi stated in 1982 to his early followers: "It does not matter how old are you, what your job is and what your political tendency: what matters is that you and we are all Lombard. ... It is as Lombards, indeed, that we have a fundamental common goal in face of which our division in parties should fall behind".[tpl]cite book |first1=David |last1=Parenzo |first2=Davide |last2=Romano |title= Romanzo padano.

The convictions of Salvadori on federalism, the self-determination of the peoples (the so-called nations without state) and the belonging to a people on the basis of cultural criteria and not on blood, were adopted by the future leader of the League".[tpl]cite book |first1=Roberto |last1=Biorcio |title=La rivincita del Nord. La Lega dalla contestazione al governo |year=2010 |publisher=Laterza |location=Rome-Bari |pages=137–138[/tpl]
Since the beginning the electorate of the party has been very diverse on a left-right scale. At the 1992 general election, for instance, 25.4% of the party supporters were former Christian Democratic voters, 18.5% Communists, 12.5% Socialists and 6.6% Missini.[tpl]cite book |first1=Pietro |last1=Ignazi |title=Partiti politici in Italia |year=2008 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |pages=87–88[/tpl]
It is quite difficult to define it in the left-right spectrum because it is variously conservative, centrist and left-wing with regard to different issues. For example, the party supports both liberal ideas, such as deregulation, and social-democratic ones, such as the defense of workers' wages and pensions. This is because Lega Nord, as a "people's party" representing the North as a whole, includes both liberal-conservative and social-democratic factions.
Generally speaking, the party supports the social market economy and other typical issues of Christian-democratic parties, and has been described as a "neo-labour party" by some commentators[tpl]cite news |first=Dario |last=Di Vico |title=Fabbriche e Gazebo: la Lega modello Pci |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/giugno/10/Fabbriche_Gazebo_Lega_modello_Pci_co_8_090610031.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2009-06-10[/tpl] and also by some of its members.[tpl]cite book |first1=Francesco |last1=Jori |title=Dalla Łiga alla Lega.

The party is also libertarian-populist in its promotion of small ownership, small and medium-sized enterprise, small government as opposed to governmental bureaucracy, waste of public funds, pork barrel spending and corruption.[tpl]cite book |first1=Pietro |last1=Ignazi |title=Partiti politici in Italia |year=2008 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |pages=86–87, 96[/tpl] These are the main reasons why the party is strong in the North, despite being obscured (especially at the beginning of its history) and badly presented by national media, television and newspapers.[tpl]cite book |first1=Aldo |last1=Bonomi |title= Prefazione – Romanzo padano.

===Platform and policies===

The party usually takes a socially conservative stance on social issues, such as abortion, euthanasia, medical embryonic stem cell research, artificial insemination, same-sex marriage (although there is an association called Los Padania, where "Los" stands for "free sexual orientation", linked to the party and Lega Nord was once in favour of same-sex marriage)[tpl]cite news |title= Il Carroccio: matrimoni gay nella Repubblica Padana |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1998/aprile/05/Carroccio_matrimoni_gay_nella_Repubblica_co_0_9804052417.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1998-04-05[/tpl] and drug use (though it did once support the legalization of marijuana along with Marco Pannella's Radicals).

====Federalist or separatist?====

The exact program of Lega Nord was not clear in the early years: some opponents claimed it wanted secession of Padania, while at other times it appeared to be requesting only autonomy for northern regions. The League eventually settled on federalism, which rapidly became a buzzword and a popular issue in most Italian political parties.[tpl]cite book |first1=Ilvo |last1=Diamanti |authorlink=Ilvo Diamanti |title= Bianco, rosso, verde... e azzurro |year=2003 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |pages=68–71[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Maurizio |last1=Ridolfi |title=Storia dei partiti politici. L'Italia dal Risorgimento alla Repubblica |year=2008 |publisher=Bruno Mondadori |location=Milan |pages=219–220[/tpl]
In 1996 the party switched to open separatism, calling for the independence of Padania. As a symbolic act of birth of the new nation, on 13 September 1996 Bossi took a bottle of water from the springs of Po River ([tpl]lang-la|Padus[/tpl], hence Padania), which was poured in the sea of Venice by a little girl two days later. A voluntary group of militants, the "Green Volunteers", often referred as "green shirts" (green being the colour of Padania), was also established.
The renewed alliance with Berlusconi in 2001 forced the party to tone down and Padania became the name of a proposed "macro-region", going back to the ideas by Miglio: an Italian federal republic, divided into three "macro-regions" ("Padania", "Etruria" and the "South"). The new buzzword devolution (often used in English) was also introduced, but with less success than "federalism". This decision caused some criticism from party ranks and led to the formation of some minor breakaway factions.[tpl]cite book |first1=Pietro |last1=Ignazi |title=Partiti politici in Italia |year=2008 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |pages=97–98[/tpl]
As observed above, the peculiarity of Lega Nord among European regionalist parties is that its main goal is the transformation of Italy into a federal state instead of simply demanding special rights and autonomy for northern regions.

====Eurosceptic or Europeanist?====

Lega Nord often criticises the European Union (it was the only party in the Italian Parliament, along with the Communist Refoundation Party, to vote against the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, but voted in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon)[tpl]cite news |first=Maurizio |last=Caprara |title= Passa all'unanimità il Trattato europeo |url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/luglio/24/Passa_all_unanimita_Trattato_europeo_co_9_080724090.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2008-07-24[/tpl] and opposes what it calls the "European superstate", favoring instead a "Europe of the Regions",[tpl]cite book |first1=Umberto |last1=Bossi |authorlink1=Umberto Bossi |first2=Daniele |last2=Vimercati |title= Vento dal Nord.

However, according to Roberto Maroni, the party is not Eurosceptic and stands for a "new Europeanism". In a public speech in 2012 he said to party activists: "We should start looking at Padania in a northern, European perspective. ... The project of Padania is not anti-European, this is a new Europeanism which looks at the future: a Europe of the regions, a Europe of the peoples, a truly federal Europe." Moreover, the party supports direct elect of the President of the European Commission, more powers for the European Parliament, acceleration of the four unions (political, economic, banking and fiscal), Eurobonds and project bonds, the European Central Bank as lender of last resort, and the "centrality of Italy in European politics".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prov-como.leganord.org/news/63-programma-lega-nord-elezioni-politiche-2013 |title=Lega Nord Como Progamma Lega Nord Elezioni Politiche 2013 |publisher=Lega Nord |year=2013[/tpl]

====Immigration====

The party takes a tough stance on crime, illegal immigration, especially from Muslim countries, and terrorism. It supports the promotion of immigration from non-Muslim countries in order to protect the "Christian identity" of Italy and Europe, which, according to party officials, should be based on "Judeo-Christian heritage".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leganord.org/elezioni/2008/lega/default.asp |title=Movimento politico Lega Nord per l'indipendenza della Padania: programmi ed iniziative del partito |publisher=Lega Nord |year=2008[/tpl] Because of this, the party has been labeled as "xenophobic"[tpl]cite news |first1=Aidan |last1=Lewis |title=Italy's Northern League resurgent |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7350691.stm |publisher=BBC News |location=London |date=2008-04-17[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Iain |last1=Rogers |title=League allies may hinder Italy's Berlusconi: reports |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/15/AR2008041500577_pf.html |publisher=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC |date=2008-04-15[/tpl] and "anti-immigrant".[tpl]cite news |first1=Elisabeth |last1=Rosenthal |title=Italy Arrests Hundreds of Immigrants |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/world/europe/16italy.html?scp=9&sq=northern%20league%20anti-immigrant&st=cse |publisher=The New York Times |location=New York |date=2008-05-15[/tpl] In 1992 the League was compared by Le Nouvel Observateur to some national populist parties of the European far-right, including Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front, Jörg Haider's Freedom Party of Austria and the Vlaams Blok: "the League rejects any association with neo-fascists but plays on themes of xenophobia regionalism and trivial racism".[tpl]cite news |first1=Gianna |last1=Fregonara |title=Un giornale francese lo mette nella casa europea dei Le Pen |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/aprile/19/giornale_francese_mette_nella_casa_co_0_9204193761.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1992-04-19[/tpl]
In 2002 the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) first denounced the party: "members of Lega Nord made a particularly intense use of racist and xenophobic propaganda, although it should be noted that even members of other parties used a xenophobic or otherwise intolerant political talk."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Italy/ITA-CbC-II-2002-004-ITA.pdf |title= Secondo rapporto sull'Italia |publisher= European Commission against Racism and Intolerance |year=2002[/tpl] In 2006 the ECRI noticed that "some members of Lega Nord have intensified the use of racist and xenophobic political talk." While noting that those expressing themselvers this way "were mostly local representatives of this party, also some important political leaders of the party at the national level issued racist and xenophobic statements. These talks continued to target mainly non-EU immigrants, but also other members of minority groups such as Roma and Sinti." ECRI also recalled that "in December 2004, the court of first instance of Verona found six local representatives of Lega Nord guilty of incitement to racial hatred, in connection with a campaign aimed at ousting a group of Sinti from a temporary camp in the local territory."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Italy/ITA-CbC-III-2006-19-ITA.pdf |title= Terzo rapporto sull'Italia |publisher= European Commission against Racism and Intolerance |year=2006[/tpl] However in 2007 the Court of Cassation cancelled the sentence.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/06/sezioni/cronaca/sicurezza-politica-10/cassazione-tosi/cassazione-tosi.html |title=Cassazione, se i nomadi sono ladri è legittima la discriminazione |publisher=La Repubblica |location=Rome |date=2008-06-29[/tpl]

In a 2010 interview after some riots in Milan between South American and North African immigrants, Maroni, then minister of the Interior, stated that "the police state is not the solution" to integration problems and, calling for a "new model of integration", he maintained that "we should think that, other than a permit of stay, a job and a house, there are further conditions that today are missing for integration to succeed".[tpl]cite news |first=Giangiacomo |last=Schiavi |title=Maroni: niente rastrellamenti serve una nuova integrazione |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/15/Maroni_niente_rastrellamenti_serve_una_co_8_100215021.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2010-02-15[/tpl] Bossi soon endorsed Maroni's position.[tpl]cite news |first=Michele |last=Focarete |title=Bossi: "Immigrati, no ai rastrellamenti" |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/febbraio/16/Bossi_Immigrati_rastrellamenti__co_8_100216022.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera|location=Milan |date=2010-02-16 [/tpl]
On 14 July 2013 Roberto Calderoli, a prominent figure of the party, said that whenever he saw the Minister of Integration Cécile Kyenge, who is an African Italian, an orangutan came to his mind.

===International affiliation===

Lega Nord was originally a member of the European Free Alliance (EFA) and its first two MEPs, Francesco Speroni and Luigi Moretti, joined the Rainbow Group in the European Parliament during the fourth parliamentary term (1989–1994). Between 1994 and 1997 it was a member of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR)[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]History of ELDR. Leeds.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-24. and one MEP of Lega Nord, Raimondo Fassa, continued to sit in the ELDR group until 1999. During the sixth parliamentary term (1999–2004), it was briefly a component of the Technical Group of Independents (TGI) along with Italian Radicals and then returned to the Non-Inscrits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=1101 |title=European Parliament: Luigi Moretti |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=997 |title=European Parliament: Francesco Speroni |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=2036 |title=European Parliament: Umberto Bossi |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=1954 |title=European Parliament: Raimondo Fassa |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=[/tpl]
Following the 2004 European election Lega Nord joined the Independence/Democracy (I/D) group and later the Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN), a seemingly awkward affiliation for a party proposing a "Europe of the Regions"—but in the Lega Nord's view, a state's "regions" are populated by "nations" such as the Catalans or the Lombards. The party was affiliated to the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe until 2006, when its members joined the European Democrat Group (EDG).[tpl]cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/ALMemberDetails.asp?MemberID=5791 |title=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe: Roberto Maroni |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date=[/tpl]

==Factions==

Although there are almost no official factions within the party, it is possible to distinguish several tendencies or wings.

===Regional/ideological divides===

The wing from the province of Varese and, more broadly, the bulk of the original Lega Lombarda (including Umberto Bossi, Roberto Maroni and Marco Formentini) has tended to be the left-wing of the party, while that from the province of Bergamo (notably Roberto Calderoli) has tended to be more conservative. In fact both Bossi and Maroni hailed from the far-left of the political spectrum, having been active in the Italian Communist Party, il manifesto movement, the Party of Proletarian Unity, Proletarian Democracy and the Greens before starting Lega Lombarda,[tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=22–23, 57[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Michele |last1=De Lucia |title=Dossier Bossi-Lega Nord |year=2011 |publisher=Kaos |location=Milan |page=1[/tpl] and conceived Lega Nord as a centre-left (and, to some extent, social-democratic) political force.[tpl]cite news |first=Gianna |last=Fregonara |title=Bossi riaccoglie Maroni e torna alle origini |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/maggio/08/Bossi_riaccoglie_Maroni_torna_alle_co_0_9505087057.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1995-05-08[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Gianfranco |last=Ballardin |title=Maroni: solo, ma vado al congresso |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/gennaio/28/Maroni_solo_vado_congresso_co_0_9501287416.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1995-01-28[/tpl] From the left came also Marco Formentini, a long-time member of the left-wing of the Italian Socialist Party,[tpl]cite news |first=Elio |last=Girompini |title=Il cuore socialista di Marco Formentini |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/novembre/29/cuore_socialista_Marco_Formentini_co_0_9311299676.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1993-11-29[/tpl] and Rosi Mauro, a trade unionist of the metal workers' section of the Italian Labour Union and, later, leader of the Padanian Trade Union (SinPa).[tpl]cite news |first=Enrico |last=Marro |title=Cremaschi e il boom della Lega operaia: "Marxisti di destra.

Since its foundation, Liga Veneta was instead characterised as a liberal, centrist and economically libertarian outfit, due to the political upbringing of its early leaders and a more conservative electoral base. In the early 1990s, the League stole votes especially from the Communists and the Socialists in western and central Lombardy, while the party electorally replaced Christian Democracy in eastern Lombardy and Veneto.[tpl]cite web |first=Massimiliano |last=Finazzer |title=Analisi dello scontro tra la Lega Lombarda e la Liga Veneta La strategia di Bossi del blocco padano |url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/104709/105181-analisi-dello-scontro-tra-la-lega-lombarda-e-la-liga-veneta-la-strategia-di-bossi-del-blocco-padano |publisher=Radio Radicale |date=1998-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Ilvo |last1=Diamanti |authorlink=Ilvo Diamanti |title= Bianco, rosso, verde... e azzurro |year=2003 |publisher=Il Mulino |location=Bologna |pages=55–83[/tpl]
In fact, also Lega Lombarda included liberal-conservative figures, such as Gianfranco Miglio and Vito Gnutti, both former Christian Democrats, while Giovanni Meo Zilio, a Socialist partisan during the Italian Resistance, was one of the founding fathers of Liga Veneta.
In Emilia-Romagna, a left-wing heartland, the party has many former Communists in its ranks, and many others have Communist upbringings.[tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Imarisio |title=Emilia, dove il rosso diventa Lega |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/aprile/19/Emilia_dove_rosso_diventa_Lega_co_9_080419145.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2008-04-19[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Michele |last1=Brambilla |title=Reggio o Bologna, la guerra fratricida della Lega in Emilia |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/201010articoli/59905girata.asp |publisher=La Stampa |location=Turin |date=2010-10-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Olivio |last1=Romanini |title=Bernardini: "Scoprii la Lega sulla Smemoranda" |url=http://corrieredibologna.corriere.it/bologna/notizie/politica/2011/24-marzo-2011/bernardini-scoprii-legasulla-smemoranda-190297103799.shtml |publisher=Corriere di Bologna |location=Bologna |date=2011-03-24[/tpl]
However, with the passing of time, the party underwent a process of homogenisation.
Between Maroni and Calderoli, there has been a liberal-centrist wing including Roberto Castelli, a conspicuous group of former Liberals (Manuela Dal Lago, Daniele Molgora, Francesco Speroni, etc.) and a new generation of Leghisti (Roberto Cota, Giancarlo Giorgetti, Marco Reguzzoni, Luca Zaia, etc.).
During the years in government in Rome (2001–2006) in the party there were different viewpoints on coalitions: some, led by Calderoli and Castelli (with the backing of Bossi), vigorously supported the alliance with the centre-right, while others, represented by Maroni and Giorgetti, were less warm about it.[tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=152–153, 158–159, 168[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Guido |last=Passalacqua |title=Maroni contro Calderoli, l'enigma è Giorgetti |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2004/05/14/maroni-contro-calderoli-enigma-giorgetti.mi_020maroni.html |publisher=La Repubblica |location=Rome |date=2004-05-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Alessandro |last=Trocino |title=Un' ora di cammino al giorno, Bossi prepara il rientro |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2004/ottobre/21/ora_cammino_giorno_Bossi_prepara_co_9_041021057.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2004-10-21[/tpl] Some of them spoke about joining the centre-left some time after the 2006 general election, which they were certain to lose. This idea was ascribed to the fact that, without any support from the left, it seemed even more difficult to win the constitutional referendum, which would have turned Italy into a federal state.[tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=122–127, 312–313[/tpl]
Similar differences emerged during Berlusconi's fourth government (2008–2011). While Calderoli was again a keen supporter of the government, Maroni seemed far less warm on Berlusconi and, at times, keener on an alliance with the centre-left Democratic Party. Calderoli's line had the backing of Federico Bricolo, Cota, Reguzzoni and, chiefly, Bossi, while Maroni was backed by Giorgetti, Speroni, Zaia and Tosi.[tpl]cite news |title=La Lega è sull'orlo della spaccatura.

===1997 Padanian elections===

In October 1997 Lega Nord organised what it called "the first elections to the Padanian Parliament". Roughly 4 million northern Italians (6 million according to the party) went to the polls and chose between a number of Padanian parties. This is a short resume of the affiliations of leading party members:[tpl]cite news |first1=Fabio |last1=Cavalera |title=Tra le 43 liste gli "italiani" Pannella e Dalla Chiesa |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/ottobre/24/Tra_liste_gli_italiani_Pannella_co_0_9710242051.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1997-10-24[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Dal Fior |title=I lumbard al primo voto: favorito Formentini nei 200 seggi gazebo |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/ottobre/26/lumbard_primo_voto_favorito_Formentini_co_0_9710261576.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1997-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Venanzio |last1=Postiglione |title=Nei gazebo vincono Centro e ultra' |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/ottobre/28/Nei_gazebo_vincono_Centro_ultra_co_0_9710281499.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1997-10-28[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first1=Adalberto |last1=Signore |first2=Alessandro |last2=Trocino |title=Razza padana |year=2008 |publisher=BUR |location=Milan |pages=111–112[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Gian Guido |last=Vecchi |title=Lista Dalla Chiesa alle elezioni padane |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/settembre/20/Lista_Dalla_Chiesa_alle_elezioni_co_0_97092014632.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1997-09-20[/tpl]

===2008–2011 developments===

Since 2008, besides the traditional regional divides, the party was increasingly divided among three groups. The first was the so-called "magic circle", that was to say Bossi's inner circle, notably including Marco Reguzzoni, Rosi Mauro and Federico Bricolo. The second was formed around Roberto Calderoli, who was the powerful coordinator of Lega Nord's national secretariats and had among his closest supporters Giacomo Stucchi and Davide Boni. The third one was led by Roberto Maroni, who tended to be more independent from Bossi and was somewhat critical of the centre-right affiliation of the party, and included Giancarlo Giorgetti, Attilio Fontana, Matteo Salvini and Flavio Tosi.[tpl]cite news |first1=Giuliano |last1=Zulin |title=Colpi bassi nella Lega per il dopo-Bossi |url=http://newrassegna.camera.it/chiosco_new/pagweb/immagineFrame.asp?comeFrom=search&currentArticle=Y36T0 |publisher=Libero |date=2011-03-10 |location=Milan[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Reguzzoni-Mauro, i bossiani non amati dalla Lega |url=http://affaritaliani.libero.it/politica/lega_mappa_potere100311.html |publisher=Affaritaliani |date=2011-03-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Matteo |last1=Pandini |title=Umberto sistema i conti a Roma. A Milano i suoi litigano ancora |url= |publisher=Libero |location=Milan |date=2011-05-04[/tpl] Gian Paolo Gobbo and Luca Zaia, leaders of the party in Veneto, although very loyal to Bossi, tended to be independent from "federal" factions and were engaged in a long power struggle with Flavio Tosi (see Factions of Liga Veneta).[tpl]cite news |first1=Lillo |last1=Aldegheri |title=La Lega si spacca sull'Unità Gobbo, nuovo attacco a Tosi |url=http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/politica/2011/25-gennaio-2011/lega-si-spacca-sull-unita-gobbo-nuovo-attacco-tosi-181325186254.shtml |publisher=Corriere del Veneto |location=Padua |date=2011-01-25 [/tpl] Indeed Corriere della Sera identified four main groups: the magic circle, Maroniani, Calderoliani and "Venetians" (or, better, Venetists),[tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Cremonesi |title=Difesa dei "piccoli" e un orizzonte di alleanza che non va oltre il 2011 |url=http://newrassegna.camera.it/chiosco_new/pagweb/immagineFrame.asp?comeFrom=search&currentArticle=11BFBJ |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2011-06-19[/tpl] leaving aside the core independentists (see below).
Roberto Cota, leader of Lega Nord Piemont, the third largest "national" section of Lega Nord, was very close to Bossi and was part of the magic circle, but, since his election as President of Piedmont, he became more independent.[tpl]cite news |first1=Michele |last1=Brambilla |title=Il Capo stanco e i "pretoriani" del cerchio magico |url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/201009articoli/58493girata.asp |publisher=La Stampa |location=Turin |date=2010-09-13[/tpl] Equidistant from the main factions were also Roberto Castelli and Francesco Speroni.
By 2011 Maroniani clearly became the strongest faction within the party and Maroni, who was acclaimed at the traditional rally in Pontida in June, became Bossi's obvious successor.[tpl]cite news |first1=Marco |last1=Imarisio |title=Quello striscione della base per Maroni |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/giugno/20/Quello_striscione_della_base_per_co_8_110620018.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2011-06-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Paolo |last1=Bracalini |title=Il popolo lumbard ha scelto: "Bobo, sarai il nostro premier" |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/il_popolo_lumbard_ha_scelto_bobo_sarai_nostro_premier/20-06-2011/articolo-id=530336-page=0-comments=1 |publisher=Il Giornale |location=Milan |date=2011-06-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Francesco |last1=Borgonovo |title=La trota è Maroni.

After earning resounding victories in the provincial congresses of Verona, Belluno and oriental Veneto during the first half of 2011, Maroniani (with the support of Calderoliani) went on to win also in Brescia and Val Camonica, defeating the candidates of the magic circle by landslides.[tpl]cite news |first1=Giuseppe |last1=Spatola |title=Lega, Maroni prende Brescia Sfida a tre per Varese |url=http://www.bresciaoggi.it/stories/Home/294147_lega_nord_sempre_pi_divisacaso_brescia_in_via_bellerio/ |publisher=Brescia Oggi |location=Brescia |date=2011-10-05[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first1=Giuseppe |last1=Spatola |title=La svolta leghista, in Valle vince Antonini |url=http://www.bresciaoggi.it/stories/Home/291335_la_svolta_leghista_invalle_vince_antonini/ |publisher=Brescia Oggi |location=Brescia |date=2011-09-26[/tpl] In October, fearing a remake in Varese, his homeprovince, Bossi imposed his candidate, who was declared elected without a vote.

===Issue-oriented groups===

The League is home also to some issue-oriented groups. First, there is a group of Christian democrats, most of whom are affiliated to the Padanian Catholics, founded by late Roberto Ronchi and currently led by Giuseppe Leoni. Another leading Catholic is Massimo Polledri.[tpl]cite news |first1=Carlo |last1=Puca |title=Dove vuole arrivare la Balena verde |url=http://newrassegna.camera.it/chiosco_new/pagweb/immagineFrame.asp?comeFrom=search&currentArticle=ZM31W |publisher=Panorama |location=Milan |date=2011-05-11[/tpl] In fact many Leghisti are committed to Catholic social teaching and the social market economy, and several party members are former members or voters of Christian Democracy.
Then, there is a right-wing which is represented mainly by Mario Borghezio, a former Monarchist who is the leader of Christian Padania, which is a key advocate of social conservatism within party ranks and has some links with the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X.
Third and fourth, the party has always included also a group of libertarians, whose leading members Leonardo Facco, Gilberto Oneto and Giancarlo Pagliarini have since left the party, and an Independentist Unit.[tpl]cite news |first=Gian Guido |last=Vecchi |title=Bossi multato dai suoi |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/novembre/21/Bossi_multato_dai_suoi_co_2_951121488.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=1995-11-21[/tpl] The independentist wing crosses all the other factions and tendencies and in fact includes, among others, Borghezio and Francesco Speroni. Also Oneto, father of Padanian nationalism, and Pagliarini were close to this group.[tpl]cite news |first=Alessandro |last=Trocino |title=La Lega delusa punta tutto sul referendum |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/aprile/11/Lega_delusa_punta_tutto_sul_co_9_060411103.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2006-04-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Alessandro |last=Trocino |title=La mozione della Lega: pronti a correre da soli |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/febbraio/10/mozione_della_Lega_pronti_correre_co_9_070210114.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |location=Milan |date=2007-02-10[/tpl]
Finally, the party is home to an agricultural wing, which is particularly strong in southern Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, and is represented by the Cobas del latte, a farmers' trade union, the "Land Movement", whose leader was Giovanni Robusti,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leganord.org/ilmovimento/storia/03_lega_nord_storia96_98.pdf |title=Cronistoria della Lega Nord 1996–1998 |publisher=Lega Nord |date=[/tpl] and politicians such as Luca Zaia, a former Minister of Agriculture, Fabio Rainieri, one of the leader of Lega Nord Emilia, and Erminio Boso, a historic and now marginal figure from Trentino.

==Popular support==

Support for Lega Nord is diverse even within Padania and has varied over time, reaching a maximum of 10.1% of the vote at the 1996 general election (around 25% north of the Po River). That year, the League scored 29.3% of the vote in Veneto, 25.5% in Lombardy, 23.2% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 18.2% in Piedmont, 13.2% in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, 10.2% in Liguria, 7.2% in Emilia-Romagna, 1.8% in Tuscany, 1.5% in the Marche, and 1.0% in Umbria. The party got 59 deputies and 27 senators (39 and 19, respectively, in single-seat constituencies), helping the centre-left to win, due to its victories in some northern constituencies characterised by three-way races. The League won barely all the seats in the provinces of the so-called Pedemontana, the area at the feet of the Prealps, from Udine to Cuneo, encompassing Friuli, Veneto, Trentino, Lombardy and Piedmont.[tpl]cite book |first1=Piergiorgio |last1=Corbetta |first2=Maria Serena |last2=Piretti |title=Atlante storico-elettorale d'Italia |year=2009 |publisher=Zanichelli |location=Bologna |pages=182–187[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=C&dtel=21/04/1996&tpa=I&tpe=A&lev0=0&levsut0=0&es0=S&ms=S |title=Ministry of the Interior – Historical Archive of Elections: House of Deputies 1996 |publisher=Elezionistorico.interno.it |date=[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=S&dtel=21/04/1996&tpa=I&tpe=A&lev0=0&levsut0=0&es0=S&ms=S |title=Ministry of the Interior – Historical Archive of Elections: Senate 1996 |publisher=Elezionistorico.interno.it |date=[/tpl] Lega Nord is stronger in the areas of the late Republic of Venice and among Catholics.[tpl]cite book |first1=Francesco |last1=Jori |title=Dalla Łiga alla Lega.
