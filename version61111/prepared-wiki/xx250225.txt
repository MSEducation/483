==History==

The history of the festival is defined[tpl]clarify|date=March 2011[/tpl] on the Rites of Spring website:http://www.vanderbilt.edu/ros/index.php[tpl]quote|During the late 1960s and early 1970s Vanderbilt students, faculty, and administrators went to great lengths to increase the amount of contact the school had with the Nashville community. One example of this community outreach was the student-formed "Free University" which offered instruction to Nashville residents in topics ranging from short wave radio to the arts. The "open campus" policy also resulted in many Nashville residents taking part in Vanderbilt campus events such as the implementation of the Rites of Spring Music Festival in 1971.[/tpl]
