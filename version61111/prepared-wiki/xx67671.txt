==History==

The church was originally known as the White Identity Church of Jesus Christ–Christian, assuming its present name in 1957. After Wesley Swift's death in 1970, the ministry was continued by his wife Lorraine Swift.
In February 2001, the names "Church of Jesus Christ–Christian" and "Aryan Nations" were transferred to Victoria and Jason Keenan when the Keenans won a US $6.3 million lawsuit against the organizations after being attacked by Aryan Nations paramilitary soldiers; the Aryan Nations compound was also transferred to the Keenans.[tpl]cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ | title=Attorney Morris Dees pioneer in using 'damage litigation' to fight hate groups | publisher=CNN |date= 2000-09-08 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060618234711/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ |archivedate = June 18, 2006[/tpl] In March 2001, the Keenans sold the compound to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Carr Foundation, a human rights organization which plans to build a human rights center on the property.[tpl]cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1EF93C540C7A8CDDA00894DC404482 | title=Richard G.
