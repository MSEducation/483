Paul Jules Tillaux (December 8, 1834 – 1904) was a French physician who was a native of Aunay-sur-Odon, département Calvados.
Tillaux was a surgeon and professor of surgery in Paris, and in 1879 became a member of the Académie de Médecine.  He was director of the Amphitheatre d'Anatomie des Hopitaux de Paris from 1868 to 1890.
In 1892 Tillaux was the first physician to describe an uncommon Salter Harris Type III fracture of the tibia. He performed experiments on cadavers and discovered that stress to the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament could lead to this type of avulsion fracture. This fracture is unique because it occurs during a certain period of adolescence, when there is a differential rate of growth of the epiphysis. In honor of his discovery, this condition is now called "Tillaux' fracture". Tillaux' fracture is sometimes misdiagnosed as a simple sprain.
