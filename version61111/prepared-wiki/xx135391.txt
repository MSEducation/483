==History==

At the age of 21 [tpl]fact|date=November 2012[/tpl] Pullinger graduated from the Royal College of Music having specialized in the oboe. She wanted to be a missionary, so she wrote to various missionary organizations.  Unable to find support from missionary organizations, she sought advice from Richard Thompson, a minister in Shoreditch, who told her that she should buy a ticket for a boat going as far as she could get and to pray to know when to get off the boat. At first she wanted to go to Africa, but then she had a dream that impressed upon her the idea of going to Hong Kong.[tpl]cite book|title=Chasing the Dragon|date=1 Sep 1980|author1=Jackie Pullinger|author2=Andrew Quickie|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton Religious|isbn=978-0-340-25760-9|page=28[/tpl] She followed vicar's advice and went to Hong Kong by boat in 1966. However, when she arrived she knew no one there and had only HK$100 on hand.[tpl]cite book|title=Chasing the Dragon|date=1 Sep 1980|author1=Jackie Pullinger|author2=Andrew Quickie|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton Religious|isbn=978-0-340-25760-9|page=22[/tpl] The only reason the immigration officers allowed her in was because her mother's godson was a police officer there.[tpl]cite book|title=Chasing the Dragon|date=1 Sep 1980|author1=Jackie Pullinger|author2=Andrew Quickie|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton Religious|isbn=978-0-340-25760-9|page=33[/tpl] She found work as a primary school teacher in the Kowloon Walled City, which in the 1960s was not policed and consequently had become one of the world's largest opium producing centres ran by Chinese criminal Triad gangs.Booth, Martin pp.99-100 She established a youth club to help drug addicts and street sleepers.

==St Stephen's Society==

In 1981, she started a charity called the St Stephen's Society which provides rehabilitation homes for recovering drug addicts, prostitutes, and gang members. By December 2007 it had grown and was providing homes for 200 people.Baynham, Jacob Hong Kong missionary uses intensive prayer to help heroin addicts San Francisco Chronicle. 17 December 2007. Retrieved August 14, 2008 The charity's work has been recognized by the Hong Kong government who donated the land for the rehabilitation homes.[tpl]cite book|title=Chasing the Dragon|date=1 Sep 1980|author1=Jackie Pullinger|author2=Andrew Quickie|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton Religious|isbn=978-0-340-25760-9[/tpl] The intervention process that the drug addicts go through is very intensive. Instead of giving them medications they are put into a room for 10 days, and prayed over and cared for by a group of ex-addicts.
