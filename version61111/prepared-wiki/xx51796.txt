Picture This is the second album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1982. The album brought the band their first top-ten hit, "Do You Believe in Love". It remained on the Billboard albums chart for 35 weeks and peaked at number 13.

==Background==

The band produced the album themselves along with their manager, Bob Brown. Several outside tunes were included on the album. One of these tunes was "Do You Believe in Love", written by Robert John "Mutt" Lange. It turned out to be their first hit single, reaching the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. A video for the single was also produced. The follow-up single, "Hope You Love Me Like You Say You Do", reached the Top 40; while the third single, "Workin' for a Livin'", just missed the Top 40, peaking at number 41.
"Giving It All Up for Love" is a cover of a Phil Lynott song. Lynott was best known as the singer and bassist for the hard rock group Thin Lizzy, and Huey Lewis played harmonica on Lynott's first two solo albums, as well as Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous album. "Buzz Buzz Buzz" is a cover of a song from the 1950s by The Hollywood Flames.
