Alienated by the sports-oriented suburbs, his grandmother purchased for him a subscription to Eagle when he was a child, and he grew up reading Dan Dare, finding them more exciting than the Batman and Superman comics of the 1950s and early 1960s. He read works by science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein, as well as writers of other genres such as Rudyard Kipling and C. S. Forester. Claremont lived on an Israeli kibbutz during his youth.[tpl]cite web |url= http://jewishworldnews.org/good-guys-win-in-the-end-must-we-wait-for-the-30th-century/|title= Good guys win in the end— Must we wait for the 30th century??|first= Larry|last= Wilson|date= September 5, 2012|publisher= Jewishworldnews.org|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081739/http://jewishworldnews.org/good-guys-win-in-the-end-must-we-wait-for-the-30th-century/|archivedate= December 1, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= December 1, 2013|quote= All that changed however in the mid 1970s when writer Chris Claremont came on board.

==Career==

===Comics===

====1969 - 1991====

Claremont initially did not view the comic book industry as the place where he would make his career, as he believed the dwindling readership to be a sign that the industry was dying, and found the material being published to be uninteresting. Instead, when he began Bard College, he did so as a political theorist, studying acting and political theory,"X-Mail", Uncanny X-Men #164 (December 1982). Marvel Comics.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bard.edu/catalogue/index.php?aid=11412&sid=669465|title= Charles Flint Kellogg Award in Arts and Letters|year= 2013 |publisher= Bard College Catalogue|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131201005511/http://www.bard.edu/catalogue/index.php?aid=11412&sid=669465|archivedate= November 30, 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl] and writing novels with the hope of becoming a director. His first professional sale was a prose story. He graduated in 1972.
Claremont's career began in 1969, as a college undergraduate, when he was hired as a gofer/editorial assistant at Marvel Comics, during which time he received a plot assist credit for X-Men #59, written by Roy Thomas (cover dated August 1969).Claremont, Chris. Marvel Age Special: X-Men Anniversary Magazine vol. 1, #1 (Sept. 1993).[tpl]#tag:ref|According to Claremont, the reason for this credit is that he suggested the issue's resolution: that the Sentinels try to eliminate mutants through the source of mutation, the Sun.[tpl]cite news | last1 = Christensen | first1= William | last2= Seifert | first2= Mark | date = August 1993 | title = From Gofer to Comic Great | work = Wizard: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 36–40[/tpl]|group="note"[/tpl] Thomas later assigned Claremont his first professional scripting assignment, on Daredevil #102 (Aug. 1973).Claremont, Chris. "The Story Behind (Part of) The Story," "Web-Zingers," Marvel Team-Up #59 (July 1977). In 1974, as an entry into regular comics writing, Claremont was given the fledgling title Iron Fist, which teamed him with John Byrne, their second collaboration after Marvel Premiere.
Though his acting career did not yield great success, he functioned well at Marvel, where he obtained a full-time position. One of the first new characters created by Claremont was Madrox the Multiple Man in Giant-Size Fantastic Four #4 (Feb. 1975).[tpl]cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2008|page = 168|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In this issue, new Marvel writer Chris Claremont and artist John Buscema introduced Madrox the Multiple Man, a mutant who could duplicate his body over and over.[/tpl] Marvel editor-in-chief at the time, Len Wein, who recognized Claremont's enthusiasm for the new X-Men that Wein and Dave Cockrum had created in 1975, hired Claremont, a relatively young writer, to take over the series as of issue #94 (May 1975),Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 170: "The 'new' X-Men team...moved into this thirty-two-page bimonthly comic...and writer Chris Claremont took over the scripting." reasoning that doing so would not draw opposition from other writers, given the book's poor standing. Claremont approached the job as a method actor, developing the characters by examining their motives, desires and individual personalities. This approach drew immediate positive reaction. According to former Marvel editor-in-chief Bob Harras, "He lived it and breathed it. He would write whole paragraphs about what people were wearing. He really got into these people's thoughts, hopes, dreams." Claremont's take on the series has been likened to writing "the Great American Novel about complex characters who just happened to fly", incorporating surprise character developments and emotional nuances amid the operatic battles that otherwise typified American superhero comics. By his own admission,[tpl]cite book|last = Claremont|first = Chris|chapter = Introduction|title = X-Men: Asgardian Wars|publisher = Marvel Comics|year = 1988|pages = 6–7|isbn = 978-0871354341[/tpl] Claremont acquired a reputation for taking a long time to resolve plot threads, and longtime X-Men editor Louise Simonson recounted that whenever he was at a loss for story ideas, "All I'd have to do was go through all of the plot threads that he had left for the last year or two."[tpl]cite news | last = Grant | first= Paul J. | date = August 1993 | title = Poor Dead Doug, and Other Mutant Memories | work = Wizard: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 66–69[/tpl]
Claremont introduced new supporting characters to the X-Men series including Moira MacTaggert in issue #96Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 171: "In this issue, the first to be plotted as well as scripted by Chris Claremont, Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum introduced geneticist Moira MacTaggert." and Lilandra Neramani in #97.Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: "Writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum also introduced the alien Shi'ar race, the Shi'ar Princess Lilandra, and covert agent Erik the Red in X-Men #97." Jean Grey a.k.a. Marvel Girl, one of Marvel's first female heroes, underwent a huge transformation into the omnipotent Phoenix.Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 176: "The transformation of Jean Grey into Phoenix was a dramatic affair...Writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum's intent in transforming Jean Grey into Phoenix was to boost Jean's powers to a higher level." Issue #107 (Oct. 1977) saw the introduction of the StarjammersSanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 181: "Cockrum and writer Chris Claremont introduced the Starjammers, a band of space pirates led by Corsair." as well as the departure of artist Dave Cockrum. Claremont began his collaboration with artist John Byrne in the following issue.Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 181: "When 'new' X-Men co-creator Dave Cockrum left the series, John Byrne took over as penciler and co-plotter. In his first issue, Byrne and writer Chris Claremont wound up the Shi'ar story arc."
During his 17 years as X-Men writer, Claremont wrote or co-wrote many classic X-Men stories, such as "The Dark Phoenix Saga"DeFalco, Tom "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 196: "In January 1980 a nine-part story began that changed the X-Men forever...Claremont proposed a story that would show how Jean Grey - one of the original members of the X-Men - had become corrupted by her new Phoenix power." and "Days of Future Past".DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 200: "The Sentinels ruled the earth in an alternate reality...The Uncanny X-Men #141 also introduced Rachel Summers, the daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey, who was born in the 'Days of Future Past' timeline." Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities."[tpl]cite book|last = Thomas|first = Roy|authorlink = Roy Thomas|coauthors = Sanderson, Peter|title = The Marvel Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles from the World of Marvel|publisher = Running Press|year = 2007|page = 136|isbn = 978-0762428441[/tpl] Comics historian Les Daniels noted that "The controversial story created a sensation and The X-Men became the comic book to watch."[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics|chapter= The Marvel Universe (1978-1990)|publisher = Harry N.

====1992 - present====

The 1990s saw Claremont diversify his comics work, as he wrote for other publishers, and wrote his own creator-owned properties. In December 1991, he sent artist Whilce Portacio a proposal to illustrate Claremont's project, The Huntsman, as a creator-owned project, and when the then-new comics publisher Image Comics was announced in 1992, Claremont was named as one of its founders. However, the project was cancelled when artist Whilce Portacio decided instead to do Wetworks. Claremont attempted to find other artist for the series, but all those in whom he was interested were either drawing X-Men or had their own projects with Image, and thus he did not become one of Image's founders.[tpl]cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = June 1993 | title = Claremont Returns With the Write Stuff | work = Wizard| issue = 22 | pages = 28–35[/tpl] In 1992 he wrote the graphic novel Star Trek: Debt of Honor, which was illustrated by Adam Hughes. In 1993, he began writing the 12-issue miniseries Aliens/Predator: Deadliest of the Species for Dark Horse Comics, which was completed in 1995. That year saw a decline in his comics output, however, as he turned his focus to writing novels, citing frustration with how the comics industry had become dominated by artists and editors. In 1994, he wrote issues 10 - 13 of Jim Lee and Brandon Choi's series, WildC.A.T.s at Image Comics, in which he finally introduced his creator-owned character, Huntsman.[tpl]cite journal|title = Bye Bye Marvel; Here Comes Image: Portacio, Claremont, Liefeld, Jim Lee Join McFarlane's New Imprint at Malibu|journal = The Comics Journal|issue = 148|pages = 11–12|publisher = Fantagraphics Books|date = February 1992[/tpl] In 1995 Claremont began writing his creator-owned series, Sovereign Seven, which was published by DC Comics, running for 36 issues until 1998.
Stan Lee interviewed Claremont for episode 7 of the 1991-92 documentary series The Comic Book Greats.
In 1998, Claremont returned to Marvel as editorial director and the regular writer of Fantastic Four. He also wrote a Wolverine story arc. In 2000, as part of the company's "Revolution" event, he wrote Uncanny X-Men and X-Men until he moved to X-Treme X-Men with penciller Salvador Larroca.  He returned to Uncanny X-Men again for a two year run starting in 2004, while teaming up with his former Excalibur collaborator and artist, Alan Davis.
In 2007, Claremont returned to New Excalibur, writing a story arc in which the character Nocturne has a stroke. He has completed his first arc on Exiles, adding Psylocke to the team.
In 2008 Claremont wrote the miniseries GeNEXT, followed by its 2009 sequel, GeNext: United.

====Writing style====

Claremont’s approach to storytelling during his run on X-Men is considered groundbreaking. According to writer/editor Paul Levitz, Claremont’s complex story structures, "played a pivotal role in assembling the audience that enabled American comics to move to more mature and sophisticated storytelling, and the graphic novel." Claremont's editor on the series, Louise Simonson, attributes the X-Men's success to his approach to the characters: "Chris took them very seriously. They were real people to him."
As the writer of X-Men, Claremont became known for certain characteristic phrases, such as Wolverine's saying, "I'm the best there is at what I do. And what I do...isn't very nice", which became closely associated with the character.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.peterdavid.net/2009/05/01/the-best-there-is-at-what-he-doesand-what-he-does-is-set-up-other-movies/|title= The Best There Is At What He Does…and What He Does is Set Up Other Movies|first= Peter|last= David|authorlink= Peter David|date= May 1, 2009|publisher= PeterDavid.net|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130704012108/http://www.peterdavid.net/2009/05/01/the-best-there-is-at-what-he-doesand-what-he-does-is-set-up-other-movies/|archivedate= July 4, 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl]
A 2009 Slate article asserted that Claremont is the "soapiest writer in comic books.... The classic Claremont pose is either a character, head hung in shame with two enormous rivers of tears running down the cheeks as he or she delivers a self-loathing monologue, or a character with head thrown back and mouth open in a shout of rage, shaking tiny fists at heaven and vowing that the whole world will soon learn about his or her feelings." However, the article goes to state that "the genius of Chris Claremont was that he made mutants a generic stand-in for all minorities".[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/04/i_heart_wolverine.html|title= I Heart Wolverine|first= Grady|last= Hendrix|date= April 30, 2009|publisher= Slate |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130724125035/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/04/i_heart_wolverine.html|archivedate= July 24, 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Novels and acting===

In 1987 Claremont began writing genre novels. His first foray into that medium was a science fiction trilogy about female USAF pilot/astronaut Nicole Shea, consisting of First Flight (1987), Grounded! (1991), and Sundowner (1994). Claremont co-wrote the Chronicles of the Shadow War trilogy, Shadow Moon (1995), Shadow Dawn (1996), and Shadow Star (1999), with George Lucas, which continued the story of Elora Danan from the movie Willow. Claremont was a contributor to the Wild Cards anthology series.
Claremont made a cameo appearance in the opening scene of the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand, for which he is credited as "Lawnmower man".

===Charity work===

In December 2010 Claremont appeared at a book signing at Borders Books at Penn Plaza in Manhattan as part of a series of special events nationwide to commemorate World AIDS Day, with 25% of the proceeds of books sold at the event donated to Lifebeat, a nonprofit organization that educates young people on HIV/AIDS prevention.
In July 2011 Claremont signed a deed of gift to Columbia University's Rare Book & Manuscript Library, donating his archives of all his major writing projects over the previous 40 years to the Library's graphic novel collection, which will form the basis of a research center for New York City-based cartoonists and comics writers. Following the examination and processing of the materials, which include notebooks, correspondence, early story drafts, plays, novels, comic books and materials from Claremont’s early training in the theater and his career as an actor, Claremont’s archive will be housed at the Butler Library, separate from the graphic novel collection, and will be open to anyone who demonstrates a need for its use, with a Finding Aid being made available online. Claremont's longtime editor Louise Simonson said, "his papers will provide many clues, not only to the evolving way comic books are created and presented, but also how they are perceived, licensed, bought and sold in America and around the world."
A symposium called Comic New York was held March 24–25, 2012 at Columbia University's Low Memorial Library to mark the occasion, which was organized by both the university's staff and editor Danny Fingeroth. A discussion between Claremont and Simonson held in recognition of Claremont's gift was the keynote event of the symposium, which focused on the intertwined histories of American comics and New York City, which has served both as a breeding ground for creators and the home of the Big Two publishers, Marvel and DC.[tpl]cite web |url= http://conferences.cdrs.columbia.edu/comicny/?utm_source=Midtown+Comics+Newsletter&utm_campaign=e5c36edab5-Justice_League_Batman_BKV&utm_medium=email|title= Comic New York: A Symposium|date= March 24–25, 2012|publisher= Columbia University|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131201020927/http://conferences.cdrs.columbia.edu/comicny/?utm_source=Midtown+Comics+Newsletter&utm_campaign=e5c36edab5-Justice_League_Batman_BKV&utm_medium=email|archivedate= November 30, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 29, 2012[/tpl] Signings and panel discussions with other creators, scholars and academics of the comics medium were held during the two-day event.
