The Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador (HFNL) is a non-profit organization which was established by the Provincial Government of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1984 to stimulate an understanding of and an appreciation for the architectural heritage of the province. HFNL is the sole organization in the province mandated to preserve one of the most visible dimensions of Newfoundland and Labrador culture - its architectural heritage. 
The Foundation supports and contributes to the preservation and restoration of buildings of architectural or historical significance. HFNL designates buildings and other structures as Registered Heritage Structures and may provide grants for the purpose of preservation and/or restoration of such structures. It also designates Registered Heritage Districts, and is responsible for the Fisheries Heritage Preservation Program, a small-projects granting program which assists in the conservation of vernacular buildings and fishing stages associated with the historic cod fishery and other fisheries.  HFNL is the provincial crown agency responsible for the administration of the Historic Places Initiative, and nominates provincially and municipally designated heritage sites to the Canadian Register of Historic Places.
In 2003 Tilting Harbour on Fogo Island was designated a Registered Heritage District by the Foundation. It marked first time the Foundation recognized an entire community for its significance to Newfoundland and Labrador's material and cultural heritage.
