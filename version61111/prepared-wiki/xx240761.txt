==Type of Restaurant==

The restaurants are of the fast food type. Customers give their order at a counter, pay and then wait for their food in front of the grill counter. Then, depending on the type of restaurant (actual restaurant or shopping centre booth), the customers will be able to eat at a table. The style of the restaurants is modern. Generally the color schemes are mostly white with tones of pale green and pink. Wood texture is also used.

, as well as in Morocco, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. Most of the locations are counters in shopping mall food courts, but there are a number of locations that are a sit-down restaurant.
