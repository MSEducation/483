São João, or São João Baptista, is a Portuguese civil parish, located in the municipality of Abrantes, in Santarém District. It is one of the three parishes that make-up the urbanized area of the city. The parish has a population of 1850 inhabitants and a total area of 2.27 km², being the smallest parish in the municipality.

==History==

The origin of São João has its base in the early settlement of Abrantes, which was first documented in 1176. Afonso Henriques donated its castle to the Order of Santiago de la Espada in 1173, but donated the fish channel to the Monastery of Lorvão, three years later. His charity was partly to support its residents, but also allowed the King to obtain a tithe equivalent to nine-tenths of the catch. In 1179, Afonso Henriques conceded a foral to Abrantes, which was later confirmed by King Afonso II in 1217. On 24 April 1281, King Denis donated the Abrantes to his wife, Queen Elizabeth of Aragon, while still expanding the fort, that included the construction the detention block. Attempting to expand the settlement, the King expanded its jurisdiction by including Punhete (today Constância) within its borders.
During the 17th/18th Century Abrantes was an important military center, classified a Praça de Guerra de  1.ª Ordem ([tpl]lang-en|War Plaza of the First Order[/tpl]).
In 1807, during the Napoleonic Invasions of the peninsula, the fort and parish was a staging point for Marshall Jean-Andoche Junot's troops (23 November).Robert Southey (1823), p.84 Later, Marshall André Massena's forces encircled the fort and settlement, but the Anglo-Portuguese troops and local inhabitants defended the parish, until he was forced to abandon Portugal for Spain.Robert Southey (1823), p.547
The Church of Saint John the Baptist ([tpl]lang-pt|Igreja de São João Baptista[/tpl]) was founded in 1300, by Elizabeth of Aragon, and the settlement was elevated to parish shortly after (in 1326). It was from this church that King John I departed for Aljubarrota, after mass, on 8 August 1385, making a promise to return and say prayers of thanksgiving for his success in battle. With his victory conceived, John I returned and ordered a sculpture in rock erected of the image of John the Baptist.
