</ref> As has been noted earlier in the [[#Terminology|terminology]] section, the photo ''voltage'' is sometimes referred to as the photo ''emf'', rather than distinguishing between the effect and the cause.
The light-induced charge separation creates a reverse current through the cell's junction (that is, not in the direction that a diode normally conducts current), and the charge separation causes a photo voltage that drives current through any attached load. However, a side effect of this voltage is that it tends to forward bias the junction. At high enough levels, this forward bias of the junction will cause a forward current in the diode that subtracts from the current created by the light. Consequently, the greatest current is obtained under short-circuit conditions, and is denoted as IL (for light-induced current) in the equivalent circuit.[ref]

Approximately this same current is obtained for forward voltages up to the point where the diode conduction becomes significant.
With this notation, the current-voltage relation for the illuminated diode is:
where I is the current delivered to the load,  I0 is the reverse saturation current, and m the ideality factor, two parameters that depend on the solar cell construction and to some degree upon the voltage itself, and where kT/q is the thermal voltage (about 0.026 V at room temperature). This relation is plotted in the figure using a fixed value m = 2.[ref]
In practice, at low voltages m → 2, whereas at high voltages m → 1. See Araújo, op. cit. isbn = 84-86505-55-0. page 72
[/ref] Under open-circuit conditions (that is, as I → 0), the open-circuit voltage is the voltage at which forward bias of the junction is enough that the forward current completely balances the photocurrent. Rearrangement of the I–V equation provides the open-circuit voltage as:
which is useful in indicating a logarithmic dependence of Voc upon the light-induced current. Typically, the open-circuit voltage is not more than about 0.5 V.[ref]

</ref>
The value of the photo voltage when driving a load is variable.  As shown in the figure, for a load resistance RL, the cell develops a voltage between the short-circuit value V = 0, I = IL and the open-circuit value Voc, I = 0, a value given by Ohm's law V = I RL, where the current I is the difference between the short-circuit current and current due to forward bias of the junction, as indicated by the equivalent circuit (neglecting the parasitic resistances).
In contrast to the battery, at current levels near IL, the solar cell acts more like a current source rather than a voltage source.[ref]

The current drawn is nearly fixed over a range of load voltages, at one electron per converted photon.   The quantum efficiency, or probability of getting an electron of photocurrent per incident photon, depends not only upon the solar cell itself, but upon the spectrum of the light.
The diode possesses a "built-in potential" due to the contact potential difference between the two different materials on either side of the junction. This built-in potential is established when the junction is formed as a by-product of thermodynamic equilibrium. Once established, this potential difference cannot drive a current, however, as connecting a load does not upset this equilibrium. In contrast, the accumulation of excess electrons in one region and of excess holes in another due to illumination results in a photo voltage that does drive a current when a load is attached to the illuminated diode. As noted above, this photo voltage also forward biases the junction, and so reduces the pre-existing field in the depletion region.
