Arnold Pan of PopMatters gave the album a positive review, writing "All in all, the catchiest tracks on Not Music make a good soundtrack for strolling down memory lane, with Stereolab offering fresh takes on old triumphs, rather than just reliving them." Rebecca Raber of Pitchfork Media was also positive, writing "I suspect it won't be long before we realize that the leftovers of a band like Stereolab are still better than main dishes offered up by many of their peers." The A.V. Club's Christian Williams wrote that while the record felt padded near the end, "for reheated leftovers, however, Not Music is delicious."
In a more mixed review, Jon Falcone of Drowned in Sound wrote "Stereolab will always provide excitement, but in the past, part of that excitement came from a band having no idea of how they should sound, so that the result threw polemics and tangents together with an unmatched grace. Now it feels as though they’re comfortable in their skin. This is great for them, but for the listener it's a bitter sweet comfort and feels akin to insincerely wishing well to an ex who has happily moved on." Under the Radar's Hays Davis also gave the album a mixed review, writing "... Not Music is one of those albums of extras that disappointingly lays bare why these tracks were excluded from those that initially found a release."
