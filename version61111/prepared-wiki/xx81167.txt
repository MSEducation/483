==Franchise history==

The oldest surviving minor league hockey franchise below the level of the American Hockey League, the Nailers began play in 1981 in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League as the Carolina Thunderbirds based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The Thunderbirds were hugely successful on the ice, winning four consecutive regular season titles and were three-time Bob Paine Trophy winners as league champions.[tpl]cite web |title =A to Z Encyclopaedia of Ice Hockey|url= http://www.azhockey.com/At.htm#Atlantic%20Coast%20Hockey%20League|accessdate=February 22, 2010[/tpl]  In 1987, the ACHL folded and the team joined the All-American Hockey League, which lasted just the 1987–88 season.  The Thunderbirds, Virginia Lancers, and Johnstown Chiefs then became the basis for the East Coast Hockey League, now known as the ECHL. The Thunderbirds won the first ECHL playoff championship, then known as the Jack Riley Cup (now Patrick J Kelly Cup), defeating Johnstown. The team was renamed Winston-Salem Thunderbirds in 1990 and moved to Wheeling to become the Wheeling Thunderbirds in 1992 under the leadership of president and co-owner Ed Broyhill.
After a trademark dispute with the Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League, the team was renamed Nailers for the 1996–97 season when the franchise held a contest open to local fans, which was won by C. J. Wickham of Steubenville, Ohio. The name "Nailers" was chosen for the city's long history of nail manufacturing. The team colors have been black and Vegas gold since the 2012–13 season.http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/1918/Wheeling_Nailers/
The team plays at the WesBanco Arena (formerly the Wheeling Civic Center), and used the Cambria County War Memorial Arena in Johnstown, Pennsylvania as an alternative venue during the 2010–2011 and 2011-2012 seasons.http://tribune-democrat.com/sports/x993486041/Arena-confirms-Wheeling-Nailers-to-play-some-games-in-Johnstown-next-year After missing the playoffs for five straight seasons, they had a 106-point season in 2003–04. They were defeated by the Reading Royals in 5 games, 3–2. In season 2005–06 they had a great season making it to the second round of the playoffs losing to Toledo in the final second of the final game.
In addition to winning the inaugural ECHL champion in the playoffs, the Nailers hold the record with three regular season Brabham Cup titles.
In August 2011, the Nailers moved to the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division as part of the league realignment for the 2011–12 season.
