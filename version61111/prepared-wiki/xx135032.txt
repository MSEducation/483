The Windsor Essex Catholic District School Board has been in financial disarray for years. It is currently the only school board in Ontario to have an accumulated deficit. And, according to the province, has repeatedly failed to present a balanced budget, which is a violation of the Education Act. The Government of Ontario appointed a supervisor to oversee the financial management and administration of the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board for an indefinite period of time. The province made the move just hours after a report by an independent auditor made the recommendation. According to the Ministry of Education, the supervisor will return the board to fiscal sustainability, ensure there are no labour disruptions in the coming year and to put the best interests of students first. Norbert Hartmann has been appointed under the Education Act, effective Sept. 4, 2012. Ontario Education Minister Laurel Broten said immediately after the appointment that Hartmann's appointment is open ended and that Hartmann will stay as long as needed.Ombudsman can now investigate Catholic board
