The Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf ([tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربية[/tpl][/tpl]), originally (and still) known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, [tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]large|مجلس التعاون الخليجي[/tpl][/tpl]), is a political and economic union of Arab states bordering the Persian Gulf, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/world/middleeast/a-call-for-private-investment-in-gulf-health-care.html?pagewanted=all |title=A Call for Private Investment in Gulf Health Care |author=Sara Hamdan |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=8 July 2013 |work=New York Times |quote=The council, an economic and political union of Arab countries, is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124285038025540481.html?mod=googlewsj |title=U.A.E.

The unified economic agreement between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council was signed on 11 November 1981 in Abu Dhabi. These countries are often referred to as "the GCC states".

===Objectives===

Among the stated objectives are:
This area has some of the fastest growing economies in the world, mostly due to a boom in oil and natural gas revenues coupled with a building and investment boom backed by decades of saved petroleum revenues. In an effort to build a tax base and economic foundation before the reserves run out, the UAE's investment arms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, retain over $900 billion in assets. Other regional funds also have several hundreds of billions dollars of assets under management.
The region is also an emerging hotspot for events, including the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. Doha also submitted an unsuccessful application for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. Qatar was later chosen to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

===Logo===

The logo of the GCC consists of two concentric circles. On the upper part of the larger circle, the Bismillah phrase is written in Arabic and on the lower part the Council's full name, in Arabic. The inner circle contains an embossed hexagonal shape representing the Council's six member countries. The inside of the hexagon is filled by a map encompassing the Arabian Peninsula, on which the areas of the member countries are shown in brown.

===Patent Office===

The GCC Patent Office was approved in 1992 and established soon after in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/index.php?action=Sec-Show&ID=62&W2SID=3439|title=GCC Patent Office page of the GCC website |accessdate=12 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] Applications are filed and prosecuted in the Arabic language before the GCC Patent Office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is a separate office from the Saudi Arabian Patent Office. A GCC Patent cannot co-exist with a national application in any of the member states, therefore, a national application must be relinquished within 90 days of filing the GCC Patent Application.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Common market===

A GCC common market was launched on 1 January 2008.GCC states to launch joint market today Arab Times The common market grants national treatment to all GCC firms and citizens in any other GCC country, and in doing so removes all barriers to cross country investment and services trade. A customs union was declared in 2003, but practical implementation has lagged behind. Indeed, shortly afterwards, Bahrain concluded a separate Free Trade Agreement with the US, in effect cutting through the GCC's agreement, and causing much friction.

===Monetary Council===

On 15 December 2009, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia announced the creation of a Monetary Council, a step toward establishing a shared currency. The board of the council, which will set a timetable for establishing a joint central bank and choose a currency regime, will meet for the first time on 30 March 2010. Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad Sabah Al-Sabah said on 8 December 2009 that a single currency may take up to 10 years to establish. The original target was in 2010. Oman and the UAE later announced their withdrawal of the proposed currency until further notice.

==2014 Saudi-Qatari Rift==

Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood across the  MENA area have led to increasing tensions with other Gulf States.  These came to a head during a March 2014 meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, after which the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain announced the recall of their ambassadors to Qatar.[tpl]cite journal|publisher=New York Times|date=5 March 2014|title=3 Gulf Countries Pull Ambassadors From Qatar Over Its Support of Islamists|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/world/middleeast/3-persian-gulf-states-pull-ambassadors-from-qatar.html?_r=0[/tpl]gulfnews.com: "UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain recall their ambassadors from Qatar" 5 Mar 2014[tpl]cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/meast/gulf-qatar-ambassadors/ |title=Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain withdraw envoys from Qatar - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2014-04-11[/tpl]  
Some financial economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi-Qatari rift as the tangible political sign  of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural gas producers, which could “have deep and long-lasting consequences” beyond the MENA area.[tpl]cite news| url= https://www.academia.edu/6702258/A_GCC_House_Divided_Country_Risk_Implications_of_the_Saudi-Qatari_Rift | work= Al-Hayat | location=London | title= A GCC House Divided: Country Risk Implications of the Saudi-Qatari Rift | first= M.

===Jordan and Morocco===

In May 2011, Jordan's request to join the GCC, which had been first submitted 15 years earlier, was accepted and Morocco was invited to join the union.Jordan, Morocco to join GCC[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-05/11/c_13868474.htm |title=GCC welcomes Jordan's request to join the council |author=Mu Xuequan|newspaper=Xinhua|date=11 May 2011|accessdate=19 September 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/gcc-membership-may-be-burden-jordan’s-security-383535|title=GCC membership may be a burden on Jordan’s security|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=26 June 2012|last=Al-Rantawi|first= Oraib[/tpl] In September 2011 a five year economic plan for both countries was put forward after a meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries and those of the GCC States, the first GCC meeting since May which included the Jordanian and Moroccan ministers. Although a plan for accession was being looked into, it was noted that there was no timetable for either's accession, and that discussions would continue.
As Jordan and Morocco are the only two Arab monarchies not currently in the council, the current members see them as strong potential allies. Jordan borders member Saudi Arabia and is economically connected to the Persian Gulf States. Although Morocco is not near the Persian Gulf, the Moroccan foreign minister Taeib Fassi Fihri notes that "geographical distance is no obstacle to a strong relationship".

===Yemen===

Yemen is ([tpl]As of|2007|alt=currently[/tpl]) in negotiations for GCC membership, and hopes to join by 2015. Although it has no coastline on the Persian Gulf, Yemen lies in the Arabian Peninsula and shares a common culture and history with other members of the GCC. The GCC has already approved Yemen's accession to the GCC Standardization Authority, Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC),Yemen joined GOIC in 2009 GCC Auditing and Accounting Authority, Gulf Radio and TV Authority, GCC Council of Health Ministers, GCC Education and Training Bureau, GCC Council of Labour and Social Affairs Ministers, and Gulf Cup Football Tournament. The Council issued directives that all the necessary legal measures be taken so that Yemen would have the same rights and obligations of GCC member states in those institutions.See the Closing Statement of the Twenty-Second Session GCC the Final Communiqué of the 29th Session

==Related organizations==

The GCC members and Yemen are also members of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA). However, this is unlikely to affect the agenda of the GCC significantly as it has a more aggressive timetable than GAFTA and is seeking greater integration.
