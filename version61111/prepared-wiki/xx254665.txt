==Promotion==

Earlier in 2008, Flannery made an appearance on RTÉ Two's music television programme Other Voices.[tpl]cite web|author=Harry Guerin|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/othervoices/mickflannery.html|title=Other Voices|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=Other Voices[/tpl] The reaction he received was positive, and Flannery was later described by one reviewer as the "where's he been hiding?" act of that series. There were calls for him to receive his own episode of the show.
On the day of the album's release Flannery performed the track "Tomorrow's Papers" on The Late Late Show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20080912.html|title=Friday, 12 September 2008|date=September 12, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Bill Browne|url=http://www.corkman.ie/entertainment/micks-in-the-house-for-new-years-eve-1979509.html|title=Mick's in the house for New Year's Eve|date=December 17, 2009|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=The Corkman[/tpl]

==Reception==

As with his previous album, Flannery's age was noted: he was twenty-four years old at the time White Lies was released. When he released his debut album, Evening Train, in 2005, his age of twenty-one years was also noted. At this stage two of his songs had already won an award each at the International Songwriting Competition, an achievement which has received much attention as he was the first Irish musician to win in this competition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/radio1/mytunes/1170319.html|title=Programme 1: Mick Flannery|date=November 29, 2007|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=RTÉ Radio 1[/tpl]
entertainment.ie reviewer Lauren Murphy said of the album: "White Lies may not be a perfect album, but it's certainly a promising step forward for a real talent".[tpl]cite web|author=Lauren Murphy|url=http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Mick-Flannery---White-Lies/5893.htm|title=Mick Flannery - White Lies|date=September 23, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=entertainment.ie[/tpl] Public service broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann's reviewer Harry Guerin commented on White Lies: "If you're adamant that Ireland may sink with another singer-songwriter on tour, then this is a record to seek out; you won't notice the time passing and the nation will remain afloat".[tpl]cite web|author=Harry Guerin|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0911/flannerym.html|title=Mick Flannery - White Lies|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2010|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl] There was praise for the faster songs such as "Tomorrow's Paper" and "What Do You See".
The Irish Times placed Flannery at number forty-six in a list of "The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now" published in April 2009,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2009/0410/1224244309293.html|title=The next 50 bands|date=2009-04-10|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] commenting on the White Lies album as having "changed everything" and "With this stunning exhibition of the gravel-voiced musician’s abilities, Flannery turned his hand to mournful piano ballads and catchy guitar tunes with a flair that far surpasses his 25 years".[tpl]cite web|author=Jim Carroll, Tony Clayton-Lea, Sinéad Gleeson, Lauren Murphy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2009/0403/1224243925837.html|title=The 50 best Irish music acts right now|date=2009-04-03|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=The Irish Times|quote=2008 was a good year for Mick Flannery. The former stonemason had hung up his chisel in search of musical fulfilment several years back, yet his 2005 debut album (Evening Train) failed to make any huge impression, despite the Corkonian’s talent as a writer and performer. Last year’s Choice- nominated White Lies changed everything. With this stunning exhibition of the gravel-voiced musician’s abilities, Flannery turned his hand to mournful piano ballads and catchy guitar tunes with a flair that far surpasses his 25 years.[/tpl]
