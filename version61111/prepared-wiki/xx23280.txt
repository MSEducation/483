Soy sauce (also called soya sauce)http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/soy_sauce "...soy sauce (or soya sauce) forms a basic ingredient in Japanese, Chinese and other Asian cooking."http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/19/salmon-soba-noodles "For the marinade; 1 tbsp soya sauce" is a condiment made from a fermented paste of boiled soybeans, roasted grain, brine, and Aspergillus oryzae or Aspergillus sojae molds.'Microbiology Laboratory Theory and Application.' Michael Leboffe and Burton Pierce, 2nd edition. pp.317 After fermentation, the paste is pressed, producing a liquid, which is the soy sauce, and a solid byproduct, which is often used as animal feed.Common soy sauce preparation Soy sauce is a traditional ingredient in East and Southeast Asian cuisines, where it is used in cooking and as a condiment. It originated in China in the 2nd century BCE and spread throughout Asia. Today, it is used in Western cuisine and prepared foods.
Soy sauce has a distinct yet basic taste of umami, due to naturally occurring free glutamates.
Most varieties of soy sauce are salty, earthy, brownish liquids intended to season food while cooking or at the table.Shurtleff, W.; Aoyagi, A. "History of Soy Sauce (160 CE to 2012)." Lafayette, California: Soyinfo Center. 2,523 p. (8,554 references. 228 photographs and illustrations. Free online). Many kinds of soy sauce are made in China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma and other countries. Variation is usually achieved as the result of different methods and durations of fermentation, different ratios of water, salt, and fermented soy, or through the addition of other ingredients.

==History==

Soy sauce originated in China sometime between the 3rd and 5th century from an older meat-based fermented sauce named jiang ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|酱[/tpl][/tpl]). Its use later spread to East and Southeast Asia.Tanaka, Norio. "Shōyu: The Flavor of Japan," The Japan Foundation Newsletter Vol. XXVII, No. 2 (January 2000), p. 2. Like many salty condiments, soy sauce was probably originally a way to stretch salt, historically an expensive commodity. In ancient China, fermented fish with salt was used as a condiment in which soybeans were included during the fermentation process. Eventually, this was replaced and the recipe for soy sauce, jiangyou ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|醬|油[/tpl][/tpl]), using soybeans as principal ingredient, with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce.[tpl]cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|title=Salt: A world history|year=2002|publisher=Walker and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8027-1373-5|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kK7ec92n5x8C[/tpl]
Records of the Dutch East India Company list soy sauce as a commodity in 1737, when seventy-five large barrels were shipped from Dejima, Japan, to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on the island of Java. Thirty-five barrels from that shipment were then shipped to the Netherlands.Tanaka, p. 6. In the 18th century, diplomat and scholar Isaac Titsingh published accounts of brewing soy sauce. Although earlier descriptions of soy sauce had been disseminated in the West, his was among the earliest to focus specifically on the brewing of the Japanese version.Titsingh, Isaac. (1781). "Bereiding van de Soya" ("Producing Soy Sauce"), Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap (Transactions of the Batavian Academy), Vol. III. OCLC 9752305 By the mid-19th century, Japanese soy sauce gradually disappeared from the European market, and the condiment became synonymous with the Chinese product. Europeans were unable to make soy sauce because they did not understand the function of Aspergillus oryzae, the fungus used in its brewing.Tanaka, p. 7.
The 19th century orientalist Samuel Wells Williams wrote that in China, the best soy sauce is "made by boiling beans soft, adding an equal quantity of wheat or barley, and leaving the mass to ferment; a portion of salt and three times as much water are afterwards put in, and the whole compound left for two or three months when the liquid is pressed and strained". Williams, Samuel Wells (1848), The Middle Kingdom: A Survey of the Geography, Government, Education, Social Life, Arts, Religion, &c. of the Chinese Empire and Its Inhabitants, 2 vol. Wiley & Putnam

==Production==

Soy sauce is made either by fermentation or by hydrolysis. Some commercial sauces have both fermented and chemical sauces.

===Traditional===

Traditional soy sauces are made by mixing soybeans and grain with mold cultures such as Aspergillus oryzae and other related microorganisms and yeasts (the resulting mixture is called "koji" in Japan; the term "koji" is used both for the mixture of soybeans, wheat, and mold as well as for the mold itself). Historically, the mixture was fermented naturally in large urns and under the sun, which was believed to contribute extra flavors. Today, the mixture is placed in a temperature and humidity controlled incubation chamber.Muro
Traditional soy sauces take months to make:

===Acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein===

Some brands of soy sauce are made from acid-hydrolyzed soy protein instead of brewed with a traditional culture. This takes about three days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koreanrestaurantguide.com/health/health_soy.htm |title=Korean Restaurant Guide article on soy sauce |publisher=Koreanrestaurantguide.com |accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl] Although they have a different flavor, aroma, and texture when compared to brewed soy sauces, they have a longer shelf-life and are usually made for this reason. The clear plastic packets of dark sauce common with Chinese-style take out food typically use a hydrolyzed vegetable protein formula. Some higher-quality hydrolyzed vegetable protein products with no added salt, sugar or colorings are sold as low-sodium soy sauce alternatives called "liquid aminos" in health food stores, similar to the way salt substitutes are used. These products are, however, not necessarily low in sodium.

==Types==

Soy sauce is widely used as an important flavoring and has been integrated into the traditional cuisines of many East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. Despite their rather similar appearance, soy sauces made in different cultures and regions are different in taste, consistency, fragrance and saltiness. Soy sauce retains its quality longer when kept away from direct sunlight.

===Chinese===

Chinese soy sauces, jiangyou/jeong yau ([tpl]zh|t=[tpl]linktext|醬|油[/tpl]|s=[tpl]linktext|酱油[/tpl]|hp=[/tpl]) or chiyou/siyau ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|豉油[/tpl][/tpl]), is primarily made from soybeans, with relatively low amounts of other grains. Chinese soy sauce can be roughly split into two classes which can be brewed or blended.

====Brewed====

Soy sauce that have been brewed directly from a fermentation process using wheat, soybeans, salt, and water without additional additives.

====Blended====

Additives with sweet or umami (savory) tastes are sometimes added to a finished brewed soy sauce to modify its taste and texture.

===Japanese===

Buddhist monks from China introduced soy sauce into Japan in the 7th century,[tpl]cite book|last=Wilson|first=Kathy|title=Biotechnology and genetic engineering|year=2010|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-7784-7|pages=90|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GwpsVDKQcSUC[/tpl] where it is known as [tpl]Nihongo|shōyu|醤油|shōyu[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shoyu |publisher=Dictionary.com |title=Shoyu[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=shoyu |publisher=Merriam-webster's Online Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shoyu[/tpl]
Shōyu is traditionally divided into five main categories depending on differences in their ingredients and method of production. Most, but not all Japanese soy sauces include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends to give them a slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic sherry-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural preservative. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, some recipes only call for one type or the other, much like a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as fish stock.
Some soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about fifty percent wheat.

====Varieties====

Newer varieties of Japanese soy sauce include:[tpl]cite book |title=Industrialization of indigenous fermented foods |editor-first=Keith H. |editor-last=Steinkraus |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WfjPq9dfTuMC&pg=PA22&dq=genen+usujio&q=genen%20usujio |page=22|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-4784-4|publisher=Marcel Dekker |edition=Second[/tpl]
All of these varieties are sold in the marketplace in three different grades according to how they were made:
All the varieties and grades may be sold according to three official levels of quality:
Soy sauce is also commonly known as shoyu, and less commonly shōyu, in Hawaii and Brazil.

===Indonesian===

In Indonesia, soy sauce is known as kecap (also ketjap), which is a catch-all term for fermented sauces, and cognate to the English word "ketchup".See discussion and references at Wiktionary: ketchup. The term kecap is also used to describe other non soy-based sauces, such as kecap ikan (fish sauce) and kecap inggris (worcestershire sauce). Three common varieties of Indonesian soy-based kecap exist:
In Indonesian cuisine, kecap are used either within cooking process or as condiment. Kecap manis is an important sauce in Indonesian signature dishes, such as nasi goreng, mie goreng, satay, tongseng and semur. Sambal kecap for example is type of sambal dipping sauce of kecap manis with sliced chili, tomato and shallot, a popular dipping sauce for sate kambing (goat meat satay) and ikan bakar (grilled fish/seafood). Since soy sauce is of Chinese origin, kecap asin is also an important seasoning in Chinese Indonesian cuisine.

===Korean===

Korean soy sauce, (called Joseon ganjang, 조선간장, in Korean) is a byproduct of the production of doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste). It is mainly used in making soups, seasoning, and dip sauce. Joseon ganjang, thin and dark brown in color, is made entirely of soy and brine, and has a saltiness that varies according to the maker. Wide scale use of Joseon ganjang has been somewhat superseded by cheaper factory-made Japanese style soy sauce, called waeganjang (hangul: 왜간장/倭: 간장). According to the 2001 national food consumption survey in Korea, traditional fermented ganjang comprised only 1.4% of soy sauce purchases.[tpl]cite web |author= Jung, Soon Teck and Kang, Seong-Gook |title= The Past and Present of Traditional Fermented Foods in Korea |url= http://www.miyajima-soy.co.jp/science/kouenkai/kouenkai.htm |year= 2002 |accessdate= 7 January 2008[/tpl]

===Burmese or Myanmar===

Burmese soy sauce production is dated back to the Bagan era in the 9th and 10th century. Scripts written in praise of pe ngan byar yay ([tpl]my|ပဲငံပြာရည်[/tpl], literally "bean fish sauce") were found.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Production increased during the Konbaung dynasty, circa 1700, when there was bolstered migration of ethnic groups from the north to boost and modify the production of silk in Amarapura.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Thick soy sauce is called kya nyo ([tpl]my|ကြာညို့[/tpl], from Chinese jiangyou 醬油).

===Filipino===

A soy sauce based product popular in the Philippines is called toyo, usually found alongside other sauces such as fish sauce (patis) and sugar cane vinegar (sukâ). The flavor of Philippine soy sauce is a combination of soybeans, wheat, salt, and caramel color. It is thinner in texture and has a saltier taste than its Southeast Asian counterparts, similar to Japanese shōyu. It is used as a marinade, an ingredient in cooked dishes, and a table condiment. It is usually mixed and served with calamansi, a small Asian, lime-like citrus fruit. The combination is known as toyomansi which can be comparable to the Japanese ponzu sauce (soy sauce with yuzu). It is also a main ingredient in the preparation of the Filipino national dish, chicken (and/or pork) adobo.

===Hawaiian===

Soy sauce (shoyu) is a very popular condiment and marinade for many Hawaiian food dishes in the cuisine of Hawaii.

===Singapore and Malaysian===

In Mandarin Chinese spoken in Malaysia and Singapore, soy sauce in general is referred to as dòuyóu ([tpl]lang|zh|豆油[/tpl]), a Mandarin transliteration of the Hokkien term for the sauce or jiàngyóu ([tpl]lang|zh|醬油[/tpl]); light soy sauce is jiàngqīng ([tpl]lang|zh|醬清[/tpl]). Angmo daoiu ([tpl]lang|zh|紅毛豆油[/tpl], lit. "foreigners' soy sauce") is the Hokkien name for Worcestershire sauce.
Malays from Malaysia, using the Malay dialect similar to Indonesian, use the word kicap for soy sauce. Kicap is traditionally of two types: kicap lemak (lit "fat/rich soy sauce") and kicap cair. Kicap lemak is similar to Indonesian kecap manis but with very much less sugar while kicap cair is the Malaysian equivalent of kecap asin.

===Taiwanese===

The history of soy sauce making in Taiwan can be traced back to southeastern China, in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Taiwanese soy sauce is known for its black bean variant, known as black bean soy sauce (黑豆蔭油), which takes longer to make (about 6 months). Most major soy sauce makers in Taiwan make soy sauce made from soybeans and wheat. Some make black bean soy sauce.[tpl]cite news |url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xitem=83076&ctnode=1337 |title=A Sauce for All |last=Chung |first=Oscar |date=1 January 2010 |work=Taiwan Review |publisher= Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan) |accessdate=14 November 2010[/tpl]

===Vietnamese===

In Vietnam, Chinese-style soy sauce is called xì dầu (derived from the Cantonese name 豉油) or nước tương. The term "soy sauce" could also imply other condiments and soy bean paste with thick consistency known as tương. Both are used mostly as a seasoning or dipping sauce for a number of dishes. Vietnamese cuisine itself favors fish sauce in cooking but nước tương has a clear presence in vegetarian cooking.

===Brazilian===

The most common type of soy sauce found in Brazil is the Japanese type (shōyu), due to influence of Japanese immigration. There are some differences between the shōyu sold in the Brazilian market and that found in the Japanese market. For example, Sakura, the market-leading Brazilian brand for soy sauce, features a 35% less salt variety (instead of the Japanese standards 20% and 50%) and all of its soy sauce is gluten free (it uses maize instead of wheat in the fermentation process).

===Carcinogens===

Soy sauce may contain ethyl carbamate, a Group 2A carcinogen.[tpl]cite journal |author= Matsudo T, T Aoki, K Abe, N Fukuta, T Higuchi, M Sasaki & K Uchida |journal= J Agric Food Chem |volume= 41 |issue= 3 |pages= 352–356 |year= 1993 |doi= 10.1021/jf00027a003 |title= Determination of ethyl carbamate in soy sauce and its possible precursor[/tpl]
In 2001 the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency found in testing various soy sauces manufactured in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand (made from hydrolyzed soy protein, rather than being naturally fermented) that 22% of tested samples, contained a chemical carcinogen named 3-MCPD (3-monochloropropane-1,3-diol) at levels considerably higher than those deemed safe by the EU. About two-thirds of these samples also contained a second carcinogenic chemical named 1,3-DCP (1,3-dichloropropane-2-ol) which experts advise should not be present at any levels in food. Both chemicals have the potential to cause cancer and the Agency recommended that the affected products be withdrawn from shelves and avoided. 3-MCPD and 1,3-DCP.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/science/surveillance/fsis2001/3-mcpdsoy |title= Survey of 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-Diol (3-MCPD) in Soy Sauce and Related Products (Number 14/01) |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=18 June 2001 |accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=by Junelyn S. de la Rosa |url=http://www.bar.gov.ph/barchronicle/2004/may04_1-31_soysauce.asp |title=barchronicle (Philippine government) |publisher=Bar.gov.ph |date=4 April 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release | author = Food Standards Agency | title = Some Soy Sauce Products To Be Removed | url = http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2001/jun/soysaucerecall | publisher = Food Standards Agency | date = 20 June 2001 | accessdate =7 January 2008[/tpl]UK UK Food Standards Agency: Soy advice leaflet.

In Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society writes, "Health Canada has concluded that there is no health risk to Canadians from use of available soy and oyster sauces. Because continuous lifetime exposure to high levels of 3-MCPD could pose a health risk, Health Canada has established 1.0 part per million (ppm) as a guideline for importers of these sauces, in order to reduce Canadians' long-term exposure to this chemical. This is considered to be a very safe level."[tpl]cite web|title=Oyster and soy sauce|url=http://www.cancer.ca/Canada-wide/About%20cancer/Cancer%20myths/Oyster%20and%20soy%20sauce.aspx?sc_lang=EN|publisher=Canadian Cancer Society|accessdate=25 December 2012[/tpl]

===Allergies===

Most varieties of soy sauce contain wheat, to which some people have a medical intolerance.http://celiac.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=20 However, some naturally brewed soy sauces made with wheat may be tolerated by people with a specific intolerance to gluten because gluten is not detectable in the finished product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soya.be/gluten-free-soy-sauce.php |title=Does soy sauce contain gluten? |publisher=Soya.be |accessdate=16 July 2010[/tpl] Japanese tamari soy sauce is traditionally wheat-free, and some tamari available commercially today is wheat- and gluten-free.
