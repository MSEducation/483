Later, he was placed in Nartang (Nar-thang) Monastery. In 1405, he took his novice vows from the abbot of Narthang, Khenchen Drupa Sherab.
When he was 20 years old, in about 1411, he received the name Gendun Drubpa upon taking the vows of a fully ordained monk, or Gelong, from the abbot of Narthang Monastery.Thubten Samphel and Tendar (2004), p. 75.

Tradition states that Palden Lhamo, the female guardian spirit of the sacred lake, Lhamo La-tso, promised the First Dalai Lama in one of his visions "...that she would protect the reincarnation lineage of the Dalai Lamas." Since the time of the Second Dalai Lama Gendun Gyatso, who formalized the system, monks have gone to the lake to meditate when seeking visions with guidance on finding the next reincarnation.Laird, Thomas (2006).
