[[East Coast Seafood Centre]]

CATEGORIES: Restaurants in Singapore, Bedok

The East Coast Seafood Centre (Chinese: 东海岸海鲜中心) is a tri-block food centre in East Coast Park, Singapore, best known for co-locating several major local seafood restaurants, including Jumbo Seafood and Long Beach Seafood Restaurant. Jumbo Seafood established its first and flagship oulet at the Centre in 1987, with the ability to seat up to 1,200 diners at a go. Some signature local dishes are served there amongst the various restaurants, in particular the chilli crab and the black pepper crab, the later of which is claimed to be invented by Long Beach Seafood Restaurant. Some of the restaurants offer seaview dining.
Opened at about the same time as the park by the Housing and Development Board, the complex is managed by National Parks Board, which currently houses seven seafood restaurants. Originally known as the UDMC Seafood Centre, it took on its current name in 2000. In 2005, the centre was renovated, resulting in a change in tenant in some instances.
As of June 2007, other seafood restaurants housed here are No Signboard, Fisherman's Village and Red House.  For the latest list of restaurants, see the external link provided below.
The Seafood Centre can be reached by car from the East Coast Park Service Road. A big carpark is located just in front of the Seafood Centre.
