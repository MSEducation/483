Paolo Martinelli (born September 29, 1952 in Modena, Italy) is an engineer best known for his position as head of Scuderia Ferrari's Engine Department from 1994 to 2006.

==Career==

Martinelli studied Mechanical Engineering at Bologna University, graduating in 1978.  He joined Ferrari immediately, at first working on engine design for the company's production cars.
In 1994 he was appointed head of the Formula One team's Engine Department, where he took the decision to ditch the commitment to running V12 engines in favour of V10s.  The first V10-powered Ferrari raced in 1996, and the team used this configuration to win five Drivers' and six Constructors' Championships before rules were brought in stipulating the use of V8s for 2006. Martinelli's favorite race was the 2000 Suzuka that Michael Schumacher won in a Ferrari.Maseratiâ€™s Paolo Martinelli on engine design and racing (August 2013)
