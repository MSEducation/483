A reversible garment is a garment that can be worn two ways. There is no true "inside out" to a reversible garment, since either way, it gives a fashionable appearance.http://books.google.com/books?id=vsaXzwMndS8C&pg=PA949&dq=%22reversible+garment%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Garments that are commonly made reversible include hats, jackets, vests, sweaters, shirts, trousers, and skirts.http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7441281.htmlhttp://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/03/business/patents-mix-match-mix-match-keep-going.html
