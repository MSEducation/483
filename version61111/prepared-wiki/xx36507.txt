 | title	= Metro introduces unlimited 7-day rail pass on SmarTrip®
 | url		= http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5199
}}[/ref] The 7-Day Fast Pass has not been sold as a paper pass since September 1, 2012, and has not been accepted on a paper pass after December 31, 2012.
Users can add value to any farecard, but riders must pay an exit fare if the cost of a trip is higher than their card’s balance. Riders may transfer for free, provided they do not exit through the faregates. SmarTrip users receive a $0.50 discount on bus-to-rail and rail-to-bus transfers.
On October 28, 2011 Metro launched Farragut Crossing, a “virtual tunnel” between Farragut West and Farragut North stations that allows SmarTrip customers to transfer above ground for free, provided that they do so within 30 minutes.
The contract for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems.http://cts.cubic.com/Portals/CTS/Collection-Point/18/files/assets/basic-html/page18.html The current electronic fare collection started on July 1, 1977, a little more than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used.http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/docs/history.pdf Metro's paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a contract for in 1974.

==Security==

Metro planners designed the system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations and the limited obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind,[tpl]cite journal|title=Visibility and Vigilance: Metro's Situational Approach to Preventing Subway Crime (Research in Brief) |publisher=National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/166372.pdf |author=La Vigne, Nancy G. |date=November 1997 |format=PDF[/tpl] has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States.[tpl]cite book|title=Preventing Mass Transit Crime |chapter=Safe Transport: Security by Design on the Washington Metro (Chapter 6) |publisher=Criminal Justice Press |editor = Clarke, Ronald V. (editor) |author=La Vigne, Nancy G. |year=1996 |isbn=1-881798-28-3[/tpl]
Metro is patrolled by its own police force, which is charged with ensuring the safety of passengers and employees. Transit Police officers patrol the Metro system and Metrobuses, and they have jurisdiction and arrest powers throughout the [tpl]convert|1500|sqmi|km2|adj=on[/tpl] Metro service area for crimes that occur on or against transit authority facilities, or within [tpl]convert|150|ft|m[/tpl] of a Metrobus stop. The Metro Transit Police Department is one of two U.S. police agencies that has local police authority in three "state"-level jurisdictions (Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia), the U.S. Park Police being the other.
Each city and county in the Metro service area has similar ordinances that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police have a reputation for enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest.Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 386 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Argued September 17, 2004 decided October 26, 2004) By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.
Metro's zero-tolerance policy on food, trash and other sources of disorder embodies the "broken windows" philosophy of crime reduction. This philosophy also extends to the use of station restroom facilities. A longstanding policy, intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity, has been to only allow employees to use Metro restrooms. Station managers may make exceptions for passengers with small children, the elderly, or the disabled.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A11550-2003Jan4&notFound=true |title=If You Have to Go, Perhaps Soon You Can Go on Metro |work=The Washington Post |date=January 5, 2003 |last=Layton |first=Lyndsey|page=C04[/tpl] Metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission, except during periods of heightened terror alerts.[ref]

===Random bag searches===

On October 27, 2008, the Metro Transit Police Department announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks, purses, and other bags. Transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station. It also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously.[tpl]cite news| author = Lena H.

The Metro Riders' Advisory Council recommended to WMATA’s board of directors that Metro hold at least one public meeting regarding the search program. [tpl]As of|2008|12[/tpl], Metro had not conducted a single bag search.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/06/AR2008120601866.html| title=Discussion Overdue On Metrorail’s Bag-Search Policy| author=Dr. Gridlock| date=December 7, 2008| work=The Washington Post| page=C02[/tpl]
In 2010 Metro once again announced that it would implement random bag searches, and conducted the first such searches on December 21, 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40764493/ns/local_news-washington_dc/| title=Metro Begins Random Bag Searches|date=December 21, 2010|work=MSNBC[/tpl]  The searches consist of swabbing bags and packages for explosive residue, and X-raying or opening any packages which turned up positive.  On the first day of searches, at least one false positive for explosives was produced, which Metro officials indicated could occur for a variety of reasons including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122105534.html| title=Metro bag inspections cause minor customer annoyances| date=December 21, 2010| work=Washington Post[/tpl] The DC Bill of Rights Coalition and the Montgomery County Civil Rights Coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches, taking the position that the practice violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and would not improve security.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local-beat/Groups-Launch-Petition-Against-Metros-Bag-Searches.html| title=Groups Launch Petition Against Metro Bag Searches| date=December 20, 2010| work=MSNBC[/tpl]  On January 3, 2011 Metro held a public forum for the searches at a Metro Riders' Advisory Council meeting, at which more than 50 riders spoke out, most of them in opposition to the searches.  However at the meeting Metro officials called random bag inspections a "success" and claimed that few riders had complained.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=598&sid=2220916| title=Metro riders sound off on bag searches| date=January 4, 2011| work=WTOP[/tpl]

==Accidents==

Several collisions have occurred on Washington Metro, resulting in injuries and fatalities, along with numerous derailments with few or no injuries. WMATA has been criticized for disregarding safety warnings and advice from experts.  The Tri-State Oversight Committee oversees WMATA, but has no regulatory authority.  Metro's safety department is usually in charge of investigating incidents, but cannot require other Metro departments to implement its recommendations.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/05/AR2005060500968.html |title=Safety Warnings Often Ignored at Metro |work=The Washington Post |date=June 6, 2005 |last=Becker |first=Jo |coauthors=Lyndsey Layton |accessdate=June 25, 2009[/tpl]

===Collisions===

During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro operator was killed when a train failed to stop at the Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash was a result of a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1996/rar9604.pdf|title=Railroad Accident Report: Collision of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Train T-111 with Standing Train at Shady Grove Passenger Station, Gaithersburg, Maryland, January 6, 1996|date=October 29, 1996|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl]
On November 3, 2004, an out-of-service Red Line train rolled backwards into the Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train stopped at the platform. The rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first car of the standing train (4018). No one was killed, but 20 people were injured.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22466-2004Nov3.html|title=20 Injured in Crash of 2 Red Line Trains|last=Layton|first=Lyndsey|coauthors=Steven Ginsberg|date=November 4, 2004|work=The Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl] A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backwards into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 people would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.[tpl]cite news| first = Lena H.| last = Sun| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/23/AR2006032300974.html| title=Dozing Operator Blamed in Rail Accident| work=The Washington Post| page=A01| date=March 23, 2006[/tpl]
On June 22, 2009 at 5:02 pm, two trains on the Red Line collided. A southbound train heading toward Shady Grove stopped on the track short of the Fort Totten station, and another southbound train collided with its rear. The front car of the moving train (1079) was telescoped by the rear car of the standing train (5066),[tpl]cite web|title=NTSB Abstract RAR-10/02|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2010/RAR1002.pdf|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board[/tpl] and passengers were trapped.

===Derailments===

On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a malfunctioning crossover switch south of the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this accident occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.
On January 20, 2003, during construction of a new canopy at the National Airport station, Metro began running trains through the center track even though it had not been constructed for standard operations, and a Blue Line train derailed at the switch. No injuries resulted, but the accident delayed construction by a number of weeks.[tpl]cite news| last=Layton| first=Lyndsey| title=Metro track blamed in derailment – Section not made for regular use| work =The Washington Post| page =A1| date =February 27, 2003[/tpl]
On January 7, 2007, a Green Line train carrying approximately 120 people derailed near the Mount Vernon Square station in downtown Washington. Trains were single-tracking at the time, and the derailment of the fifth car occurred where the train was switching from the south to northbound track. The accident injured at least 18 people and prompted the rescue of 60 people from a tunnel.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/07/AR2007010700827.html |title=Green Line Metro Train Derails; at Least 18 Hurt |last=Klein |first=Allison |coauthors=Martin Well |date=January 8, 2007 |pages=A01 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=June 24, 2009[/tpl] At least one person had a serious but non-life-threatening injury.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/08/AR2007010800195.html|title=Federal Investigators Question Metro's Safety|last=Weiss|first=Eric M.|date=January 9, 2007|work=The Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=January 27, 2009[/tpl]
The Mount Vernon Square accident was one of a series of five derailments involving 5000-Series cars, with four of those occurring on side tracks and not involving passengers.
On June 9, 2008, an Orange Line train (2000-series) derailed between the Rosslyn and Court House stations.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/09/AR2008060901703.html |title=Metro Train Derails, Causing Major Delays |work=The Washington Post |last=Sun |first=Lena H. |coauthors=Daniela Dean |date=June 10, 2008 |pages=B01 |accessdate=June 24, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/10/AR2008061000546.html |title=Metro Says Operator Wasn't First to Detect Derailment |work=The Washington Post |last=Sun |first=Lena H. |date=June 11, 2008 |pages=B01 |accessdate=June 24, 2009[/tpl]
On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed at about 10:13 am as it left the Farragut North station in downtown Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer at the end of the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. The wheels of the first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50 am and the NTSB arrived on the accident scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital.[tpl]cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/getthere/2010/02/train_derails_at_farragut_nort.html |title=D.C.

On July 6, 2012, around 4:45 pm, a Green Line train bound for downtown Washington, DC and Branch Avenue derailed near West Hyattsville. No injuries were reported. A heat kink, due to the hot weather, was identified as the probable cause of the accident.

==Safety measures==

On July 13, 2009, WMATA adopted a "zero tolerance" policy for train or bus operators found to be texting or using other hand-held devices while on the job. This new and stricter policy came after investigations of several mass-transit accidents in the U.S. found that operators were texting at the time of the accident. The policy change was announced the day after a passenger of a Metro train videotaped the operator texting while operating the train.[tpl]cite news |author= John Hughes |publisher=Bloomberg |url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aQFnCkF0qCSs |title= Washington Metro Train Operators Caught Texting Will Be Fired |date= July 9, 2009 [/tpl]

==Future expansion==

WMATA expects an average of one million riders daily by 2030. The need to increase capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2064 |title=Metro details improvements to meet future capacity needs |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |date=April 18, 2008 |publisher=WMATA [/tpl] Population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service, build new stations, and construct additional lines.

===Silver Line===

The most prominent expansion is the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project, informally dubbed the Silver Line, a [tpl]convert|23|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] extension from the Orange Line into Loudoun County, Virginia, by way of Tysons Corner and Washington Dulles International Airport. Rail to Dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976. The current Silver Line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the Federal Transit Administration in 2004. After several delays, federal funding for Phase 1 was secured in December 2008[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/03/AR2008120302256.html|title=Silver Line To Dulles Wins Crucial Federal Okay|last=Gardner|first=Amy|date=December 4, 2008|work=The Washington Post|page=A01|accessdate=December 7, 2008[/tpl] and construction began in March 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dullesmetro.com/about/timeline.cfm|title=Project Timeline|publisher=Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority|accessdate=September 14, 2009[/tpl] The line will be constructed in two phases; the first phase to Wiehle – Reston East in Reston, Virginia, is scheduled to open March 2014 and the second phase to Virginia Route 772, beyond Dulles Airport, is projected for completion in 2018.[tpl]cite news |url=http://dullesmetro.com/documents/November2012/12NOV_DEC_DullesMetroNewsletter.pdf |title=Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project Newsletter  |date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Blue Line realignment===

Blue Line trains share a single tunnel with Orange Line trains to cross the Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, creating a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue Line between the Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.narpac.org/METROLRP.HTM| title=Metro Long Range Planning| publisher=National Association to Restore Pride in America's Capital| accessdate=January 25, 2009[/tpl] The proposal was later rejected due to cost,[tpl]cite news|first=Peter| last=Whoriskey| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54434-2005Apr14.html| title=Choke Point Slows Orange Line Trains| work =The Washington Post| page = B01| date =April 15, 2005[/tpl] but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011.[tpl]cite news| title=Metro studies more rail lines for future| date=June 14, 2011| url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/115100| author=Kytja Weir| work=The Examiner| publisher=WashingtonExaminer.com| accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl]

===Orange Line extension===

The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) announced on Jan 18, 2008 that it and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDPRT) had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the I-66 corridor in Fairfax and Prince William counties. According to VDOT the EIS, officially named the I-66 Multimodal Transportation and Environment Study, would focus on improving mobility along I-66 from the Capital Beltway (I-495) interchange in Fairfax County to the interchange with U.S. Route 15 in Prince William County. The EIS also allegedly includes a four station extension of the Orange Line past Vienna. The extension would continue to run in the I-66 median and would have stations at Chain Bridge Road, Fair Oaks, Stringfellow Road and Centreville near Virginia Route 28 and U.S. Route 29.[tpl]cite web| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.55: |title=Northern Virginia Metrorail Extension Act of 2011 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |date=January 5, 2011 |publisher=The Library of Congress [/tpl]  In its final report published June 8, 2012, the study and analysis revealed that an "extension would have a minimal impact on Metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the Beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor"http://virginiadot.org/projects/resources/NorthernVirginia/I-66_Multimodal_-_Final_Report.pdf

===Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade extensions===

In 2005, the Defense Department announced that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, as part of that year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.[tpl]cite news| first = Leef| last = Smith| title = Metro Studies Ft.

===Potomac Yard station===

In 2008, officials began to explore the possibility of adding a station in the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria on the Blue and Yellow Lines between the National Airport and Braddock Road stations. In 2010, the Alexandria City Council approved a portion of the proposed $240 million construction of the station. If the council approves the final budget, construction would start in 2013 and the station could open as early as 2016.[tpl]cite web|last=Goodman|first=Christy|title=Potomac Yard Metro funding approved|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/20/AR2010122005640.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=December 23, 2010[/tpl]

===Other new rail lines===

In 2011, Metro began studying the needs of the system through 2040.  New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway; a new line from the Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak, Maryland, which would pass through the District and Silver Spring; an extension of the Green Line to National Harbor in Maryland; and re-routing the Blue Line in the District between the Orange Line and Green Line.  None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.
