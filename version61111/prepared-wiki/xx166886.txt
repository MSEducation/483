[tpl]nihongo|Saga Nishiki|佐賀錦|Saga-nishiki[/tpl] is a form of brocading from Saga prefecture, Japan. It is a unique form of brocading in that Japanese paper is used as the warp. This paper is coated in either gold, silver or lacquer. The weft is a silk thread which is dyed. As the technique is time-consuming, only several inches are produced each day.Saga Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Saga Nishiki Process, August 2, 2007.

==History==

Saga Nishiki was created at the end of the Edo Period by Kashima Nabeshima, the daimyo of Saga. At this time it was referred to as Kashima Nishiki. It was not until the Japan-British Exhibition of 1910 that it was renamed "Saga Nishiki".Saga Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Saga Nishiki History, August 2, 2007.
