The Antarctic minke whale or southern minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) is a species of minke whale within the suborder of baleen whales.

Until recently, all minke whales were considered a single species.  However, the common minke whale was recognized as a separate species from the Antarctic minke whale based on mitochondrial DNA testing.[ref]
