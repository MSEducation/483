[[Middle class]]

CATEGORIES: Social classes

The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a societal hierarchy. In Weberian socio-economic terms, the middle class is the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the working class and upper class. The common measures of what constitutes middle class vary significantly among cultures.Their value was considered to be the highest of all class, until the economy matured and settled in more, and then they were less rich, and leaving the upper class the richest and wealthiest title and class during the late 1800's. 

==History and evolution of the term==

The term "middle class" is first attested in James Bradshaw's 1745 pamphlet Scheme to prevent running Irish Wools to France."middle class, n. and adj.". OED Online. March 2012. Oxford University Press. 18 May 2012[tpl]cite book|author=James Bradshaw|title=A scheme to prevent the running of Irish wools to France: and Irish woollen goods to foreign countries. By prohibiting the importation of Spanish wools into Ireland, ... Humbly offered to the consideration of Parliament. By a Merchant of London|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AJdbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA4|accessdate=18 May 2012|year=1745|publisher=printed for J. Smith, and G. Faulkner|pages=4–5[/tpl] The term has had several, sometimes contradictory, meanings. It was once defined by exception as an intermediate social class between the nobility and the peasantry of Europe.[tpl]By whom|date=October 2009[/tpl]  While the nobility owned the countryside, and the peasantry worked the countryside, a new bourgeoisie (literally "town-dwellers") arose around mercantile functions in the city. Another definition equated the middle class to the original meaning of capitalist: someone with so much capital that they could rival nobles. In fact, to be a capital-owning millionaire was the essential criterion of the middle class in the industrial revolution. In France, the middle classes helped drive the French Revolution.Georges Lefebvre, La Révolution Française, 1951 1957
The modern usage of the term "middle class", however, dates to the 1913 UK Registrar-General's report, in which the statistician T.H.C. Stevenson identified the middle class as that falling between the upper class and the working class.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Included as belonging to the middle class are professionals, managers, and senior civil servants. The chief defining characteristic of membership in the middle class is possession of significant human capital.
Within capitalism, "middle class" initially referred to the bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.  However, with the impoverisation and proletarianisation of much of the petit bourgeois world, and the growth of finance capitalism, "middle class" came to refer to the combination of the labour aristocracy, the professionals, and the white collar workers.
The size of the middle class depends on how it is defined, whether by education, wealth, environment of upbringing, social network, manners or values, etc.  These are all related, but are far from deterministically dependent. The following factors are often ascribed in modern usage to a "middle class":[tpl]By whom|date=October 2009[/tpl]
In the United States by the end of the twentieth century, more people identified themselves as middle class than as lower or "working" class (with insignificant numbers identifying themselves as upper class).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/12/22/what-does-middle-class-mean-today/who-should-be-the-judge-of-middle-class |work=The New York Times |title=Room for Debate: Who Should Be the Judge of Middle Class? |date=2010-12-23[/tpl] The British Labour Party, which grew out of the organized labour movement and originally drew almost all of its support from the working class, reinvented itself under Tony Blair in the 1990s as "New Labour", a party competing with the Conservative Party for the votes of the middle class as well as the working class.  By 2011, almost three quarters of British people were also found to identify themselves as Middle Class.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13626046 Discusses middle class snobbery as regards popular culture.

==Marxism==

In Marxism, which defines social classes according to their relationship with the means of production, the "middle class" is said to be the class below the ruling class and above the proletariat in the Marxist social schema. Marxist writers have used the term in two distinct but related ways.Communist League Britain, Marxism and Class: Some definitions. undated. http://www.mltranslations.org/Britain/Marxclass.htm at §The 'Middle Class' In the first sense it is used for the bourgeoisie, the urban merchant and professional class that stood between the aristocracy and the proletariat in the Marxist model. However, in modern developed countries, some Marxist writers specify the petite bourgeoisie – owners of small property who may not employ wage labor – as the "middle class" between the ruling and working classes. Marx himself regarded this version of the "middle class" as becoming merged with the working classes.
Pioneer 20th Century American Marxist theoretician Louis C. Fraina (Lewis Corey) defined the middle class as "the class of independent small enterprisers, owners of productive property from which a livelihood is derived."Lewis Corey, "American Class Relations," Marxist Quarterly, vol. 1 no. 2 (Jan.-Mar. 1937), pg. 141. Included in this social category, from Fraina's perspective, were "propertied farmers" but not propertyless tenant farmers. Middle class also included salaried managerial and supervisory employees but not "the masses of propertyless, dependent salaried employees. Fraina speculated that the entire category of salaried employees might be adequately described as a "new middle class" in economic terms, although this remained a social grouping in which "most of whose members are a new proletariat."
The fact that recent decades have seen a large section of small businessmen (shopkeepers, restaurants) replaced by wage-workers (in supermarkets or chains of restaurants) has led most Marxists to theorize an expansion of the working class at the expense of the middle class.

==Social reproduction of the middle class==

Through social reproduction, the middle-class grooms its members each generation to take over from the previous one. To do this, they have nearly developed a system for turning children of the middle-class into successful citizens. Those who are categorized under the American middle-class give education a great importance, and value success in education as one of the chief factors in establishing the middle-class life. Parents place a strong emphasis on the significance of a quality education and its effects on success later in life. The best way to understand education through the eyes of middle-class citizens would be through the previously stated process of social reproduction as middle-class parents breed their own offspring to become successful members of the middle-class. Members of the middle-class consciously use their available sources of capital to prepare their children for the adult world.[tpl]cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey|pages=157–167|chapter=The Badly Besieged Middle Class[/tpl]
The middle-class childhood is most prominently characterized by an authoritative parenting approach with a combination of parental warmth, support and control. Parents set some rules establishing limits, but overall this approach creates a greater sense of trust, security, and self-confidence.[tpl]cite journal|last=Demo|first=David H.|coauthors=Martha J. Cox|title=Families with Young Children: A Review off Research in the 1990s|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|year=2000|volume=62|issue=November|pages=876–95[/tpl]  Though not every middle-class family fits under such a specific, yet broad definition, this style of parenting reflects greatly the middle-class attitude toward childrearing. Teach your children through an active role as parent, which includes a relatively positive parent/child relationship, where the parent plays an active role in the child’s life, making sure to be there for emotional support and guidance in order to shape one’s children into proper, hardworking middle-class citizens.
In addition to an authoritative parenting style, middle-class parents provide their children with valuable sources of capital.[tpl]cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher B.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=New Jersey|pages=157–67|chapter=The Badly Besieged Middle Class[/tpl]  
By spending a lot of time helping their children learn to express themselves effectively, middle-class parents are equipping their children with cultural capital. In a study conducted by sociologist Annette Lareau, she uses an example of nine-year-old Alex, a middle-class child at the doctor’s office getting his regular check-up. Alex's mother has suggested he start thinking of a few questions to ask. When the doctor mentions a confusing term to Alex, his parental guidance provides him with the confidence to ask questions and assert himself, whereby he proceeds in conversation with the doctor, offering up his own opinions and even putting to test the doctor's.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lareau|first=Annette|title=Invisible Inequality: Social Class and Childrearing in Black Families and White Families|journal=American Sociological Review|year=2003|volume=67|issue=October|pages=747–76[/tpl]  Middle-class parents want their children to understand and appreciate the life provided to them in a complicated and sometimes threatening modern world, to appreciate that living well requires a careful study of this world, and do this by painstakingly explaining the reasoning for the decisions and orders they issue.[tpl]cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Hong|title=Class, Gender, and Parental Values in the 1990s|journal=Gender & Society|year=2000|volume=14|issue=December|pages=785–803[/tpl]
Valuing the importance of networking, as outlined below, middle-class parents provide human capital to their children by frequently signing up boys and girls for various adult-run activities, such as soccer, dance, or music lessons; sometimes having as many as three or four per week or even more. Middle-class families utilize their capital resources in order to maintain or develop further their status as members of the middle-class, often hoping to rise to the upper-middle or upper-classes.
Children from middle-class families develop a sense of entitlement. A result of the investments in capital provided and encouraged by parents, middle-class children are far more likely than their working-class or lower-class counterparts to feel this sense of entitlement.
Following the sense of entitlement given to middle-class students from their parents, going to college is an assumption. The striking majority of middle-class children have no reason to question the thought of going to college; never an option, but always an assumption that a college degree is a prerequisite to success in life. This thought can be seen even more so from parents with higher education, whose greater appreciation for autonomy leads them to want the same for their children.
Parents of middle-class children make use of their social capital when it comes to their children’s education as they seek out other parents and teachers for advice. Some parents even develop regular communication with their child’s teachers, asking for regular reports on behavior and grades. When problems do occur, middle-class parents are quick to “enlist the help of professionals when they feel their children need such services."[tpl]cite journal|last=Lareau|first=Annette|title=Invisible Inequality: Social Class and Childrearing in Black Families and White Families|journal=American Sociological Review|year=2002|volume=67|issue=October|pages=747–76[/tpl]
The middle-class parents’ involvement in their children’s schooling underlines their recognition of its importance. Some would even argue that the middle-class is the key to a better educated nation.[tpl]cite web|last=Madland|first=David|title=The Middle Class is the Key to a Better Educated Nation|url=http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/economy/report/2011/11/08/10647/the-middle-class-is-key-to-a-better-educated-nation/|work=Center for American Progress Action Fund|accessdate=11/8/12|coauthors=Nick Bunker[/tpl]
Doob reminds us that “middle-class people are joiners—open to information and influence from various members of their class” (page number here). What he means by this is that members of the middle-class are far more likely to reach out for help from other middle-class families than individuals from lower classes who either don’t have access to such networks or do not feel confident enough to look for them.

==Professional-managerial class==

In 1977 Barbara Ehrenreich and her then husband John defined a new Marxist class in United States as "salaried mental workers who do not own the means of production and whose major function in the social division of labor...(is)...the reproduction of capitalist culture and capitalist class relations"; the Ehrenreichs named this group the "professional-managerial class".Stewart Clegg, Paul Boreham, Geoff Dow; [tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Iu0NAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA158&dq=Professional/Managerial+Class&q=Professional%2FManagerial%20Class|title=Class, politics, and the economy|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2009-10-04|isbn=978-0-7102-0452-3|year=1986[/tpl]

[/ref] The Ehrenreichs developed their definition from studies by André Gorz, Serge Mallet, and others, of a "new working class", which, despite education and a perception of themselves as being middle class, were part of the working class because they did not own the means of production, and were wage earners paid to produce a piece of capital.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-LPgx62t86gC&pg=PA5&dq=Professional/Managerial+Class&q=Professional%2FManagerial%20Class |title=Between labor and capital - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate=2009-10-04 |isbn=978-0-89608-037-9|year=1979[/tpl] The professional-managerial class seeks higher rank status and salary,[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TOtOkos1LP8C&pg=PA469&dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class |title=The general theory of ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.com |accessdate= 2009-10-04|isbn=978-0-521-59006-8|year=1998[/tpl] and tend to have incomes above the average for their country.Gail Paradise Kelly, Sheila Slaughter; [tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=V-CKcuRAu8EC&pg=PA254&dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class%20salary |title=Women's higher education in comparative perspective |publisher=Springer |year=1990 |isbn=0-7923-0800-X |accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl]

==Recent growth of the global middle class==

In February 2009, The Economist announced that over half the world's population now belongs to the middle class, as a result of rapid growth in emerging countries. It characterized the middle class as having a reasonable amount of discretionary income, so that they do not live from hand to mouth as the poor do, and defined it as beginning at the point where people have roughly a third of their income left for discretionary spending after paying for basic food and shelter. This allows people to buy consumer goods, improve their health care, and provide for their children's education. Most of the emerging middle class consists of people who are middle-class by the standards of the developing world but not the rich one, since their money incomes do not match developed country levels, but the percentage of it which is discretionary does. By this definition, the number of middle-class people in Asia exceeded that in the West sometime around 2007 or 2008.
The Economist[tpl]'s[/tpl] article pointed out that in many emerging countries the middle class has not grown incrementally, but explosively. The rapid growth results from the fact that the majority of the people fall into the middle of a left-skewed bell-shaped curve, and when the peak of the population curve crosses the threshold into the middle class, the number of people in the middle class grows enormously. In addition, when the curve crosses the threshold, economic forces cause the bulge to become taller as incomes at that level grow faster than incomes in other ranges. The point at which the poor start entering the middle class by the millions is the time when poor countries get the maximum benefit from cheap labour through international trade, before they price themselves out of world markets for cheap goods. It is also a period of rapid urbanization, when subsistence farmers abandon marginal farms to work in factories, resulting in a several-fold increase in their economic productivity before their wages catch up to international levels. That stage was reached in China some time between 1990 and 2005, when the middle class grew from 15% to 62% of the population, and is just being reached in India now.
The Economist predicted that surge across the poverty line should continue for a couple of decades and the global middle class will grow enormously between now and 2030.
As the American middle class is estimated at approximately 45% of the population,Gilbert, D. (2002) The American Class Structure: In An Age of Growing Inequality. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Thompson, W. & Hickey, J. (2005).Society in Focus. Boston, MA: Pearson, Allyn & Bacon; Beeghley, L. (2004).The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. Boston, MA: Pearson, Allyn & Bacon. The Economist[tpl]'s[/tpl] article would put the size of the American middle class below the world average. This difference is due to the extreme difference in definitions between The Economist[tpl]'s[/tpl] and many other models.[tpl]discuss|45%_exactly[/tpl]
In 2010, a working paper by the OECD estimated that 1.8 billion people were now members of the global middle class.http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/52/44457738.pdf)
