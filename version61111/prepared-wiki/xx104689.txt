==Early life and education==

Bostridge studied at Dulwich College Preparatory School and Westminster School, where he was a Queen's Scholar.
He then attended the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where he achieved a First in  modern history and received an M.Phil in the history and philosophy of science respectively. He received his D.Phil from Oxford[tpl]cite news|last=Clark|first=Andrew|title=Lunch with the FT: Ian Bostridge|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/dddf3f4c-4555-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2kGGTSUYj|accessdate=November 9, 2013|newspaper=ft.com|date=November 8, 2013[/tpl]  in 1990, on the significance of witchcraft in English public life from 1650 to 1750, and was a British Academy post-doctoral fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, before embarking on a career as a singer.
His book Witchcraft and Its Transformations, c. 1650-1750 was published as an Oxford Historical Monograph in 1997. This - "the most sophisticated and original of all recent histories of early modern demonology" according to Professor Stuart Clark ("Witchcraft and Magic in Europe" volume 4, p139, 2002) - has been an influential work in the study of the pre-Enlightenment. It "achieves that rarest of feats in the scholarly world: taking a well-worn subject and ensuring that it will never be looked at in quite the same way again" (Noel Malcolm, TLS).[tpl]cite news| url=http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25362-1955464,00.html | location=London |title=Witch ideologies |publisher=The Times |date=17 October 1997[/tpl] (pay to view) In 1991 he won the National Federation of Music Societies Award and from 1992 received support from the Young Concert Artists Trust.
