Bo Fredrik Björck (born 22 October 1979) is a Swedish footballer who plays for BK Häcken as a defender.
He joined Helsingborgs IF before the start of the 2005 season, transferred from newly relegated AIK. A central defender, Björck has had injury problems during his time at HIF and the team has only been able to use him irregularly. When not injured, he has proven to be a stable player with a very powerful shot. Previously, he has also played for Västra Frölunda IF and as a youngster for Kållered SK and IFK Göteborg. 
In the autumn of 2008 he was made captain of Esbjerg fB. On 4 February 2010 it was announced that he had signed a contract with Norwegian Tippeliga team Tromsø IL, after failing a medical test with Tippeligaen rivals, Aalesunds FK.
