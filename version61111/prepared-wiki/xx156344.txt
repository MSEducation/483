iLike was an online service that allowed users to download and share music.  The website made use of a sidebar that is used with Apple's iTunes or Microsoft's Windows Media Player. The program and sidebar are not required in order to use the site but allow for ease in discovering new artists. The site attracted around half a million users in the first four months after it was launched. According to the latest statements by the company, over 60 million consumers registered to use iLike either directly on iLike.com or using the apps built by iLike for third-party social networks such as Facebook.  iLike also built a "post-once publish-everywhere" dashboard for artists – major label artists as well as independent artists.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/27/ilike-growing-quickly-still-massively-trailing-lastfm/|title=iLike Growing Quickly, Still Trailing Last.fm[/tpl]

iLike had a free Facebook application which allowed users to play clips of music they like on their profile, show concerts they are going to and play a music trivia quiz. The application had great success after its release, making it one of the most popular applications on the Facebook Platform. As of November 2007, iLike had more than 15 million users.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/applications/iLike/2413267546|title=[/tpl] With the launch of Facebook Pages, iLike created pages for bands. A similar feature was also available for the Bebo network.
In April 2009, iLike renamed this application to simply "Music" to maintain consistency with other Facebook apps. 
The website and Facebook app no longer exist.
