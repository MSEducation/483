The park contains a great variety of scenery including beaches, sand-dunes, coastal cliffs, coastal heath and pockets of Karri forest. Rivers such as the Warren, the Donnelly and the Shannon flow through the park and discharge into the waters off-shore.
Important large scale wetlands, known as the Blackwater, and lakes such as Lake Jasper and Lake Yeagarup are found within the park boundaries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,93/Itemid,755/|title=Department of Environment - Parkfinder|year=2009|accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl]
Broke Inlet is contained within the park boundaries at iys eastern end; it is the only inlet in the South West that has not been significantly altered within the catchment area. The gneiss basement rocks project through the shallow waters to form small islands in the Inlet.
Sandy Island in Windy Harbour is part of the park; it is an important nesting site for seabirds, with up to 300,000 breeding pairs of Flesh-footed Shearwaters, a high proportion of the global population.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Sandy Island (Windy Harbour)|accessdate=3 October 2011|work= Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= [/tpl]
