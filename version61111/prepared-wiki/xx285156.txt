==Music and lyrics==

The album's title track is Kuti's commentary on the colonial mentality of Africans who adhere to European customs and clothing, as referenced by the cover artwork's collage of a monkey's head on a suited body.[tpl]cite web|last=Gehr|first=Richard|date=1 December 2009|url=http://www.emusic.com/music-news/review/album/fela-kuti-gentleman/|title=Fela Kuti, Gentleman|publisher=eMusic|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] On the song, Kuti ponders why fellow Africans would wear so much clothing in the African heat: "I know what to wear but my friend don't know / I am not a gentleman like that! / I be Africa man original." He solos on his tenor saxophone over most of the song's nine-minute intro and switches to his electric piano during the vocal sections.[tpl]cite web|last=Tangari|first=Joe|date=8 February 2010|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6007-africa-100-the-indestructible-beat/4/|title=Africa 100: The Indestructible Beat|publisher=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Kuti had learned how to play after the departure of Igo Chico from his Afrika 70 band in 1973. "Gentleman" is followed by two jazzy instrumentals—"Fefe Naa Efe" and "Igbe".
