]]
A relatively large group of Boers settled in Kenya.  The first wave of migrants consisted of individual families, followed by larger multiple-family treks.  Some had arrived by 1904, as documented by the caption of a newspaper photograph noting a tent town for "some of the early settlers from South Africa" on what became the campus of the University of Nairobi.[tpl]cite web|title=Title Unknown |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/1266/historical-kenya-photocamp.jpg|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmCzJrjV|archivedate=24 October 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Probably the first to arrive was W.J. Van Breda (1903), followed by John de Waal and Frans Arnoldi at Nakuru (1906).  Jannie De Beer's family resided at Athi River, while Ignatius Gouws resided at Solai.
The second wave of migrants is exemplified by Jan Janse van Rensburg's trek. Janse van Rensburg left the Transvaal on an exploratory trip to British East Africa in 1906 from Lourenço Marques (then Portuguese), Mozambique. Janse van Rensburg was inspired by an earlier Boer migrant, Abraham Joubert, who had moved to Nairobi from Arusha in 1906, along with others. When Joubert visited the Transvaal that year, Janse van Rensburg met with him. Sources disagree about whether Janse van Rensburg received guarantees for land from the Governor of the East Africa Protectorate, Sir James Hayes Sadler.
On his return to the Transvaal, Janse van Rensburg recruited about 280 people (comprising either 47 or 60 families) to accompany him to British East Africa. Most came from districts around Ermelo and Carolina. On 9 July 1908 Janse van Rensburg's party sailed in the chartered ship SS Windhuk from Lourenço Marques to Mombasa, from where they boarded a train for Nairobi. The party travelled by five trains to Nakuru.
In 1911 the last of the large trek groups departed for Kenya, when some 60 families from the Orange Free State boarded the SS Skramstad in Durban under leadership of C.J. Cloete. But migration dwindled, partly due to the British secretary of state's (then Lord Crewe) cash requirements for immigrants.  When the British granted self-government to the former Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1906 and 1907, respectively, the pressure for emigration decreased.  A trickle of individual trekker families continued to migrate into the 1950s.
A combination of factors spurred on Boer migration. Some, like Janse van Rensburg and Cloete, had collaborated with the British, or had surrendered during the Boer War. These joiners and hensoppers ("hands-uppers") subsequently experienced hostility from other Boers. Many migrants were extremely poor and had subsisted on others' property. Collaborators tended to move to British East Africa, while those who had fought to the end (called bittereinders) initially preferred German West Africa.
One of the best known Boer settlements in the British East Africa Protectorate became established at Eldoret, in the south west of what became known as Kenya in 1920. By 1934 some 700 Boers lived here, near the Uganda border.[ref]

====South West Africa====

With the onset of the First World War in 1914, the Allies asked the Union of South Africa to attack the German territory of South West Africa, resulting in the South-West Africa Campaign (1914–1915). Armed forces under the leadership of General Louis Botha defeated the German forces, who were unable to put up much resistance to the overwhelming South African forces.
Many Boers, who had little love or respect for Britain, objected to the use of the "children from the concentration camps" to attack the anti-British Germans, resulting in the Maritz Rebellion of 1914, which was quickly quelled by the government forces.
Some Boers subsequently moved to South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa until its independence in 1990, after which the country adopted the name Namibia.

==Modern history==

===Apartheid era===

In South Africa, an Afrikaner minority party, the National Party, came to power in 1948 and enacted a series of segregationist laws favouring whites known as apartheid. These laws allowed for the systematic persecution of opposition leaders and attempted to enforce general white supremacy by classifying all South African inhabitants into racial groups. Non-white political participation was outlawed, black citizenship revoked, and the entire public sphere, including education, residential areas, medical care and common areas such as public transportation, beaches and amenities, was segregated.
Apartheid was officially ended in 1990 after widespread unrest, led by supporters of the United Democratic Front, Pan-African Congress, South African Communist Party and African National Congress and a long embargo against South Africa. The factual end to apartheid, however, is widely regarded as the election of 1994. After a long series of negotiations involving the apartheid government under President Frederik Willem de Klerk the ANC under Nelson Mandela, and other parties a democratic, multi-racial election was held, transitioning power from the National Party to the black African National Congress.

===Post-apartheid era===

Efforts are being made by some Afrikaners to secure minority rights even though protection of minority rights is fundamental to the new 1996 post-apartheid Constitution of South Africa. These efforts include the Volkstaat movement. In contrast, a handful of Afrikaners have joined the ruling African National Congress party, which is overwhelmingly supported by South Africa's black majority. However, the vast majority of Afrikaners support South Africa's official opposition, the Democratic Alliance, indicating their acceptance of non-racism within a free enterprise economy, and in the spirit of people like Frederik van Zyl Slabbert who was the leader of the official opposition — the Progressive Federal Party — in the House of Assembly from 1979 to 1986.
Employment Equity legislation favours employment of black (African, Indian and Coloured) South Africans over white women and men. Black Economic Empowerment legislation further favours blacks as the government considers ownership, employment, training and social responsibility initiatives which empower black South Africans as important criteria when awarding tenders. However, private enterprise adheres to this legislation voluntarily.Temporarily unavailable Some reports indicate a growing number of whites suffering poverty compared to the pre-apartheid years and attribute this to such laws — over 350,000 Afrikaners may be classified as poor, with some research claiming that up to 150,000 are struggling for survival.Simon Wood meets the people who lost most when Mandela won in South AfricaSouth Africa – Poor Whites This combined with a wave of violent crime has led to vast numbers of Afrikaners and English-speaking South Africans leaving the country.
Genocide Watch has theorised that farm attacks constitute early warning signs of genocide against Afrikaners and has criticised the South African government for its inaction on the issue, pointing out that the murder rate for them ("ethno-European farmers" in their report, which also included non-Afrikaner farmers of European race) is four times that of the general South African population.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/BoersSlain01.htm | title=Over 1000 Boer Farmers in South Africa Have Been Murdered Since 1991 | publisher=Genocide Watch | accessdate=2005-12-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051230121634/http://www.genocidewatch.org/BoersSlain01.htm  |archivedate = 30 December 2005[/tpl] There are 40,000 white farmers in South Africa. Since 1994 close to three thousand farmers have been murdered in thousands of farm attacks,White farmers being wiped out, The Times with many being brutally tortured and/or raped. Some victims have been burned with smoothing irons or had boiling water poured down their throats.

===Afrikaner diaspora and emigration===

Since 1994 there has been significant emigration of white people from South Africa. There are thus currently large Afrikaner and English-speaking South African communities in the UK and other developed countries. Between 1995 and 2005, more than one million South Africans have emigrated, citing violent and racially motivated black on white crime as the main reason.[tpl]cite web|title=Million whites leave SA - study|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2003186|publisher=24.com|accessdate=5 June 2013|author=Peet van Aardt|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080416135445/http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?ArticleId=1518-25_2003186|archivedate=April 16, 2008|date=24 September 2006[/tpl] Farmers have emigrated to other parts of Africa to develop efficient commercial farming there.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-03-boers-are-moving-north |title=Boers are moving north — News — Mail & Guardian Online |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl]

==Geography==

===Namibia===

There were 133,324 speakers of Afrikaans in Namibia, forming 9.5% of the total national population, according to the 1991 census. However the majority of these speakers come from the Coloured and Baster communities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] Afrikaners are mostly found in Windhoek and in the Southern provinces.

===Global presence===

A significant number of Afrikaners have migrated to countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.
A large number of young Afrikaners are taking advantage of working holiday visas made available by the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, as well as the Netherlands and Belgium, to gain work experience. The scheme under which UK working holiday visas were issued ended on 27 November 2008 and has been replaced by the Tier 5 (Youth Mobility) visa. South Africa is unlikely to partake in this scheme.
As of 2011, Georgia is encouraging Afrikaner immigration to help kickstart the country's agriculture industry, which has declined significantly since the fall of communism.[tpl]cite web|author=James Brooke | url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Afrikaner-Farmers-Migrating-to-Georgia-129900258.html |title=Afrikaner Farmers Migrating to Georgia | Africa | English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Religion===

Traditionally Christian, the Calvinism of Boers in South Africa developed in much the same way as the New England colonies in North America.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2012[/tpl] The original South African Boer republics were founded on the principles of the Dutch Reformed Church.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
In 1985, 92% of Afrikaners were members of Reformed Churches. However, by 2013, this figure dropped to only 40%, with actual weekly attendance of Reformed Church services estimated to have dropped to just under 25%.http://www.rapport.co.za/Weekliks/Nuus/Krisis-kom-vir-lee-kerke-20140111
In an online poll conducted by an Afrikaans Free State newspaper during August 2012, 65% of respondents claimed they attend church regularly,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.volksblad.com/Stem |title=Vorige Meningspeilings |publisher=Volksblad.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl] although based on other similar studies[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] in traditionally religious communities, as well as the fact that particularly the older generations of those living the Free State and Northern Cape is probably slightly more conservative than most parts of the country, the true figure is likely to be closer to 40%.
Another online poll conducted in February 2013 by a newspaper revealed that just over 30% of Afrikaners read the Bible at home.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beeld.com/Stem |title=Vorige Meningspeilings |publisher=Beeld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl]
Although social conservatism remain prevalent in some communities, social attitudes have become increasingly liberal since the disestablishment of apartheid in the 90s, and in a 2013 poll nearly 30% of Afrikaners claimed to have "no problem" with homosexuality, while a further 18% said they were not opposed to it.http://www.rapport.co.za/Stem
There are numerous websites and Facebook Pages for Afrikaners who are not religious and many Afrikaners claim to be Atheist or Agnostic.http://forum.skeptic.za.org/afrikaans/afrikaner-wees/?wap2/Afrikanerhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/ateisafrikaans/?fref=ts/Afrikaner_Facebook

===Language===

The Afrikaans language changed over time from the Dutch spoken by the first white settlers at the Cape. From the late 17th century, the form of Dutch spoken at the Cape developed differences, mostly in morphology but also in pronunciation and accent and, to a lesser extent, in syntax and vocabulary, from that of the Netherlands, although the languages are still similar enough to be mutually intelligible. Settlers who arrived speaking German and French soon shifted to using Dutch and later Afrikaans. The process of language change was influenced by the languages spoken by slaves, Khoikhoi and people of mixed descent, as well as by Cape Malay, Zulu, British and Portuguese. While the Dutch of the Netherlands remained the official language, the new dialect, often known as Cape Dutch, African Dutch, "kitchen Dutch", or taal (meaning "language" in Afrikaans) developed into a separate language by the 19th century, with much work done by the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners and other writers such as Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven. In a 1925 act of Parliament, Afrikaans was given equal status with Dutch as one of the two official languages (English being the second) of the Union of South Africa. There was much objection to the attempt to legislate the creation of Afrikaans as a new language.  Marthinus Steyn, a prominent jurist and politician, and others were vocal in their opposition.  Today, Afrikaans is recognised as one of the eleven official languages of the new South Africa, and is the third largest mother tongue spoken in South Africa. In June 2013, the Department of Basic Education included Afrikaans as an African language to be compulsory for all pupils, according to a new policy.

===Literature===

Afrikaners have a long literary tradition, and have produced a number of notable novelists and poets, including Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee, Eugene Marais, Uys Krige, Elisabeth Eybers, Breyten Breytenbach, André Brink, C. J. Langenhoven and Etienne Leroux.

===Arts===

Music is probably the most popular art form among Afrikaners. While the traditional Boeremusiek ("Boer music") and Volkspele ("people games") folk dancing enjoyed popularity in the past, most Afrikaners today favour a variety of international genres and light popular Afrikaans music. American country and western music has enjoyed great popularity and has a strong following among many South Africans.  Some also enjoy a social dance event called a sokkie. The South African rock band Seether has a hidden track on their album Karma and Effect titled Kom Saam Met My ("Come With Me"), sung in Afrikaans. There is also an underground rock music movement and bands like the controversial Fokofpolisiekar have a large following. The television Channel MK (channel) also supports local Afrikaans music and mainly screens videos from the Afrikaans Rock genre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://beta.mnet.co.za/MK/ |title=M-Net — Mk |publisher=Beta.mnet.co.za |date=1 April 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-18[/tpl]

===Sport===

Rugby, cricket, and golf are generally considered to be the most popular sports among Afrikaners. Rugby in particular is considered one of the central pillars of the Afrikaner community. The Springboks won the 1995 and 2007 Rugby World Cups.
Boere-sport also played a very big role in the Afrikaner history. It consisted of a variety of sports like tug of war, three-legged races, jukskei, skilpadloop (tortoise walk) and other games.

===Numismatics===

The world's first ounce-denominated gold coin, the Krugerrand was struck at the South African Mint on the third of July 1967.  The name Krugerrand was derived from Kruger (after President Paul Kruger) and the rand monetary unit of South Africa.
In April 2007, the South African Mint coined a collectors R1 gold coin commemorating the Afrikaner people as part of its cultural series, depicting the Great Trek across the Drakensberg mountains.

==Institutions==

===Cultural===

The Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuurvereniging (ATKV) ("Afrikaans Language and Culture Association") is responsible for promoting the Afrikaans language and culture.
Die Voortrekkers is a youth movement for Afrikaners in South Africa and Namibia with a membership of over 10 000 active members to promote cultural values, maintaining norms and standards as Christians, and being accountable members of public society.Die Voortrekkers se Amptelike Afrikaanse Webtuiste

===Political===

An estimated 82% of Afrikaners supported the Democratic Alliance, the official opposition party, in the 2009 general election,The Afrikaners: Twenty traumatic years PoliticsWeb. 1 March 2010 and this figure is estimated to have increased to over 85% in the 2011 municipal elections.[tpl]cite web|last=Seria |first=Nasreen |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-21/south-african-opposition-party-gains-ground-against-anc-in-municipal-vote.html |title=Democratic Alliance Gains Ground on ANC in South African Local Elections |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12[/tpl] The Democratic Alliance is a Liberal Party and a full member of Liberal International.
Smaller numbers are involved in nationalist or separatist political organisations. The Freedom Front Plus is an Afrikaner ethnic political party in the Republican tradition,[tpl]clarify|date=November 2012[/tpl] which lobbies for minority rights to be granted to all of the South African ethnic minorities. The Freedom Front Plus is also leading the Volkstaat initiative and is closely associated with the small town of Orania.Afrikaner Independence (1): Interview With Freedom Front General-Secretary Col. Piet Uys Global Politician. 24 May 2005 Freedom Front Plus leader Dr Pieter Mulder is currently Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the Cabinet of President Jacob Zuma.
Only approximately 3% of Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans vote for the ruling ANC, which favours the advancements of blacks. Some prominent Afrikaner ANC Cabinet Ministers include the Minister of Science and Technology Derek Hanekom, the Minister of Tourism and former leader of the New National Party Marthinus van Schalkwyk, Deputy Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development Andries Nel, Deputy Minister of Sport and Recreation Gert Oosthuizen and former ANC Spokesman Carl Niehaus.
In an online poll of the Beeld newspaper during November 2012, in which nearly 11 000 Afrikaners participated, 42% described themselves as conservative and 36% as liberal.http://www.beeld.com/Stem
