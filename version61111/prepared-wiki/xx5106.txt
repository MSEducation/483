Jack French Kemp (July 13, 1935[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]May 2, 2009) was an American politician and a collegiate and professional football player. A Republican, he served as Housing Secretary in the administration of President George H. W. Bush from 1989 to 1993, having previously served nine terms as a congressman for Western New York's 31st congressional district from 1971 to 1989. He was the Republican Party's nominee for Vice President in the 1996 election, where he was the running mate of presidential nominee Bob Dole. Kemp had previously contended for the presidential nomination in the 1988 Republican primaries.
Before entering politics, Kemp was a professional quarterback for 13 years. He played briefly in the National Football League (NFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL), but became a star in the American Football League (AFL). He served as captain of both the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills and earned the AFL Most Valuable Player award in 1965 after leading the Bills to a second consecutive championship. He played in the AFL for all 10 years of its existence, appeared in its All-Star game seven times, played in its championship game five times, and set many of the league's career passing records. Kemp also co-founded the AFL Players Association, for which he served five terms as president. During the early part of his football career, he served in the United States Army Reserve.
As an economic conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative opposition to abortion to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As a proponent of both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and the architect of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.
After his days in political office, Kemp remained active as a political advocate and commentator, and served on corporate and nonprofit organization boards. He also authored, co-authored, and edited several books. He promoted American football and advocated for retired professional football players. Kemp was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 by President Barack Obama."President Obama Names Medal of Freedom Recipients", White House Office of the Press Secretary, July 30, 2009

Kemp grew up in the heavily Jewish Wilshire district of West Los Angeles, but his tight-knit middle class family practiced in the Church of Christ, Scientist.  In his youth, sports consumed Kemp, who once chose the forward pass as the subject of a school essay on important inventions, although his mother attempted to broaden his horizons with piano lessons and trips to the Hollywood Bowl.
Kemp attended Melrose Avenue's Fairfax High School, which was, at the time, known both for its high concentration of Jewish students and concentration of celebrities' children.  Over 95% of Kemp's classmates were Jewish, and he later became a supporter of Jewish causes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/2740.html|title=114th Commencement Speaker and Honorary Degree Recipient Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa|accessdate=2008-04-01|date=1997-05-05|publisher=University of Southern California|work=USC News|author=Payton, Melissa[/tpl]  His classmates included Herb Alpert, Larry Sherry, and Judith A.

In his spare time, he became a rigorous reader, preferring history and philosophy books.

===College===

After graduating from high school in 1953,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.ak.us/96oep/kemp.htm|title=U.S. Vice President: Jack Kemp, Republican|accessdate=2008-05-01|year=1996|publisher=Alaska Division of Elections |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602222229/http://www.elections.state.ak.us/96oep/kemp.htm |archivedate = June 2, 2008[/tpl] he attended Occidental College, a founding member of the NCAA Division III Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesciac.org/information/about/index|title=About the SCIAC|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference[/tpl] Kemp selected Occidental because its football team used professional formations and plays, which he hoped would help him to become a professional quarterback. At [tpl]convert|5|ft|10|in|cm[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|175|lb|kg|0[/tpl], he considered himself too small to play for the USC Trojans or UCLA Bruins, the major Southern California college football programs.
At Occidental, Kemp was a record-setting javelin hurler and played several positions on the football team: quarterback, defensive back, place kicker, and punter. Although he was near-sighted, Kemp was tenacious on the field.  During his years as starting quarterback the team posted 6–2 and 3–6 records. Kemp was named a Little All-America player one year in which he threw for over 1,100 yards.  That year, he led the nation's small colleges in passing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/BaltimoreSun/DeathNotices.asp?Page=Lifestory&PersonID=126845793|title=Jack Kemp|accessdate=2009-05-04|work=Baltimore Sun[/tpl] He and close friend Jim Mora, who later became an NFL head coach, were members of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEMP+SUCCESS+BEGAN+AT+OXY-a083966485|title=Kemp Success Began At Oxy|accessdate=2008-03-31|date=1996-09-08|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|work=Los Angeles Daily News|author=Martinez, Michael[/tpl] Another teammate in college was Ron Botchan,Occidental Players/Alumni who was a NFL umpire for years (record five Super Bowls).Sam Farmer, "Football Umpires are in the Line of Fire", Los Angeles Times, November 11, 2008, revised December 8, 2008 Kemp declined to become involved in student government.  After graduating from Occidental with a degree in physical education, he pursued postgraduate studies in economics at Long Beach State University and California Western University, and served in the military from 1958 to 1962.

==Marriage and family==

Kemp graduated from Occidental in 1957 and married Joanne Main, his college sweetheart, after she graduated from Occidental in 1958. Main had grown up in Fillmore, California, and attended Fillmore High School in Ventura County.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEMP'S+WIFE+PREPARED+FOR+ROLE%2c+MOM+SAYS.(NEWS)-a083959339|title=Kemp's Wife Prepared For Role, Mom Says|accessdate=2008-03-31|date=1996-08-11|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|work=Los Angeles Daily News|author=Gonzalez, Virginia[/tpl]  Her father was a teacher and football coach in the Fillmore Unified School District before becoming vice principal and eventually superintendent of the district.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/election/august96/joanne_kemp_8-15.html|title=Second Lady Hopeful|accessdate=2008-09-03|date=1996-08-15|publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions|author=Farnsworth, Elizabeth[/tpl] Kemp's Biblical Literature professor, Keith Beebe, presided over the wedding, after which Kemp converted to his wife's Presbyterian faith.

In 1976, C. Evert Koop wrote The Right to Live, The Right to Die, setting down his own concerns about abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia.http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/QQ/p-nid/84 The C. Everett Koop Papers  Koop also took some time off from his surgical practice to make a series of films with Christian apologists Frank Schaeffer and his father Francis Schaeffer in 1978, entitled Whatever Happened to the Human Race? based on the book of the same title that had been previously written by the elder Schaeffer. Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining "...access to everyone in the Republican Party".Schaeffer, Frank. Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found The Religious Right,and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back. Carrol & Graf Publishers, 2007, pp. 284-285.

==Football career==

After being drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 17th round of the 1957 NFL Draft, Kemp was cut from the team before the 1957 NFL season began. He spent 1957 with the Pittsburgh Steelers and 1958 on the taxi squads of the San Francisco 49ers and New York Giants.  The 1958 New York Giants played in that year's NFL Championship Game, known as the "Greatest Game Ever Played" and the first overtime NFL playoff game,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.jsp?release_id=1805|title=Greatest game ever played|accessdate=2008-12-26|publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2794025|title=What if the Colts-Giants game had not been such a classic?|accessdate=2008-12-26|date=2007-02-01|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|author=Mosse, David[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EEDD123FF934A15752C0A9679C8B63|title= A Giant in '58|accessdate=2008-03-06|date=2001-01-27|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Kemp, Jack[/tpl] but, as a third-string quarterback member of the taxi squad, Kemp did not take the field.
After his time in the NFL, Kemp served a year as a private in the United States Army Reserve. During his service, he played one game for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, which made him ineligible for the NFL in 1959.  According to his older brother Tom, his parents drove him from California to Calgary, Alberta only to see him cut.  By this time Kemp had been cut from five professional teams (Lions, Steelers, Giants, 49ers, and Stampeders) and his family encouraged him to get on with his life.
On February 9 and February 11, 1960, the newly formed AFL agreed to "no tampering" policies with the NFL and CFL respectively, protecting each league's players. Players like Kemp, with modest NFL experience, were often signed by the AFL at the time.Gruver, p. 44. Kemp signed as a free agent with the AFL's Los Angeles Chargers.

===Sid Gillman era (1960–1962)===

In 1960, Kemp led the Chargers to a Western Division Championship with a 10–4 record.Gruver, p. 55.  He finished second in the league to Frank Tripucka in passing attempts, completions, and yards (making him and Tripucka the league's first 3,000-yard passers), led the AFL in yards per completion and times sacked, and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1960_AFL/leaders.htm|title=1960 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl]  Under Kemp, the Chargers' offense averaged 46 points over its last four games and scored more than 41 points in five of its last nine games.Gruver, p. 56.  In the 1960 AFL Championship Game, he led the team to field goals on its first two possessions, but after the Houston Oilers posted a touchdown in the second quarter for a 7–6 lead, the Chargers never recovered.Gruver, pp. 58–59.
In 1961, San Diego Union editor Jack Murphy convinced Barron Hilton to move the Chargers from Los Angeles to San Diego.Gruver, p. 61.  Kemp led the relocated team to a 12–2 record and a repeat Western Division Championship.Gruver, p. 71.  He again finished second in passing yards (this time to George Blanda).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1961_AFL/leaders.htm|title=1961 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl]  The Chargers earned an AFL Championship Game rematch against the Oilers.  However, this time the Chargers were unable to score until a fourth-quarter field goal in a 10–3 loss.Gruver, p. 266.
The Berlin Wall was erected in August 1961. On October 15, 1961, President John F. Kennedy activated Kemp's San Diego-based 977th Transportation Company reserves unit for duty in response. In September, the right-handed Kemp had injured his left shoulder while playing football. Medical examiners found swelling and muscle spasms and described his voluntary range of motion at 80%.  In a decision that was reviewed and upheld by the Surgeon General of the United States Army, Army doctors found him as unfit for active duty. That year, he led the Chargers to a division title, passing for 2,686 yards and 15 touchdowns.  Years later, Kemp's 1961 Chargers roommate, Ron Mix, recalled that Kemp needed "ten or so" shots of painkillers before each game and commented that "it sounds weird, but he could play football and not be fit to serve in the Army."[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DB1630F93BA2575BC0A960958260|title= Army Allowed Kemp to Skip Army Call-Up For an Injury|accessdate=2008-03-03|date=1996-08-18|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Frantz, Douglas[/tpl]
In 1962, Kemp broke his middle finger two games into the season and was unable to play. He persuaded his doctors to set his broken finger around a football, so that his grip would not be affected once the finger healed. Chargers coach Sid Gillman put Kemp on waivers to try to "hide" him.Gruver, pp. 82–83.  Buffalo Bills coach Lou Saban noticed that Kemp was available and claimed him for a $100 waiver fee on September 25, 1962,Maiorana (1994), p. 86. in what sportswriter Randy Schultz has called one of the biggest bargains in professional football history.[tpl]cite book|title=Legends of the Buffalo Bills|author=Schultz, Randy|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2003|isbn=1-58261-687-6[/tpl]  The Dallas Texans and Denver Broncos also attempted to claim Kemp, but he was awarded to Buffalo by AFL commissioner Joe Foss.Gruver, p. 83.

===Lou Saban era (1962–1965)===

According to Billy Shaw, Kemp's acquisition solved the Bills' quarterback problem, but Kemp was not excited about coming to Buffalo. According to Van Miller, "Jack's a skier, and he wanted to go to Denver and play for the Broncos. He hated the thought of coming to Buffalo."[tpl]cite book|title=The American Football League: A Year-by-Year History, 1960-1969|author=Gruver, Ed|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=1997[/tpl]  In Buffalo, he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by Henry Thoreau, which led to chidings from Saban.
Injuries, including the broken finger, kept Kemp from playing for most of 1962. That season, Kemp received a military draft notice for service in the Vietnam War but was granted a draft waiver because of a knee problem. The injuries healed, and Kemp debuted for Buffalo on November 18, 1962, by directing the only touchdown drive in a 10–6 win over the Oakland Raiders.  He played only four games for Buffalo in 1962, but made the AFL All-Star team.  The Bills won three of their last four games to finish 7–6–1.Maiorana (1994), p. 93–94.
On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica. In 1963, a four-season starting quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica left for the Raiders. Lamonica felt he "... learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking.  And I truly believe that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills." In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record.Maiorana (1994), p. 104.  Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1963_AFL/leaders.htm|title=1963 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl]  The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28, 1963, at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in [tpl]convert|10|°F|°C|sigfig=2|lk=on[/tpl] weather.  During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.Gruver, p. 115.
Kemp was said to be the "clubhouse lawyer" for the Bills because of his role in mediating conflicts.  In 1964, he managed personalities such as Gilchrist, who walked off the field when plays were not being called for him, and Saban, who he kept from cutting Gilchrist the following week.  He also managed the politics of his quarterback battle with Lamonica, who engineered four winning touchdown drives in the Bills' first seven games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876407,00.html|title=Any Time, Any Place|accessdate=2008-03-21|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1964-11-06[/tpl]  Kemp was the first and only Professional Football player to pass for three touchdowns in the first quarter of a season-opening game, against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 1964 AFL season, until the record was tied but not broken, 47 years later in 2011 by Aaron Rodgers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2011/09/aaron_rodgers_got_off_to_sizzl.html|title=Aaron Rodgers got off to sizzling start for Green Bay Packers|accessdate=2011-09-11|date=2011-09-09|publisher=Nola.com|work=The Times-Picayune|author=Reeves, Jeremy[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sport360.com/article/nfl-super-start-green-bay|title=NFL: SUPER START FOR GREEN BAY|accessdate=2011-09-11|date=2011-09-10|publisher=Sport360.com[/tpl]  The 1964 team won its first nine games and went 12–2 for the regular season, winning the Eastern Division with a final game victory over the Patriots at Fenway Park. Kemp led the league in yards per attempt and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead, which was shared by Gilchrist and Sid Blanks. In the 1964 AFL Championship Game, he scored the final touchdown with just over nine minutes left in a 20–7 victory.Maiorana (1994), p. 116.
According to Lamonica, the 1965 team had a new emphasis: "In '64 we had depended a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us. . .But that all changed in '65.  The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So we went to a pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before.  We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And I really think it brought out the best in Jack that year."  In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record.Maiorana (1994), p. 125.  Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1965_AFL/leaders.htm|title=1965 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl]  In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834954,00.html|title=The Game Nobody Saw|accessdate=2008-03-21|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1966-01-07[/tpl]  Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1964_AFL/leaders.htm|title=1964 AFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/1965.htm|title=1965 Buffalo Bills|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-31[/tpl]  Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.Maiorana (1994), p. 126.Gruver, p. 151.

===Joe Collier and John Rauch eras (1966–1969)===

Following the championship game, Saban resigned to coach the Maryland Terrapins and defensive coordinator Joe Collier was promoted to head coach for the 1966 AFL season.Maiorana (1994), p. 127.  That year, Kemp led the Bills to their third consecutive division title with a 9–4–1 record.  However, in the 1966 AFL Championship Game, which was played for the right to represent the AFL in Super Bowl I, the Bills lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 31–7.Maiorana (1994), pp. 136–37.  Kemp was named an AFL All-Star for the sixth consecutive year.[tpl]cref|a[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KempJa00.htm|title=Jack Kemp|accessdate=2008-03-31|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com[/tpl] The 1967 Bills endured a 4–10 1967 AFL season, in which Kemp was not named to the All-Star game for the first time in his AFL career.Maiorana (1994), p. 147.
On August 23, 1968, the Bills suffered a blowout preseason loss to the Houston Oilers.  On August 26, Collier put the Bills through a 40-play scrimmage. During the scrimmage, Ron McDole fell on Kemp's right knee and injured it, forcing Kemp to sit out the entire 1968 AFL season.Maiorana (1994), p. 148.  The Bills went 1–12–1 without Kemp.Maiorana (1994), p. 157.
Despite Kemp's return from injury and the arrival of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only compiled a 4–10 record during the 1969 AFL season under new coach John Rauch.Maiorana (1994), pp. 158–66.  Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress.  After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics.Maiorana (2000), p. 174.  Kemp said, "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ... I figured that if I lost I could always come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress."

==Political career==

Kemp's political career began long before his 1970 campaign. In 1960 and 1961, Kemp was an editorial assistant to San Diego Union editor and future Richard Nixon aide Herb Klein. Subsequently, Kemp became a volunteer in both Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign and Ronald Reagan's successful 1966 California gubernatorial campaign. In the 1967 football off-season, Kemp worked on Reagan's staff in Sacramento. In 1969 he was special assistant to the Republican National Committee chairman.
Kemp was a voracious reader, and his political beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Ayn Rand's libertarian novels, such as The Fountainhead, and Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty.  He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do." Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that "the huddle is colorblind."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/971208/archive_008431.htm|title=Sweating to the Oldies: Toiling together will do as much for race relations as talking together |accessdate=2008-04-13|date=1997-11-30|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=U.S. News & World Report|author=Waldman, Steven[/tpl]

===Congress (1971–1989)===

As a self-described "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp represented a part of the suburban Buffalo region that is known as the Southtowns and that traditionally voted Democratic for the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/us/man-in-the-news-theorist-with-a-heart-jack-french-kemp.html|title=Man in the News; Theorist With a Heart; Jack French Kemp|accessdate=2009-04-08|date=1988-12-20|work=The New York Times|author=May, Clifford D.[/tpl] He is as fondly remembered for his good hair and handsome looks as for his athletic prowess and political savvy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1704390,00.html|title=Can the Economy Save Mitt Romney?|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=2008-01-17|author=Duffy, Michael; Tumulty, Karen[/tpl] and he is described as having the charisma of the earlier J.F.K.

The Erie County, New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after incumbent congressman Richard D. McCarthy decided to run for the United States Senate.  During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and The New York Times described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense.  Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pont—discussed in Time. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon's war policies in order to firm up Kemp's support from military hawks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904463-2,00.html|title=Newcomers in the House|accessdate=2008-03-21|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1970-11-16[/tpl]
Kemp championed several Chicago school and supply-side economics issues: economic growth, free markets, free trade, tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income.  He was a long-time proponent of the flat tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,5606,00.html|title=The New 12 Steps to Recovery|accessdate=2008-03-04|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1996-01-17[/tpl]  He also defended the use of anti-Communist contra forces in Central America,[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D9133EF93AA3575AC0A961948260|title=Kemp, in Honduras, Assails Latin Peace Plan|accessdate=2009-01-10|date=1987-09-09|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=May, Clifford[/tpl] supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, and was the first lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones,  which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,7154,00.html|title=Babbitt: Think Small|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1996-08-26[/tpl]  During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat: he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants.  The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy.  He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs.  For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, David Gergen heralded him as a "courageous voice in the wilderness."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/960909/archive_034577.htm|title=A Bridge to Nowhere|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=1996-09-01|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=U.S. News & World Report|author=Gergen, David[/tpl] Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools.

Kemp had his first encounter with supply-side economics in 1967, when The Wall Street Journal's Jude Wanniski interviewed him at his Congressional office.  Kemp questioned Wanniski all day (until midnight, at Kemp's Bethesda, Maryland home) and was eventually converted to University of Southern California professor Arthur Laffer's supply-side discipline.  Thereafter, Kemp espoused supply-side economics freely, and in 1978 he and William V. Roth, Jr. proposed tax-cutting legislation. Kemp has been credited as responsible for supply-side economics' inclusion in President Reagan's economic plan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/books/review/Lowenstein-t.html|title=Deep Voodoo|accessdate=2008-03-01|date=2007-09-23|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Lowenstein, Roger[/tpl] although at the time of Robert Mundell's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to Mundell, Laffer, Robert Bartley, and Wanniski.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/991025/archive_002169.htm|title=Supply-Side Godfather: The influential and controversial Robert Mundell wins the Nobel in economics|accessdate=2008-04-13|date=1999-10-17|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=U.S. News & World Report|author=Egan, Jack[/tpl]  In 1979, Kemp wrote An American Renaissance (ISBN 0-06-012283-8), to deliver his message that "A rising tide lifts all boats."[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DD1139F934A35756C0A96F948260|title= Jack Kemp Faces Reality|accessdate=2008-03-08|date=1989-05-09|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Traub, James[/tpl]  Although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to Reagan, they were initiated by Kemp and Roth through their 1981 Kemp–Roth Tax Cut legislation.

Despite the levity of the speech, it has garnered significant backlash.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=FAITH-FAITH-07-12-06|title=Jack Kemp is wrong; soccer is very democratic|accessdate=2008-03-27|date=2006-07-12|publisher= Scripps Howard News Service |author=Waters, David[/tpl]  However, he continues to insist that soccer's main problem is "it doesn't have a quarterback".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx?UrlTitle=what_i_really_think_about_soccer&ns=JackKemp&dt=06/19/2006&page=full&comments=true|title=What I really think about soccer|accessdate=2008-02-24|date=2006-06-19|author=Kemp, Jack|publisher=Salem Web Network|work=Townhall.com[/tpl] Kemp notes that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claims to have since 'changed' his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with long time soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a "boring game."

===Presidential bid (1988)===

In 1988, if Kemp had won his campaign for the United States Presidency, it would have made him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963738,00.html|title=The High Jumper from St. Louis Missouri|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-03-09|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Demott, John S.[/tpl]  When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1582843,00.html|title=American Notes|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1986-12-15|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time[/tpl]  From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963997,00.html|title=Campaign Portrait|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-04-13|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Stanley, Alessandra[/tpl]  Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963279,00.html|title=Rushing to An Early Kickoff|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-01-19|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Barrett, Laurence I.|authorlink=Laurence I.

Although Kemp tried to appeal to the conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values.  To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/policamp/demo88.htm|title=The Democrats in '88|publisher=Atlantic Online|work=Atlantic Monthly|author=Schneider, William |accessdate=2008-04-15|date=April 1987 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040804194157/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/policamp/demo88.htm |archivedate = August 4, 2004[/tpl]  However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/127497|title=The Right's War On Poverty: Conservatives Offer New Solutions To Old Problems|accessdate=2008-04-15|date=1990-06-04|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=Newsweek|publisher=Clift, Eleanor[/tpl]
After the May 1987 Gary Hart–Donna Rice scandal, a questionnaire by The New York Times requested things such as psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as "beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964724,00.html|title=Full Disclosure, Semi-Outrage|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-06-22|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Zuckerman, Laurence[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964431,00.html|title=Sounds of the Righteous Brothers|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-05-25|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Barrett, Laurence I.[/tpl]  His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York.  Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemp's campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red,  which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965008,00.html|title=But Mike's Raking In Money|accessdate=2008-03-16|date=1987-07-20|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Barrett, Laurence I.[/tpl] To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State George Shultz. To position himself as Reagan's successor, Kemp called for Shultz's resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963662,00.html|title=Tacking Further to the Right|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=1987-03-02|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|author=Barrett, Laurence I.[/tpl] In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan - a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/world/kemp-in-honduras-assails-latin-peace-plan.html|title=Kemp, in Honduras, Assails Latin Peace Plan|accessdate=2011-10-11|date=1987-09-09|publisher=New York Times Inc.|work=New York Times|author=May, Clifford[/tpl]
Despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects, Kemp's primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts. As part of his fiscal policy, he opposed a Social Security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966610,00.html|title=Yes, There Are Issues|accessdate=2008-03-11|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1988-08-08|author=Shapiro, Walter[/tpl]  Some viewed Kemp's supply-side stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit.

With aspirations of support from right-wing voters, all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same "sabre-rattling" stand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966229,00.html|title=An Offer They Can Refuse|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1987-12-14|author=Griffith, Thomas[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965949,00.html|title=Yapping From The Right|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1987-11-09|author=Shapiro, Walter[/tpl]  By early 1988, the moderates (Bush and Dole) were clearly the front-runners and Kemp was battling with Pat Robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D7173BF935A25751C0A96E948260|title= Three Candidates in 2 Parties Bracing for the Battle of Their Political Lives; Jack F.

A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39 delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign.  After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968078,00.html|title=The Great G.O.P.

===Cabinet (1989–1993)===

As a so-called "bleeding-heart conservative", Kemp was a logical choice for Bush as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956576,00.html|title=A Clean Bill of Health|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1988-12-26|author=Lamar, Jacob V.[/tpl] whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDD123CF932A15751C1A96E948260|title= New Supply Side for Jack Kemp|accessdate=2008-03-10|date=1988-12-21|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times[/tpl]  However, the scandals of Reagan's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start, and Kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives: enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership.  The goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenant-owned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975501,00.html|title=The Political Interest|accessdate=2008-03-05|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1992-05-11|author=Kramer, Michael[/tpl]  Although Kemp did not affect much policy as HUD's director, he cleaned up HUD's reputation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4D71430F933A1575BC0A960958260|title=Kemp's Legacy as Housing Secretary: One of Ideas, Not Accomplishments|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=1996-08-20|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Holmes, Steven A.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958199,00.html|title=Jack Be Nimble, Jack Be Quick|accessdate=2008-03-06|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1989-07-24|author=Magnuson, Ed[/tpl]  and developed a plan to salvage the troubled Federal Housing Administration.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970380,00.html|title=Business Notes Mortgage Insurance|accessdate=2008-03-06|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1990-06-18[/tpl]  He halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957690,00.html|title=American Notes Housing|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1989-05-22[/tpl] which enabled him to collaborate with Director of the National Drug Control Policy Bill Bennett.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956800,00.html|title=Back in the Bully Pulpit|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1989-01-23|author=Sidey, Hugh[/tpl]  He supported "Operation Clean Sweep" and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957564,00.html|title=Evicting The Drug Dealers|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1989-05-01|author=Prudhomme, Alex[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973185,00.html|title=Firearms: Chicago's Uphill Battle|accessdate=2008-03-06|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1991-06-17|author=Prudhomme, Alex[/tpl]
Although Kemp coaxed Bush to support a $4 billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361 million to the plan.  In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDC1E39F93BA15751C0A965958260|title= How Jack Kemp Lost the War on Poverty|accessdate=2008-03-02|date=1993-02-28|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Deparle, Jason[/tpl] HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help first-time home buyers.  Sununu opposed it at first as did most of the Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force.  However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project.  Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber.  The budget left him with $256 million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles.  Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.

Kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the Cabinet.

===Post-HUD years (1993–1996)===

Kemp gave public speeches for $35,000 apiece between his time as Housing Secretary and his Vice Presidential nomination. By 1994, Kemp had embarked on 241 fund-raising dinners to raise $35 million for a 1996 Presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts.  After stepping down from his $189,000 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development job, Kemp personally earned $6.9 million in the next three years, primarily for speaking on behalf of local Republican candidates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984990,00.html|title=In From the Cold|accessdate=2008-03-02|publisher=Time Inc.|work=Time|date=1996-08-19|author=Kramer, Michael[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE2D6163BF935A3575AC0A960958260|title=Kemp Earned $6.9 Million, Mostly as Speaker, Since '92|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=1996-09-06|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Fritsch, Jane[/tpl]  During the Super Bowl XXVIII festivities, Kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/whispers/articles/940207/archive_012361.htm|title=Back to Strength; Thinking the Unthinkable; Kemp Followers; The Wrong Fields; Past Prime Time; Backing Up Bill: Saddam Hussein's military is almost back to prewar potency; Rostenkowski could lose March 15 primary, insiders say; Clinton's speech insurance: Seven floppy disks, two paper copies |accessdate=2008-04-14|date=1994-01-30|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=U.S. News & World Report|author=Fenyvesi, Charles[/tpl]

Kemp had a reputation as the highest-profile progressive Republican.

Several of Dole's other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennett's Empower America, which had Jeane Kirkpatrick, Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatrick's tough foreign policy, Bennett's "right conduct" and even Alexander's school choice interest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/960826/archive_034438.htm|title=A Conservatism of the Head|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=1996-08-18|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=U.S. News & World Report|author=Barone, Michael[/tpl]

Kennedy's tax cuts, while Kemp was an outspoken supply-sider. In the early 1980s, according to David Stockman, Kemp persuaded Reagan to make a 30% across-the-board tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature. Once Reagan was elected, Dole was the Senate Finance Committee chairman who Kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way. Dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan.  The big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after Dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms.  Kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an op-ed piece in The New York Times, which enraged Dole. Reagan supported the reforms at Dole's request, causing Kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act, which eventually passed in 1982.  At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Kemp, along with allies such as Gingrich and Lott, added a plank to the party platform that put President Reagan on record as ruling out tax increases. Gingrich called this action "Dole proofing" the platform, and the plank passed over Dole's opposition. Then, in 1985, Dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient Pete Wilson casting the tying vote and Vice President Bush casting the deciding vote. In meetings with the president that excluded Dole, Kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial Social Security cutbacks. This is said to have been Dole's most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the Republican loss of control of the Senate. During the 1988 presidential election, the two antagonized each other.  After Bush won and Kemp left Congress for the Cabinet, the two did not really cross paths again until 1996, when Kemp endorsed Dole's opponent Forbes on the eve of the New York Primary in March.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE4DE103CF93AA1575AC0A960958260|title= Dole, in Choosing Kemp, Buried A Bitter Past Rooted in Doctrine|accessdate=2008-03-02|date=1996-09-29|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Kolbert, Elizabeth[/tpl]

===Legacy===

His legacy includes the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut of the 1980s, also known as the first of two "Reagan tax cuts."  These served as the foundation of supply-side economics, known as Reaganomics.  Many Republicans have endorsed this Laffer Curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits. Although George H. W. Bush called this philosophy voodoo economics, George W. Bush and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snow, were believers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E6D7163EF93BA25756C0A9659C8B63|title= Economic View; Name That Tune About Tax Cuts|accessdate=2008-03-17|date=2003-05-18|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|author=Rosenbaum, David E.[/tpl]  Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/gephardt.htm|title=A Democrat Who Admits It|accessdate=2008-04-15|date=November 1997|author=Fallows, James|publisher=The Atlantic.com|work=Atlantic Monthly[/tpl]
