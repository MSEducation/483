East Langton railway station was opened by the Midland Railway on what is now the Midland Main Line in 1857, initially calling it simply Langton.
Plans had been made earlier in 1847 for a line from Leicester to Bedford, but had lapsed.  However the Midland, running to Rugby at that time and dependent on the LNWR for its path into London, was looking for an alternative. It revived its plans for Bedford to go forward to Hitchin to join the Great Northern Railway 
The station had two platforms with neat Midland pattern timber buildings. The booking office was on the southbound
up line, with a small waiting-room on the down.  There was no footbridge and the line was crossed by a barrow crossing at the northern end.  To the north were long sidings on either side of the running lines capable of handling trains of 30 to 41 wagons - typical for Victorian trains of the period.  The signal box was next to these on the down side.  Southbound LNWR trains also used the line on their way to a junction at Market Harborough and would signal their presence to the box by means of three whistles.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations.

It was renamed East Langton in 1891 though it also served West Langton, Church Langton, Thorpe Langton and Tur Langton.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books
At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway.
It closed in 1968. Although the site can be seen just north of where the line crosses the B6047 road, the platforms and station buildings have disappeared, and the site may disappear with possible planned future quadrupling of the line.
