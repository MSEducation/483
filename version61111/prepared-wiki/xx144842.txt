[[Mount Rubidoux Manor]]

CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Riverside, California

The Mount Rubidoux Manor is a 16-story residential tower located in downtown Riverside, California. Built in 1971, the tower is used as senior housing by American Baptist Homes of the West (ABHOW). First Baptist Church of Riverside, one of the oldest churches in the city, raised the money to build the tower.
The building has more stories than any other building in Riverside, but the nearby 14-story Riverside County Administration Building is slightly taller based on overall height.
