==Early life==

Day-Lewis was born in London, the son of poet Cecil Day-Lewis and English actress Jill Balcon. His father, who was of Anglo-Irish background, lived in England from the age of two and later became the United Kingdom's Poet Laureate. His mother was Jewish, and his maternal grandparents' families had emigrated to England from Latvia and Poland.[tpl]Cite book|last=Jackson|first=Laura|title=Daniel Day-Lewis: the biography|publisher=Blake|year=2005|page=3|url=|isbn=1-85782-557-8|quote=Michael Balcon's family were Latvian refugees from Riga who had come to England around the turn of the 20th century.

 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] His maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, an important figure in the history of British cinema, was the head of Ealing Studios.[tpl]cite news |last=Pearlman |first=Cindy |title=Day-Lewis isn't suffering: 'It's a joy'|work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=30 December 2007|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/pearlman/718435,SHO-Sunday-lewis30.article |accessdate=9 January 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] Two years after his birth, the family moved to Croom's Hill, Greenwich, south-east London, where Day-Lewis grew up along with his older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis, who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef.Segal, David. "Daniel Day-Lewis, Behaving Totally In Character". The Washington Post, 31 March 2005
Living in Greenwich, Day-Lewis found himself among tough South London children, and, being of part Jewish ancestry and "posh", he was often bullied.Corliss, Richard and Carrie Ross Welch. "Dashing Daniel" Time, European Edition, 21 March 1994 He mastered the local accent and mannerisms and credits that with being his first convincing performances. Later in life, he was known to speak of himself as very much a disorderly character in his younger years, often in trouble for shoplifting and other petty crimes.Jenkins, Garry. Daniel Day-Lewis: The Fires Within. St. Martin's Press, 1994, ASIN B000R9II4OWills, Dominic, "Daniel Day-Lewis Biography". 'Tiscali UK'' Retrieved 25 February 2006
In 1968, Day-Lewis' parents, finding his behaviour to be too wild, sent him to the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent as a boarder. Though he detested the school, he was introduced to his three most prominent interests: woodworking, acting, and fishing. His disdain for the school grew, and after two years at Sevenoaks, he was transferred to another independent school, Bedales in Petersfield, Hampshire,[tpl]cite web|title=The Tatler List|url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list|publisher=Tatler[/tpl] which his sister attended, and which had a more relaxed and creative ethos. The transfer led to his film debut at the age of 14 in Sunday Bloody Sunday in which he played a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as "heaven", for getting paid £2 to vandalise expensive cars parked outside his local church.
For a few weeks in 1972, he and his parents and sister lived at Lemmons, the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard. Cecil Day-Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use to rest and recuperate. Cecil died there in May that year.Ian Sansom, "Great dynasties of the world: The Day-Lewises", The Guardian, 3 April 2010.
Leaving Bedales in 1975, Day-Lewis's unruly attitude had faded and he needed to make a career choice. Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London, he applied for a five-year apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker, but was rejected due to lack of experience. He was then accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years, eventually performing at the Bristol Old Vic itself. At one point he played understudy to Pete Postlethwaite, with whom he would later co-star in In the Name of the Father.FILM; Pete Postlethwaite Turns a Prison Stint Into Oscar Material The New York Times.

==Career==

===1980s===

During the early '80s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I[tpl]IMDb title|0084097|title=How Many Miles to Babylon?[/tpl] officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven years after his film debut, Day-Lewis continued his film career with a small part in Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a street thug who bullies the title character, only to be immediately chastised by his high-strung mother. In late 1982 he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
In 1985, Day-Lewis played a gay man in an interracial relationship in the film My Beautiful Laundrette, set in 1980s London during the period when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. Day-Lewis gained further public notice with A Room with a View (1985). Set in the Edwardian period of turn-of-the-twentieth-century England, he portrayed an entirely different character: Cecil Vyse, the proper upper class fiancé of the main character (played by Helena Bonham Carter).[tpl]cite web |title=Daniel Day-Lewis |url=http://theoscarsite.com/whoswho7/daylewis_d.htm |publisher=The Oscar Site |accessdate=6 January 2009[/tpl] In 1987, Day-Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman's adaptation of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, co-starring Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche, where he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman. During the eight-month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule. During this period, Day-Lewis and other young British actors of the time such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth and Bruce Payne, were dubbed the 'Brit Pack',Stern, Marlow. "Gary Oldman Talks 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,' 'Batman' Retirement". The Daily Beast. 8 December 2011. Retrieved 10 December 2013. a nickname based on the Brat Pack of the US.
Day-Lewis threw his personal version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor. He prepared for his role by frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, some of whom had no speech.[tpl]cite book |title= The Good Samaritans – Memoir of a Biographer |author= Anthony J. Jordan |publisher= Westport Books |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-9524447-5-6 |page=40[/tpl] During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.An Inspirational Journey: The Making of My Left Foot DVD, Miramax Films, 2005
Day-Lewis returned to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre, in Hamlet at the National Theatre, London, but collapsed in the middle of a scene where the ghost of Hamlet's father first appears to his son. He began sobbing uncontrollably and refused to go back on stage; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word-and-action-perfect and received a standing ovation. Ian Charleson then formally replaced Day-Lewis for the rest of the run, except that ill-health forced Northam to stand in again many times. Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion, Day-Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father."Daniel Day-Lewis Q&A"[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] TimeOut.com, 20 March 2006[tpl]cite episode |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0779518/ |title=Parkinson |airdate=25 March 2006 |season=35[/tpl] He has not appeared on stage since. The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame.[tpl]cite news |title=Daniel Day-Lewis |author=Jessica Winter |newspaper=The Observer Magazine |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl]

===1990s===

In 1992, three years after his Oscar win, The Last of the Mohicans was released. Day-Lewis's character research for this film was well-publicized; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting and fishing. Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills and learned how to make canoes.[tpl]cite news |title=The madness of Daniel Day-Lewis – a unique Method that has led to a deserved third Oscar |newspaper=The Independent |last=Macnab |first=Geoffrey |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-madness-of-daniel-daylewis--a-unique-method-that-has-led-to-a-deserved-third-oscar-8510704.html |accessdate=September 2, 2013 |date=25 February 2013[/tpl] He even carried a long rifle at all times during filming in order to remain in character and learned how to skin animals.[tpl]cite web |title=Daniel Day-Lewis |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/45745%7C183579/Daniel-Day-Lewis/ |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl]
He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on In the Name of the Father, in which he played Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four who were wrongfully convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA. He lost a substantial amount of weight for the part, kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule, and spent stretches of time in a prison cell. He also insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him. The film earned him his second Academy Award nomination, his third BAFTA nomination, and his second Golden Globe nomination.
Day-Lewis returned in 1993, playing Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese's adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel The Age of Innocence, opposite Winona Ryder and Michelle Pfeiffer. To prepare for the film, set in America's Gilded Age, he wore 1870s-period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months, including top hat, cane and cape in cold weather.[tpl]cite web |title=Daniel Day-Lewis |url=http://www.helloonline.com/profiles/daniel-day-lewis/ |work=Hello! |accessdate=7 January 2010[/tpl]

Following The Boxer, Day-Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into "semi-retirement" and returning to his old passion of woodworking. He moved to Florence, Italy, where he became intrigued by the craft of shoemaking, eventually apprenticing as a shoemaker. For a time his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known.Biography The New York Times, Retrieved 27 February 2006 Day-Lewis has declined to discuss this period of his life, stating that "it was a period of my life that I had a right to, without any intervention of that kind."

===2000s===

After a five-year absence from filming, Day-Lewis returned to act in the multiple Academy Award-nominated film Gangs of New York (2002), directed by Scorsese and produced by Harvey Weinstein. In his role as the villain gang leader William "Bill the Butcher" Cutting, he starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Bill's young protégé. He began his lengthy, self-disciplined process by taking lessons as an apprentice butcher, and while filming, he was never out of character between takes (including keeping his character's New York accent). At one point during filming, having been diagnosed with pneumonia, he refused to wear a warmer coat or to take treatment because it was not in keeping with the period; however, he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment.[tpl]cite web |title=Daniel Day-Lewis aims for perfection |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579473/Daniel-Day-Lewis-aims-for-perfection.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 February 2008|accessdate=1 January 2010[/tpl] His performance in Gangs of New York earned him his third Academy Award nomination and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.
