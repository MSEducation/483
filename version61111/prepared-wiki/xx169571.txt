==Music video==

The music video was shot by Norwegian director Ray Kay around the week of July 17, 2007. Jagged Edge members looked for girl video dancers with acting ability (a big plus for "Soprano's" style narrative). The video premiered on 106 & Park on August 17.
The video premiered on 106 & Park as the New Joint of the Day on August 15, 2007. Ashanti's verse was taken out of the song, and replaced with a snippet clip of "Whole Town Laughing."
Recently[tpl]When|date=June 2008[/tpl] on HOT 97 in New York, Jagged Edge reportedly said Ashanti was not featured in the music video due to a conflict disagreement with Irv Gotti.
