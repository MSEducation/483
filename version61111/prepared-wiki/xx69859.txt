Mother Ruby Muhammad (March 20, 1907 â€“ March 2, 2011) was an African American religious figure known as the "Mother of the Nation of Islam." She was born in Sandersville, Georgia and grew up in Americus. No birth certificate exists to confirm her age, and it has been reported with significant disparity, although she claimed in newspaper interviews that she was born Ruby Macie Grayer on March 20, 1897. Recent research, however, suggests she was born in 1907, a decade later, based on the listing of Ruby Macie Grier, aged 3, in the 1910 census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/CalmentFraud.html|title=Ruby Muhammed Claims She Is 112 Years in Sacramento, CA|publisher=Gerontology Research Group|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-04|last=Prista Lucas|first=Filipe[/tpl]
Her mother died when she was very young, and she was raised by a woman she called her aunt, although she would later say that this woman was probably not her biological aunty. She did not know her father until she was a teenager. Community records in Sandersville, where she was born, indicate her father died at age 107 and her great-grandfather died at age 110.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/seniors/story/6745838p-7696920c.html|title=Seniors - Number of centenarians expected to double every decade|accessdate=2007-04-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070212084545/http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/seniors/story/6745838p-7696920c.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007[/tpl]

==Mother of Islam==

Muhammad joined the Nation of Islam in 1946 and was named "Mother of the Nation of Islam" in 1986 by Minister Louis Farrakhan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=69975|title=The life of a matriarch|publisher=Sacramento News|date=2006-07-13|accessdate=2007-04-11|last=Saini|first=Sonia K.[/tpl] This is an honorary title; Muhammad, who was married twice, was not the widow of Elijah Muhammad, who founded the Nation of Islam. Ruby Muhammad died on March 2, 2011
In 2006, Muhammad moved into a senior center in Sacramento, California. In 2008, Muhammad, then known as Ruby Pittman (the name of her second husband), received a motorized wheelchair as a donation from a scooter store.[tpl]cite web|url=http://medical.presslib.com/family-medicine/660074.htm|title=Disabled Sacramento Woman, 110, Receives Power Wheelchair Donation from The SCOOTER Store|publisher=Medical News|accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacobserver.com/news/020508/ruby_muhammad_scooter.shtml|title=Mother Muhammad Goes Mobile|publisher=Sacramento Observer|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2008-05-25|last=Barrow|first=Genoa[/tpl]
