[[Chromosome 15q trisomy]]

CATEGORIES: Genetic disorders with no OMIM

Chromosome 15q trisomy is an extremely rare genetic disorder, caused by a chromosomal aberration in which there is an excess copy of the long ("q") arm of human chromosome 15. The disorder is also known as Distal Duplication 15q and Partial Duplication 15q Syndrome.  
The disorder is primarily characterized by growth abnormalities, which range from growth retardation to accelerated growth, intellectual disability, and distinctive malformations of the head and face. Additional abnormalities may involve malformation of the skeleton, spine and neck; fingers and/or toes; genitals (particularly in males); and, in some cases, heart problems. When accelerated growth is present, it is thought to result from the duplication of the IGF1 receptor gene.
