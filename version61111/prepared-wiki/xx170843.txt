In August 2007, the publisher, Cambridge University Press, removed the work from circulation under pressure from a libel action lawsuit filed against them in the British legal system by wealthy Saudi Khalid Salim A. Bin Mahfouz because the book accused him of funding al-Qaeda.
Mahfouz had previously also forced the censorship of four other books:
Within hours, Alms for Jihad became one of the 100 most sought after titles on Amazon.com and eBay in the United States. Cambridge University Press sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation.  CUP subsequently sent out copies of an "errata" sheet.  The American Library Association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding Alms for Jihad: "Given the intense interest in the book, and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand, we recommend that U.S. libraries keep the book available for their users."
The decision did not have the support of the book's authors and was criticised by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English libel laws were excessively strict.Bonus Books criticises CUP, The Bookseller, March 8, 2007A University Press Stands Up -- and Wins, Inside Higher Ed, August 16, 2007 In a New York Times Book Review (7 October 2007), United States Congressman Frank R.

CUP pointed out that, at that time, it had already sold most of its copies of the book. Kevin Taylor, intellectual property director at Cambridge University Press, stated that the book cited sources, "whose falsity had been established to the satisfaction of the English courts" in previous cases.Kevin Taylor, Why CUP acted responsibly theBookseller.com 09.08.07
