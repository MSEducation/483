[[McCawley]]

CATEGORIES: English-language surnames, Patronymic surnames

McCawley and MacCawley are surnames in the English language. The names are Anglicisations of several Gaelic-language surnames. There are several etymological origins for the names: all of which originated as patronyms in several Gaelic languages—Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Although the English-language surnames are ultimately derived from Gaelic patronyms, the English-language surnames, and the modern Gaelic-language forms do not refer to the actual name of the bearer's father or grandfather. The surnames are not very common.

==Etymology==

In some cases, the surnames are derived from the Scottish Gaelic MacAmhalghaidh and Irish Mac Amhalghaidh. Those Gaelic surnames translate into English as "son of Amhalghaidh"[tpl]citation |title=Mac Amhalghadha, Mac Amhalghaidh |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/names/maca/mac-amhalghadha-mac-amhalghaidh.php |publisher=Library Ireland (www.libraryireland.com) |accessdate=19 December 2010 [/tpl], which is a transcription of: [tpl]citation |last1=Woulfe |first1=Patrick |title=Irish Names and Surnames |year=1923 [/tpl]. or "son of Amhalghadh". The Gaelic surnames originated as patronyms; however, they are no longer used to refer to the actual names of the bearers' fathers. The personal name Amhalghaidh (also spelt Amhalghadh) is an old Gaelic name, and its etymological origin and meaning are uncertain.
In other cases, the surnames are derived from the Scottish Gaelic MacAmhlaidh, or the Irish Mac Amhlaoibh.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |publisher=Ancestry.com |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl], which cited: [tpl]citation |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-508137-4 [/tpl], for the surnames "McCawley" and "McCauley". These surnames translate into English as "son of Amhladh" or "son of Amhlaidh"; and "son of Amhlaoibh". The Gaelic surnames originated as patronyms; however, they are no longer used to refer to the actual names of the bearers' fathers. The names Amhladh, Amhlaidh, and Amhlaoibh are Gaelic derivatives of the Old Norse personal names Áleifr and Óláfr.[tpl]citation |last=Black |first=George Fraser |title=The Surnames of Scotland: Their Origin, Meaning, and History |publisher=New York Public Library |publication-place=New York |year=1946 |pages=37, 455 [/tpl].[tpl]citation |last1=Hanks |first1=Patrick |authorlink1= Patrick Hanks |last2=Hardcastle |first2=Kate |last3=Hodges |first3=Flavia |title=A Dictionary of First Names |edition=2nd |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-861060-1 |pages=341, 393, 399 [/tpl].
According to John O'Hart, a late 19th-century genealogist, the surname MacCawley is an Anglicised form of the Irish Ó Cadhla,[tpl]citation |title=Cawley of West Connaught |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/Pedigrees1/CawleyIr.php |publisher=Library Ireland (www.libraryireland.com) |accessdate=15 December 2010 [/tpl], which is a transcription of: [tpl]citation |last1=O'Hart |first1=John |title=Irish Pedigrees |volume=1 |year=1892 [/tpl]. which translates into English as "descendant of Cadhla".[tpl]citation |title=Ó Cadhla |url=http://www.libraryireland.com/names/oc/o-cadhla.php |publisher=Library Ireland (www.libraryireland.com) |accessdate=15 December 2010 [/tpl], which is a transcription of: [tpl]citation |last1=Woulfe |first1=Patrick |title=Irish Names and Surnames |year=1923 [/tpl].
