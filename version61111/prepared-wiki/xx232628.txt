eIF2 activity is regulated by a mechanism involving both guanine nucleotide exchange and
phosphorylation. Phosphorylation takes place at the α-subunit, which is a target for a number of serine kinases that phosphorylate serine 51. Those kinases act as a result of stress such as
amino acid deprivation (GCN2), ER stress (PERK), the presence of dsRNA (PKR) or Heme deficiency (HRI). Once phosphorylated, eIF2 shows increased affinity for its
Guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. However, eIF2B is able to exchange GDP for GTP only if eIF2 is in its unphosphorylated
state. Phosphorylated eIF2, however, due to its stronger binding acts as an inhibitor of its own GEF (eIF2B).
Since the cellular concentration of eIF2B is much lower than that of eIF2, even a small amount of
phosphorylated eIF2 can completely abolish eIF2B activity by sequestration. Without the GEF, eIF2
can no longer be returned to its active (GTP-bound) state. As a consequence, translation comes to a halt since
initiation is no longer possible without any available ternary complex. Furthermore low concentration of ternary complex allows the expression of GCN4 (starved condition) which in turn results in increased activation of amino acid synthesis genes

==Disease==

Since eIF2 is essential for translation initiation and therefore protein synthesis, defects in eIF2 are lethal. The protein is highly conserved among evolutionary remote species - indicating a large impact of mutations on cell
viability. Therefore, no diseases directly related to mutations in eIF2 can be observed.
However, there are many illnesses caused by down-regulation of eIF2 through its upstream kinases. For
example, increased concentrations of active PKR and inactive (phosphorylated) eIF2 were found in
patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease. There is also one proven example of a disease related to the GEF eIF2B. Mutations in all of the
five subunits of eIF2B could be linked with leukoencephalopathy, an illness that causes the brain’s
white matter to disappear. It is still not fully understood why only brain cells seem to be affected by
these defects. Potentially reduced levels of unstable regulatory proteins might play a role in the
development of the diseases mentioned.
