[[Shikhov Beach]]

CATEGORIES: Beaches of Azerbaijan, Baku

Shikhov Beach (Azeri: Şıxov çimərliyi) is a resort area in Shikhov, just southwest of Baku, Azerbaijan, and adjacent to the Shikhov Cape.  Lying on the Caspian Sea coast, it is politically part of the Baku city-subdivision and treated as a suburb.  The beach has been a traditional retreat for Baku residents, though the water is polluted by sewage and industrial waste and the view is marred by large oil rigs both in the surrounding land area and offshore.
