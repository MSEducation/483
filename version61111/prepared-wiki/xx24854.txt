Professor John Nerdelbaum Frink, Jr., or simply Professor Frink, is a recurring character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is voiced by Hank Azaria, and first appeared in the 1991 episode "Old Money". Frink is Springfield's nerdy scientist and professor and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat mad and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his trademark.
Frink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in "Old Money", since he was trying to secure funding for a death ray. When Azaria ad-libbed a voice for the character, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's Julius Kelp character from The Nutty Professor. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personality — he became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink's father in the 2003 episode "Treehouse of Horror XIV".
The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from The Simpsons. Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and a simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida. The character's popularity has led to him giving name to the computer programming language Frink.

==Character==

Frink first appeared in the season two episode "Old Money" that aired on [tpl]nowrap|March 28, 1991[/tpl]. In that episode, Grampa Simpson inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that "it is just a prototype. With proper funding I’m confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!" Grampa responds with "But I want to help people, not kill ‘em!", to which Frink replies "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she’s hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one."
In the original script, Frink appeared more evil.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Kogen, Jay; Silverman, David; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2002). Audio commentary for "Old Money", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. However, when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film The Nutty Professor, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed.[tpl]cite news |title=Comedian Lewis recovering from heart attack |url=http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-jerrylewismildheartattack,0,377757.story?coll=zap-movies-headlines |accessdate=2010-08-02 |newspaper=Zap2it |date=2006-06-14[/tpl] The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide that "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona. What I love about Hank is that, you give him a single line — and most of these characters have very few lines — and he just brings it to life. Every time." Frink was originally animated without his buckteeth; they were added later on to make him look even more like Lewis's character. He was named after television writer John Frink, who was later hired on The Simpsons. The nonsensical utterances that Frink makes are written in the scripts as "Frink noise".[tpl]cite news |last=Chant |first=Lisa |title=30 things you didn't know about The Simpsons |newspaper=Sunday Mail |date=2005-01-30 |page=066[/tpl]
Azaria has voiced Frink ever since the first appearance of the professor. Out of the many characters for which Azaria provides the voice, Frink is his favorite to do because he was a fan of Lewis in his younger years[tpl]cite news |title=Raise your glass |newspaper=The Express |date=2000-08-12[/tpl] and he enjoys imitating the voice of the nutty professor.[tpl]cite news |last=Knutzen |first=Eirik |title=Azaria finds therapeutic role as 'Huff' |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |date=2004-11-11 |page=9A[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Actor Hank Azaria reveals a few of his favourite things |newspaper=The Mail on Sunday |date=2006-07-23[/tpl] He has said that "once you start talking like Kelp it’s very hard to stop.

==Reception==

Frink is a popular character on The Simpsons and he has received acclaim from critics. Mark Hughes Cobb of The Tuscaloosa News named him his favorite secondary character from the show. Fort Worth Star-Telegram[tpl]'[/tpl]s Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on The Simpsons, writing that "Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny."[tpl]cite news |last=Philpot |first=Robert |title=D'oh-boy! - 'The Simpsons ' marks its 300th episode of razor-sharp satire |newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |date=2003-02-15 |page=1[/tpl] On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral Simpsons characters, IGN's Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the Simpsons universe "as the town's brilliant mad scientist." They highlighted a scene from the episode "The PTA Disbands", in which Frink becomes a kindergarten substitute teacher and keeps one of the children's toys to himself because the children "wouldn't enjoy it on as many levels" as he did.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p2.html |title=The top 25 Simpsons peripheral characters|accessdate=2010-08-01 |date=2006-10-06 |publisher=IGN[/tpl] Nick Griffiths of Radio Times named Frink one of the best characters of the show, stating that he has "always loved Professor Frink", particularly because of his appearance, gibberish talking, and overuse of the word "the", and because of his inventions such as the matter teleporter that turns Bart into half-human half-fly.[tpl]cite news |last=Griffiths |first=Nick |title=The best...Simpsons character |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/simpsonscharacter/ |accessdate=2010-08-31 |newspaper=Radio Times |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100907071451/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/simpsonscharacter/  |archivedate=2010-09-07[/tpl] The Sydney Morning Herald[tpl]'[/tpl]s David Hollingworth profiled Frink in his list of "TV's great tech figures", writing that apart from being smart, the professor is best known for his "rather idiosyncratic speech patterns — hmmguyvin-whey-hey."[tpl]cite news |last=Hollingworth |first=David |title=As seen on TV — TV geeks |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2000-11-30 |page=18[/tpl] Joe Rhodes of TV Guide listed the following as the professor's most memorable line: "Sorry I'm late. There was trouble at the lab with the running and the exploding and the crying when the monkeys stole the glasses off my head."
Several critics have commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that "When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it "was not one of Frink's most successful," since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa.[tpl]cite web |last=Goss |first=Patrick |title=Great gadgets of The Simpsons |url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=149575278 |work=Tech & Gadgets |publisher=MSN |accessdate=2010-08-02 |date=2009-09-08[/tpl] On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: "Where would the town be without your Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?"[tpl]cite web |title=Professor Frink |url=http://simpsons.ugo.com/?cur=frink |publisher=UGO Networks |accessdate=2010-08-02[/tpl] Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.[tpl]cite news |last=Waldrop, Howard; Person, Lawrence |title=Movie review of The Simpsons Movie |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2007/WaldropPerson_Simpsons.html |accessdate=2010-08-02 |newspaper=Locus (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Locus |date=2007-07-30[/tpl]

It is, according to creator of the language, "designed to make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out right, and to make a tool that's really useful in the real world. It tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps you easily verify that your answers make sense."[tpl]cite web |last=Eliasen |first=Alan |title=Frink (official website) |url=http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/ |accessdate=2011-07-30[/tpl]
