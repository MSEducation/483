Arachnophobiac is the eighth studio album released in 2003 by the German hard rock band Michael Schenker Group. After exiting UFO, rumors spread about Schenker's health and well-being. But the longtime guitar hero silenced his doubters with an extensive tour, as well as an all-new solo release. The album was recorded with Michael Schenker on guitars, Chris Logan on vocals, Stuart Hamm on bass guitar and Jeremy Colson on drums.
