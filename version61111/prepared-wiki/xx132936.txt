The northern dwarf tree frog, (Litoria bicolor) is a small species of tree frog native to northern Australia, from the Kimberly region of Western Australia to Bowen, Queensland, and Aru Islands of Indonesia. The population occurring in Indonesia may not be L. bicolor, and research on call structure or genetics is needed to confirm its taxonomic status.

==Physical description==

The northern dwarf tree frog is small, slender tree frog growing up to 30Â mm in length. The dorsal surface is green and is bordered by a bronze stripe that runs along the sides, from the shoulder to the groin. A white stripe runs along the upper lip to the base of the arm and may continue on to the groin. The belly is granular and white or pale yellow. The iris is golden and the tympanum is distinct. There is orange in the groin and thigh. The fingers have a trace of webbing and the toes are half to three-quarters webbed.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Most abundant in grassland or marshy areas, but also occurs along permanent or semi-permanent streams, billabongs and floodplains. Breeding starts with summer rains and 10-20 eggs are laid on submerged vegetation in temporary pools. Males call from around the breeding site from elevated positions. The call is a "wree-e-eck pippip" with the second part of the call starting before the first part finishes. Tadpole metamorphosis takes 70 to 80 days.
