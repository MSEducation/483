==Influence on design==

Noted initially for such sensuous efforts as the Ferrari 250 Berlinetta Bertone, De Tomaso Mangusta, Iso Grifo, and Maserati Ghibli, Giugiaro switched courses to introduce the highly angular "folded paper" era of the 1970s. Straight lined designs such as the BMW M1, Maserati Bora, and Maserati Merak followed before a softer approach returned in the Lamborghini Cala, Maserati Spyder, and Ferrari GG50.
