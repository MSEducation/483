Sirindhorn ([tpl]lang-th|สิรินธร[/tpl]; [tpl]RTGS|Sirinthon[/tpl]) is a district (Amphoe) of Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, established by the Royal Decree Establishing Amphoe Sirindhorn, BE 2534 (1991), coming into force on January 4, 1992. It is named in honor of HRH Princess Sirindhorn on the occasion of her 36th birthday.

==Creation==

The district was created by splitting off tambon Kham Khuean Kaeo from Khong Chiam and the five tambon Khan Rai, Chong Mek, Nikhom Sang Ton-eng Lam Dom Noi, Non Ko and Fang Kham from Phibun Mangsahan district.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=108|issue=211 ก special|pages=29–31|title=พระราชกฤษฎีกาตั้งอำเภอสิรินธร พ.ศ. ๒๕๓๔|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2533/A/083/1.PDF|date=December 4, 1991|language=Thai[/tpl]

==Geography==

Neighboring districts are (from the south clockwise) Buntharik, Phibun Mangsahan and Khong Chiam. To the west across the Mekong river is the Laotian province of Champasak.
The Sirindhorn Dam that dams the Dom Noi River is located in this district.
There is a border crossing to Laos here—from Chong Mek on the Thai side to Vang Tao on the Lao side, with onward travel typically to Pakxe.
 

==Administration==

The district is subdivided into 6 subdistricts (tambon), which are further subdivided into 73 villages (muban). Chong Mek has township status (thesaban tambon) and covers parts of the tambon Chong Mek, and the township Nikhom Sang Ton-eng Lam Dom Noi covers the entire tambon of the same name. There are a further 5 Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAO).
