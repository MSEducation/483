The King's Highway was a roughly [tpl]convert|1300|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] road laid out from 1650 to 1735 in the American colonies. It was built on the order of Charles II of England, who directed his colonial governors to link Charleston, South Carolina, and Boston, Massachusetts.
The section north of New York City, laid out on January 22, 1673, became the Upper Boston Post Road.Map Guide to American Migration Routes, 1735–1815 by William Dollarhide, Heritage Quest, 1997, ISBN 1-877677-74-4 The road was finally completed in 1735.

Herman Moll’s 1729 “Post Map” described the route:

==Boston Post Road==

The Boston Post Road was a system of mail-delivery routes between New York City and Boston that evolved into the first major highways in the United States. The Upper Post Road was originally called the Pequot Path and had been in use by native Americans long before Europeans arrived.Bourne, p.13 Some of these important native trails had been pounded by moccasin-shod feet for so many years that they were two feet below the surrounding woodland.
The colonists first used this trail to deliver the mail using post riders. The first ride to lay-out the Upper Post Road started on January 1, 1673.Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine, January 1917, Vol. 50, page 386, http://books.google.com/books?id=swILAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA386&dq=first+ride+king%27s+highway+post+road+connecticut&as_brr=1 Later, the newly blazed trail was widened and smoothed to the point where horse-drawn wagons or stagecoaches could use the road. During the 19th century, turnpike companies took over and improved pieces of the road. Large sections of the various routes are still called the King's Highway and Boston Post Road. Much of the Post Road is now U.S. Route 1, and U.S. Route 20.
