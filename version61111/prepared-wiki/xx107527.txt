==Analysis==

In reviewing the published play, Harvey PitcherHarvey Pitcher is the author of "The Chekhov Play: A New Interpretation" (University of California Press)wrote that Mamet was the "most faithful to Chekhov..... Chekhov himself was the first to realize that many of his early stories, consisting largely of dialogue, could be easily transferred to the stage. Mamet made the same discovery. Resisting the temptation to improve on Chekhov, he has produced an attractively straightforward version of the comic story 'Vint,' in which a group of civil servants give an original twist to a popular card game."Pitcher, Harvey.Orchards: Seven Stories by Anton Chekhov and Seven Plays They Have Inspired (Knopf: $18.95, hardcover; $9.95, paperback; 144 pp.)" latimes.com, July 20, 1986
