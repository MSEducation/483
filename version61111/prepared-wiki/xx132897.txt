[[Black pepper crab]]

CATEGORIES: Singaporean cuisine, Crab dishes

Black pepper crab is one of the two most popular ways that crab is served in Singapore. It is made with hard-shell crabs, and fried with black pepper. Unlike the other popular chilli crab dish, it is less heavy due to the absence of a sauce. The black pepper crab is liked by many locals and foreign tourists over the chilli crab because of its drier and fragrant pepperish nature. It is becoming very popular to mix the pepper crab with a fresh jackfruit sauce. It is however not in the list of Singapore's National Dishes.http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/dining/signature-dishes.html
The creation of Singapore's black pepper crab is attributed to Long Beach Seafood Restaurant in 1959.http://www.longbeachseafood.com.sg/about.php However, for many Singaporeans, Eng Seng Restaurant is widely recognised as the place for the best black pepper crabs, with notorious long queues, booking required and the dishes selling out by 8pm.http://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/eng_seng_restaurant/http://ieatishootipost.sg/2008/09/eng-seng-restaurant-reserve-your-black.html
