According to "Cincinnati Parks and Parkways" the piece was moved to its new location because it "was so annoying to pedestrians."Darbee, Jeffrey T. & Nancy A. Recchie. Cincinnati Parks and Parkways.

==Information==

Locals have been known to call the sculpture "Cootie" because the sculpture's leggy design looks like a "bug" from the game Cootie.

==Condition==

This sculpture was surveyed by Save Outdoor Sculpture! in 1994 and was described as needing treatment. The sculpture is frequently repainted due to the frequent fading of the color. The paint is also known for flaking and rust is known to form underneath the structure. At the time of the survey it was in need of repainting.
