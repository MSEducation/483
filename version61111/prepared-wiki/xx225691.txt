CATEGORIES: Special functions, Hypergeometric functions

In mathematics, a Barnes integral or Mellin–Barnes integral is a contour integral involving a product of gamma functions. They were introduced by [tpl]harvs|txt|authorlink=Ernest William Barnes|first=Ernest William |last=Barnes|year1=1908|year2=1910[/tpl]. They are closely related to generalized hypergeometric series.
The integral is usually taken along a contour which is a deformation of the imaginary axis passing to the left of all poles of factors of the form Γ(a + s) and to the right of all poles of factors of the form Γ(a − s).

==Hypergeometric series==

The hypergeometric function is given as a Barnes integral [tpl]harv|Barnes|1908[/tpl] by 
This equality can be obtained by moving the contour to the right while picking up the residues at s = 0, 1, 2, ... . Given proper convergence conditions, one can relate more general Barnes' integrals and generalized hypergeometric functions pFq in a similar way. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Barnes lemmas==

The first Barnes lemma [tpl]harv|Barnes|1908[/tpl] states
This is an analogue of Gauss's 2F1 summation formula, and also an extension of Euler's beta integral.  The integral in it is sometimes called Barnes's beta integral. 
The second Barnes lemma [tpl]harv|Barnes|1910[/tpl] states
where e = a + b + c − d + 1.  This is an analogue of Saalschütz's summation formula.

==q-Barnes integrals==

There are analogues of Barnes integrals for basic hypergeometric series, and many of the other results can also be extended to this case [tpl]harv|Gasper|Rahman|2004|loc=chapter 4[/tpl].
