[[Fish River (Namibia)]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Namibia

The Fish River (Visrivier in Afrikaans, Fischfluss in German) is a river in Namibia.  It is 650 km long, flowing from Hardap Dam near Mariental.  The flow of the river is seasonal; in winter the river can dry up completely.  Despite this, the river is the site of the spectacular Fish River Canyon, a canyon 160 km long, and at points as much as 550 m deep.
The outflow of the Fish River joins the Orange River at the border with South Africa about 100 km from the Atlantic Ocean.
