Auttapon Prakopkong อรรถพล ประกอบของ (who is better known as M The star) is a Thai singer who was the champion of the popular reality TV program The Star 2 when he was 25 years old.

==Biography==

He was born September 28, 1978 in Chiang Mai (Northern Thailand). Although his parents were divorced when he was only two years old, his strong determination to be a good person was always kept in his mind. This might be caused by his mother's advice as a teacher. As a teenager, he had a part-time job as a singer at the Public House in Chiang Mai. It led him to his goal of being a professional singer. 
The first challenge came when he applied to join "The Star 1" together with his friends; Jeiw-Piyanuth and New-Napassorn. Both of the girls went to the final round but he was knocked out in the first round. Again, his strong determination to be a singer still never continued on as he later joined "The Star 2" in the next year and was the winner by getting 50.81% of the audience's vote in the final round. He finally achieved one of his dreams to be the winner of the star. Later, he had a chance to release the debut album with the huge entertainment company in Thailand, GMM Grammy.
He decided to drop out of his first year at Payap University to focus on his singing career. In the future he would like to have further education in the music field aboard.
