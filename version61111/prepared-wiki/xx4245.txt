[[Histone]]

CATEGORIES: Epigenetics, Genetics, Proteins

In biology, histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei that package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes.[tpl]cite book| last= Youngson| first= Robert M.| title= Collins Dictionary of Human Biology| year= 2006| publisher= HarperCollins| location= Glasgow| isbn = 0-00-722134-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author = Cox, Michael; Nelson, David R.; Lehninger, Albert L | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long (a length to width ratio of more than 10 million to 1 in human DNA). For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 micrometers (0.09 mm) of chromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Redon C, Pilch D, Rogakou E, Sedelnikova O, Newrock K, Bonner W | title = Histone H2A variants H2AX and H2AZ | journal = Curr.

==Classes==

Five major families of histones exist: H1/H5, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bhasin M, Reinherz EL, Reche PA | title = Recognition and classification of histones using support vector machine | journal = J. Comput. Biol. | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–12 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16472024 | doi = 10.1089/cmb.2006.13.102 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]Cite book|last1= Hartl|first= Daniel L. |last2= Freifelder | first2= David|last3= Snyder|first3= Leon A.|  year=1988|title=Basic Genetics|publication-place=Boston|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|isbn=0-86720-090-1[/tpl] Histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are known as the core histones, while histones H1 and H5 are known as the linker histones.
Two of each of the core histones assemble to form one octameric nucleosome core, approximately 63 Angstroms in diameter (a solenoid (DNA)-like particle). 147 base pairs of DNA wrap around this core particle 1.65 times in a left-handed super-helical turn to give a particle of around 100 Angstroms across.[tpl]cite journal | author = Luger K, Mäder AW, Richmond RK, Sargent DF, Richmond TJ | title = Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6648 | pages = 251–60 |date=September 1997 | pmid = 9305837 | doi = 10.1038/38444 | url =  [/tpl] [tpl]PDB|1AOI[/tpl]  The linker histone H1 binds the nucleosome at the entry and exit sites of the DNA, thus locking the DNA into place[tpl]cite book |author=Farkas, Daniel |title=DNA simplified: the hitchhiker's guide to DNA |publisher=AACC Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=1996 |isbn=0-915274-84-1 [/tpl] and allowing the formation of higher order structure.  The most basic such formation is the 10 nm fiber or beads on a string conformation.  This involves the wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes with approximately 50 base pairs of DNA separating each pair of nucleosomes (also referred to as linker DNA). Higher-order structures include the 30 nm fiber (forming an irregular zigzag) and 100 nm fiber, these being the structures found in normal cells.  During mitosis and meiosis, the condensed chromosomes are assembled through interactions between nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins.
The following is a list of human histone proteins:

==Structure==

The nucleosome core is formed of two H2A-H2B dimers and a H3-H4 tetramer, forming two nearly symmetrical halves by tertiary structure (C2 symmetry; one macromolecule is the mirror image of the other). The H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 tetramer also show pseudodyad symmetry. The 4 'core' histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) are relatively similar in structure and are highly conserved through evolution, all featuring a 'helix turn helix turn helix' motif (which allows the easy dimerisation).  They also share the feature of long 'tails' on one end of the amino acid structure - this being the location of post-translational modification (see below).
It has been proposed that histone proteins are evolutionarily related to the helical part of the extended AAA+ ATPase domain, the C-domain, and to the N-terminal substrate recognition domain of Clp/Hsp100 proteins. Despite the differences in their topology, these three folds share a homologous helix-strand-helix (HSH) motif.[ref]

Using an electron paramagnetic resonance spin-labeling technique, British researchers measured the distances between the spools around which eukaryotic cells wind their DNA.  They determined the spacings range from 59 to 70 Å.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ward R, Bowman A, El-Mkami H, Owen-Hughes T, Norman DG | title = Long distance PELDOR measurements on the histone core particle | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 131 | issue = 4 | pages = 1348–9 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 19138067 | doi = 10.1021/ja807918f | url =  [/tpl]
In all, histones make five types of interactions with DNA:
The highly basic nature of histones, aside from facilitating DNA-histone interactions, contributes to their water solubility.
Histones are subject to post translational modification by enzymes primarily on their N-terminal tails, but also in their globular domains[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]. Such modifications include methylation, citrullination, acetylation, phosphorylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation. This affects their function of gene regulation (see "Function" section).
In general, genes that are active have less bound histone, while inactive genes are highly associated with histones during interphase[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl].  It also appears that the structure of histones has been evolutionarily conserved, as any deleterious mutations would be severely maladaptive. All histones have a highly positively charged N-terminus with many lysine and arginine residues.

==History==

Histones were discovered in 1884 by Albrecht Kossel.  The word "histone" dates from the late 19th century and is from the German "Histon", of uncertain origin: perhaps from Greek histanai or from histos. Until the early 1990s, histones were dismissed by most as inert packing material for eukaryotic nuclear DNA, based in part on the "ball and stick" models of Mark Ptashne and others who believed that transcription was activated by protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions on largely naked DNA templates, as is the case in bacteria.  During the 1980s, work by Michael Grunstein[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 3048701 | volume=55 | issue=1 | title=Extremely conserved histone H4 N terminus is dispensable for growth but essential for repressing the silent mating loci in yeast |date=October 1988 | journal=Cell | pages=27–39 | author=Kayne PS, Kim UJ, Han M, Mullen JR, Yoshizaki F, Grunstein M | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90006-2[/tpl] demonstrated that eukaryotic histones repress gene transcription, and that the function of transcriptional activators is to overcome this repression.  It is now known that histones play both positive and negative roles in gene expression, forming the basis of the histone code.
The discovery of the  H5 histone appears to date back to 1970s,[tpl]cite journal | author = Crane-Robinson C, Dancy SE, Bradbury EM, Garel A, Kovacs AM, Champagne M, Daune M | title = Structural studies of chicken erythrocyte histone H5 | journal = Eur. J. Biochem. | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 379–88 |date=August 1976 | pmid = 964248 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1976.tb10702.x| url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Aviles FJ, Chapman GE, Kneale GG, Crane-Robinson C, Bradbury EM | title = The conformation of histone H5. Isolation and characterisation of the globular segment | journal = Eur. J. Biochem. | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 363–71 |date=August 1978 | pmid = 689022 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1978.tb12457.x| url =  [/tpl] and in classification it has been grouped with H1.

==Conservation across species==

Histones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, and in certain Archaea, namely Thermoproteales and Euryarchaea, but not in bacteria.  The unicellular algae known as dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes that are known to completely lack histones.[tpl]cite journal | author = Peter J. Rizzo | title = Those amazing dinoflagellate chromosomes | journal = Cell Research | year= 2003 | volume= 13 | pages = 215–217. |doi = 10.1038/sj.cr.7290166 | url = http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v13/n4/full/7290166a.html | issue=4 | pmid = 12974611[/tpl]
Archaeal histones may well resemble the evolutionary precursors to eukaryotic histones. Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, emphasizing their important role in the biology of the nucleus.[tpl]rp|939[/tpl] In contrast mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely because this allows them to achieve an even higher packaging ratio.[tpl]cite journal | author = Clarke HJ | title = Nuclear and chromatin composition of mammalian gametes and early embryos | journal = Biochem. Cell Biol. | volume = 70 | issue = 10–11 | pages = 856–66 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1297351 | doi = 10.1139/o92-134| url =  [/tpl]
Core histones are highly conserved proteins; that is, there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species. Linker histone usually has more than one form within a species and is also less conserved than the core histones.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl]
There are some variant forms in some of the major classes. They share amino acid sequence homology and core structural similarity to a specific class of major histones but also have their own feature that is distinct from the major histones. These minor histones usually carry out specific functions of the chromatin metabolism. For example, histone H3-like CenpA is associated with only the centromere region of the chromosome. Histone H2A variant H2A.Z is associated with the promoters of actively transcribed genes and also involved in the prevention of the spread of silent heterochromatin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Guillemette B, Bataille AR, Gévry N, Adam M, Blanchette M, Robert F, Gaudreau L | title = Variant Histone H2A.Z Is Globally Localized to the Promoters of Inactive Yeast Genes and Regulates Nucleosome Positioning | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e384 |date=December 2005 | pmid = 16248679 | pmc = 1275524 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030384 [/tpl] Furthermore, H2A.Z has roles in chromatin for genome stability.[tpl]cite journal | author = Billon P, Côté J | title = Precise deposition of histone H2A.Z in chromatin for genome expression and maintenance | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta. |date=October 2011| pmid = 22027408| doi = 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2011.10.004 | volume=1819 | issue=3–4 | pages=290–302[/tpl] Another H2A variant H2A.X binds to the DNA with double-strand breaks and marks the region undergoing DNA repair.[tpl]cite journal | author = Paull TT, Rogakou EP, Yamazaki V, Kirchgessner CU, Gellert M, Bonner WM | title = A critical role for histone H2AX in recruitment of repair factors to nuclear foci after DNA damage | journal = Curr.

==Function==

===Compacting DNA strands===

Histones act as spools around which DNA winds. This enables the compaction necessary to fit the large genomes of eukaryotes inside cell nuclei: the compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule.

===Chromatin regulation===

Histones undergo posttranslational modifications that alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. The H3 and H4 histones have long tails protruding from the nucleosome, which can be covalently modified at several places. Modifications of the tail include methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, citrullination, and ADP-ribosylation. The core of the histones H2A, H2B, and H3 can also be modified. Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code, the so-called "histone code".[tpl]cite journal |author=Strahl BD, Allis CD |title=The language of covalent histone modifications |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6765 |pages=41–5 |date=Jan 2000 |pmid=10638745 |doi=10.1038/47412[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Jenuwein T, Allis CD |title=Translating the histone code |journal=Science |volume=293 |issue=5532 |pages=1074–80 |date=Aug 2001 |pmid=11498575 |doi=10.1126/science.1063127[/tpl] Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair, chromosome condensation (mitosis) and spermatogenesis (meiosis).[tpl]cite journal |author=Ning Song, Jie Liu, Shucai An, Tomoya Nishino, Yoshitaka Hishikawa and Takehiko Koji |year=2011 |title= Immunohistochemical Analysis of Histone H3 Modifications in Germ Cells during Mouse Spermatogenesis |journal=Acta Histochemica et Cytochemica |volume=44 |issue=4 |doi=10.1267/ahc.11027 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ahc/advpub/0/advpub_1107140114/_article |pages=183–90 |pmid=21927517 |pmc=3168764[/tpl]
The common nomenclature of histone modifications is:
So H3K4me1 denotes the monomethylation of the 4th residue (a lysine) from the start (i.e., the N-terminal) of the H3 protein.
Examples of histone modifications in transcription regulation include:

==Functions of histone modifications==

A huge catalogue of histone modifications have been described, but a functional understanding of most is still lacking. Collectively, it is thought that histone modifications may underlie a histone code, whereby combinations of histone modifications have specific meanings. However, most functional data concerns individual prominent histone modifications that are biochemically amenable to detailed study.

===Chemistry of histone modifications===

The addition of one, two or three methyl groups to lysine has little effect on the chemistry of the histone; methylation leaves the charge of the lysine intact and adds a minimal number of atoms so steric interactions are mostly unaffected. However, proteins containing Tudor, chromo or PHD domains, amongst others, can recognise lysine methylation with exquisite sensitivity and differentiate mono, di and tri-methyl lysine, to the extent that, for some lysines (e.g.: H4K20) mono, di and tri-methylation appear to have different meanings. Because of this, lysine methylation tends to be a very informative mark and dominates the known histone modification functions.
What was said above of the chemistry of lysine methylation also applies to arginine methylation, and some protein domains—e.g., Tudor domains—can be specific for methyl arginine instead of methyl lysine. Arginine is known to be mono- or di-methylated, and methylation can be symmetric or asymmetric, potentially with different meanings.
Addition of an acetyl group has a major chemical effect on lysine as it neutralises the positive charge. This reduces electrostatic attraction between the histone and the negatively charged DNA backbone, loosening the chromatin structure; highly acetylated histones form more accessible chromatin and tend to be associated with active transcription. Lysine acetylation appears to be less precise in meaning than methylation, in that histone acetyltransferases tend to act on more than one lysine; presumably this reflects the need to alter multiple lysines to have a significant effect on chromatin structure.
Addition of a negatively charge phosphate group can lead to major changes in protein structure, leading to the well-characterised role of phosphorylation in controlling protein function. It is not clear what structural implications histone phosphorylation has, but histone phosphorylation has clear functions as a post-translational modification, and binding domains such as BRCT have been characterised.

===Functions in transcription===

Most well-studied histone modifications are involved in control of transcription.

====Actively transcribed genes====

Two histone modifications are particularly associated with active transcription: 
H3K4 trimethylation is performed by the COMPASS complex.[tpl]cite journal | author = Krogan NJ, Dover J, Khorrami S, Greenblatt JF, Schneider J, Johnston M, Shilatifard A | title = COMPASS, a histone H3 (Lysine 4) methyltransferase required for telomeric silencing of gene expression | journal = J.

However, it is an excellent mark of active promoters and the level of this histone modification at a gene’s promoter is broadly correlated with transcriptional activity of the gene. The formation of this mark is tied to transcription in a rather convoluted manner: early in transcription of a gene, RNA polymerase II undergoes a switch from initiating’ to ‘elongating’, marked by a change in the phosphorylation states of the RNA polymerase II C terminal domain (CTD). The same enzyme that phosphorylates the CTD also phosphorylates the Rad6 complex,[tpl]cite journal| author=Wood A, Schneider J, Dover J, Johnston M, Shilatifard A| title=The Bur1/Bur2 complex is required for histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 and histone methylation by COMPASS | journal=Mol Cell | year= 2005 | volume= 20 | issue= 4 | pages= 589–99 | pmid=16307922 | doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2005.09.010 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=16307922  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Sarcevic B, Mawson A, Baker RT, Sutherland RL| title=Regulation of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme hHR6A by CDK-mediated phosphorylation | journal=EMBO J | year= 2002 | volume= 21 | issue= 8 | pages= 2009–18 | pmid=11953320 | doi=10.1093/emboj/21.8.2009 | pmc=125963 | url= [/tpl] which in turn adds a ubiquitin mark to H2B K123 (K120 in mammals).[tpl]cite journal| author=Robzyk K, Recht J, Osley MA| title=Rad6-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2B in yeast | journal=Science | year= 2000 | volume= 287 | issue= 5452 | pages= 501–4 | pmid=10642555 | doi= 10.1126/science.287.5452.501| pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=10642555  [/tpl] H2BK123Ub occurs throughout transcribed regions, but this mark is required for COMPASS to trimethylate H3K4 at promoters.[tpl]cite journal| author=Sun ZW, Allis CD| title=Ubiquitination of histone H2B regulates H3 methylation and gene silencing in yeast | journal=Nature | year= 2002 | volume= 418 | issue= 6893 | pages= 104–8 | pmid=12077605 | doi=10.1038/nature00883 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=12077605  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Dover J, Schneider J, Tawiah-Boateng MA, Wood A, Dean K, Johnston M, Shilatifard A | title = Methylation of histone H3 by COMPASS requires ubiquitination of histone H2B by Rad6 | journal = J.

This process therefore helps ensure that transcription is not interrupted.

====Repressed genes====

H3K9Me2/3 is a well-characterised marker for heterochromatin, and is therefore strongly associated with gene repression. The formation of heterochromatin has been best studied in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where it is initiated by recruitment of the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing complex to double stranded RNAs produced from centromeric repeats.[tpl]cite journal| author=Verdel A, Jia S, Gerber S, Sugiyama T, Gygi S, Grewal SI et al.| title=RNAi-mediated targeting of heterochromatin by the RITS complex | journal=Science | year= 2004 | volume= 303 | issue= 5658 | pages= 672–6 | pmid=14704433 | doi=10.1126/science.1093686 | pmc=3244756 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=14704433  [/tpl] RITS recruits the Clr4 histone methyltransferase which deposits H3K9Me2/3.[tpl]cite journal| author=Rea S, Eisenhaber F, O'Carroll D, Strahl BD, Sun ZW, Schmid M et al.| title=Regulation of chromatin structure by site-specific histone H3 methyltransferases | journal=Nature | year= 2000 | volume= 406 | issue= 6796 | pages= 593–9 | pmid=10949293 | doi=10.1038/35020506 | pmc= | url= [/tpl] This process is called histone methylation.

This modification is tightly associated with heterochromatin,[tpl]cite journal| author=Schotta G, Lachner M, Sarma K, Ebert A, Sengupta R, Reuter G et al.| title=A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 methylation at constitutive heterochromatin | journal=Genes Dev | year= 2004 | volume= 18 | issue= 11 | pages= 1251–62 | pmid=15145825 | doi=10.1101/gad.300704 | pmc=420351 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15145825  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Kourmouli N, Jeppesen P, Mahadevhaiah S, Burgoyne P, Wu R, Gilbert DM et al.| title=Heterochromatin and tri-methylated lysine 20 of histone H4 in animals | journal=J Cell Sci | year= 2004 | volume= 117 | issue= Pt 12 | pages= 2491–501 | pmid=15128874 | doi=10.1242/jcs.01238 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=15128874  [/tpl] although its functional importance remains unclear. This mark is placed by the Suv4-20h methyltransferase, which is at least in part recruited by heterochromatin protein 1.

====Bivalent promoters====

Analysis of histone modifications in embryonic stem cells (and other stem cells) revealed many gene promoters carrying both H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3, in other words these promoters display both activating and repressing marks simultaneously. This peculiar combination of modifications marks genes that are poised for transcription; they are not required in stem cells, but are rapidly required after differentiation into some lineages. Once the cell starts to differentiate, these bivalent promoters are resolved to either active or repressive states depending on the chosen lineage.[tpl]cite journal| author=Bernstein BE, Mikkelsen TS, Xie X, Kamal M, Huebert DJ, Cuff J et al.| title=A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells | journal=Cell | year= 2006 | volume= 125 | issue= 2 | pages= 315–26 | pmid=16630819 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.02.041 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=16630819[/tpl]
