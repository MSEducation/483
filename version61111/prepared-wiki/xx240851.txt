==History==

In 1859 Parliament authorised the Wansbeck Railway Company to build the line from [tpl]stnlnk|Morpeth[/tpl] to [tpl]stnlnk|Reedsmouth[/tpl]. In 1862 the line from [tpl]stnlnk|Morpeth[/tpl] to [tpl]stnlnk|Scotsgap[/tpl] opened. 
The next year the Northumberland Central Railway were authorised to construct a line from [tpl]stnlnk|Scotsgap[/tpl] to Ford on the Berwick to Kelso line. They also were permitted to build a short branch line to Cornhill. Due to financial difficulties the line was to be built in stageshttp://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/s/scots_gap/index.shtml starting with the section from [tpl]stnlnk|Scotsgap[/tpl] to [tpl]stnlnk|Rothbury[/tpl] which was started in August 1869 and completed by November 1870. The North British Railway and the branch line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. In September 1952 passenger services were withdrawn and the line closed in November 1963.http://www.northumbrian-railways.co.uk/index.php?page=rothbury-branch
One of the original stations on the branch line Ewesley was constructed in the centre of a circular prehistoric camp.http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/e/ewesley/index.shtml Later in 1894 the only passing loop on the otherwise single track line was constructed at Ewesley. At closure the station had been renamed Ewesley Halt. Although in a bad state of repair the platform remains intact, the station building has been demolished.
