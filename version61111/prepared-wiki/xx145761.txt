Pasko Rakic, MD, PhD ([tpl]lang-hr|Paško Rakić[/tpl]) is a neuroscientist at Yale University.

==Early life==

Rakić was born in the Syrmian city of Ruma, Kingdom of Yugoslavia into a Croatian family. His father was originally from Pula, but studied to become a tax official in Novi Sad, after which he had to move often because of his job, while his mother was from Dubrovnik and moved to Vojvodina for a job in the postal service. Rakić graduated with a degree in medicine (MD) from the University of Belgrade School of Medicine in Serbia and then embarked on a career as a neurosurgeon.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://medicine.yale.edu/publications/Images/M%40YV4I1.pdf | title = Cartographer of the brain | journal = Medicine@Yale | volume = 4 | issue = 1 |date=March–April 2008 | publisher = Office of Institutional Planning and Communications, Yale School of Medicine | quote = A Croatian, born in the former Yugoslavia, Rakic’s first forays into neurobiology began during his medical education, followed by graduate training in developmental biology and genetics at Belgrade University. | accessdate = 2013-01-27[/tpl] He is a self-described Croat of Serbia.
His research career began in 1962, with a Fulbright Fellowship at Harvard University.Profile: Pasko Rakic In 1966 he returned to Belgrade and made his first big discovery the same year, before obtaining his PhD in 1969, when he moved to Harvard again. He moved from Harvard to Yale in 1978.

==Research==

According to Nature Medicine, his first experiments required "a special grant, nearly 200 rhesus monkeys and so much radioactive thymidine that manufacturers had to retool their entire production system to provide it." Rakic injected the monkeys' fetuses with radioactive thymidine at a particular time after conception. Only replicating cells took up the radioactive label, which enabled Rakic to trace the lineages of brain cells as they were created. He and his team then sliced the brain of each monkey into 7,000 sections for the benefit of future researchers. Because he used a radiolabel that decays slowly, the slides should be useful for years, and have so far led to more than 24 papers.Dove, Alan. "Profile: Pasko Rakic", Nature Medicine  11, 362 (2005)
Among the discoveries made by Pasko Rakic is the first description of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone.

In 1997, he received a doctor honoris causa from the University of Zagreb.[tpl]cite web | url = http://tkojetko.irb.hr/znanstvenikDetalji.php?sifznan=9734 | title = Paško Rakić | language = Croatian | work = Tko je tko u hrvatskoj znanosti (Who's who in Croatian science) | accessdate = 2013-01-27[/tpl]
In 2003 he received the 15th annual Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Neuroscience Research, a $50,000 award, which noted two of his hypotheses in particular. The first hypothesis is the radial unit hypothesis, that in the developing cerebral cortex the cells are created at the base of each column, and that each new cell migrates past its predecessors. In the related protomap hypothesis, external signals determine cell function as it grows and forms complex connections.http://research.yale.edu/ysm/temp/YSM-Article209.pdf
