[[Hard to Swallow (album)]]

Hard to Swallow is the third studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice. Released by Republic Records in 1998, the album was the first album the performer recorded after a four-year hiatus following the 1994 release of Mind Blowin. Vanilla Ice intended the new musical direction found on the album as an attempt to move away from hip hop music and discard his former pop image. Hard to Swallow instead featured what he described as "skate rock", a fusion of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. The album features appearances from Amen vocalist Casey Chaos, Bloodhound Gang vocalist Jimmy Pop, and Insane Poetry front man Cyco. Session musicians included drummer Shannon Larkin, keyboardist Scott Borland, and Snot guitarist Sonny Mayo.
Vanilla Ice took an interest in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing as a member of a Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared an interest in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. Although Republic Records believed that the album would revive Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.
The song "S.N.A.F.U." was remade in Rhythm Party (Boom Boom Dance) as "BEFREE" with additional verses from Vanilla Ice himself and production from Konami in house artist Des-ROW.

==History==

Vanilla Ice was briefly a member of a band called Pickin' Scabs, which he described as being "like a grunge band."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.well-rounded.com/music/interviews/vanillaice.asp |title=Vanilla Ice: The Well Rounded Interview |accessdate=2009-02-13 |last=Peisner |first=David |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020606031005/http://well-rounded.com/music/interviews/vanillaice.asp |archivedate=2006-06-06 |year=1998 |publisher=Well Rounded Entertainment[/tpl] He had wanted to perform more hip hop-influenced rock music, but the band "didn't know how to play this sound that I was looking for."
Monty Lipman, a founder of Republic Records and former SBK Records promoter, told Vanilla Ice that Ross Robinson, who had worked with bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Sepultura and Deftones, was interested in working with him. Vanilla Ice stated that he and Robinson were "totally clicking right off the bat" when it was discovered that they both shared an interest in motocross racing.
According to Robinson, others had attempted to persuade him not to produce the album. "People kept saying to me, 'It might hurt your name, it might hurt your reputation. I said, 'Then I'm doing it.' It's the most punk-rock thing you could do."[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD8173AF931A2575BC0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=THE POP LIFE; He's Back Back, Baby: A New (Improved?)

Vanilla Ice stated that "It's unbelievable how this whole thing just came about. I really believe that it was an action of God. God pushing my wave and riding it. And Ross is one of those people and Monty is one of those people that God put in front of me and I'm being blessed right now."

==Production==

Initial publicity claimed that the album would feature guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and members of Korn and the Bloodhound Gang.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23202 |title=Interview with Vanilla Ice |accessdate=2008-02-18 |last=Thompson |first=Stephen |coauthors= |date=May 6, 1998 |work= |publisher=The A.V.

Drummer Shannon Larkin said of the album "I'm proud of that one. That was a killer record. Producer Ross Robinson is very demanding when it comes to drums in the studio. Everything had to be 110% for that guy, and I love him for that."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/updatefull/200001380 |title=Shannon Larkin: Showman |accessdate=2008-06-24 |last=John Farinella |first=David |coauthors= |work= |publisher=Modern Drummer[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Vanilla Ice stated of working with Robinson, "The vibe was totally so cool. We had the album finished in a month and a half because we kept the vibe."

==Musical and lyrical style==

In the early stages of the album's development, it was promoted as an album of "high-energy hip-hop."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435114/19980521/vanilla_ice.jhtml |title=Vanilla Ice Lands New Deal |accessdate=2008-02-05 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=May 21, 1998 |work= |publisher=MTV News[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanillaice/articles/story/5921192/to_the_extreme_and_back |title=To The Extreme and Back: A clean-and-sober Vanilla Ice returns again with Hard to Swallow |accessdate=2008-03-23 |last=Fischer |first=Blair R. |coauthors= |date=March 12, 1998 |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone[/tpl] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as "aggressive rock" in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as "skate rock." The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop.[tpl]cite news |first=Kristi |last=Singer |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=A new start for Vanilla Ice: Rob Van Winkle struggled with image and depression but now embraces the new Ice |url=http://kristi_singer.tripod.com/id77.htm |work= |publisher=Wilmington Morning Star |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=August 4, 2000 |accessdate=2008-06-24 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl] Vanilla Ice stated that "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine.

"It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. ... I had heard the Deftones more than any of them."
The album features a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album was described by CNN as a "shrill confessional" on which the performer "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has."[tpl]cite news |first=Donna |last=Freydkin |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Vanilla Ice rolls the dice: The Iceman resurfaces with new rap-metal album |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9901/08/vanilla.ice/index.html |work= |publisher=CNN Interactive |id= |pages= |page= |date=January 8, 1999 |accessdate=2007-11-10 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl] Vanilla Ice explained that the album "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" and that the album "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told him a lot of things that happened to me in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy."
The subjects focused on in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. "I can look back at the whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." "Too Cold" is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, "Ice Ice Baby".[tpl]cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Mickey |editor=Hess, Mickey |title=Icons of Hip Hop |year=2007 |origyear= |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location= |language= |isbn=0-313-33903-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=94 |pages= |chapter=Vanilla Ice [/tpl] Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." "Too Cold" was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.

==Response==

"Too Cold" became a radio hit in some markets. Reviews of the album were generally negative. A reviewer for the New Times in Los Angeles referred to the album as "stupid, exploitive, derivative rap-metal by the man who once did nearly irrepairable damage to hip-hop." Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that "If history is any guide, Vanilla Ice's adoption of rap-metal means that hard rock is about to move on."[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFDF113DF930A15753C1A96E958260 |title=POP REVIEW; Ditching Rap for More Hardcore Metal |accessdate=2008-03-13 |last=Pareles |first=Jon |coauthors= |date=October 23, 1998 |work= |publisher=The New York Times[/tpl] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," the album "isn't half-bad."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanillaice/albums/album/118944/review/5945083/hard_to_swallow |title=Hard to Swallow Review |accessdate=2007-11-10 |last=Torres |first=Richard |coauthors= |date=November 13, 1998 |work= |publisher=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013031429/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanillaice/albums/album/118944/review/5945083/hard_to_swallow  |archivedate=2007-10-13[/tpl] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three out of five stars.[tpl]cite book |last=Kemp |first=Rob |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Brackett, Nathan; Hoard, Christian |others= |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=fourth |series= |volume= |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |language= |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=pages 843–844 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= [/tpl] The Iowa State Daily called the album "the greatest pop culture comeback of all time".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/1998/09/28/UndefinedSection/Swallow.This.Ice.Returns-1074778.shtml |title=Swallow this - Ice returns |accessdate=2007-11-10 |last=Moss |first=Corey |coauthors= |date=September 28, 1998 |work= |publisher=Iowa State Daily[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The album did not chart.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=vanilla ice|chart=all[/tpl] |title=Artist Chart History for Vanilla Ice |accessdate=2008-06-23 |publisher=Billboard[/tpl] The album appeared on The A.V.
