[[Tyrode's solution]]

CATEGORIES: Intravenous fluids

Tyrode's solution is a solution that is roughly isotonic with interstitial fluid and used in physiological experiments and tissue culture. It resembles Lactated Ringer's solution, but contains magnesium, a sugar (usually glucose) as an energy source and uses bicarbonate and/or HEPES as a buffer instead of lactate. Some variations also include phosphate and sulfate ions. It is typically gassed with 95% Oxygen 5% Carbon Dioxide when used for cell culture applications and physiology experiments. With the addition of extra potassium salt, it can be used to prepare a cardioplegic solution.

==Development of Tyrode's solution==

Tyrode's solution was invented by Maurice Vejux Tyrode,Tyrode's solution (www.whonamedit.com) an American pharmacologist. The solution was a modification of Ringer-Locke's solution.
