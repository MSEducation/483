[[River Teith]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Scotland

The River Teith in Scotland flows from the north-west into the River Forth near Drip north-west of Stirling.

==Etymology==

The name comes from the Scottish Gaelic Uisge Theamhich, which translates into English as the "quiet and pleasant water".MacKay, Moray S.(1953). Doune Historical Notes, p. 104. Forth Naturalist and Historian Board ISBN 0950696250.

==Course==

The river forms from two burns (Scottish for streams): one from Loch Venachar the Eas Gobhain which translates as "the smith's cascade", and one from  Loch Lubnaig - Garbh Uisge which translates as "the rough water".  The river flows thorough/past Callander, Deanston and Doune where the Ardoch Burn meets it, before its confluence with the (smaller) Forth upstream of Stirling. The Deanston Distillery near Doune uses the Teith to supply water for the manufacture of Deanston Single Malt Whisky.

==Importance==

The Teith is renowned for its fishing and for the splendid arched bridge ½ mile southwest of Doune.
The 'Brig o' Teith' was constructed in 1535 by Robert Spittal, a Royal tailor to Mary Queen of Scots. According to Charles Roger in 'A Week at Bridge of Allan 1851', a ferryman refused Spittal passage across the Teith as he did not have his purse and could not pay.  The bridge was built in retaliation.
