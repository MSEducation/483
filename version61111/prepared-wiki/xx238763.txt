==Foreign sponsorship and links to Al-Qaeda==

Foreign sponsorship of the Pakistan-based terrorist group has been reported by both Western and other foreign media.  
In May 2007 the London Daily Telegraph reported that President George W. Bush had given the CIA approval to launch covert "black" operations to achieve regime change in Iran. According to this report, the CIA was supplying money and weapons to the Baluchi separatist group named Jundullah.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1552784/Bush-sanctions-black-ops-against-Iran.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Bush sanctions 'black ops' against Iran | first=Tim | last=Shipman | date=May 27, 2007 | accessdate=April 23, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100330134224/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1552784/Bush-sanctions-black-ops-against-Iran.html| archivedate= 30 March 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The former Pakistani Army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg claimed in July 2008 that Washington had been providing Jundullah with financial aid and training facilities to create unrest and strain Tehran–Islamabad relations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=184745 |title=UK, U.S. aided Jundullah kidnapping: Iranian official |publisher=tehran times |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl] According to PressTV, Abdolhamid Rigi, a senior member of Jundullah, mentioned in July 2009 in court that the group has been trained and financed by "the US and Zionists".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=99567&sectionid=351020101 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22[/tpl]
