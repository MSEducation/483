[[Large intestine]]

CATEGORIES: Digestive system, Organs

The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system in vertebrate animals. Its function is to absorb water from the matter, and then to pass useless waste material from the body.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=45097 | title=large intestine | publisher=National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health | work=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms | accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl] 
Terminologia Anatomica, Medscape, and Gray's Anatomy define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.[tpl]cite web | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948929-overview | title=Large Intestine Anatomy | publisher=WebMD LLC. | work=Medscape | date=13 Jul 2011 | accessdate=2013-08-20 | author=Kapoor, Vinay Kumar | Editor=Gest, Thomas R.[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/ | title=Gray's Anatomy | publisher=Lea & Febiger | author=Gray, Henry | authorlink=Henry Gray | year=1918 | location=Philadelphia[/tpl] Other sources, such as Mosby's Medical Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionaries of Medicine and Biology exclude the anal canal.[tpl]cite dictionary|title=large intestine|dictionary=Mosby's Medical Dictionary|year=2009|edition=8th|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323052900[/tpl][tpl]cite dictionary|title=intestine|dictionary=Concise Medical Dictionary|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199557141[/tpl][tpl]cite dictionary|title=large intestine|dictionary=A Dictionary of Biology|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199204625[/tpl] In humans, it begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine.  It then continues up the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity, and then down to its endpoint at the anus. Overall, in humans, the large intestine is about [tpl]convert|1.5|m|ft|[/tpl] long, which is about one-fifth of the whole length of the intestinal canal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

==Structure==

The colon is the last part of the digestive system in most vertebrates. It extracts water and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the site in which flora-aided (large bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material occurs. Unlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role in absorption of foods and nutrients. However, the colon does absorb water, sodium and some fat soluble vitamins.Colon Function And Health Information Retrieved on 2010-01-21

===Sections===

In mammals, the colon consists of four sections: the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon (the proximal colon usually refers to the ascending colon and transverse colon). The cecum, colon, rectum and anal canal make up the large intestine.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=45097 | title = NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms — large intestine | accessdate = 2012-09-16 | author = National Cancer Institute[/tpl]
Locations along the colon are:
The parts of the colon are either in the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal) or behind it in the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal organs in general do not have a complete covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. Intraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mananatomy.com/digestive-system/peritoneum |title=Peritoneum |publisher=Mananatomy.com |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2013-02-07[/tpl] Of the colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the caecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal.http://www.ucd.ie/vetanat/ga-subject/abdomen/ab13.html This is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.

====Ascending colon====

The ascending colon is one part of four sections of the large intestine. This first section of the large intestine is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum. The ascending colon runs through the abdominal cavity, upwards toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).
One of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it back into the body. As the waste material exits the small intestine it will move into the cecum and then the ascending colon where this process of extracting starts. The waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse section of the colon by a process known as peristalsis.
In ruminants, this is known as the spiral colon.[ref]
