Barnard "Barney" Gumble[tpl]cite episode |title=A Star Is Burns |episodelink=A Star Is Burns |series=The Simpsons |credits=Keeler, Ken; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-05[/tpl] is a character on the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. The character is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared in the series premiere episode "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire". He is the town drunk of Springfield, a huge fan of Lord Palmerston, and Homer Simpson's best friend. His desperation for alcohol is a frequent butt of jokes on the show. Barney sobered up in the episode "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", which was co-written by Castellaneta, and stayed sober for several seasons. Barney was inspired by the cartoon character Barney Rubble from The Flintstones and by several barflies from other television programs. In 2004, Castellaneta won an Emmy Award for voicing various characters, including Barney.

==Role in The Simpsons==

Barney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II veteran who died in 1979 in a parade float accident.[tpl]cite episode |title=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish' |episodelink=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish" |series=The Simpsons |credits=Collier, Jonathan; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1996-04-28[/tpl] Little is known about his mother, except that she lives in Norway[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa the Greek |episodelink=Lisa the Greek |series=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace |network=Fox |airdate=1992-01-23[/tpl] and that she served in the United States Navy, including duty on a submarine. In Treehouse of Horror XVII, he stated that he was Polish, after mistakenly saying he was Irish in a drunken stupor. She is seen in the season nine episode Simpson Tide. Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers as being on the same day as Hitler's in "Viva Ned Flanders" and Barney's entry into the Springfield Film Festival in "A Star Is Burns" where Barney states that he is 40 years old). In the episode "$pringfield", he claims that he studied dance for several years, including modern and tap.
Two episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. "Mr. Plow" suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to Harvard University, until Homer introduced him to beer the day before the SATs.[tpl]cite episode |title=Mr. Plow |episodelink=Mr. Plow |series=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1992-11-19[/tpl] Season 16's "She Used to Be My Girl" attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving Springfield to pursue a journalism career.[tpl]cite episode |title=She Used to Be My Girl |episodelink=She Used to Be My Girl |series=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2004-12-05[/tpl]
In "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", Barney formed a barbershop quartet with Homer, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, and Seymour Skinner called the Be Sharps. Barney was asked to join when the other members heard him singing in a beautiful tenor voice in the restroom of Moe's Tavern, replacing the group's original fourth member, Chief Wiggum, who was kicked out. In 1986, the Be Sharps won a Grammy Award for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year. Soon, creative disputes arose, and Barney left the group in all but name when he began dating a Japanese conceptual artist. The group realized that they were no longer popular and split up.[tpl]cite episode |title=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |episodelink=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1993-09-30[/tpl]
Barney started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer's in "Mr. Plow". Barney's commercial defamed Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow's Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside of Springfield. When Homer saw a news report showing that Barney had become trapped in an avalanche, Homer immediately drove to the mountain and rescued Barney. The friends resolved their differences and agreed to work together. However, a heat wave hit Springfield at that exact moment, driving them both out of business. However, in the episodes "O Brother, Where Bart Thou?" and "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" it is showed that Barney still drives his Plow King truck.
After being forced to spend a sober night at Moe's Tavern serving as designated driver, Barney left town in Homer Simpson's car to, among other things, give a guest lecture at Villanova (although, by his own admission, the guest lecture could just have likely occurred on a street corner). A gag in "Selma's Choice" suggests that Barney is the father of many local babies born through (presumably, paid) donation of semen and the resulting artificial insemination.
Barney made a documentary film about his life as an alcoholic, titled Pukahontas. It won the top prize at the Springfield Film Festival. He was ready to quit drinking after winning the Festival, but unfortunately, the prize he received was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer. In "Deep Space Homer", Barney trained to become an astronaut for NASA. Under their alcohol-ban, he quickly regained his balance and diction and was quite appropriately selected to fly with Buzz Aldrin. However, he reverted to his old ways when he was presented with a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne.[tpl]cite episode |title=Deep Space Homer |episodelink=Deep Space Homer |series=The Simpsons |credits=Mirkin, David; Baeza, Carlos |network=Fox |airdate=1994-02-12[/tpl] Barney served in the United States Navy Reserve as a submariner on the USS Jebediah, alongside his mother, in "Simpson Tide".[tpl]cite episode |title=Simpson Tide |episodelink=Simpson Tide |series=The Simpsons |credits=Sternin, Joshua and Jeffrey Ventimilia; Gray, Milton |network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-29[/tpl]
In "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", after watching a video of his drunken antics at his birthday party, Barney resolves to get sober. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, cleans up his appearance, and attends helicopter-flying lessons.[tpl]cite episode |title=Days of Wine and D'oh'ses |episodelink=Days of Wine and D'oh'ses |series=The Simpsons |credits=Lacusta, Deb and Dan Castellaneta; Affleck, Neil |network=Fox |airdate=2000-04-09[/tpl] It was revealed in the fourteenth season episode "I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can" that he had relapsed.

==Character==

===Creation===

Barney was inspired by Barney Rubble, Fred Flintstone's best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series The Flintstones.Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The writers originally wanted the character to be Homer Simpson's sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. Ned Flanders would become the next-door neighbor instead. "Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible," said Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons.[tpl]cite news |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |publisher=TV Guide |date=2000-10-21 |accessdate=2007-08-15[/tpl] The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian Frank Fontaine on The Jackie Gleason Show. Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of "a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it." The writers also patterned the character after Norm Peterson (George Wendt), a character from the sitcom Cheers.Castellaneta, Dan; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Moore, Rich; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for "Flaming Moe's", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
In some early first season episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the production of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin;Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for "Some Enchanted Evening", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. as well, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have yellow hair. Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the Farrah Fawcett poster and the cable spool table.Moore, Rich (2001). Commentary for "Homer's Night Out", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney's Bowl-A-Rama.Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for "Life on the Fast Lane", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. However, after making him "pathetic", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in "And Maggie Makes Three" that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.Groening, Matt; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for "And Maggie Makes Three", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.

===Voice===

Barney Gumble is voiced by Dan Castellaneta.[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997|p=165[/tpl] Early on the show, Castellaneta discovered that it was not easy for him to do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard.Jean, Al (2002). Commentary for "Blood Feud", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, with the exception of the episode "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing back up.Martin, Jeff; Reiss, Mike (2004). Commentary for "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.

===Sobriety===

Castellaneta thought of the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script together with his wife Deb Lacusta. They offered their script to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, "Duffless", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes.Affleck, Neil; Castellaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Their script became the eleventh season episode "Days of Wine and D'oh'ses", which first aired April 9, 2000.[tpl]cite book |last=McCann |first=Jesse L. |title=The Simpsons Beyond Forever! A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family...Still Continued |year=2002 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-06-050592-3[/tpl] The episode was directed by Neil Affleck, who said that he had "a vested interest in getting Barney sober." However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny. Castellaneta commented, "He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins."
After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes.[tpl]cite web |last=Loerzel |first=Robert |title=D'oh! Now He's Van Gogh |publisher=robertloerzel.com |url=http://www.robertloerzel.com/clipfile/castellaneta.htm |accessdate=2008-12-17[/tpl] The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.
