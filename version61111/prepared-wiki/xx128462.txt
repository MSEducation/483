Teala Loring (October 6, 1922 â€“ January 28, 2007)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.westernclippings.com/|title=News|last=Magers|first=Boyd|date=2008-04-22|work=Western Clippings|accessdate=2008-05-13[/tpl] was an American actress who appeared in over thirty films during the 1940s. 

==Life and career==

Born Marcia Eloise Griffin in Denver, Colorado, she was the sister of actors Debra Paget, Lisa Gaye, and Reull Shayne.  At the start of her film career, she was sometimes credited as Judith Gibson.
From 1942, Loring appeared in uncredited or bit parts in films at Paramount, turning up as a cigarette girl in Holiday Inn and as a telephone operator in Double Indemnity, for example.  
in 1945-46, she appeared in ten films released by the low-key Poverty Row studio Monogram Pictures, including Fall Guy (1947), and costarring in two films starring Kay Francis, Allotment Wives (1945) and Wife Wanted (1946).  
Of her portrayal of a young mother caught up in an illegal adoption scheme in 1945's Black Market Babies, The New York Times noted that Loring and co-star Maris Wrixon "struggle fitfully with the lines accorded the two principal mothers" in what it called an "uninspired minor melodrama". Having failed to achieve the success that sister Paget would capture in the 1950s, Loring made her final film, Arizona Cowboy (supporting Western star Rex Allen in his screen debut), in 1950.
