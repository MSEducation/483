The Vice Chairman outranks all respective heads of each service branch, with the exception of the Chairman, but does not have operational command authority over their service branches. The Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986 created the position of VJCS to assist the Chairman in exercising his duties. In the absence of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all other duties prescribed under [tpl]UnitedStatesCode|10|153[/tpl] and may also perform other duties that the President, the Chairman, or the Secretary of Defense prescribes.

The chain of command runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands.http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000162----000-.html 10 USC 162.

The Vice Chairman serves a two-year term of office at the pleasure of the President, but can be reappointed to serve two additional terms for a total of six years. In case of times of war or nation emergency, there is no limit to how many times an officer can be reappointed to serve as Vice Chairman. Historically, the Vice Chairman has served two terms.
