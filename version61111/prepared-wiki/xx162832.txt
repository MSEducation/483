[[HPS stain]]

CATEGORIES: Staining, Saffron

In histology, the HPS stain, or hematoxylin phloxine saffron stain, is a way of marking tissues.  
HPS is similar to the standard bearer in histology H&E; however, it differentiates between the most common connective tissue (collagen is yellowSaffron. polysciences.com.

Accessed on: 6 December 2009.) and muscle & cytoplasm (are both pink) unlike H&E stain (where connective tissue, muscle and cytoplasm all stain pink).
HPS stained sections are more expensive than H&E stained sections, primary due to the cost of saffron.
