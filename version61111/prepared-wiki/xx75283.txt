The Brian Setzer Orchestra (sometimes known by its initials BSO) is a swing and jump blues band formed in 1990 by Stray Cats frontman Brian Setzer. The group covered Louis Prima's "Jump Jive an' Wail", which appeared on Prima's 1957 album The Wildest!. The BSO's follow up single was "Gettin' In the Mood."

==History==

In 1990, Setzer organized the orchestra, styled as a big band which included full sections of trumpet, trombone and saxophone players, and a rhythm section with Setzer on guitar and vocals, plus piano, string bass and drums. The orchestra began playing clubs in and around Los Angeles, USA and was eventually signed to Hollywood Records.
The group released its first two albums in 1994 and 1996. There had been a change of labels, to Interscope Records. The band also had a slight change in orchestration, dropping the piano player. They were followed by The Dirty Boogie (1998), a mix of Setzer-penned originals and covers of swing standards. The orchestra then embarked on several U.S. and world tours.
The album Vavoom! followed, then in the early 2000s two albums of Christmas music and several supporting tours. The orchestra added two backing vocalists, one of whom, Julie Reiten, eventually became Setzer's wife.[tpl]Citation needed|date= May 2012[/tpl]
Setzer persuaded Frank Comstock, who had made an arrangement of "The Nutcracker Suite" on one of the Christmas albums and then retired, to create arrangements for Setzer's 2007 album, Wolfgang's Big Night Out. The orchestra cancelled its 2008 Christmas tour but went back on the road in 2009.
In 2009 the orchestra released a new album titled Songs from Lonely Avenue. This was the first album to feature all original songs written by  Setzer. Frank Comstock also worked on horn and string arrangements for the album.

Besides Setzer, the rhythm section is anchored by drummer Daniel Glass and bassist Johnny Hatton. During live concert performances, Setzer often dismisses the horn players and plays a set of rockabilly using just this trio, in the manner of the Stray Cats.[tpl]Citation needed|date= May 2012[/tpl] 
The woodwind and brass players have had some turnover over the years. Members have included bass trombonist Robbie Hioki, sax player Vincent Trombetta, and trumpeter Kevin Richardson.[tpl]Citation needed|date= May 2012[/tpl] The two female backup singers are referred to as the Vixens.
