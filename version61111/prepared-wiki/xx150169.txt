[[Cross-domain solution]]

CATEGORIES: Computer security software

A cross-domain solution (CDS) is a means of information assurance that provides the ability to manually or automatically access or transfer between two or more differing security domains.[tpl]cite web |url=http://iase.disa.mil/cds/ |title=Cross Domain Enterprise Service (CDES) |date=2011-11-16 |work=Information Assurance Support Environment |publisher=Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) |accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl] They are integrated systems of hardware and software that enable transfer of information among incompatible security domains or levels of classification.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Modern military, intelligence, and law enforcement operations critically depend on timely sharing of information.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] CDS is distinct from the more rigorous approaches, because it supports transfer that would otherwise be precluded by established models of computer, network, and data security, e.g., Bell–LaPadula model and Clark–Wilson model.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] CDS development, assessment, and deployment are based on risk management.
The three primary elements demanded from cross domain solutions are:
The acceptance criteria for information transfer across domains may be simple (e.g.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] antivirus scanning before transfer from low to high security domains) or complex (e.g.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] multiple human reviewers must examine and approve a document before release from a high security domain).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] One-way data transfer systems (one-way traffic systems, data diodes),[tpl]cite web|title=Nexor Data Diode|url=http://www.nexor.com/data-diodes|publisher=Nexor|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.owlcti.com |title=Dual Data Diode Information Transfer Products |publisher=Owl Computing Technologies, Inc |accessdate=2012-01-16[/tpl]  are often used to move information from low security domains to secret enclaves while assuring that information cannot escape.
Cross-domain solutions often include a High Assurance Guard.

==Unintended consequences==

In previous decades, multilevel security (MLS) technologies were developed and implemented that enabled objective and deterministic security, but left little wiggle room for subjective and discretionary interpretation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] These enforced mandatory access control (MAC) with near certainty.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] This rigidity prevented simpler solutions that would seem acceptable on the surface.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Automated information systems have enabled extensive information sharing that is sometimes contrary to the need to avoid sharing secrets with adversaries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] The need for information sharing has led to the need to depart from the rigidity of MAC in favor of balancing need to protect with need to share.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] When the ‘balance’ is decided at the discretion of users, the access control is called discretionary access control (DAC) that is more tolerant of actions that manage risk where MAC requires risk avoidance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Allowing users and systems to manage the risk of sharing information is in some way contrary to the original motivation for MAC.
The unintended consequences of sharing can be complex to analyze and should not necessarily be left to the discretion of users who may have a narrow focus on their own critical need.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] These documents provide standards guidance on risk management:
