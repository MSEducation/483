==Background==

1927 formed in Melbourne in 1987 as a pop, rock band with James Barton on drums, Bill Frost on bass guitar, his brother Garry Frost (ex-Moving Pictures) on guitar and keyboards, and Eric Weideman on lead vocals and guitar. After a year of vainly seeking a recording contract, 1927 were signed by Charles Fisher for his label, Trafalgar Productions. With Fisher producing the group recorded their debut single, "That's When I Think of You", which entered the ARIA Singles Chart in September 1988 and peaked at No. 6. It is co-written by Garry Frost and Weideman. In November 1988 the band released their second single, "If I Could", which peaked at No. 4. It was co-produced by Fisher with Jim Bonneford (their engineer), and was written by Garry Frost. In early December their debut album, ...ish, largely produced by Fisher (except "If I Could"), followed. Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, described it as "brimful of stirring, stately pop rock anthems". It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart for four weeks and stayed in the Top 50 for 45 weeks. Two more top 20 singles from the album followed, "You'll Never Know" (February 1989) and "Compulsory Hero" (April). "If I Could" peaked at No. 21 on the 1989 ARIA End of Year Top 50 Singles Chart.
