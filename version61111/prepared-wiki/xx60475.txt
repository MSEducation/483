Port Columbus International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|CMH|KCMH|CMH[/tpl], commonly shortened to Port Columbus, is a Class C international airport located [tpl]convert|6|mi|km[/tpl] east of downtown Columbus, Ohio, USA. It is managed by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which also oversees operations at Rickenbacker International Airport and Bolton Field. The airport code 'CMH' stands for "Columbus Municipal Hangar," though that name is no longer used today.
Port Columbus is primarily a passenger airport, providing 151 non-stop flights to 34 airports via 15 airlines daily.  Traffic reached 6,233,485 passengers in 2009, a 9.8% decrease over the previous year.Columbus Airport Passenger numbers
In 2012 passenger traffic reached 6.32 million 1-1/2% down from 2011.http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2013/05/30/passenger-totals-keep-slipping-but-few-worry.html
According to a 2005 market survey, Port Columbus attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its [tpl]convert|60|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] radius primary service region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.port-columbus.com/about/CRAA-EIA-full%20brochure.pdf|title=REGIONAL AIRPORTS ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY, WILBUR SMITH ASSOCIATES, INC., January 2005, Chap 1 pp2-4|accessdate=April 7, 2010[/tpl] In addition, the airport also handles freight and US mail, with 10,411,920 units of freight and 8,537,279 units of mail passing through in 2006.
Today Port Columbus has service to almost all major airline hubs across the United States, exceptions being San Francisco, San Diego and Salt Lake City, Delta Air Lines' Western hub. The airport is the largest passenger airport in central Ohio and is the second busiest in the state after Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.
Accessing Port Columbus by road is possible by two interstate highways: I-270 to the northeast and I-670 to the west. The main airport roadway, International Gateway, connects directly to I-670.
Port Columbus is known for displaying community artwork, including children's drawings, a photographic timeline, and other donated items. Most recognized is Brushstrokes in Flight, a sculpture in front of the Concourse B security checkpoint designed by Roy Lichtenstein.

==History==

===Early history===

The airport opened July 8, 1929 on a site selected by Charles Lindbergh, as the eastern air terminus of the Transcontinental Air Transport air-rail New York to Los Angeles transcontinental route. Passengers traveled overnight on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Airway Limited from New York to Columbus; by air from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma; by rail again from Waynoka to Clovis, New Mexico; and by air from Clovis to Los Angeles.[tpl]cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=January 1959|title=Columbus Prepared for Progress|author=Fred J. Bunyan[/tpl] The original terminal building and hangars are still in use; the terminal has been restored and has rental office space and the hangars are still hangars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://columbusairports.com/about-us/our-history/|title=Port Columbus Milestones|publisher=Columbus Regional Airport Authority|year=2012|accessdate=July 28, 2012[/tpl]

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 72 airline departures each weekday: 41 TWA, 16 American, 6 Eastern, 6 Lake Central and 3 Piedmont.[tpl]Citation |last= |first= |year=1957 |title=Official Airline Guide |publisher= American Aviation Publications |publication-place=Washington DC |page= |url= |accessdate= [/tpl]
A $12 million terminal building opened on September 21, 1958. Jet airline flights (American 707s) started in April 1964.

===Recent improvements===

A $70 million renovation of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981.[tpl]cite journal|title=Engineering News-Record|journal=Engineering News-Record|year=1979|volume=202|issue=1-13|pages=271|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=dnDsT5PKFaq02AXxtd2wAQ&id=eR5QAAAAYAAJ&dq=port+columbus+airport+architect&q=%22port+columbus%22+airport#search_anchor|accessdate=June 28, 2012[/tpl] This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding what is known today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. The concourse was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.
Between 1998 and 2000, numerous airport expansion and renovation projects were completed, including a $25 million terminal renovation in 1998 that included additional retail shops, new flight information displays, enhanced lighting, upgraded flooring, and a new food court. Also, new hangars and office spaces were completed for NetJets in 1999, as well as a $92 million parking garage including an underground terminal entrance, new rental car facilities, dedicated ground transportation area, improved eight-lane terminal access on two levels, and a new atrium and entrances in 2000, which were designed by URS Corporation.URS Corporation - Port Columbus International Airport
On April 25, 2004, a new [tpl]convert|195|ft|m|0|sing=on[/tpl] control tower directed its first aircraft, ushering in the beginning of several major facility enhancements to be constructed through 2025.
On October 21, 2010, a new arrivals/departures board was installed in the place of the old one in the main entrance area
Port Columbus is currently going under a Terminal Modernization Program, which includes new terrazzo flooring throughout the airport, new restrooms, and new LED lighting. Construction started on Concourse A in late 2012 and is expected to be complete throughout the concourse in 2015.http://flycolumbus.com/at-port-columbus/terminal-modernization-program
In 2013, the airport completed a US$140 million runway improvement. The south runway was moved farther from the north runway, creating a buffer distance which would enable simultaneous takeoffs and landing on both the north and south runways, and increase the volume of air traffic. Columbus mayor Michael B. Coleman commented, "as the city grows, the airport needs to grow with it."[tpl]cite web | last = Weese | first = Evan | title = Port Columbus ‘Staying Ahead of Demand Curve’ With New South Runway | publisher = Columbus Business First | date = August 22, 2013 | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2013/08/port-columbus-staying-ahead-of-demand.html?s=print[/tpl]

==Infrastructure==

===On-site facilities===

In 2001, Executive Jet Aviation (now known as NetJets, opened up a [tpl]convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] operational headquarters at Port Columbus International Airport.
In November 2006, Skybus Airlines began leasing [tpl]convert|100000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of office and hangar facilities at the Columbus International AirCenter adjacent to Port Columbus.

===Airfield===

The original 1929 layout for the airport covered [tpl]convert|524|acre|ha|0[/tpl], with two runways [tpl]convert|2500|and|3500|ft|m|-1[/tpl] long. In 1952 the current south runway was lengthened to [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m|-2[/tpl], making it the longest runway in the midwest at the time.  The north runway was extended to [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m|-2[/tpl] in 1997 and the south runway has since been extended to [tpl]convert|10125|ft|m|0[/tpl].
Port Columbus international Airport covers [tpl]convert|2185|acre|ha[/tpl] and has two runways:
Runway 10L/28R is just north of the 40th Parallel North.
The airport has its own police and fire departments (ARFF-C)

===Aircraft===

For the 12-month period ending January 1, 2009, the airport had 163,984 aircraft operations, an average of 449 per day: 44% air taxi, 18% general aviation, 37% scheduled commercial, and 1% military. There are 92 aircraft based at this airport: 46% single engine, 16% multi-engine, 37% jet aircraft, and 1% helicopters.

==Terminals, airlines and destinations==

The first major airline to fly into Port Columbus was TWA, and it kept a presence at Columbus over seventy years during the era of airline regulation.  TWA offered a club for exclusive passengers up until 2000 when America West took over a gate held by TWA and the club itself due to financial problems.
Port Columbus International Airport was formerly a hub of America West Airlines in the 1990s, but the company closed the hub in 2003. America West eliminated the Columbus hub as result of financial losses at the hub, overall financial losses at the airline, and a weak airline market after September 11, 2001.[ref][tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.psa-history.org/awa/cmh.html|title=America West in Columbus|publisher=PSA History Page|date=2003–2007|accessdate=July 22, 2007[/tpl]
[/ref]
The airport was the home base of short-lived Skybus Airlines, which began operations from Port Columbus on May 22, 2007. The airline touted themselves as the cheapest airline in the United States, offering a minimum of ten seats for $10 each on every flight. Skybus ceased operations April 4, 2008.
Port Columbus International Airport has 3 airport terminals, which contain 44 gates total: Concourse A (gates A1 – A7), Concourse B (gates B15 – B36), and Concourse C (gates C46 – C56).

==Incidents and accidents==

===June 27, 1954===

An American Airlines Convair CV-240 (N94263) from Dayton International Airport was on approach to Runway 27 at [tpl]convert|300|ft|m[/tpl] when the left side of the plane collided with a US Navy Beechcraft SNB-2C Navigator (BuA23773), also on approach. The Convair recovered and landed, though the nose gear collapsed on landing. The Beechcraft crashed short of the runway, killing two on board.
The probable cause was attributed to "A traffic control situation created by the tower local controller which he allowed to continue without taking the necessary corrective action. A contributing factor was the failure of both crews to detect this situation by visual and/or aural vigilance."

===January 7, 1990===

A Piper Aztec from Duluth, Minnesota, veered off the left side of the runway when the nose gear collapsed on landing. The aircraft was damaged significantly, though the pilot survived. The pilot reported having difficulty with the landing gear during taxi from Duluth, and witnesses reported seeing the nose gear of the aircraft canted 60 degrees left during landing.
The probable cause was attributed to "Pilot's inadequate preflight of the airplane and the continued operation of the airplane with a nose gear steering problem."

===July 1, 1991===

A New Creations Learjet 25XR (N458J) from Philadelphia International Airport lost sight of the runway on approach in heavy rain and lost directional control, resulting in no fatalities.
The probable cause was attributed to "The failure of the pilot to maintain visual reference with the runway during a landing, which resulted in a loss of directional control. Also causal to the accident was the pilot's failure to initiate a go-around, after he lost sight of the runway during the touchdown. Factors related to the accident were the heavy rain and the lack of runway centerline lights."

===January 7, 1994===

An Atlantic Coast Airlines/United Express BAe Jetstream 41 (N304UE) was on approach to runway 28L when it entered into a stall at [tpl]convert|430|ft|m[/tpl] above runway level. The aircraft collided with a stand of trees and came to rest inside a commercial building [tpl]convert|1.2|mi|km[/tpl] short of the runway and burst into flames. The accident killed two of three crewmembers and five of nine passengers.
The probable cause was attributed to ''"(1) An aerodynamic stall that occurred when the flight crew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a very poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline; (2) Improper pilot response to the stall warning, including failure to advance the power levers to maximum, and inappropriately raising the flaps; (3) Flight crew experience in 'glass cockpit' automated aircraft, aircraft type and in seat position, a situation exacerbated by a side letter of agreement between the company and its pilots; and (4) the company's failure to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, and the FAA's failure to require such criteria.
Member Vogt concluded that the last factor was contributory but not causal to the accident. Additionally, for the following two factors, Chairman Hall and Member Lauber concluded that they were causal to the accident, while Members Vogt and Hammerschmidt concluded they were contributory to the accident:
(5) The company's failure to provide adequate crew resource management training, and the FAA's failure to require such training; and (6) the unavailability of suitable training simulators that precluded fully effective flight crew training."''

===February 16, 1999===

America West Airlines flight 2811, an Airbus A320 (N628AW), experienced a landing gear malfunction during approach to CMH. After visual confirmation of the fault from the ground, the pilot initiated a missed approach and declared an emergency. On the second approach, the plane landed. Damage was limited to the nose landing gear rims and tires. The incident was very similar to the more recent JetBlue Airways Flight 292.http://www.airlinepilotforums.com/jetblue/1104-has-happened-before.html

===May 2, 1999===

During taxiing, a Cessna 172 accidentally entered a perimeter road instead of Taxiway Charlie. After turning onto the road, the Cessna struck a fence with its left wing. Investigation revealed that the perimeter road was unmarked.
The probable cause was attributed to "The pilot's failure to maintain obstacle clearance and his visual perception of the perimeter road as Taxiway Charlie. A factor in the accident was the absence of a sign identifying the perimeter road."

==Ground transportation==

===Car===

The airport is accessible directly by taking exit number nine on Interstate 670 to International Gateway. Alternatively, drivers located south of the airport can also get to the airport via Hamilton Road, just south of Interstate 270, and enter at Sawyer Road.
Parking is available long-term and short-term in the six-story attached parking garage, though the first two levels are dedicated to rental cars. Additional there is valet parking and long-term parking is also available in three outdoor lots along International Gateway, named blue (with some covered parking area), green and red. These lots access the terminal via a free shuttle, which runs continuously throughout the day. Additionally, there is a small free "cell phone lot" accessed from the outbound side of International Gateway.[ref]
