==History==

Producer and pedal steel guitar artist Pete Drake brought Tubb and his current line-up of the Texas Troubadours into the recording studio to record basic tracks in 1977. Unknown to Tubb, Drake later secretly brought in other famous country music singers and musicians to overdub vocals and instruments to the already recorded tracks. Special guests included such artists as Chet Atkins, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, Johnny Paycheck, Ferlin Husky, Waylon Jennings, George Jones, Marty Robbins, Conway Twitty, Charlie Rich and many others.[tpl]cite book| last = Pugh| first = Ronnie| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Ernest Tubb: The Texas Troubadour| publisher = Duke University Press| year = 1998| location = | pages = 295| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=m_cDTOIdVRcC&pg=RA1-PA295&dq=Ernest+Tubb+Legend+and+the+Legacy&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Ernest%20Tubb%20Legend%20and%20the%20Legacy&f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8223-2190-3[/tpl]
Drake intended two issues of the material recorded—hence the Volume 1—but due to poor distribution and sales, the album quickly went out of print. Subsequent reissues on CD included additional tracks.
It was reissued again on the 20th anniversary of its release in 1999 by First Generation Records in a limited run. The Pete Drake Music Group recently made the project available as a download or physical CD via Drake's First Generation Records online store at Bandcamp.

==Reception==

In his Allmusic review, Eugene Chadbourne said, "The highest possible rating for this project reflects its brilliance as a grand statement about country & western music, especially the incredible loyalty its artists have toward historic figures in the genre."
