==Research interests==

===Parapsychology===

Current research is employing the 'ganzfeld' procedure to study extrasensory perception (ESP). One of the aims of this research is to examine the extent to which findings from studies using this procedure are replicable. This research has been funded by the Bial Foundation, the Perrott-Warrick Fund, and the Society for Psychical Research.

===Psychology of deception===

This includes research on lie-detection as well as the psychology of magic. He has recently begun some pilot work examining recent attempts to improve peopleâ€™s ability to detect when someone is lying. Research on the psychology of conjuring is examining a range of cognitive biases that are involved in how people observe and interpret magic tricks.

===Offender profiling===

Recent research has involved critically evaluating the type of advice psychologists typically provide when asked to produce a 'profile' of the likely characteristics of an offender.

===Psychology of luck===

Smith's PhD research examined people's beliefs about luck, and why people might consider themselves lucky or unlucky. A current project is drawing together the psychological and philosophical literature on the concept of luck.
