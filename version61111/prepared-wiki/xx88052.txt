==Life and family==

William Mulready was born in Ennis, County Clare. Early in his life, in 1792, the family moved to London, where he was able to get an education and was taught painting well enough so that he was accepted at the Royal Academy School at the age of fourteen.
In 1802, he married Elizabeth Varley (1784–1864), a landscape painter. Their three children, Paul Augustus (1805–1864), William (1805–1878), and Michael (1807–1889) also became artists. His relationship with his wife however deteriorated gradually over the years, which is detailed in papers stored at the library of the Victoria and Albert Museum. His strong Catholic beliefs prevented any chance of a divorce but they separated. He accused her of "bad conduct" but shied from providing details. In a letter to him in 1827 she blamed him entirely for the collapse of their marriage, suggesting cruelty, pederastic activities and adultery were the reasons.[tpl]cite book  | last = Robinson | first = Leonard | title = William Etty; The Life and Art | publisher = McFarland | year = 2007 | location = Jefferson, N.C. | pages = 354 | url = http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=r7F7iYMo3yYC&dq=The+Life+and+Art+of+Leonard+Robinson&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=v5vRd1jlkQ&sig=7OmbZui4up-ZgLPqgda3WmvAW5c&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA354,M1 | isbn = 0-7864-2531-8 [/tpl]Brian Reade, Sexual Heretics, London, 1970. p. 16

==Artistic career==

Many of his early pictures show landscapes, before he started to build a reputation as a genre painter from 1808 on, painting mostly everyday scenes from rural life.  Besides this, he also illustrated books, including the first edition of Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare in 1807.[tpl]cite book  | last = Lamb | first = Charles | title = Tales from Shakespear designed for the use of young persons | publisher = Thomas Hodgkins | year = 1807 | location = London | pages =  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FSwJAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tales+from+Shakespear+designed+for+the+use+of+young+persons&as_brr=3&ei=CfPoSMamLIH-sQPuq4DvBg [/tpl]  His paintings were very popular in Victorian times.
