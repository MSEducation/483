The Donghae Nambu Line is a railway line connecting Busan to Pohang in South Korea.
The line runs along South Korea's east coast.

==History==

On October 31, 1918, an extension of the Daegu Line reached Pohang.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.silvernews.or.kr/?inc=newsview&no=675&s=14&ss=0&sss=0 |title=대구선 일부구간 이설 개통 |language=Korean |date=2005-11-14 |publisher=Silvernet News |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl] The section from Gyeongju to Pohang would become the oldest part of the future Donghae Nambu Line.  On October 25, 1921, a branch of the Daegu Line from Gyeongju to Taehwagang was opened.  On December 16, 1935,[tpl]cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=경영원칙 > 경영공시 > 영업현황 > 영업거리현황 |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-12-04[/tpl] Busan and Ulsan were linked up.  The new line and the two older sections built as part of the Daegu Line were combined into the new Donghae Nambu Line, with a length of [tpl]convert|145.8|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Busanjin to Pohang.

===Upgrade===

As of 2010, most of the line remains single-track and unelectrified. The entire line is to be upgraded to an electrified-double-tracked railway.

====Busan-Ulsan====

Planning for the upgrading of the line started in 1990 already, with the primary aim to improve commuter traffic; construction started in June 2003.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.krnetwork.or.kr/service/condition/RouteMapView.do?PA_MAP_ID=12425 |title=부산∼울산 복선전철 |publisher=Korea Rail Network Authority |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl] The section gets a new 72.1 km long alignment with several tunnels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.samboeng.co.kr/result/result02_40_eng.html |title=Detailed Design Proposal for Construction of Donghaenambu Line (Busan - Ulsan) Double Track Railway Lot 2 |publisher=Sambo Engineering |accessdate=2010-10-19[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cse.co.kr/eng/results/res_D.asp?idx=284 |title=Alternative design of railway construction for electrified double track on Donghae Nambu Line between Busan and Ulsan (Section 2) |publisher=Chunsuk Engineering |accessdate=2010-10-19[/tpl] Korea Rail Network Authority, Busan, and Ulsan city government is undertaking the upgrade. As of 2010, construction progress reached 32% of the total budget of 2,268.9 billion won. The completion of the upgrade is foreseen for 2015.
On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Busan-Ulsan section of the Donghae Nambu Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.[tpl]cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925474 |title=Bullet trains coming to a town near you by 2020 |date=2010-09-02 |publisher=JoongAng Daily |accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]

====Ulsan–Gyeongju–Pohang====

The line is to be replaced by a completely new alignment that circumvents downtown Gyeongju and connects to the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway at Singyeongju Station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.krnetwork.or.kr/service/condition/RouteMapView.do?PA_MAP_ID=12389 |title=울산∼포항 복선전철 |publisher=Korea Rail Network Authority |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl] In 2003, a feasibility study was prepared for the section.  Detailed design was started, and in May 2007, the government expected to realise the project from 2008 to 2011 at the earliest.[tpl]cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/05/09/2007050961003.html |title=KTX to Cut Seoul-Pohang Trip to 2 Hours in 2011 |date=2007-05-09 |publisher=The Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl]  The project was finally approved by the government on April 23, 2009, and a ground-breaking ceremony was held.

====Pohang–Samcheok extension====

At the time of thawing relations between South and North Korea, when the cross-border section of the Donghae Bukbu Line was reopened in 2007, the South Korean government considered the construction of a railway for freight traffic all along the east coast to the North Korean border.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.irail.net/webzine/krt/20071008/15356_cf_171_KRT_9.pdf |title=Trans-Korean Railway |journal=Korean Rail Technology (English) |volume=9 |pages=09–11 |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/south-koreas-growing-network.html |title=South Korea's growing network |date=2008-09-08 |publisher=Railway Gazette International |accessdate=2010-10-28[/tpl]  As part of the corridor, a new single-track, non-electrified line for 150 km/h would connect Pohang and Samcheok, the end of a branch of the Yeongdong Line.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.railjournal.com/altfeature1.shtml |title=Korea's railways face a bright future |date=2008-07-01 |publisher=International Railway Journal |archiveurl=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_7_48/ai_n27948208?tag=untagged |archivedate=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2010-10-28[/tpl] new line is to connect to the existing railhead at Samcheok.

The line sees passenger and freight traffic. As of October 2010, from Bujeon Station in Busan, cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains travel in around 1 hour 25 minutes to Ulsan and in around 2 hours 40 minutes to Pohang.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.korail.com/en/rv/pr21100/w_pr21110.jsp |title=Booking |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-10-28[/tpl]  Via the Gyeongbu, Daegu and Jungang Lines, Pohang and Ulsan are connected to Seoul with both intercity Saemaul-ho and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho services.
