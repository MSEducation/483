Kevin Joseph Witt (born January 5, 1976 in High Point, North Carolina) is an American professional baseball player. Witt spent parts of five seasons in the major leagues, appearing with the Blue Jays, San Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, most often as a designated hitter. He also played parts of two seasons in Japan, spending time with the Yokohama BayStars and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
Witt was drafted in the first round, 28th overall, by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1994 Major League Baseball Draft. Originally a shortstop, Witt was converted to first base while in the minors. He made his major league debut for the Blue Jays as a September call-up in 1998. His only significant playing time came with the Tigers in 2003, when he batted .263 in 93 games while splitting his time between designated hitter, first base, and left field.
After spending the 2004 season back in the minor leagues, Witt signed with the BayStars in 2005. He returned to North America the next season, where his 36 home runs for the Durham Bulls, Tampa Bay's AAA team led the minor leagues in 2006.http://minors.baseball-reference.com/bat_leaders.cgi?yid=2006&lvl=&lid=&sort=HR That earned him one last major league stint, where he batted .148 in 19 games for the Devil Rays.
