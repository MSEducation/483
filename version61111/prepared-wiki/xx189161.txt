==Legislative History==

Weinstein served as Assistant Majority Whip from 2005 to 2006.  After only two years in the Senate, Weinstein was chosen by the Senate Democratic Caucus to chair the Consumer Protection and Housing Committee.  Weinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Early Learning and K-12 Education Committee.  In 2005 at the Governor's request, Weinstein prime sponsored the Washington Learns bill, SB 5441.  Signed into law, the legislation required a comprehensive study of Washington's structure and funding of public education, including recommendations for reform.  Many of the recommendations have been adopted.  In 2007, he prime sponsored and helped pass the Insurance Fair  Conduct Act which made it unlawful for insurers to unreasonably deny a claim for coverage or payment of benefits.  The insurance industry and others tried to repeal the legislation through Referendum 67, but the voters  rejected  the insurance industries efforts to repeal Weinstein's law.  In 2008, Weinstein sponsored and passed SB 6381 which imposes a fiduciary duty on mortgage brokers (requiring mortgage brokers to act in the best interest of the borrower).  Weinstein was also instrumental in securing state funding for the Washington State Holocaust Education Resource Center. 
The Legislature failed to pass Weinstein's Homebuyer's Bill of Rights which would have held builders liable for shoddy construction.  In 2007 and 2008 the bill passed the Senate but was never brought to a vote before the full House of Representatives. In 2008, Weinstein announced he would return to the practice of law and not run for re-election.
