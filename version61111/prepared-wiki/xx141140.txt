The Millennium Party series was a collection of music compilations released by Rhino Records focusing on a specific genre for each album. The series was created to celebrate the dawn of the third millennium. The series was originally entitled Millennium Party, but added the New to coincide with the "New Millennium", and also to create a new title for their sequels. Only the funk and hip-hop albums received sequels.
All albums were released by Rhino Records and are available at their website. Almost all albums have no repeated artists, but the Rock 'n' Roll Party has two by The Drifters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000HZEG |title=Millennium Classic Rock Party: Various Artists: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01[/tpl] The Emotions' "Best of My Love" is featured on two albums.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000007RQ9 |title=Millennium Party: Funk: Various Artists: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-01[/tpl] Each album has about twenty songs.
