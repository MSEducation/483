The Lords of Discipline is a 1983 American film based on the novel by Pat Conroy and directed by Franc Roddam. The film stars David Keith, Robert Prosky, Judge Reinhold, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Michael Biehn, and Olympic boxer Mark Breland. The college scenes were filmed primarily at Wellington College in England, as none of the American military academies would allow filming on their grounds because of the book's less-than-positive portrayal of life at a military academy.

==The story==

The year is 1964, and Carolina Military Institute is about to do something it's never done in its entire history—allow a black man to become a member of the Corps of Cadets. Will McLean, a senior private, has been assigned to watch over him to ensure that he makes it through the year.  This assignment forces him to stand against the power of "the Ten," an alleged secret brotherhood within the Corps of Cadets sworn to uphold CMI's highest standards – by any and all means necessary.
