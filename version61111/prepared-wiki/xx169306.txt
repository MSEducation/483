The Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant is located at Flamanville, Manche, France on the Cotentin Peninsula.
It houses two pressurized water reactors (PWRs) that produce 1.3 GWe each and came into service in 1986 and 1987, respectively. It produced 18.9 TWh in 2005, which amounted to 4% of the electricity production in France. In 2006 this figure was about 3.3%.
In 2006, before the start of construction of unit 3, there were 671 workers regularly working at the two operational reactors.
The safety of the Flamanville plant has been questioned due to the danger of flooding of the kind experienced during the 1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood.The great lesson France has to learn from Fukushima Deciphering Fukushima, published 2011-03-08, accessed 2012-05-08

==Unit 3==

Construction on a new reactor, Flamanville 3, began on 4 December 2007.  The new unit is an Areva European Pressurized Reactor type and is planned to have a nameplate capacity of 1,650 MWe. 
EDF has previously said France's first EPR would cost €3.3 billion and start commercial operations in 2012, after construction lasting 54 months.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&storyCode=2048041 |title=Flamanville 3 concrete poured |newspaper=Nuclear Engineering International |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2011[/tpl]
