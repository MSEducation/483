The  luncheon meat often also contains garlic, basil or sweet peppers for additional flavor.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl] Olive loaf is a loaf-type luncheon meat, traditionally cooked in a loaf pan as opposed to a sausage cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive loaf is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive loaf contains mostly chicken or turkey.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl] Since most less expensive bologna is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive loaf in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive loaf is a sausage like bologna.[tpl]fact|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Olive loaf is similar to pimento loaf, the primary difference being the addition of pickles in place of olives.
