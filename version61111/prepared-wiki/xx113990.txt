The Moei River ([tpl]Lang-th|แม่น้ำเมย[/tpl], [tpl]RTGS|Maenam Moei[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-th|mɛ̂ːnáːm mɤːj|IPA[/tpl]) is a tributary of the Salween River. Unlike most rivers in Thailand the Moei River flows north in a NW direction. 
It originates in Phop Phra district, Tak Province, flowing then from South to North across Mae Sot, Mae Ramat and Tha Song Yang disctricts, finally entering the Salween River within the limits of Sop Moei district of Mae Hong Son Province. The river is 327 km long.
The Yuam River joins its left bank only 7 km before its confluence with the Salween. Many fish species inhabit its waters, including the Giant river catfish.Breeding and nursing of Asiatic shovelnose catfish, Aorichthys seenghala (Sykes, 1841). (by W. Ratanatrivong, N.
