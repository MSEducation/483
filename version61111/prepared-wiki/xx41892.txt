==Way of St. James==

Condom is a town on the Via Podiensis, one of the three major French arms of the pilgrimage route, the Way of St. James. This particular route begins in Le Puy and ends in Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain. Pilgrims arrive at Condom after Miradoux and continue on to Larressingle.

==Name==

There is no relationship between the English word condom and this town. The toponym Condom comes from the Gaulish words condate-ó-magos which means "market of the confluence". Condatómagos evolved into Condatóm and then into Conddóm. Condom was first recorded in Latin in the 10th century as Condomus or Condomium.Ernest Nègre , "Toponymie générale de la France, Volume 1", p.192 http://books.google.be/books?id=rsNpi7IVulEC&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=Condom+toponymie&source=bl&ots=dQRjRmiaOi&sig=7jGgvCheVBeoNAIMOF9T6bdZUfY&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=i7RdUobhI8TF0QXXk4CQDw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Condom%20toponymie&f=false
Though the French word for a condom is préservatif, in 1995 the town's mayor, taking advantage of the incidental relationship between the town's name and the English word, opened a museum of famous population-control devices, which closed in 2005.[tpl]cite news|last=Meslin |first=Franck |title=La capote colle toujours à la peau de Condom Tous les projets ont capoté|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2012/08/04/la-capote-colle-toujours-a-la-peau-de-condomtous-les-projets-ont-capote-786852-2362.php|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=Sud-Ouest|date=4 August 2012[/tpl]
