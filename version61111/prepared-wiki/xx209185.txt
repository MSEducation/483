The National Basketball Association (NBA) presents 12 annual awards to recognize its teams, players, and coaches for their accomplishments. The NBA championship trophy is called the Larry O'Brien Trophy. First introduced in the 1978 NBA Finals, it is awarded annually to the winner of the NBA Finals.
The NBA's championship trophy was first awarded after the inaugural NBA Finals in 1947. In 1964, it was named after Walter A. Brown, in honor of the original owner of the Boston Celtics who was instrumental in merging the Basketball Association of America and the National Basketball League into the NBA in 1949.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/walter-a-brown|title=Walter A.

Aside from annual awards, the league also awards players and coaches weekly and monthly awards.
Each individual award, with the exception of the Finals MVP, is awarded at the end of the regular season while the NBA Playoffs are ongoing. This is different from the other major professional sports leagues where they hand out individual awards after their postseasons have concluded.
