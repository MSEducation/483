There are a number of varieties of chow mein.

==Etymology==

The pronunciation chow mein comes from the Taishan dialect of Chinese, spoken by immigrants from Taishan to America. In Taishanese, it is pronounced chāu-mèing. The lightly pronounced Taishanese [tpl]IPA|ŋ[/tpl], resembling the end of a Portuguese nasal vowel, was taken to be [tpl]IPA|/n/[/tpl] by English speakers.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section.

==Regional cuisine==

===American Chinese cuisine===

In American Chinese cuisine, it is a stir-fried dish consisting of noodles, meat (chicken being most common but pork, beef or shrimp sometimes being substituted), onions and celery. It is often served as a specific dish at westernized Chinese restaurants.
There are two main kinds of chow meins available on the market: 1) Steamed chow mein, and 2) Crispy chow mein, also known as Hong Kong style chow mein (see below). The steamed chow mein has a softer texture, while the latter is crisper and drier.  Crispy chow mein uses fried, flat noodles, while soft chow mein uses long, rounded noodles.http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/Dictionary/C/Chow-mein-noodles-fried-5043.aspx
Crispy chow mein has either onions and celery in the finished dish or is served "strained," without any vegetables. Steamed chow mein can have many different kinds of vegetables in the finished dish; most commonly including onions and celery but also sometimes carrots, cabbage and mung bean sprouts as well.  Crispy chow mein is usually topped with a thick brown sauce, while steamed chow mein is mixed with soy sauce before being served.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.madeinfallriver.com/content/pounds-noodles-pile-chow-mein-factory |title=The pounds – of noodles – pile up at chow mein factory |publisher=Made In Fall River |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2010-09-12[/tpl]
There is a regional difference in the US between the East and West Coast use of the term "chow mein." On the East Coast, "chow mein" is always the crispy or "Hong Kong style.""Classic Cantonese Chow Mein With Fried Noodles – That Was Then. Sophistication, Freshness And Delicacy – This Is Now". Philadelphia Inquirer, November 9, 1988. At some restaurants located in these areas the crispy chow mein noodles are sometimes deep fried"In Search of Chow Mein". New York Times, November 23, 1997. and could be as crispy "like the ones in cans""Chow Mein Lives".

Los Angeles Times, April 15, 1999. At a few East Coast locations, "chow mein" is also served over rice."Chinese Dishes, American Style". New York Times, April 13, 1983.  Here, the steamed style using soft noodles is a separate dish called  "lo mein".  On the West Coast, "chow mein" is always the steamed style, the crispy style is simply called "Hong Kong style".  There, the term "lo mein" is not widely used.
The crispy version of chow mein can also be served in a hamburger-style bun as a Chow mein sandwich.
There are also variations on how either one of the two main types of chow mein can be prepared as a dish.  When ordering "chow mein" in some restaurants in Chicago, a diner might received "chop suey poured over crunchy fried noodles"."Theories on origin of other Chinese foods". Chicago Tribune, November 03, 2005. In Philadelphia, Americanize chow mein tends to be similar to chop suey but would have crispy fried noodles on the side and includes lots of celery and bean sprouts and sometimes accompanied with fried rice."Top Spots For Chow Mein In The Region".  CBS Philly, September 10, 2013. Jeremy Iggers of the Star Tribune describes Minnesota-style chow mein as "a green slurry of celery and ground pork topped with ribbons of gray processed chicken"."Restaurant review: Chow mein". Star Tribune. October 27, 1999. Bay Area journalist William Wong made a similar comment about what is sold as chow mein in places like Minnesota."Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asian America". By William Wong (2010), Temple University Press, Pages 92–94. The essay in this book was original published in the East-West News, July 21, 1988 as an article titled "Minnesota Chow Mein".

Chow mein is mentioned as early as 1920, in the novel Main Street by Sinclair Lewis.books.google.com Main street novel by sinclair Lewis(Lewis, Sinclair), "Main Street" (1920), Project Gutenberg.
Although frequently confused with chop suey, a dished incorrectly labeled as chow mein was sometimes served in American restaurants, drug store soda fountains,"Fountain Specials for the Peoples Drug Store ad". Free Lance–Star, April 8, 1982, Page 10. school cafeterias,"School lunch menus". South Coast Today, October 20, 1996. senior citizens facilities,"Ruthton News".

In 1946, one of the first companies to market "chow mein" in a can was Chun King."RJR Sending Chun King To Orient". Chicago Tribune, June 22, 1989. The product's creator was Jeno Paulucci, the son of Italian immigrants, who developed a recipe based mostly upon Italian spices that would be better catered to the food preferences of European immigrants and some Americans of similar ethnic origins."Food Giant's Green Thumb Grew 2 Big Successes". Chicago Tribune, March 23, 1987."Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93". New York Times, November 25, 2011."What Makes Jeno Paulucci Happy? Italian Influence, Clean Lakes, Punctuality and Pizza Eaters". People, September 13, 1976, Volume 6, Number 11. To keep cost down, Paulucci ingeniously substituted expensive water chestnuts with lower cost celery stalks that were originally destined for cattle feed. Paulucci's company became so successful selling canned chow mein and chop suey that President Gerald Ford quipped “What could be more American than a business built on a good Italian recipe for chop suey?" when praising Paulucci accomplishments with Chun King."Jeno Paulucci, pioneer of frozen-food business, dies at 93". Washington Post, November 30, 2011."Remarks Of The President At The Italian-American Foundation Bicentennial Tribute Dinner". September 16, 1976. After Paulucci sold Chun King in 1966, the company would be sold several more times more until it was dissolved in 1995.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-04-04/business/1995094157_1_chun-king-wesson-manufacturing-operations

===Brazilian Japanese cuisine===

Chow mein was brought to Brazil by Japanese immigrants and is thus referred as yakisoba ([tpl]IPA-pt|jakiˈsoβɐ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-pt|jakisoˈba|[/tpl]). It fits Brazilian tastes rather than Japanese ones though, and is thus more similar to the North American versions of chow mein.
Pastelarias and Asian restaurants serve it in the entire country. They generally are presented in chicken (the most common), beef, shrimp and pork versions, with vegetarian and egg versions being much rarer. Brazilian yakisoba is typically served much more al dente than the Japanese, being also heavy in shoyu (soy sauce), azeite de gergelim (sesame oil) and vegetables, almost always including at least carrot, cabbage, onion and at least one dark green species (usually other than kale, collard, spinach, chicory or mustard) such as Chinese cabbage, and less often either bean sprouts, broccoli/broccolini, zucchini, shiitake, bell pepper and/or cucumber.
Also popular is yakibifum ([tpl]IPA-pt|jakibiˈfũ|[/tpl], from Japanese yakibīfun), its equivalent that instead of a wheat noodles uses rice vermicelli. Brazilian spring rolls' (rolinhos-primavera or harumakis) fillings generally use the same ingredients of the stir-fried noodles in the restaurants or fast-food chains they are found, though spring rolls may have cheese, usually white (such as catupiry or other kinds of requeijão, or queijo minas), or tofu instead of meat, what is uncommon for the noodles. All of them, but most often and especially spring rolls, may be served with bright red molho agridoce (soursweet sauce), that combines ketchup, vinegar, sugar, star anise and other spice.

===Canadian Chinese cuisine===

Canadian westernized Chinese restaurants may offer up to three different types of chow mein, none of which is identical to either of the two types of American chow mein. Cantonese style chow mein contains deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles, green peppers, pea pods, bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, shrimp, Chinese roast pork (char siu), chicken, and beef, and is served in a thick sauce. Plain chow mein is similar to other Western chow meins but contains far more mung bean sprouts; some regional recipes may substitute bean sprouts for noodles completely. In Canada, Hong Kong style chow mein is similar to plain chow mein but is always served on a bed of deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles.  The Japanese Canadian community also have their own version of chow mein that might include dried seaweed and pickle ginger and could be served in a bun."The Legacy of the Cumberland Chow Mein". The Bulletin (Japanese Canadian Citzens Association), May 29, 2013."Japanese-Canadian chow mein: Chow mein — with seaweed and pickled ginger — never tasted so good". Toronto Star, March 8, 2011.

===South Asian Chinese cuisine===

Chow mein is also common in Bangladeshi Chinese, Indian Chinese and Pakistani Chinese cuisine. In India, it was introduced by the Chinese of Calcutta. It is usually offered Hakka or with gravy. Catering to vegetarian diets, there is an Indian variant, vegetable chow mein, which consists of noodles with cabbage, bamboo shoots, pea pods, green peppers, and carrots.  In the New Delhi area, chow mein can sometimes include paneer with the mixture of noodles and vegetables. Another non-meat Indian variant includes scrambled egg as a protein source."Recipe: Egg Chowmein" Zee News, January 21, 2013."Egg Hakka Chowmein". Recipe on gourmetindia.com.

===Nepalese Chinese cuisine===

Tibetans who settled in Nepal brought chow mein with them. It is a popular fast food in Nepal. The Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley use water buffalo meat and chicken in their cuisine, and chow mein in Nepal is often cooked with onion, vegetables and buff (water buffalo meat).

===Caribbean Chinese cuisine===

Many West Indian people include chow mein in their cuisine, especially peoples from islands like Trinidad and Tobago"Recipe: Eight-Treasure Trini Chow Mein". NPR, February 1, 2011."Chinese New Year, Trinidad-Style". NPR, February 2, 2011. and Jamaica which include a significant ethnic Chinese population; much of the cooking has infused itself into the population in general. As well, in the South American country Guyana the culture and cuisine is similar to the Caribbean's."Guyanese-style chicken chowmein": Sometimes you just crave chowmein. Using chowmein noodles, marinaded chicken, and veggies like beans, carrots, and green onion, you can make your own version at home". Christian Science Monitor, January 29, 2013."Guyanese chow mein: A traditional Guyanese dish that reveals a fusion of Asian influences". Christian Science Monitor, April 30, 2011. These chow mein dishes are cooked in a similar manner, with green beans, carrots, peas, onions and sometimes other vegetables. Meat used is mostly chicken and sometimes pork and/or shrimp. The main difference is that local spices are added, and the dish is often served with hot Scotch bonnet peppers and/or pepper sauce.
In Cuba, aside from the foreign owned tourist hotels which often serve Western-style Chinese food, local Chinese restaurants can be found in Havana that offer a distinct Cuban style.
In Panama, chow mein is prepared with a mixture of shredded carrots and cabbage with pork or chicken and served over noodles. Another recipe includes canned corn."El "Chow Mein" es panameño; La ancestral receta es diferente a la nuestra. Hemos creado un plato a nuestro gusto, que de chino solamente tiene los fideos". Panamá América, March 31, 1997. (In Spanish)

===Peruvian Chinese cuisine===

Chinese food (Chifa) is very popular in Peru and is now a part of mainstream Peruvian culture.  Chow Mein is known to Peruvians as Tallarín salteado and may contain peppers, onions, green onions, and tomatoes."Lunch Bunch: A Peruvian twist; Andes fare meets Mexican eatery".
