Afsāneh Ballet ([tpl]lang-fa|گروه رقص افسانه[/tpl]) is a non-profit cultural organization devoted to the art, dance, music, and poetry of the Iranian cultural continent (Iran, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Western China). The word "Afsaneh" is a Persian word and means "myth" or "fable". The dynamic group presents performances and activities featuring dance, poetry, and music of the Silk Road — the historic trade route that stretched thousands of kilometers across Central Asia from the China Sea in the east to the Mediterranean in the west. Afsaneh Ballet is considered to be one of the foremost proponents of world dance and Persian dance in particular.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl]
In 2003, Afsaneh Art and Culture Society launched a translation project. The aim of this project is to increase the visibility of the contemporary Iranian literature on the world stage, create a greater opportunity for the literature to be part of the modern conversation and to receive its deserved international recognition.
In 2005 the organization launched a cultural exchange project with artists in Tajikistan. The Tajik Dance Initiative  engages Tajik artists, scholars and arts administrators with their international counterparts, creating opportunities for collaborative work, and support for the dance artists and related expressive arts of Tajikistan.
