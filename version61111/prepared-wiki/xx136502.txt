Following his honorable discharge, he worked briefly for the Allstate Insurance Company before moving to the Ford Motor Company, where he spent ten years with Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division prior to joining Nissan.
Soon after arriving at Nissan Thomas was running its sales operations, and in a 1988 reorganization that divided the company into three entities (Nissan, Infiniti and parts and service) Thomas was made a vice president and head of the Nissan division. In 1993 he succeeded Thomas Mignanelli as corporate president and CEO when Mignanelli retired after heart surgery. However, after 21-month slide in sales, Nissan announced on October 7, 1997, that Thomas was resigning for personal reasons. He was replaced by Minoru Nakamura, then-current chairman of Nissan Motors USA and president of Nissan North America (the parent company of Nissan Motors USA).
In July 2000, Roberts was named chief executive officer for North American operations of Edmunds.com, responsible for North American sales and marketing, partner relationship management and business development. In November of that same year, he was promoted to corporate chief operating officer, with Peter Steinlauf (the controlling shareholder) assuming the titles of chairman and CEO.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.edmunds.com/about/press/edmundscom-promotes-members-of-executive-management-team.html | title=Edmunds.com Promotes Members of Executive Management Team | date=November 22, 2000[/tpl] He served in that position until his retirement in August 2004.[tpl]citation | url=http://www.edmunds.com/about/press/edmundscom-promotes-jeremy-anwyl-to-ceo-avi-steinlauf-to-president.html | title=Edmunds.com Promotes Jeremy Anwyl to CEO, Avi Steinlauf to President | date=June 12, 2007[/tpl]
