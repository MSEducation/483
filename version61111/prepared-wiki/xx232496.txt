==Politics==

Cummings is active in local and national politics and has often been consulted for fundraising strategies on the technology and web side of campaigns.
Most recently, Cummings served as Director of Internet Finance for Hillary Clinton’s historic presidential bid from February to June 2008. As an integral cog to Clinton’s fundraising resurgence in the winter of 2008, Cummings is credited with being part of the largest single day of online fundraising ($10 million in 24 hours) in American presidential campaign history.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/24/hillary-clinton-raises-10_n_98428.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Hillary Clinton Raises $10 Million After Pennsylvania Win | date=April 24, 2008[/tpl] 

==Director of Internet Finance (Hillary Clinton Presidential Bid 2008)==

Cummings was first sought out by the Hillary Clinton campaign by campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe on July 9, 2008 after organizing a $215,000 fundraiser in Syracuse, McAuliffe’s home town. After initially working as a satellite consultant, Cummings joined the Hillary Clinton campaign in Arlington, Virginia, as an unpaid volunteer in February.
Clinton's fundraising, which had lagged behind Barack Obama's, began to improve soon after Cummings joined the campaign in February. Clinton’s online fundraising began to account for nearly 75% of her monthly totals, mainly in small contributions. In February, the campaign raised $30 million of its $35 million monthly total online, the single largest fundraising month for the campaign. Contributions averaged $100 during this period, and nearly 25% of all contributions were from new donors.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/us/politics/29donate.html?scp=8&sq=Hillary%20Clinton%20fundraising%20february%202008&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Obama and Clinton Flush With Cash From February | first1=Michael | last1=Luo | first2=Jeff | last2=Zeleny | date=February 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl]
Political bloggers were frequently critical of Cummings during the campaign, alleging that he had effectively turned the Internet into an ATM for campaign finance.http://www.personaldemocracy.com/blog/entry/1874/daily_digest_the_obama_money_bomb_bombs
Cummings is said to have financed his participation in the campaign himself and received no compensation from the campaign after it was suspended in June.http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2008/04/what_the_clinton_campaign_lear.html
