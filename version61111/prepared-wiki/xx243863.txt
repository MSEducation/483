==History==

CF Barcelona, which was sponsored by FC Barcelona, was a founder member of the Spanish League in 1988, and won the 1994 Copa de la Reina. It had a successful 3-year run in the early 1990s, winning the 1994 national cup and being the championship's runner-up in 1992 and 1994, but it subsequently declined to bottom table positions.
In 2001 CF Barcelona was incorporated to FC Barcelona as an official section as the Spanish League was refounded into the Superliga Femenina, but it wasn't accepted due to its results in the previous season. After two unsuccessful appearances in the promotion playoffs the team was promoted in 2004. It ended in mid table positions for the next two seasons, but in 2007 it ended last and it was thus relegated.
Barcelona returned to the Superliga the next year, and between 2009 and 2011 it consolidated itself in the top positions. In 2011 it won its second Spanish Cup, beating local rival RCD Espanyol 1–0 in the final,[tpl]cite web|title=FC Barcelona, campeón de la Copa de SM La Reina tras vencer al RCD Espanyol (1-0)|url=http://www.rfef.es/index.jsp?nodo=119&ID=1479|publisher=rfef.es|accessdate=19 June 2011|language=Spanish|date=19 June 2011[/tpl] and in 2012 it won its first national championship with a record 94 points,[tpl]cite web|title=El Barça femenino, campeón de Liga |url=http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20120527/mundo-barsa/barca-barca-femenino-liga-campeonas_54300366310.html|publisher=mundodeportivo.com|accessdate=27 May 2012|language=Spanish|date=27 May 2012[/tpl] qualifying for the first time for the UEFA Champions League, where it was defeated by Arsenal FC in the first round.
