==Parkersburg-New Hartford, Iowa Tornado==

A strong supercell developed in northeast Iowa, west of Waterloo in the late afternoon of May 25, 2008. The first tornado warning of the cell was issued at 4:22 pm CDT (2122 UTC) for the Parkersburg area, The first tornado from this cell was reported near Aplington in Butler County at 4:48 pm CDT. It then tracked toward Parkersburg, intensifying to EF5 strength before slamming into the southern part of the community just before 5:00 pm CDT. Many homes and businesses were completely leveled there. Several of the destroyed homes were well-built, and cleanly swept from their foundations. 7 people died in Parkersburg, several of which were taking shelter in basements. However, the tornado was violent enough that it ripped away the floors above that were anchored to the foundations, leaving the victims in the basement exposed. At some residences, the anchor bolts themselves were pulled out of the foundation perimeter.https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/141533.pdf A rebar anchor was found snapped in half at one home, and shrubs were uprooted and stripped in some areas.http://www.wibw.com/blogs/jeremy/19301464.html A large industrial building was completely destroyed, with steel girders twisted and broken, and most of the foundation swept clean of debris. At that time, the tornado was estimated to be about 7/10 mile (1.1 km) wide. On the east side of Parkersburg, the tornado struck a golf course and a newly built subdivision. Multiple homes were swept away at that location, two of which had no debris left within 200 yards of the foundations. One of the two homes was very well-built. At one house that was swept away, a thick, poured concrete wall that was part of a walk-out basement cracked at the base and was pushed over. The concrete basement floor of that home was cracked as well. Structural debris from the town and golf course subdivision was finely granulated into small pieces, many no larger than coins.[ref]

After passing through Parkersburg, the tornado continued eastward toward New Hartford, impacting a housing development on the northern side of the community at 5:09 pm CDT. Multiple well-built homes with anchor bolts were completely swept away, and debris was again finely granulated into small wood chips. Trees were completely debarked, low-lying vegetation was shredded, and vehicles were thrown and mangled beyond recognition. Intense cycloidal scouring occurred in farm fields, and wet topsoil and corn stubble was removed and plastered against structures, fences, and utility poles.https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/141533.pdf The tornado then passed just north of Waterloo and Cedar Falls and shrunk to about 1/4 mile (400 m) in width as it continued to impact rural areas. The tornado was weaker at this point, and damage ranged mostly from EF2 to EF3 along the rest of the track. As the tornado approached Dunkerton, it turned to the east-northeast and grew to 1.2 miles (2 km) wide. Farms were badly damaged in this area.  Shortly before reaching Fairbank, the tornado dissipated, at which point it was replaced by a second tornado, about a mile and a half south of Fairbank. This second EF3 tornado struck the community of Hazleton, where homes and mobile homes were destroyed.
Catastrophic damage occurred in Parkersburg as much of the town was destroyed. Seven people were killed in Parkersburg and two were killed in New Hartford, where the housing development was destroyed. 288 homes in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford were damaged or destroyed. A final assessment determined that the tornado was an EF5 with estimated peak winds of about 205 miles per hour (330 km/h).[ref]
