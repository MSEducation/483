[[Abraham's House]]

CATEGORIES: West Bank

Abraham's House was the name once given to a ruined structure at Ramet-el-Khulil near Hebron. It was identified as the spot where the Biblical character Abraham pitched his tent beneath the oak (sometimes identified as a terebinth) of Mamre.  This oak was for centuries venerated as an object of worship, until Constantine supposedly put a stop to this practice by erecting a basilica.
