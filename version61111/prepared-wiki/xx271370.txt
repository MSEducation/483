Sing, Boy, Sing is a 1958 musical-drama film, released by 20th Century Fox. The film starred two newcomers, Tommy Sands and Lili Gentle.
The film was an expansion of the January 1957 Kraft Television Theatre episode  "The Singin' Idol", also starring Sands. Sands, billed by the studio as a potential new teen idol, played an Elvis Presley-type singer. 
The film was Gentle's only starring role, and her penultimate film appearance. 20th Century Fox had plans to promote Gentle as its new dashing red-head, but the right type of roles to offer her did not materialize.[tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Sing, Boy, Sing was released in the United States in February 1958, to positive reviews, but did rather poorly at the box-office, despite being somewhat popular with teenage audiences.[tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
