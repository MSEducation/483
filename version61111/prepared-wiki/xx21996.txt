==Programs==

The foundation encourages communities across the nation to become Tree City USAs by meeting four standards:
The Nature Explore program is a program designed to help educators, parents, and caregivers connect young children with nature. The program has grown steadily to provide activities and projects for preschool through third grade as well as give educators an opportunity to build and certify a Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom using safe, durable, natural components. Children experience enhanced learning and development as they are provided a daily connection with nature in Nature Explore Classrooms at early childhood education centers, elementary schools, and other public spaces across the country.
Tree Campus USA colleges and universities strive to engage their student body as well as their broader community to establish and sustain healthy community forests for the benefit of current and future residents.http://www.arborday.org/programs/treecampususa/
