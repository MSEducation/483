==Involvement in Stanleybet shutdown==

In November 2008, the government of Greece shut down the Greek operations of Liverpool-based Stanleybet International, an European gambling company.  Stanleybet had recently opened two offices in Greece and was to be a major competitor to OPAP.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_economy_1_05/11/2008_101849 | title=Tax inspectors set sights on Stanleybet | publisher=Kathimerini | accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl]  The government acted on OPAP's public complaints and raided Stanleybet offices on November 7, 2008, confiscating their assets.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1226062030.81/ | title=Greek police raid Stanleybet outlet at OPAP's behest | publisher=EUbusiness | accessdate=2008-12-08[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
One of the complaints expressed by protests during the 2008 Greek riots was the government's fast action in acting on behalf of OPAP to remove competition, whereas for issues affecting public safety or the rights of the people the government has been popularly thought to be slow-acting.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/08/greece | title=Athenian democracy in ruins | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=2008-12-08 | location=London | first=Kat | last=Christofer | date=2008-12-08[/tpl]
