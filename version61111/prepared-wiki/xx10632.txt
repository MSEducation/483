Racial segregation is separation of humans into racial groups in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, riding on a bus, or in the rental or purchase of a home.Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium, Michael Schill & Susan Wachter, Cityscape Segregation itself is defined by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation".ECRI General Policy Recommendation N°7: National legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination — Explanatory memorandum, Para. 16 According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, "The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature".Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 — para. 27
Racial segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by Thomas Schelling's models of segregation and subsequent work.Thomas C. Schelling (1969) "Models of segregation", American Economic Review, 1969, 59(2), 488–493.  Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to vigilante violence (such as lynchings) Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as separation or de facto separation of the races rather than segregation. In the United States, legal segregation  was required in some states and came with "anti-miscegenation laws" (prohibitions against interracial marriage).E.g., Virginia Racial Integrity Act, Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59 Segregation, however, often allowed close contact in hierarchical situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Segregation can involve spatial separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races.

==Historical cases==

Racial segregation has appeared in all parts of the world where there are multiracial communities. Where racial amalgamation has occurred on a large scale, as in Hawaii and Brazil, there was no legal segregation, however, there has been occasional social discrimination.Racial segregation.

===Jewish segregation===

Jews in Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated ghettos and shtetls.Wirth, Louis. The Ghetto. Transaction Publishers (1997), pp. 29–40. ISBN 1-56000-983-7. In 1204 the papacy required Jews to segregate themselves from Christians and to wear distinctive clothing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/margin/jew.htm |title=A Short History of the Jewish Tradition |publisher=.kenyon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] Forced segregation of Jews spread throughout Europe during the 14th and 15th centuries.Ghetto. Encyclopædia Britannica. In the Russian Empire, Jews were restricted to the so-called Pale of Settlement, the Western frontier of the Russian Empire corresponding roughly to the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.[tpl]cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=Anti-Semitism in modern Europe |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] By the early 20th century, the majority of European Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement.
Jewish population were confined to mellahs in Morocco beginning from the 15th century. In cities, a mellah was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural mellahs were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G.

===Anglo-Saxons in England===

Segregation may have existed in early Anglo-Saxon England, restricting intermarriage and resulting in the displacement of the native British population by Germanic incomers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html |title=Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] According to research led by the University College London, Anglo-Saxon settlers enjoyed substantial social and economic advantages over Celtic Britons.Thomas, Mark G. et al. Evidence for a segregated social structure in early Anglo-Saxon England. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 273(1601): 2651–2657. However, Stephen Oppenheimer and Bryan Sykes argue that there was no population displacement, as the Anglo-Saxons had relatively little genetic impact on England.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/09/blood_of_the_british.php |title=Gene Expression: Blood of the Wakas Wakas |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?search_term=oppenheimer&id=7817 |title=Special report: 'Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer | Prospect Magazine October 2006 issue 127 |publisher=Prospect-magazine.co.uk |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] In 2002, the BBC used the headline "English and Welsh are races apart" to report a genetic survey of test subjects from market towns in England and Wales."English and Welsh are Races Apart", BBC, 30 June 2002

===English Settlers in Ireland===

The Statutes of Kilkenny were a series of thirty-five acts passed at Kilkenny in 1366. They forbad the intermarriage between the native Irish and the English settlers in Ireland, the English fostering of Irish children, the English adoption of Irish children and use of Irish names and dress.Simms, Katherine. "Gaelicization." Medieval Ireland An Encyclopedia. 1st ed. Routledge 2005., p.191

===French Algeria===

Following its conquest of Ottoman controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century France maintained colonial rule in the territory which has been described as "quasi-apartheid"."Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony. It was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." Bell, David Scott. Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France, Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36. The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to apply for French citizenship only if they abandoned their Muslim identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that this established "the formal structures of a political apartheid"."the senatus-consulte of 1865 stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under French jurisdiction, i.e., French nationals subjected to French laws, but it restricted citizenship only to those who renounced their Muslim religion and culture. There was an obvious split in French legal discourse: a split between nationality and citizenship which established the formal structures of a political apartheid encouraging the existence of 'French subjects' disenfranchised, without any rights to citizenship, treated as objects of French law and not citizens". Debra Kelly. Autobiography And Independence: Selfhood and Creativity in North African Postcolonial Writing in French, Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 43. Camille Bonora-Waisman writes that, "in contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates", this "colonial apartheid society" was unique to Algeria."In contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates, Algeria was made an integral part of France and became a colony of settlement for more than one million Europeans... under colonial rule, Algerians encountered France's 'civilising mission' only through the plundering of lands and colonial apartheid society..." Bonora-Waisman, Camille. France and the Algerian Conflict: Issues in Democracy and Political Stability, 1988–1995, Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p. 3.
This "internal system of apartheid" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection."As a settler colony with an internal system of apartheid, administered under the fiction that it was part of metropolitan France, and endowed with a powerful colonial lobby that virtually determined the course of French politics with respect to its internal affairs, it experienced insurrection in 1954 on the part of its Muslim population." Wall, Irwin M. France, the United States, and the Algerian War, University of California Press, 2001, p. 262.

===Germany===

In the early 14th century, some guilds in the cities of North-East Germany introduced statutes, under which persons of Wendish, i.e. Slavic, origin were forbidden from joining the guild."The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present" (pdf). According to Wilhelm Raabe, "down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend."Raabe, p. 189.
The ban on interracial marriage was a part of the Nuremberg Laws, which prohibited sexual relations and marriages between people classified as "Aryan" and "non-Aryan." Such relationships were called Rassenschande (race defilement).  At first the laws were aimed primarily at Jews but were later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes and their bastard offspring".[tpl]cite book | author = S. H.

Rupp, Mobilizing Women for War, p 125, ISBN 0-691-04649-2 To preserve the so-called purity of the German blood, after the war began, the Nazis extended the race defilement law to include all foreigners (non-Germans).[tpl]cite book|author = Diemut Majer | title = "Non-Germans" Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939-1945 | year = 2003|publisher = JHU Press | isbn=978-0-8018-6493-3 | page = 180[/tpl]
Under the General Government of occupied Poland in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of Kashubians and Gorals (Goralenvolk), based on these groups' alleged "Germanic component."
During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear yellow ribbons or stars of David, and were, along with Romas (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors and professors were not allowed to treat Aryan (effectively, gentile) patients or teach Aryan pupils, respectively.
The Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3–5 pm in Jewish stores.  After Kristallnacht ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 marks for damages done by the Nazi troops and SS members.
Jews and Roma were subjected to genocide as "undesirable" "racial" groups in the Holocaust. The Nazis established ghettos to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into de facto concentration camps. The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people.  The Ghetto Litzmannstadt was the second largest, holding about 160,000.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=23 November 1939 |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl]
Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million Polish citizens were transported to the Reich for forced labour (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside Nazi Germany).[tpl]cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, Poles, along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler’s Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Vli1|archivedate=27 May 2012[/tpl] were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear identifying red tags with "P"s sewn to their clothing, subjected to a curfew, and banned from public transportation.
While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with Germans outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (Rassenschande or "racial defilement") were punishable by death.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl]

===Imperial China===

====Tang dynasty====

Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the Han chinese during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced usury. The magristrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom. In 836, when Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&pg=PA22&dq=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate#v=onepage&q=chinese%20uighurs%20779%20edict%20lure%20canton%20836%20foreigners%20and%20chinese%20lu%20governor%20forbade%20marriages%20forced%20separate&f=false|title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics|author=Edward H.

====Qing dynasty====

The Qing Dynasty was founded not by the Han Chinese who form the majority of the Chinese population, but the Manchus, who are today an ethnic minority of China.  The Manchus were keenly aware of their minority status and during the early eras of their reign, they implemented a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Han Chinese. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchurian heritage and minimize sinicization.  Han Chinese and Mongols were banned from settling in Manchuria.[tpl]cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl]
The Qing Dynasty started colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the Outer Willow Palisade, which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.
The policy of segregation applied directly to the banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding Ming dynasty, their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations, and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

===Italy===

In 1938, the fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini, under pressure from the Nazis, introduced a series of laws instituting an official segregationist policy in the Italian Empire, especially aimed against Jews. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the prohibition for Jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities, to own industries reputed of major national interest, to work as journalists, to enter the military, and to wed non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their job, or even Italy. Amongst these, world-renowned physicists Emilio Segrè, Enrico Fermi (whose wife was Jewish), Bruno Pontecorvo, Bruno Rossi, Tullio Levi-Civita, mathematicians Federigo Enriques and Guido Fubini and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist Margherita Sarfatti, who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. Rita Levi-Montalcini, who would successively win the Nobel Prize for Medicine, was forbidden to work at the university. Albert Einstein, upon approval of the racial law, resigned from honorary membership of the Accademia dei Lincei.
After 1943, when Northern Italy was occupied by the Nazis, Italian Jews were rounded up for the Holocaust.

===Latin America===

Spanish colonists created caste systems in Latin American countries based on classification by race and race mixture.  An extensive nomenclature developed, including the familiar terms "mulatto", "mestizo", and "zambo" (the latter the origin of "sambo").  The Spanish had practiced a form of caste system in Hispania prior to their expulsion of the Jews and Muslims. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually at the time of independence, prejudice based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an echo of the colonial caste system.Soong, Roland. "Racial Classifications in Latin America", 1999.Cline, Howard F., "Review", The American Historical Review, Vol. 76, No. 5 (Dec. 1971), 1626–1628.

===Norway===

On 16 May 1940 the Administrasjonsrådet asked Rikskommisariatet why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway."Population, Führer and acquittal. Racial segregation between Norwegian citizens quietly accepted May 17, 1940 That Administrasjonsrådet thereafter "quietly" acceptedhttp://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Folk-frer-og-frifinnelse-6730068.html racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by Tor Bomann-Larsen. Furthermore he claimed that this segregation "created a precedent. 2 years later (with NS-styret in the ministries of Norway) Norwegian police picked up those who had listened to the radios at the addresses where radios were previously confiscated from Jews. November 26, 1942 it was time for departure and extermination"."Saken dannet presedens. Drøye to år senere (og nå med NS-styret på plass i departementene) rykket norske politimyndigheter ut på ny, denne gang for å hente lytterne på de samme adresser som radioapparatene. 26. november 1942 var det tid for avreise og utradering. Men politifolkene hadde altså vært ute en vårdag før. Raseskillet mellom norske borgere var blitt stilltiende akseptert den 17. mai 1940."

===Rhodesia===

Following a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty, the British self-governing colony of Rhodesia, governed by a predominantly white minority government, unilaterally declared independence in 1965. Led by Prime Minister Ian Smith, it endured as an unrecognized state under white rule for the next 14 years, with majority rule coming in 1979 with the Internal Settlement between Smith's government and moderate black nationalists, the associated multiracial elections and the reconstitution of the country as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, with Bishop Abel Muzorewa at the helm of a coalition cabinet comprising 12 blacks and five whites. This new order also failed to win legitimacy in the eyes of the world, and British control returned to the country in December 1979, following the Lancaster House Agreement. New elections were held in 1980, and Zimbabwe gained recognized independence in April 1980, with Robert Mugabe as prime minister.
Laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965, although many institutions simply ignored them. One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated public toilets at the newly built Reps Theatre in 1959 caused an argument called "The Battle of the Toilets".

===South Africa===

The apartheid system enacted a nation-wide social policy "separate development" with the National Party victory in 1948, following the "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the Union of South Africa and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.
Apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the Population Registration Act in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: "black", "white", "Coloured", and "Indian" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the Group Areas Act in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act in 1953, amenities in public area, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the Bantu Education Act in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the so-called Pass laws, which deprived black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system black people were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.
Uprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the Black Consciousness Movement, students’ protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act. In 1994, Nelson Mandela won in the first multiracial democratic election in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.

===United States===

After the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in America, racial discrimination became regulated by the so-called Jim Crow laws, which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended in many cases, they only became formalized after the end of Republican-enforced Reconstruction in the 1870s and 80s during a period known as the nadir of American race relations. This legislation that mandated segregation lasted to the mid-1960s.
While the U.S. Supreme Court majority in 1896 Plessy explicitly upheld only "separate but equal" facilities (specifically, transportation facilities), Justice John Marshall Harlan in his dissent protested that the decision was an expression of white supremacy; he predicted that segregation would "stimulate aggressions … upon the admitted rights of colored citizens," "arouse race hate" and "perpetuate a feeling of distrust between the races. Feelings between whites and blacks were so tense, even the jails were segregated."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040503/fonerkennedy |title=Brown at 50 |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl]
Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice by the efforts of such civil rights activists as Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., Rosa Parks, and Martin Luther King Jr., working during the period from the end of World War II through the passage of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Many of their efforts were acts of non-violent civil disobedience aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person (Rosa Parks), or holding sit-ins at all-white diners.
By 1968 all forms of segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and by 1970 support for formal legal segregation had dissolved. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954 outlawed segregation in public schools. The Fair Housing Act of 1968, administered and enforced by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, prohibited discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.  Formal racial discrimination was illegal in school systems, businesses, the American military, other civil services and the government. Separate bathrooms, water fountains and schools all disappeared and the civil rights movement had the public's support.

===Bahrain===

On 28 April 2007, the lower house of Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law MP Nasser Fadhala, a close ally of the government said "bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids".
Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of Al Wefaq said: "The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment," said Mr Rahma. "The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested."[tpl]cite news | author = Tariq Kkonji | url = http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 | title = 'No go' rule for bachelor labourers | publisher = Gulf Daily News | date=23 January 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]

The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them."

===Canada===

Since the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger Toronto[tpl]cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Rachel|title=Vancouver Income Inequality Study Shows City Segregating Along Racial, Income Lines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=03/12/2012[/tpl] and the southern bedroom communities of Greater Vancouver have become steadily more immigrant and visible minority dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income.  A CBC panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of ethnic enclaves in Greater Vancouver (such as Han Chinese in Richmond and Punjabis in Surrey) amounted to a type of self-segregation. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet Whites are never accused of "self-segregation".

Due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream". A 2007 poll commissioned by the Center Against Racism (2008) found a worsening of Jewish citizens' perceptions of their Arab counterparts:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3381836,00.html |title= יותר ממחצית היהודים: נישואים לערבי הם בגידה – חדשות היום |publisher=ynet.co.il |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2012[/tpl] For instance, 75% of Israeli Jews would not agree to live in a building with Arab residents, 60% would not accept any Arab visitors at their homes, 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of their right to vote, and 59% believe that the culture of Arabs is primitive. In 2012, a public opinion poll showed that 53% of the polled Israeli Jews said they would not object to an Arab living in their building, while 42% said they would. Asked whether they would object to Arab children being in their child’s class in school, 49% said they would not, 42% said they would.http://forward.com/articles/165231/israelis-should-avoid-using-term-apartheid/?p=all#ixzz2Eq6Isy4wGabe Fisher.

Malaysia has an article in its constitution which distinguishes the ethnic Malays and indigenous peoples of Malaysia—i.e. bumiputra—from the non-Bumiputra such as ethnic Chinese and Indians under the social contract, of which by law would guarantee the former certain special rights and privileges.

===Mauritania===

Slavery in Mauritania was finally criminalized in August 2007Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law by BBC News It was already abolished in 1980 though it was still affecting the descendants of black Africans abducted into slavery before generations, who live now in Mauritania as "black Moors" or haratin and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or bidhan (the name means literally white-skinned people), as slaves.

For centuries, the so-called Haratin lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by white Moors of Arab/Berber ancestry. Many descendants of the Arab and Berber tribes today still adhere to the supremacist ideology of their ancestors.

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality.  However, due to many cultural differences between the pre-existing system of passively co-existing communities, segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream”.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |work=BBC News | title=Britons warned over 'segregation' | date=22 September 2005[/tpl]
The affected and ‘ghettoised’ communities are often largely representative of Pakistanis, Indians and other Sub-Continentals as well as Afro-Caribbeans and other blacks, with skin colour often being a determinant, although the percentage of the United Kingdom's working and poorer class is predominantly white[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl].  Such racial segregation has widely been thought to be the basis of growing ethnic tensions, a measurable deterioration in race relations in poorer areas, a deterioration of the standard of living, and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas. In addition to this, it segregation is considered by some as being a main precursor to the recent race riots.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |work=BBC News | title=Race 'segregation' caused riots | date=11 December 2001[/tpl]http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf  Most British commentators claim it is false that the riots were due to a breakdown of multiculturalism alone, and instead claim that it is more likely to have been caused by other factors such as disillusioned youth, high unemployment and a growing attraction to 'gangsta' culture[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2013[/tpl] by a sizeable proportion of the youth, across all ethnicities, of the United Kingdom.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral ‘steering’ of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.PHILLIPS, D. (2002) Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities. End of Award report, ESRC R000238038. School of Geography, University of Leeds. Pg.7. This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area.  This is likely as other theories such as “ethnic self segregation” have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.

===United States of America===

De facto segregation in the United States has increased since the civil rights era in the United States.[tpl]cite book|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|title=The Shame of the Nation|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-5245-5[/tpl] The Supreme Court ruled in Milliken v. Bradley (1974) that de facto racial segregation was acceptable, as long as schools were not actively making policies for racial exclusion; since then, schools have been segregated due to myriad indirect factors.
Redlining is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |format=PDF |accessdate=18 January 2010[/tpl] access to health care,See: Race and health  or even supermarketsIn poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition, Elizabeth Eisenhauer, GeoJournal  Volume 53, Number 2 / February 2001 to residents in certain, often racially determined,How East New York Became a Ghetto by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0-8147-8267-1. Page 42. areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and measure to end mortgage discrimination in 1975, would completely invalidate de jure racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although de facto segregation and discrimination have proven more resilient.  According to the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University, the actual de facto desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers.

Regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by undesirable groups.

Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods.
