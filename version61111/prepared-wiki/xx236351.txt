New tribes in Asteraceae. Phytologia 91(3), 568-70.Nordenstam, B. and V. A. Funk. Corymbieae. In: Funk, V. A., et al. Systematics, Evolution, and Biogeography of Compositae. Vienna, Austria: International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT). 2009. pp.487-91. The species are all endemic to the Cape Province of South Africa, where they are known commonly as plampers.
These are perennial herbs growing from a thick, hairy rhizome. It is stemless, with the flowers borne on an erect scape. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, sometimes narrowly oval in shape, with pointed tips and veins running the length of the blades. They are hairless to slightly hairy. At the top of the stout scape are panicles or corymbs of flower heads. Each head has a single floret. It is pink, purple, or white and tipped with five lobes. It is enclosed in a pair of narrow green to purplish bracts. The style is divided into two long, hairy branches. The achene is tipped with a pappus of scales or fine bristles.
The plants produce copious nectar which attracts an assemblage of bees, wasps, beetles, and ants, which likely act as pollinators. Plants of the genus appear to be adapted to wildfire-prone habitat, and have been observed flowering most abundantly after fire.
