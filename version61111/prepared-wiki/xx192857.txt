</ref> Montagu received a 12 months sentence, while Wildeblood and Pitt-Rivers were sentenced to 18 months in prison as a result of these and other charges. The result of the trial led to an inquiry resulting in the [[Wolfenden Report]], which in 1957 recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK. Wildeblood's testimony to the Wolfenden committee was influential on its recommendations.
He published a book on the case, Against the Law, in 1955, an account which detailed his experiences at the hands of the law and the British establishment, brought to light the appalling conditions in Wormwood Scrubs, and encouraged campaigns for prison—and homosexual—reform. C. H. Rolph wrote in the New Statesman that it was "the noblest, and wittiest, and most appalling prison book of them all". To Wildeblood, "it was merely part of the story which had been implicit in me from the day when I was born".
He wrote a second book on the subject of homosexuality the following year, propelled, he said in the first chapter, by the strong response to Against the Law from people who contacted him directly to say how grateful they were for bringing the subject into the open. A Way of Life included twelve essays describing different lives lived with homosexuality among people with whom he had come in contact. The essays served further to normalise homosexuality and reveal its then still hidden existence in all walks of life.Peter Wildeblood, A Way of Life, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1956
After the trial and his subsequent imprisonment, Wildeblood became a television producer and writer and was involved in a number of productions (particularly for Granada Television and then CBC Toronto) throughout the 1960s and 70s.  Wildeblood wrote the book and lyrics, to Peter Greenwell's music, for the London musical The Crooked Mile, an avant-garde piece of 1959, set in the Soho underworld. He also chose to campaign publicly for the rights of gays by testifying before the Wolfenden Committee and the House of Lords.
His role in the decriminalisation of homosexuality which occurred in 1967 was explored in the Channel Four docudrama A Very British Sex Scandal.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g3RTZ-XvCw&feature=related
Wildeblood moved to Canada, becoming a citizen of the country in the 1980s.http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/united_kingdom/uknews04.htm In 1994, he suffered a stroke which left him speechless and a quadriplegic. He died in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1999.
