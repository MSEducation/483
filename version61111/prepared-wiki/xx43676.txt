==Biography==

Worcester was a news reporter for the Providence Journal in Providence, Rhode Island for over a decade before he joined the faculty at the University of Connecticut as a journalism professor in 1987.[tpl]cite web|title=Journalism Professor Turns Writing Skills  to Sherlock Holmes Mystery|url=http://advance.uconn.edu/2000/000124/00012410.htm|work=Advance - Univers ity of Connecticut|accessdate=21 April 2013[/tpl] He also wrote several Sherlock Holmes novels around that time. 
In 1975, Worcester reported on the theft of over $30 million worth of valuables from safe deposit boxes. Most of the valuables belonged to the New England mafia. This would continue to be Worcester's most prominent work for years to come, including the ongoing investigation.

In 1987, Worcester began working as a journalism professor at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. He retired in May 2013.
In his ceremonial final lecture, Worcester complained that his Wikipedia article contained significant misinformation about him. According to Worcester, "This morning I looked up my own name in Wikipedia, and learned things about myself I did not know, For example, I was born in Oklahoma but moved to New Hampshire when I was only a year old. The truth is, as far as I know, Iâ€™ve never set foot in Oklahoma. Never." The article also stated that Worcester won an award for his class on the history of weather reporting. Such a class has never existed at UConn, but Worcester joked that it would make a good HBO Series.[tpl]cite web|last=Constable|first=Kyle|title=Retiring professor leaves a legacy behind|url=http://www.dailycampus.com/news/retiring-professor-leaves-a-legacy-behind-1.3042736?pagereq=2#.UYxWb7VwqoM|publisher=The Daily Campus[/tpl]
