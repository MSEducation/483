Hiram I (Hebrew: חִירָם, "high-born"; Standard Hebrew [tpl]Unicode|Ḥiram[/tpl], Tiberian vocalization Ḥîrām, Modern Arabic: حيرام), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the Phoenician king of Tyre. He reigned from 980 to 947 BC, succeeding his father, Abibaal. Hiram was succeeded as king of Tyre by his son Baal-Eser I.Vance, Donald R. (March 1994) "Literary Sources for the History of Palestine and Syria: The Phœnician Inscriptions" The Biblical Archaeologist 57(1) 2-19. Hiram is also mentioned in the writings of Menander of Ephesus, as preserved in Josephus’s Against Apion, where some additional information is given that is not found in the Bible. One such item is that Hiram lived 53 years, and reigned 34.

==Reign==

During Hiram's reign, Tyre grew from a satellite of Sidon into the most important of Phoenician cities, and the holder of a large trading empire. He suppressed the rebellion of the first Tyrean colony at Utica, near the later site of Carthage (Against Apion i:18).
The Hebrew Bible says that he allied himself with King David of the United Kingdom of Israel as well as that the status of both Kings was equal and that the treaty between them was a parity treaty ([tpl]bibleverse|2|Samuel|5:11|KJV|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|1|Kings|5:1|KJV|[/tpl], [tpl]bibleverse|1|Chronicles|14:1|KJV|[/tpl]). After the death of King David, Solomon, a son of David, succeeded to David's throne and Hiram continued the relation with Israel through King Solomon, the upcoming power of the region. They were also equal ("אחי", meaning "brothers" 1 Kings 9:13, Amos 1:9)Michael D. Coogan, "A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament" page 213-214, Oxford University Press, 2009  Through the alliance with Solomon, Hiram ensured himself access to the major trade routes to Egypt, Arabia and Mesopotamia. The two kings also joined forces in starting a trade route over the Red Sea, connecting the Israelite harbour of Ezion-Geber with a land called Ophir (2 Chronicles 8:16,17). Some schools of thought suggest that this land of Ophir was the port city of Sopara which is near to modern Mumbai.A L Bashman, "The wonder that was India" page 232, Picador press India
According to the Bible, both kings grew rich through this trade and Hiram sent Solomon architects, workmen, cedar wood and gold to build the First Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus says that he also extended the Tyrean harbour, enlarged the city by joining the two islands on which it was built, and built a royal palace and a temple for Melqart (Against Apion i:17). Modern archaeology has found no evidence for these expansions.[tpl]cite book|last=Demand|first=Nancy H.|title=The Mediterranean Context of Early Greek History|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405155519|page=230[/tpl]

==Hypotheses regarding the chronology of Hiram’s reign==

The beginning date of Hiram’s reign is derived from a statement by Josephus, citing both Tyrian court records and the writings of Menander,Against Apion i:17,18. relating that 143 years passed between the start of construction of Solomon’s Temple until the founding of Carthage (or until Dido’s flight that led to its founding). Josephus also related that Hiram’s reign began 155 years and 8 months before this event, and that construction of Solomon's Temple began in the twelfth year of Hiram's Reign, which would be 143 years before the building of Carthage. The redundancy inherent in these multiple ways of expressing the total years (the 143 years is mentioned twice, and the 155 years minus 12 years once) has guaranteed that all extant copies of Josephus/Menander that contain these passages give 155 years and 8 months between the start of Hiram’s reign and the foundation of Carthage. (One copy has 155 years and 18 months, but this is an obvious error for 155 years and eight months.) Modern historians have therefore had confidence in the 155-year figure and have used it to date Hiram’s reign.[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl]
As pointed out by William Barnes, the date for the start of Temple construction using the Tyrian data is derived “wholly independently” of the way that date is derived using the Scriptural data.William H. Barnes, Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991) 31. It is this consideration, plus the evidence of the tribute from Baa‘li-maanzer/Baal-Eser II to Shalmaneser III, that has led to the adoption of the chronologies of Frank M. Cross and other scholars for the Tyrian kings in the present article. Hiram’s first year is therefore accepted as 980 BC instead of the 969 BC that was favored before publication of the Shalmaneser inscription.[tpl]cn|date=November 2012[/tpl]

==Sarcophagus==

The sarcophagus of Hiram is located a couple minutes drive southeast of Tyre in the village of Hanaway, a colossal limestone sarcophagus on a high pedestal",http://gatchina3000.ru/brockhaus-and-efron-encyclopedic-dictionary/110/110262.htm so-called Qabr Hiram.C.R. Conder and H.H. Kitchener, The Survey of Western Palestine I. Galilee, London 1881, S. 61-64 It is not to be confused with the famous Ahiram sarcophagus.
