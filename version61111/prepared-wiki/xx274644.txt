Ibrahim ibn Tashfin (died 1147)  was the seventh Almoravid king, who reigned shortly in 1146â€“1147. Once the news of the death of his father Tashfin ibn Ali reached Marrakech, he was proclaimed king while still an infant. He was soon replaced by his uncle Ishaq ibn Ali, but the Almohads quickly subdued Marrakech and killed both.
