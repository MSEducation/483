==History==

After the foundation of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), all music schools and the only music college were situated in the west of Berlin. Hence the GDR Ministry for Education decided to establish a music college in the east sector. On 1 October 1950 the Deutsche Hochschule für Musik was founded. Professor Dr. Georg Knepler was the first director of the school. The teaching staff included Rudolph Wagner-Régeny and Hanns Eisler (composition), Helmut Koch (conducting), Helma Prechter, Arno Schellenberg (voice), Carl Adolf Martiensse, Grete Herwig (piano), Gustav Havemann, Wilhelm Martens (violin), Bernhard Günther (cello), Werner Buchholz (viola) and Ewald Koch (clarinet).
Since 1964 the conservatoire is named Hochschule für Musik "Hanns Eisler" Berlin.
In 1950 a special school for music was founded. The convervatory built up a partnership with the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Schule.
In 1953 the program of opera and musical theatre stage direction was established, as two students were interested in this subject. Thus the conservatory became the first school in Europe to have a program of that kind.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
The state of Berlin following German Reunification took over the conservatory. Today it is under the jurisdiction of the Senate department of science, research and the arts.http://www.hfm-berlin.de/en/History.html
