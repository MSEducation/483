[[Equipe 84]]

CATEGORIES: Italian rock music groups

Equipe 84 were an Italian Beat band, formed in 1964, in Modena. The name translates as Team 84, and it was originally suggested by a friend of the band, Pier Parri. Team was thought to be a word that would resonate more easily outside of their home country, and though the origin of '84' is unclear, it is presumed to have been the total age of the members of the band.
