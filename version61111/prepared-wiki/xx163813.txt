[[Amsterdam criteria]]

CATEGORIES: Oncology

The Amsterdam criteria  are a set of diagnostic criteria used by doctors to help identify families which are likely to have Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).[tpl]cite journal |author=Lindor NM |title=Familial colorectal cancer type X: the other half of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome |journal=Surg.

The Amsterdam criteria arose as a result of a meeting of the International Collaborative Group on Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer in Amsterdam, in 1990.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bellizzi AM, Frankel WL |year=2009 |title=Colorectal cancer due to deficiency in DNA mismatch repair function: a review |journal=Advances in Anatomic Pathology |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=405–417 |pmid=19851131 |doi=10.1097/PAP.0b013e3181bb6bdc[/tpl]  Following this, some of the genetic mechanisms underlying Lynch syndrome were elucidated during the 1990s and the significance of tumours outside the colon, such as those of the endometrium, small intestine and ureter, became clearer.  These  changes in the knowledge of the syndrome lead to a revision of the Amsterdam criteria and were published in Gastroenterology journal in 1999.

==Criteria==

The initial Amsterdam criteria were a series of clinical criteria that were colloquially known as the ‘‘3-2-1’’ rule.  They were formulated to serve as a common starting point for future research into the genetics underlying the disease.  The criteria were as follows: 
These criteria were found to be too strict and were expanded to include the associated non-colorectal cancers in 1998.  These were called the Amsterdam II clinical criteria for families with Lynch syndrome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Virgínia Piñol; Antoni Castells; Montserrat Andreu; et al. |year=2005 |title=Accuracy of Revised Bethesda Guidelines, Microsatellite Instability, and Immunohistochemistry for the Identification of Patients With Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer |journal=JAMA |volume=293 |issue=16 |pages=1986–1994 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.16.1986 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/293/16/1986 |pmid=15855432[/tpl]
Each of the following criteria must be fulfilled:

==Alternatives==

In 1997, the National Cancer Institute published a set of recommendations called the Bethesda guidelines for the identification of individuals who should receive genetic testing for Lynch syndrome related tumors.  The NCI revisited and revised these criteria in 2004.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/djh034 |author=Umar A, Boland CR, Terdiman JP, et al. |year=2004 |title=Revised Bethesda Guidelines for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) and microsatellite instability. |pmc=2933058 |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst. |volume=96 |pages=261–268. |pmid=14970275 |issue=4[/tpl]
The Revised Bethesda Guidelines are as follows:
The Revised Bethesda Guidelines have been reported as being more sensitive than the Amsterdam II Criteria in detecting individuals and families at risk of Lynch syndrome.
