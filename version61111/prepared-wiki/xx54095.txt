Jill Wendy Dando (9 November 1961 – 26 April 1999) was an English journalist, television presenter and newsreader who was 1997 BBC Personality of the Year.
Dando was murdered by gunshot outside her home in Fulham, West London. A local man Barry George was convicted and jailed for the murder but was later acquitted on appeal. A Yugoslav terrorist connection was initially dismissed by police, but has since acquired more credence. The case remains open.

She studied journalism at South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education in Cardiff.
Dando was a keen thespian. She was a member of Weston-super-Mare Amateur Dramatic Society and Exeter Little Theatre Company, with whom she appeared in plays at the Barnfield Theatre.
Dando was a volunteer at Sunshine Hospital Radio in Weston-super-Mare in 1979. She started her first job as a trainee reporter for the local weekly newspaper, the Weston Mercury, where her father and brother worked. After five years as a print journalist, she began employment with the BBC when she became a newsreader for BBC Radio Devon in 1985. That year, she transferred to BBC South West, where she presented a regional news magazine programme, Spotlight South West. In 1987, she worked for TSW, then worked for BBC Spotlight in Plymouth. In early 1988, Dando made a move from regional to national television when she moved to London to present BBC television news.
Dando went on to present the BBC television programmes Breakfast Time, Breakfast News, the BBC One O'Clock News, the Six O'Clock News, the travel programme Holiday, the crime appeal series Crimewatch (from 1995 until her death) and occasionally Songs of Praise. In 1994 she moved to Fulham.
On 25 April 1999, Dando presented the first episode of The Antiques Inspectors.TV star Dando murdered by single shot She was scheduled to present the Six O'Clock News on the evening of the following day.

At the time of her death she was among those with the highest profile of the BBC's on-screen staff; she had been the 1997 BBC Personality of the Year.This is Bristol :10 years later Crimewatch reconstructed her murder in an attempt to aid the police in the search for her killer. After Barry George (see below) was charged with the murder but acquitted, Crimewatch made no further appeals for information concerning the case.

==Murder==

On the morning of 26 April 1999, 37-year-old Dando left the Chiswick home of her fiancé, Alan Farthing. She returned alone, by car, to the house she owned in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, West London. She had lived in the house, but by April 1999 was in the process of selling it and did not visit it frequently. As Dando reached her front door at about 11:32, she was shot once in the head.[tpl]cite news | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/328804.stm | title = BBC presenter shot dead | date = 26 April 1999 [/tpl] Her body was discovered about 14 minutes later by neighbour Helen Doble.Daily Mail article :2000 Police were called at 11:47. Dando was taken to the nearby Charing Cross Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival at 13:03 BST. 
Forensic study indicated that Dando had been shot by a bullet from a 9 mm calibre automatic pistol, with the gun pressed against her head at the moment of the shot. Richard Hughes, her next door neighbour, heard a surprised cry from Dando "like someone greeting a friend" but heard no gunshot. Hughes looked out of his front window and, while not realising what had happened, made the only certain sighting of the killer—a 6 foot (1.83 metre) tall white man aged around 40 years old, seen walking away from Dando's house.

===Investigation===

After the murder there was intense media coverage. An investigation by the Metropolitan Police, named Operation Oxborough, proved fruitless for over a year. Dando's status as a well-known public figure probably brought her into contact with thousands of people, and she was known by millions, so there was fevered speculation about the motive for her killing.
Within six months, the murder investigation team had spoken to more than 2,500 people and taken more than 1,000 statements. With little progress after a year, the police concentrated their attention on Barry George, who lived about half a mile from Dando's house. He had a history of stalking women, sexual offending and other anti-social and attention seeking behaviour.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1419998.stm | work=BBC News | title=Dando killer's Diana 'obsession' | date=3 July 2001[/tpl]
George was put under surveillance, arrested on 25 May and charged with Dando's murder on 28 May.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1185897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jill Dando: The investigation | date=25 February 2001[/tpl]
George was tried at the Old Bailey, convicted, and on 2 July 2001 he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Concern about this conviction was widespread on the basis that the case against George appeared thin. Two appeals were unsuccessful, but after discredited forensics evidence was excluded from the prosecution's case, George's third appeal succeeded in November 2007. The original conviction was quashed and a second trial lasting eight weeks ended in George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.[tpl]cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7536815.stm | title= George not guilty of Dando murder | publisher= BBC News | date= 1 August 2008 | accessdate= 1 August 2008[/tpl]
Dando's family and her fiancé Alan Farthing did not ask the police to reopen the investigation.[tpl]cite news | title= Dando family and former fiance want her murder case closed | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1041031/Dando-family-fiance-want-murder-case-closed.html | last= Leake | first= Christopher | date= 2 August 2008 | publisher= Mail Online | quote= ... a senior police source last night told the Mail on Sunday that Miss Dando's former fiance, consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing, and her family wanted the case to remain closed ... the senior officer revealed that it was 'most likely' there would be no reinvestigation, though the file would remain open ... | location= London | accessdate= 4 March 2009[/tpl] After George's acquittal, some newspapers published articles which appeared to suggest that he was guilty of the Dando murder and other offences against women. In December 2009, George accepted substantial damages from News Group Newspapers over articles in The Sun and the News of the World, following a libel action in the High Court.BBC report :December 2009

===Potential suspects===

Lines of inquiry explored in the police investigation included:
The original police investigation had explored the possibility of a professional killing, but since Dando was living with her fiancé and was only rarely visiting her Gowan Avenue house, it was considered unlikely that a professional assassin would have been sufficiently well informed about Dando's movements to have known when she was going there. CCTV evidence of Dando's last journey (mainly security video recordings from the Kings Mall Shopping Centre in Hammersmith, which she visited on her way to Fulham) did not show any sign of her being followed.Guardian article :2001 article 
Dando's BBC colleague Nick Ross stated on Newsnight on the night of her death that retaliatory attacks by criminals against police, lawyers and judges were almost unknown in Britain. Finally, forensic examination of the cartridge case and bullet recovered from the scene of the attack suggested that the weapon used had been the result of a workshop conversion of a replica or decommissioned gun. It was argued that a professional assassin would not use such a poor quality weapon. The police therefore soon began to favour the idea that the killing had been carried out by a crazed individual acting on an opportunist basis. This assumed profile of the perpetrator led to the focus on Barry George.
However, it is reported that cold case reviews by the police after 2008 have concluded that Dando was killed by a professional assassin.Plymouth Herald report, 23 July 2013 "Jill Dando was executed ..." Dando was subject to a 'hard contact execution'. Pressing the gun against her head would have silenced the fatal shot and prevented her killer from being splattered with blood.

===Yugoslav connection===

Soon after the killing some commentators identified the possibility of a Serbian connection.
At Barry George's first trial his defence barrister, Michael Mansfield QC, quoted from a National Criminal Intelligence Service report which stated that the Serbian warlord leader Arkan had ordered her assassination in retaliation for the NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters on 23 April 1999. 16 station staff had died in the bombing.Amnesty International, 9 April 2009 "No Justice ..." Mansfield suggested that Dando's earlier presentation of an appeal for aid for Kosovar Albanian refugees may have attracted the attention of Bosnian-Serb hardliners. Dando's picture was on the cover of the Radio Times (edition 24 to 30 April 1999) in the week of her killing.
The theory still holds great sway with commentators.Pravda, 2002 :book review The former communist government in Yugoslavia had a history of assassinations directed against its opponents. The victims were mostly Croatian émigrés, although others were targeted. The attacks were usually carried out by small teams consisting of a trigger-man supported by a spotter and were always carefully planned.  The attacks were often made as targets entered or left their homes since this was the point at which they were most vulnerable and where a case of mistaken identity was least likely.
Bob Woffinden, a journalist who specialises in miscarriages of justice has stated "Claims of responsibility are made by groups such as the IRA or ETA. In 60 years, there has not once been a claim of responsibility for an assassination carried out by Eastern European secret services." Woffinden advanced the view that a Yugoslav group was behind the Dando killing and in various newspaper articles he contested all the grounds on which the police had dismissed this possibility.[tpl]cite news | last=Woffinden | first= Bob | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,749126,00.html | publisher= The Guardian | title= Shadow of doubt? | date= 6 July 2002 | accessdate= 17 November 2007 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/01/jilldando.ukcrime3| title= With Barry George innocent, who did kill Jill Dando? | last=Campbell | first= Duncan | publisher= The Guardian | date= 1 August 2008 | accessdate= 4 August 2008 | location=London[/tpl]
