Tin Foil Phoenix is a Canadian post-grunge band from Winnipeg. The band formed from the ashes of a previous incarnation under the moniker of Sonic Bloom with core members Michael Allen Zirk and Steven Kray.

In 2001, they released Hurry, an independent seven-song EP.  Its first single, Neopolitan, got a great amount of airplay on Canadian radio.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.uptownmag.com/archive/music/04sept09.htm | title = Little shop of horrors | author = Mike Warkentin | publisher = Uptown Magazine | accessdate = 2007-03-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061112132849/http://www.uptownmag.com/archive/music/04sept09.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-12[/tpl] The song soon caught the music industry's attention and the band was signed to 604 Records/Universal in August 2002.[tpl]cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/T/Tin_Foil_Phoenix/AlbumReviews/2004/09/10/772034.html | title =  Living in the Shadow of the Bat | author = Darryl Sterdan | publisher = Winnipeg Sun | accessdate = 2007-03-07[/tpl]  The deal guaranteed the release of their debut album in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.
In February 2002, the name of the band changed from Sonic Bloom to Tin Foil Phoenix because of legal concerns over the name expressed by their international label affiliate, Roadrunner Records.
Their first full-length album, Living In The Shadow Of The Bat, was released on September 14, 2004 by 604/Universal. They have a new single called 'Have A Nice Day' on their MySpace and their second album Age Of Vipers is set for release on 20 May. The lead single of Age Of Vipers is called "Hurry Home".
