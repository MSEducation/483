==Later life==

Taken captive at age eight, Rhoda lived with the Delaware for eight years, from the age of eight to sixteen, by which time she was assimilated to the band.  Liberated by Colonel Henry Bouquet at the forks of the Muskingum River, she and Elizabeth Studebaker, another English colonist adopted by the Delaware, escaped from his custody on their way to Fort Pitt in Pittsburgh, and returned to the Delaware.[tpl]cite book |last1= Cort|first1= Cyrus |authorlink1=Cyrus Cort |others= Westmoreland County Bouquet Memorial Committee |title= Col.

Girls and young women who married into the tribe also wanted to stay with their new people, rather than making another adjustment to return to colonial British culture.Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, Good Wives: Image and Reality in the Lives of Women in Northern New England, 1650-1750 (Vintage, 1991) , New York: Vintage, 1991  This was the case with Eunice Williams, the daughter of John Williams, the minister of Deerfield, Massachusetts; after being taken to Canada and adopted by the Mohawk, she married a Mohawk husband at age 16 and never returned full-time to her New England family.John Demos, the Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1994
Rhoda Boyd was ransomed in Detroit in 1764 and taken back to the British colonists.
