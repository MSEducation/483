[[Whitehorse, Yukon]]

CATEGORIES: Whitehorse, Yukon, Populated places established in 1898

Whitehorse (total area population 27,889 as of 2013) is the capital and largest city of Yukon, Canada and the largest city in northern Canada. It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 on the Alaska Highway in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's downtown and Riverdale areas occupy both shores of the Yukon River, which originates in British Columbia and meets the Bering Sea in Alaska. The city was named after the White Horse Rapids for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near Miles Canyon, before the river was dammed. Because of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley, the climate is milder than other comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife.[tpl]cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=ARCTIC|date=23 January 2007|month=September|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227–237|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have 20 hours of daylight.[tpl]cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25[/tpl] Whitehorse, as reported by Guinness World Records, is the city with the least air pollution in the world.Guinness World Records 2013, Page 036 (Hardcover edition).

==Geography==

Whitehorse is located at kilometre 1,425 (Historic Mile 918) of the Alaska Highway and is framed by three nearby mountains: Grey Mountain to the east, Haeckel Hill to the northwest and Golden Horn Mountain to the south. The rapids which were the namesake of the city have disappeared under Schwatka Lake, formed by the construction of a hydroelectric dam in 1958. Whitehorse is currently the 79th largest city in Canada by area. The city limits present a near rectangular shape orientated in a NW-SE direction.[tpl]cite web|title=Whitehorse Keymap|url=http://ww3.whitehorse.ca/Maps/gmap75.php?_GRP_Cadastre_Layers=1&Subdivision=1&Zoning=1&_GRP_Streams%2C_Rivers%2C_Lakes=1&Yukon_Satellite_Image=1&ViewRegion=Quick+View&minx=476407.649681&miny=6714194.605109&maxx=515589.436842&maxy=6745540.034837&imagewidth=500&imageheight=400&mainmap.x=170&mainmap.y=282&CMD=&KEYMAPXSIZE=138&KEYMAPYSIZE=200&MapSize=Map+Size&PREVIOUS_MODE=1&SEARCH_ADDR=&SEARCH_STREET_NAME=Street+Name|work=Whitehorse Topography and Zoning|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl]

===Subdivisions===

thumb|Downtown mural painted on the backs of the Main Street businesses. Due to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's downtown core on the Yukon River's west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the Yukon River (640 m). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to Riverdale, one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.[tpl]cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=Whitehorse Star|date=14 July 2009[/tpl] North of downtown is the Marwell industrial subdivision which used to be separated from the downtown by a large marshland but the first decade of 2000 saw huge commercial transformations and these two neighbourhoods are now contiguous.  Prior to 1975, there were squatters' subdivisions along the Yukon River at the current sites of the S.S. Klondike riverboat, Rotary Peace Park, and the waterfront development area from the north end of 1st Avenue to the north end of the waterfront trolley line; these were expropriated and cleared.
The rest of Whitehorse is generally located above 690 meters. Immediately after climbing "Two Mile Hill", looking to the north are the old residential neighbourhoods of Takhini, Takhini North and Takhini East, where many homes actually are originally army barracks and military officers' residences.[tpl]cite web|title=Camp Takhini|url=http://www.nwtandy.rcsigs.ca/stories/down_north12.htm|work=Down North, A Dependent's Notes of Interest|publisher=© Jean Watts 2002|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] Yukon College, Yukon Arts Centre and Whitehorse Correctional Centre are situated in Takhini. Situated further north are Porter Creek and Crestview.
West of downtown are Valleyview, Hillcrest (also largely constituted of old military lodgings) and the airport; and beyond the Canada Games Centre along Hamilton Boulevard are the neighbourhoods of McIntyre (designated to replace inferior lands and homes of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation ("The Village") previously located where Marwell adjoins a marshy area), then Ingram, Arkell, Logan, Granger, and rapidly expanding Copper Ridge.
Whitehorse also has subdivisions designated "Country Residential" which are subject to different municipal bylaws[tpl]cite web|title=Animal FAQ|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={ED5E5AB3-9730-489F-8234-4AEB5333001E}|work=Bylaw Services|publisher=City of Whitehorse, Yukon[tpl]![/tpl]Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] and are located farther out from the downtown. They consist of the rural Whitehorse subdivisions of Hidden Valley and MacPherson at Whitehorse's northern limits; to the south: McCrae (also spelt MacRae), Wolf Creek, Wolf Creek North, Mary Lake, Cowley Creek, Spruce Hill, Pineridge and Fox Haven Estates.[tpl]cite web|title=try Residential - Whitehorse|url=http://www.sewp.gov.yk.ca/region?regionId=YK.WH.CNTRYRES|work=Socio-Economic Web Portal|publisher=© Yukon Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] Also located at the south end of the city is the newly designated Mt.

===Urban planning===

Whitehorse Bylaw 426 (1975) restricts the operation of motor vehicles to designated roadways in certain "Protected Areas" to ensure maximum conservation of the environmental quality.[tpl]cite web|title=BYLAW 426|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/vertical/Sites/%7B77FF5155-2407-453B-BAE8-67D8813B88C6%7D/uploads/%7B7D50CCCB-7095-4E32-AAC4-8143699082AE%7D.PDF|work=OFFICE CONSOLIDATION To Bylaw 94-02 Passed January 24, 1994|publisher=City of Whithorse|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] Most are near the downtown core (downtown and Yukon river escarpments, Mt. Mac ski trails, Riverdale, Valleyview, Hillcrest, Granger, Porter Creek, and Mountainview ) and one, Pineridge, is south of downtown.[tpl]cite web|title=Protected Areas within City Limits|url=http://www.whitehorse.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D399FCB1-97FC-43B8-8989-97B072B3BA10}|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl]
In 1999, the city approved the Area Development Scheme (ADS) which reallocated the area previously known as "Whitehorse Copper" to the following uses: Country Residential, Commercial, Service Industrial, and Heavy industrial.
Recent demands for growth have reignited urban planning debates in Whitehorse.[tpl]cite news|title=A downhill slide|url=https://www.yukon-news.com/letters/17591/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=Yukon News|date=9 April 2010[/tpl] In 1970 the Metropolitan Whitehorse development plan[tpl]cite book|title=General development plan, Whitehorse metropolitan area|year=1970|publisher=Reid, Crowther & Partners|location=Yukon Government Archives|url=http://virtua.gov.yk.ca:8080/lib/item;jsessionid=16631D01624F337AAF89EF312E265821?id=145506|author=Planning Division, Reid, Crowther|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] included park and greenbelt areas that were to be preserved to ensure high quality of life even within city limits.

===Ecology and climate===

Whitehorse is in the Cordilleran climate region, the Complex Soils of Mountain Areas soil region, the Cordilleran vegetation region, and the Boreal Cordillera ecozone.
Like most of Yukon, Whitehorse has a dry subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc). However, because of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley, the climate is milder than other comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife. At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have 20 hours of daylight. Whitehorse experiences an annual temperature average with daily highs of [tpl]convert|20.5|C|F|1|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] in July and average daily lows of [tpl]convert|-22|C|F|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in January. The record high temperature was [tpl]convert|34|C|F|1|abbr=on|[/tpl] in June 1969 and the lowest was [tpl]convert|-52|C|F|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in January 1947. Whitehorse has little precipitation with an average annual snowfall of [tpl]convert|145|cm|in|2|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|163|mm|in|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of rainfall.
According to Meteorological Service of Canada, Whitehorse has the distinction of being Canada's driest city, mainly because it lies in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains.

==Government==

===Municipal=== 
Whitehorse municipal elections occur every three years. In the 2012 election, Dan Curtis was elected as mayor of Whitehorse for a first term. Whitehorse City Council has six councillors: Jocelyn Curteanu (first term), Kirk Cameron (second term), Betty Irwin (second term), John Streicker (first term), Mike Gladish (first term) and Dave Stockdale (eleventh consecutive term).[tpl]cite web|title=Mayor and Council|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={ACDB6341-BF17-45A6-880F-243DF59D4A7D}|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] The voter turn out at the 2009 election was 4218 of 11446 (36.85%),[tpl]cite web|title=City of Whitehorse -Official Election Results Oct 15, 2009|url=http://ww3.whitehorse.ca/pgms/election/election_results_viewer.php|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] which is significantly lower than the 44% at the 2006 election, causing consternation among councillors.[tpl]cite news|title=Buckway re-elected Whitehorse mayor|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2009/10/15/whse-elex-results.html?ref=rss|accessdate=2011-03-27|newspaper=CBC North online|date=16 October 2009[/tpl] Municipal services provided by the city of Whitehorse include: water and sewer systems, road maintenance, snow and ice control, non-recyclable waste and composting, as well as a mosquito control program.[tpl]cite web|title=Public Works|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D85C582B-E415-4887-8D04-1DA95101840D}|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl]
===Territorial=== 
Whitehorse was represented by 9 of 18 MLAs in Yukon's Legislative Assembly, as per the 2002 map of Yukon Electoral districts.[tpl]cite web|title=View map of Yukon Electoral Districts (2002)|url=http://www.electionsyukon.gov.yk.ca/whtsemap.html|work=Maps|publisher=Elections Yukon|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] In 2009 Yukon's electoral map was modified to give Whitehorse an extra seat, bringing its total up to 10 out of 19. The Legislative Assembly Building is located in downtown Whitehorse and elections usually take place every three to five years.[tpl]cite web|title=Election Call|url=http://www.electionsyukon.gov.yk.ca/elections.html|work=Yukon Elections|publisher=Elections Yukon|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl] The last general election was held in 2011. Whitehorse residents have four local political parties from which to choose: Yukon Liberal Party, Yukon New Democratic Party, Yukon Party, as well as the newly constituted Yukon Green Party.
===Federal=== 
All of Yukon consists of a single Federal electoral district and therefore there is only one MP and 65% of Yukon's voters live in Whitehorse. Residents of the Yukon have been voting federally since a byelection returned the first Yukon MP in January 1903 and, from 1984 onward, have had candidates from at least four federal political parties to choose from. In 2006, 2008 and 2011, the choices have been: Conservative, Green, Liberal, and NDP. Other parties that have contested the riding from 1984 onward include the Libertarian Party, the Rhinoceros Party, the three precursors of the Conservative Party (Reform Party, Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservatives), the National Party (1993) and the Christian Heritage Party.
Ryan Leef was elected as Yukon's new Conservative MP in 2011. Liberal Larry Bagnell was Yukon's MP from 2000 to 2011, winning the 2006 election with 49% of the vote and voter turnout of 66%,[tpl]cite news|title=Some northerners stymied by new voter ID rules on election day|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2008/10/14/north-vote.html|accessdate=2011-03-27|newspaper=CBC news online|date=14 October 2008[/tpl] on par with the total Canadian turnout of 65%,[tpl]cite news|title=Voter turnout increases by 5 per cent, up to 65%|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060123/elxn_voter_turnout_060124/20060124?s_name=election2006&no_ads=|accessdate=2011-03-27|newspaper=CTV News |date=24 January 2006[/tpl] with Whitehorse districts turnout lower at 55%.[tpl]cite web|title=39th General Election – Poll-by-Poll Results – Raw Data|url=http://www.elections.ca/scripts/resval/ovr_39ge.asp?ddlEDRes_prov=60&lang=e|publisher=Elections Canada|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl]

===Judicial===

All court matters are handled in Whitehorse at the Andrew Philipsen Law Building which also houses a law library. Yukon's Territorial Court (three judges) handles most adult criminal prosecutions under the criminal code and other federal statutes. The Supreme Court of Yukon has two resident judges and nine judges from NWT and Nunavut. The Court of Appeal, made up of justices from BC, Yukon, NWT and Nunavut, sits in Whitehorse only one week of the year, so most appeals are heard in Vancouver.[tpl]cite web|title=Yukon Courts|url=http://www.yukoncourts.ca/courts/territorial.html|publisher=Yukon Department of Justice|accessdate=2011-03-27[/tpl]

===Military===

The Canadian Forces is represented in Whitehorse by Canadian Forces Detachment Yukon located in downtown Whitehorse, Regional Cadet Support Unit (North)was at Boyle Barracks (until a re-organization in 2012 amalgamated the cadet support unit into Regional Cadet Support Unit (NW) based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba.) and the Canadian Rangers of the Whitehorse Patrol of 1 Canadian Ranger Patrol Group. 2685 Yukon Regiment Army Cadet Corps and 551 Whitehorse Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Cadets of the Canadian Cadet Organizations also operate in Whitehorse. All units operate as part of Canadian Forces Joint Task Force (North)..http://www.jtfn.forces.gc.ca/units/index-eng.asp
440 Transport Squadron, and other units of the Royal Canadian Air Force, including the Snowbirds often operate and train out of Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport, formerly RCAF Station Whitehorse.
Boyle Barracks is located [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south of downtown Whitehorse. The facility houses Regional Cadet Support Unit (North), Whitehorse Cadet Summer Training Centre, service support elements of Joint Task Force (North), and is used by 1 Canadian Ranger Patrol Group, the Junior Canadian Rangers, and other units to conduct training. Boyle Barracks is located on the property of the unused Wolf Creek Juvenile Corrections Centre which is leased by the Department of National Defence from the Yukon Government.
Whitehorse Cadet Summer Training Centre offers a variety of courses and activities that focus on general training, leadership, and expedition training up to the instructor level. Courses are two, three, and six weeks long and are offered throughout the summer.[tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] Personnel are drawn primarily from the territories, but many come from across Canada. The training centre also hosts members of the United Kingdom's Army Cadet Force and Combined Cadet Force.
Historically, Whitehorse also was the location of units of the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force; the Canadian Army was the last to pull out in 1968, at the same time the armed forces were unified.

==History==

Archeological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as Canyon City, has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and Frederick Schwatka, in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass Miles Canyon. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
The discovery of gold in the Klondike in August, 1896, by Skookum Jim, Tagish Charlie and George Washington Carmack set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the Chilkoot Pass, but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte stampeders had arrived via steamship and were camping at "White Horse". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. Samuel Steele of the North-West Mounted Police said: "why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me."
On their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the "copper belt" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and Sam McGee on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] stretch on the east bank of the river from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.
The White Pass and Yukon Route narrow-gauge railway linking Skagway to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of Bennett lake. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June–July 1890 that construction finished the difficult Bennett lake section itself, completing the entire route.
By 1901, the Whitehorse Star was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by William Ogilvie, the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.
In 1920 the first planes landed in Whitehorse and the first air mail was sent in November 1927. Until 1942, river and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the Alaska Highway. The entire [tpl]convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war.
In 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from Dawson City after the construction of the Klondike Highway.[ref]
</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name="ref1">Robert G. Woodall, The Postal History of Yukon, Canada, Lawrence, MA, Quarterman, Revised edition, ©1976, ISBN 0-88000-086-4, p.239</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Air====

Whitehorse is served by the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport and has scheduled service to Vancouver, Kelowna, Calgary, Edmonton, Dawson City, Old Crow, Inuvik, as well as Fairbanks, Alaska and Frankfurt, Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941-42 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal.
In 1998 work was completed on a 340 meter runway extension and other improvements (concrete turn button, installation of storm and sanitary mains, lighting upgrades, tower access road and blast pad).[tpl]cite web|title=Whitehorse International Airport Runway Extension|url=http://www.yes-group.ca/index.php/Transportation/view_project/airport_runway_extension/|publisher=YES Group|accessdate=2011-03-26[/tpl] Expansion of the terminal itself was completed in 2010.

====Roads====

Surface access to Whitehorse is provided by a network of highways, including the international Alaska Highway connecting the Yukon with the Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta highway networks.
Whitehorse has been described as "pearls on a string", with its residential, industrial, and service subdivisions located along the main thoroughfares that carry traffic within city limits, with large gaps of undeveloped (often hilly) land between them. The Alaska Highway is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as "Highway 1A" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.
The city road network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.

====Water====

The Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the Bering Sea. At 640 meters above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the highest point on earth that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea. Currently, no passenger or freight services use the river at Whitehorse.

====Rail====

Whitehorse presently has no active railway service. The city is reached by the tracks of the White Pass and Yukon Route, of which only a small portion are currently maintained to run a small trolley service in the summer. The last scheduled service to Whitehorse occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from Skagway, Alaska to Carcross, [tpl]convert|72|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl] south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at Carmacks, with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.

====Public transit====

Whitehorse Transit provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours. There is a waterfront tram, known as the "trolley", which provides transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it is chiefly tourist-oriented and is not yet integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on the south end of the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station.
