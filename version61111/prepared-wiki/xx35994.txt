The Spencer Churches (less commonly called the "Union Churches") are the two religious denominations that resulted from a schism in the "Union Church of Africans" (also known as African Union Church), the first independent black denomination, founded by Peter Spencer in Delaware in 1813.
The two denominations created by the schism are the African Union Methodist Protestant Church and Union American Methodist Episcopal Church
It is possible that these churches will reunite.  Various people hope it will be by the Churches' 200th anniversary in 2013.
