Others take a systemic viewpoint that does not necessarily depend on molecular chemistry. One systemic definition of life is that living things are self-organizing and autopoietic (self-producing). Variations of this definition include Stuart Kauffman's definition as an autonomous agent or a multi-agent system capable of reproducing itself or themselves, and of completing at least one thermodynamic work cycle.[tpl]cite journal | first1=Stuart | last1=Kaufmann | year=2004 | title=Autonomous agents | editor1-first=John D. | editor1-last=Barrow | editor2-last=Davies | editor3-first=C.

====Viruses====

Viruses are most often considered replicators rather than forms of life. They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life,"[tpl]Cite journal |last=Rybicki |first=EP |year=1990 |title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics |journal=S Aft J Sci |volume=86 |pages=182–186[/tpl] since they possess genes, evolve by natural selection,[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Holmes | first1=E.

However, viruses do not metabolize and they require a host cell to make new products. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it may support the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Koonin | first1=E.

===Living systems theories===

The idea that the Earth is alive is found in philosophy and religion, but the first scientific discussion of it was by the Scottish scientist James Hutton. In 1785, he stated that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be physiology. Hutton is considered the father of geology, but his idea of a living Earth was forgotten in the intense reductionism of the 19th century.[tpl]cite book |title=GAIA – A new look at life on Earth | first1=James | last1=Lovecock | author-link=James Lovelock | year=1979 | page=10 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-286030-5 [/tpl] The Gaia hypothesis, proposed in the 1960s by scientist James Lovelock,[tpl]Cite journal |last1=Lovelock | first1=J.

The first attempt at a general living systems theory for explaining the nature of life was in 1978, by American biologist James Grier Miller.[tpl]Cite book |last=Woodruff |first=T. Sullivan |coauthor=John Baross |title=Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology |publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0521824214 |date=October 8, 2007[/tpl] Cleland and Chyba wrote a chapter in Planets and Life: "In the absence of such a theory, we are in a position analogous to that of a 16th-century investigator trying to define 'water' in the absence of molecular theory." ... "Without access to living things having a different historical origin, it is difficult and perhaps ultimately impossible to formulate an adequately general theory of the nature of living systems". Such a general theory, arising out of the ecological and biological sciences, attempts to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into component parts, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.[ref]
