Rolf Martin Theodor Dahlgren (July 7, 1932 - February 14, 1987) was a Swedish-Danish botanist, professor at the University of Copenhagen from 1973 to his death.
Dahlgren was born in Örebro to apothecary Rudolf Dahlgren and wife Greta née Dahlstrand.Vem Är Vem - Skåne, Halland, Blekinge (ed. Åke Davidsson), 2nd edn. Bokförlaget Vem är vem, Stockholm, 1966; p. 167 He took his MSc degree (1955) and PhD degree (1963) at Lund University.[tpl]cite book|last=Dahlgren|first=Rolf|title=Studies on Aspalathus and some related genera in South Africa (PhD thesis)|year=1963|location=Lund|publisher=Lund University[/tpl] He continued working on South African plants during expeditions in 1956-57 and 1965–66, while affiliated with the Botanical Museum in Lund as docent. In 1973, he became professor of botany at the University of Copenhagen. Here, he developed his system of Angiosperm classification, based on many more characters simultaneously than previous systems, most notably many chemical plant traits (see also chemotaxonomy). Although the system was first presented in Danish,[tpl]cite book|last=Dahlgren|first=Rolf|title=Angiospermernes taxonomi, vol. 1-4|year=1974–76|location=Copenhagen|publisher=Akademisk Forlag[/tpl] it rapidly gained widespread acceptance, particularly due to the instructive diagrams, socalled Dahlgrenograms. His work on family circumscription in the Monocotyledons, published with H. T. Clifford and Peter Yeo, has had profound influence well into the molecular age.[tpl]cite book|last1=Dahlgren|first1=Rolf|last2=Clifford|first2=H.

In 1986, he was elected member of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
The South African monotypic plant genus Dahlgrenodendron (J.H. Ross) J.J.M. van der Merwe & A.E. van Wyk was named to him honour in 1988[tpl]cite journal|last1=van der Merwe| first1=J. J.
