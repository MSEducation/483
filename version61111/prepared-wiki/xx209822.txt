===Forthcoming Book===

Zeitz's next book, Lincoln's Boys: John Hay, John Nicolay, and the War for Lincoln's Image, will be published by Viking Press in February 2014. Focusing on Abraham Lincoln's young White House aides, John Hay and John Nicolay, the book is "part political drama and part coming-of-age tale—a fascinating story of friendship, politics, war, and the contest over history and remembrance," according to the publisher.http://www.penguin.ca/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670025664,00.html  In an early review, the filmmaker Ken Burns said that "Zeitz has pulled off a difficult task -- revealing how the myth of Lincoln came to be without distorting the true greatness of our extraordinary 16th President."

==Personal==

Zeitz and his wife live in Hoboken, New Jersey with their two daughters.
