Frederick Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (Ichtershausen, 16 February 1679 â€“ Meiningen, 10 March 1746), was a duke of Saxe-Meiningen.

==Life==

He was the fifth son of Bernhard I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his first wife, Marie Hedwig of Hesse-Darmstadt.
When his father died in 1706, according to his will, he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen with his older full-brother, Ernst Ludwig I, and his younger half-brother, Anton Ulrich.
But, shortly after, Ernst Ludwig signed a contract between himself and his brothers, and they were compelled to leave full control of the duchy in his hands.
When Ernst Ludwig died (1724), Frederick Wilhelm and Anton Ulrich took again the government of the duchy as guardians of his nephews until 1733.
After the death of his nephew, Karl Frederick (1743), he inherited the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen.
Frederick Wilhelm never married and died after only three years of reigning. He was succeeded by his younger half-brother, Anton Ulrich.
