==The Francis Bacon Interiors==

==No Human Way to Kill==

In 2007 Priseman developed the project 'No Human Way to Kill''No Human Way to Kill'  out of the 'Hospital' series. 'No Human Way to Kill' was exhibited in London and New York in 2010 and again in 2011.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] The series of paintings presents the five different methods of execution used in the USA which include Hanging, Firing Squad, Gassing, Lethal Injection and Electrocution. Alongside the paintings, twelve etchings look at other methods of state sanctioned execution which have been used around the world, including the Guillotine and Garrotte. The series examined how different countries have adopted different techniques to execute condemned prisoners, which in turn argue execution to be a socially constructed act of group catharsis.
During the New York shows, live debates around the issues explored were streamed to universities across the USA and Canada which included Yale, Columbia, Arizona University, the University of Minnesota and the Cleveland Institute of Art.
A book on the work and ideas surrounding it was published by the Seabrook PressAvailable at amazon.com Amazon in collaboration with the Human Rights Centre at the University of Essex and Amnesty International in 2009. The book presents different points of view on the topic. It opens with an account from Reverend Cathy Harrington, whose daughter Leslie Mazzara was murdered. Cathy negotiated a life sentence for her daughter’s murderer, who had potentially been facing the death sentence. This is followed by an overview of life on death row in San Quentin from former Crips gang member Anthony Ross. Then former Texas prison Warden Jim Willett, who oversaw 89 executions, gives a detailed account of how an execution is carried out.

==Gas Chambers==

Following 'No Human Way to Kill' Priseman produced the 'Gas Chambers' series.Exhibited at The Centre of Contemporary Art, New Zealand in 2009, New Zealand This project comes in two parts, and focuses on the developmental steps taken in Nazi Germany that began with the gassing of the mentally ill and ended in genocide. 
The first part consists of six pencil drawings which are designed to look like hand coloured postcards'On Robert Priseman and The Possibility of Painting' by Professor Peter Vergo and show the outsides of the hospitals in Germany and Austria where the T4 Euthanasia programme took place between 1939 and 1941.
The second part of this project consists of five oil paintings (each 6 ft x 9 ft). The paintings trace the movement taken by the Nazis towards an industrialised killing process which culminated in Auschwitz where up to 2,500 people were killed at a time. The series is accompanied by an essay entitled 'On Robert Prisman and the Possibility of Painting' by the curator and art historian Professor Peter Vergo.
