[[Iridium(IV) oxide]]

CATEGORIES: Iridium compounds, Oxides

Iridium(IV) oxide, IrO2, is the only well characterised oxide of iridium. Its crystal has the TiO2, rutile structure containing six coordinate iridium and three coordinate oxygen. [tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw[/tpl]
It is used with other rare oxides in the coating of anode-electrodes for industrial electrolysis and in microelectrodes for electrophysiology research.
It can be formed by oxidation of iridium black, a finely divided powder of iridium metal.
