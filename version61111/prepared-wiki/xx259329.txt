White Plains Rural Cemetery is a historic rural cemetery located at White Plains, Westchester County, New York. The cemetery was organized in 1854 and designed in 1855.

Also on the property is a former church, now cemetery office.  It was built in 1797, and is a [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl]-story, five-by-three-bay frame building with a high-pitched gable roof.
