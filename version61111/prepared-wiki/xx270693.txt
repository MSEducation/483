==Britain's Got Talent==

In 2012, Oliver was approached by Producers of the show Britain's Got Talent in regards to Superpowerless performing in the competition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/britain_got_talent/4782669/BGT-Superpowerless-nerds-blast-Cowell-and-his-judging-pals.html |title=Geeks v god, Nerds blast Cowell |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl] After assurance that they would be portrayed in a professional and positive light, Superpowerless was fast-tracked through the regular auditions and given a place in the televised semi-finals. On the day of the audition, the band felt all interviews and questions were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act in to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/ |title=Britain's Got Bullies - BGT's War on Nerds |publisher=mcmbuzz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20[/tpl]
The story was published in newspapers, magazines and high-traffic websites/blogs. Britain's Got Talent made no public statements regarding the issue but the audition and interviews were never aired as part of the show.

==Live performances/tours==

The Superpowerless live band has toured the UK multiple times, playing over 300 shows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.superpowerless.co.uk |title=Superpowerless |publisher=Superpowerless |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28[/tpl]
