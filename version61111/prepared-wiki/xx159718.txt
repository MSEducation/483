On May 16 Kaspiysk police announced that another terrorist attack had been prevented. Three terrorists were caught while planting a MON-100 mine, similar to that detonated on May 9. During the arrest, the suspects presented papers from Dagestan's Ministry of Internal affairs and said that police had no right to arrest them. Further investigation was blocked by the Russian state security service FSB, and the director of the service, Patrushev announced that "the arrested parties had no connection with terrorists". Further fate of these suspects, one of whom was identified as Rashid Dzabrailov, remains unknown

==Investigation==

According to the indictment brought after the investigation, the explosion was organized by the Dagestani militant Rappani Khalilov. Khalilov allegedly sent his envoy named Kazim Abdurakhmanov to Dagestan to organize the bombing. Abdurakhmanov offered Abdulkhalim Abdulkarimov to join the plot, and Abdulkarimov agreed. Another militant, Dzhamal Turulayev, ordered Murad Abdurazakov to build the remotely controlled land mine-based bomb. The bomb was delivered to the potential explosion spot by Khanali Umakhanov. Abdulkarimov was videotaping the bomb installation, while Turulayev triggered the explosion by remote control. 
However, on July 1, 2005, the jury found Abdulkhalim Abdulkarimov and Murad Abdurazakov not guilty of participating in the bombing.[tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Defeat parade, Kommersant, July 4, 2005.

He was found guilty of transporting the remote control device that triggered the bomb and sentenced to four years in prison, but the jury decided he did not know how the device was going to get used.[tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] Remote control determined to be a terrorism weapon, Kommersant, October 21, 2005.
