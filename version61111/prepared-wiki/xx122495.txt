Hugo Rodallega Martínez (born 25 July 1985) is a Colombian footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Fulham.
Rodallega started his professional career with Deportes Quindío in 2004. An impressive first season with the club earned him a call-up to represent Colombia at the U-20 South American Championship in 2005, where he went on to set a new record for most goals scored in the tournament. A move to Deportivo Cali and his senior international debut followed later in the year before he moved abroad, signing for Mexican Primera División side Monterrey. A disappointing spell resulted in a loan move to Atlas before being transferred to Necaxa in 2007.
In January 2009, he moved to Wigan Athletic for a fee of £4.5 million. After initially struggling at the club, he finished as the club's top goalscorer in his first full Premier League season. He scored 24 goals for the club, making him their all-time leading Premier League goalscorer.
