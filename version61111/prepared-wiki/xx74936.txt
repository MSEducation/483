MuchMusic (often referred to as Much) is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE, Inc. Much is dedicated to music and pop culture with a strong emphasis on comedy programming.

==History==

MuchMusic was licensed on April 2, 1984 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to CHUM Limited.CRTC Decision 1984-338 Shortly thereafter, MuchMusic was launched on August 31, 1984 as one of the first Canadian cable specialty channels. It was headed by the channel's founders John Martin and Moses Znaimer. The first video played on MuchMusic was "an early music-to-film synchronization short from the 1920s which featured Eubie Blake performing Snappy Songs." The first video made specifically for television air play was Rush's "The Enemy Within".
Making use of CHUM's facilities and production teams, the channel has produced many specialty musical and variety programs, including the long-running dance program Electric Circus and the late 1980s game show Test Pattern, and it adopted some programs originally created for CHUM such as City Limits, which featured alternative videos.
MuchMusic is well known for its annual music awards show that airs every Father's Day called the MuchMusic Video Awards (or MMVAs). It is anticipated and promoted for weeks before the night of the MMVAs.
MuchMusic has been credited with helping to foster a vibrant Canadian music scene because of the Canadian content broadcast rules which mandated native musical acts had a secure and prominent place on the channel's video schedule.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl] As well, MuchMusic funds the creation of new Canadian music videos through MuchFACT and produces the popular album series Big Shiny Tunes and MuchDance.

===Sale to CTV, 2006-Present===

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later renamed CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated $1.7 billion CAD, including MuchMusic. The sale was subject to CRTC approval and was approved in June 2007,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165; CRTC; 2007-06-08 with the transaction completed on June 22, 2007 while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media that same year.
Since 2007, MuchMusic has aired a vast number of non-music related programs. Before those programs aired, Much Mega Hits was a prominent program that played various music videos based on singles.
Bell Canada gained control of MuchMusic through its takeover of CTVglobemedia on April 1, 2011, in effect changing the company's name to Bell Media. Shortly thereafter, MuchMusic received a new look and a new "Much" logo, while continuing to add non-music television series, mainly dramas and reality shows.
In September 2013, the channel began airing significantly more comedy programming focused on young-adult audiences during the late afternoon and primetime hours, much of it moved from sister channel The Comedy Network. This includes Comedy Central programming such as South Park, Tosh.0 and The Jeselnik Offensive; reruns of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show; and talk shows Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Conan. Aside from its website and other uses, the channel rarely uses it's full name in promos.
Most of the channel's previous non-music programming, such as the teen dramas Pretty Little Liars and Degrassi, has moved to sister channels M3 (formerly MuchMore) and MTV respectively.http://blog.muchmusic.com/find-out-where-your-favourite-shows-moved-with-this-handy-guide/ At the same time the channel cut back further on original music-related programming apart from Video on Trial, The Wedge, countdowns, and other non-hosted blocks of music videos, with New.Music.Live. confirmed to have been cancelled and the likes of RapCity no longer appearing on Much's schedule.

==Logo==

The first logo for MuchMusic when it first began was a big "M" with "Muchmusic" boxed in the centre of the M. The logo was slightly redesigned as a big M with a small m inside the outline, with the word Muchmusic below the logo. In 1997, a new logo was designed with a black-and-white "Much" superimposed on a planet with longitude/latitude lines on the surface.
In 2010, MuchMusic began to use a new simplistic, multi-colored logo on the channel's promos, however the older logo used on-air did not change until April 1, 2011, when MuchMusic was officially relaunched with a new look. This change coincided with the completion of Bell Canada's acquisition of CTVglobemedia with the company's subsequent renaming as Bell Media. In May 2011, the logo redesign was implemented with MuchVibe. The former logo design continued to be used by MuchLoud until late 2012. Since late 2013, a black-and-white version of the current logo has been in use.

==Programming==

Much's present lineup includes sitcoms, game shows, and talk shows, with music-related programming being aired throughout the day and in the evenings. The channel also broadcasts films under its MuchMovie banner, though much of the scenes are edited or cut due to time constraints or explicit content. An example would be 8 Mile, which muted the profanity and removed the sexual and violent content.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

===Controversy===

In recent years, the popularity of MuchMusic has waned and the channel faces constant criticism that it focuses too much on "top 40" acts, reality shows and movies (the latter two usually having nothing to do with music). A main point of criticism is not giving nearly enough time to smaller, independent and Canadian performers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH8SiRg1nUQ |title=MuchMusic Station IDs from the 1980s |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]
In 2010, CTV (parent company of MuchMusic) was denied a request by the Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to reduce the percentage of music video programming that the channel shows from 50 to 25 percent. CTV's second request to the CRTC to reduce and reposition its Canadian programming was also denied. For the reasoning behind these requests, CTV explained that "music videos no longer distinguish the service as they are readily available through other sources." This was met with mixed reaction by music fans, as they believe it is MuchMusic's lack of music programming and demographic diversity that makes these other sources preferable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blogto.com/arts/2010/11/crtc_denies_muchmusics_request_to_play_fewer_videos/ |title=CRTC denies MuchMusic's request to play fewer videos |publisher=Blogto.com |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl] These changes to abandon the channel's music format has drawn the ire of notable music artists and music fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/republicofdave/004_muchless.php |title=This Magazine: Much, much less |publisher=Thismagazine.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Whaley |first=Karen |url=http://torontoist.com/2008/03/much_more_medio/ |title=Much More Mediocre | news |publisher=Torontoist |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Nick Patch The Canadian Press |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/686319--muchmusic-turns-25-quietly |title=MuchMusic turns 25...quietly |publisher=thestar.com |date= 2009-08-25|accessdate=2013-01-16 |location=Toronto[/tpl]
Much has also been the centre of controversy because of its leniency in censorship, sometimes leaving expletives uncensored from videos played on the network, in contrast to MTV, often censors certain music videos for inappropriate content. However, some programs, due to their wider audience, are edited for content. As with MTV, the network also generated controversy by occasionally "banning" videos it deemed too racy or violent for broadcast. Unlike MTV however, MuchMusic broadcasts the controversial videos in a series of late night specials dubbed Too Much 4 Much, along with panel discussions on their content and arguments on if it should be banned or not. However, recently, many of the videos are censored, and even airs the MTV censored version.

===Relationship with MTV===

MuchMusic was launched in part to capitalize on the success of MTV, an American cable music channel that had premiered a few years earlier. Although never an affiliate, Much over the years would often broadcast MTV-produced programming such as awards shows, concerts, reality series and other programs. MTV itself was not permitted in Canada because of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) restrictions on format protection. However, no such restrictions exist in the United States, where CHUM attempted to compete with MTV through MuchUSA (now the unaffiliated Fuse).
Perhaps owing to this, MTV was unwilling to extend its relationship with MuchMusic longer than necessary, and has made two attempts to launch a competing MTV channel in Canada. The first attempt began in 2001 when MTV Canada (Now MTV2) was launched by Craig Media and Viacom. MTV Canada had an edge over MuchMusic in that it was licensed by the CRTC as a broadly based teen channel and could air programming from various categories and not just music-related programming. In 2004, MTV Canada's owners were bought by CHUM, allowing Viacom to exit its contract with Craig, and stripped MTV programming and branding from the channel forcing Viacom to find another partner to bring MTV to Canada.
The next attempt began in 2006 when Viacom partnered with CTV to rebrand its low-rated specialty channel talktv as MTV. With the new launch of MTV in March 2006, MuchMusic lost all rights to MTV programming from that point forward.
Since the acquisition of CHUM Limited (which includes MuchMusic and MuchMore) by CTVglobemedia, MTV and MuchMusic have technically been under the same ownership since June 2007. CTVglobemedia has announced that it planned on maintaining all CHUM's specialty channels including both MuchMusic and MTV. Bell Media and Viacom have no plans to disaffiliate either channel from its programming and/or branding. In fact, MuchMusic and MTV have even begun cross-promoting each other's programs (e.g., MuchMusic airing a promo for MTV's The Hills). Until 2013, Much has aired many of MTV's scripted programming such as Teen Wolf & Awkward.

===Guinness World Record===

MuchMusic holds the only Canadian television record in the Guinness Book of World Records. The world's shortest television commercial is half a frame (one field) and lasted for 1/60 of a second. Twelve different versions of the commercial were produced, all advertising MuchMusic; the first of these ads aired on January 2, 2002. The creator, producer and editor was Tharanga Ramanayake.

==Affiliated channels==

With the success of MuchMusic, several spinoff channels have been launched within Canada and around the world, including:

===VJ Search===

Every few years, when new video jockeys are needed, Much runs a "VJ Search" to pick one new VJ to join the channel. They will usually visit cities across Canada and pick people who appear to show potential through their audition. In earlier years, the VJ Search was usually a two-part show, but in 2006 it evolved into its own reality series called Muchmusic VJ Search. As a result of that series, Tim Deegan was chosen as a VJ. It was followed in 2009 by VJ 2.0, where the winner Liz Trinnear was also picked to join the channel. The most recent search, Much VJ Search, which Chloe Wilde won in 2013.
Despite the popularity of the VJ Search, some of the other VJs are still hired by Much directly, without being VJ Search contestants.
