===The News Hour with Jim Lehrer===

On May 9, 2007, Morgan appeared with VoteVets.org co-founder and chairman Jon Soltz on The News Hour with Jim Lehrer. Morgan accused the veteran of "political games" and undermining the U.S. troops serving in Iraq.The News Hour with Jim Lehrer: Transcript: Grassroots Groups Seek to Influence Iraq Policy.  May 9, 2007. Executive Producer Linda Winslow responded to complaints by saying, "Since neither guest was in the studio with Judy Woodruff, there wasn't much she could do to prevent them from interrupting one another, short of saying — as she did at least three times — 'please let him/her finish his/her point'. The NewsHour style is to ask pointed questions politely; we expect our guests to subscribe to the same rules. Since the program is produced live, we can't do much to eliminate rude guests from your television screen once the segment has begun; what we can do is guarantee you will never see Morgan on our program again."Poynter Institute, Right-wing talker Morgan isn't welcome back on "NewsHour", May 17, 2007. Retrieved June 9, 2007.Michael Getler, PBS, The Ombudsman Column: Ombudsman's Mailbag, May 17, 2007. Retrieved June 9, 2007. Rather than considering her own actions, and the need to know enough about what one is talking about in the first place, in order to refute a discussion-combatant in a civilized manner, without continued resort to butting into their time-slot, Morgan subsequently blamed Media Matters for America for her persona non grata status, accusing the organization of "a bottom-line effort... where they call their people and ask them to call PBS."
