In an interview with Sylvie Myerson in the Brooklyn Rail, Levin said of her book: "There was a lot that made me want to write it as a novel, one being this whole idea that sometimes truth cannot come out as a theorem even in mathematics, let alone in a retelling of two people’s lives. Sometimes you have to step outside of the perfect linear logic of biographical facts."[tpl]cite journal | last=Myerson | first=Sylvie | title=Janna Levin in conversation with Sylvie Myerson | journal=Brooklyn Rail |date=September 2007 | url=http://brooklynrail.org/2007/09/express/janna-levin-with-sylvie-myerson[/tpl]  The book won several awards, including the prestigious PEN/Bingham Fellowship Prize for Writers and the MEA Mary Shelley Award for Outstanding Fictional Work.  It was also a runner-up for the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award.
A copy of this book was among the items seized as evidence from Bruce Ivins in an FBI raid investigating the 2001 anthrax attacks.[tpl]citation|title=FBI reveals tasers, guns and 'anger checklist' from Bruce Ivins raid|journal=New York Daily News|date=August 7, 2008|first=James Gordon|last=Meek|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-08-07/news/17903816_1_bruce-ivins-body-armor-fbi[/tpl].
