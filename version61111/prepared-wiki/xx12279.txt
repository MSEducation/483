In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy roleplaying game, the wemic is a fantastical hybrid creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a lion. Like centaurs, they are considered "tauric" creatures.

==Description==

In the game, the wemic is described as larger and stronger than humans; a wemic can leap up to 30 feet with a running start. Their front claws are sharp, and they can fight with both claws and weapons at the same time. The leonine body is described as covered with dusky golden fur, while the underbelly fur is short and white. Males are generally depicted with long mane-like hair.D&D First Edition Monster Cards Set 3, Review of Wemic Rules from 1E Monster Cards Set 3 (Cayzle's Wemic Site, 2001)

==Society==

In the Dungeons and Dragons game, Wemics are excellent hunters and fighters. Descriptions in game books state that they do not make settled homes, but generally follow the herds they hunt for food. Some[tpl]Who|date=November 2013[/tpl] have compared them with the aboriginal people of the central plains of North America. A fictional, nomadic, stone-age folk, Wemics are often represented as barbaric, illiterate, and uncivilized; they are described as famous for being highly superstitious. Others[tpl]Who|date=November 2013[/tpl] would describe Wemics as nature-oriented people with a rich tradition of oral history; they live close to the earth and are in tune with its magical forces.
In the context of the game, when Wemic must be still for a time telling stories around a fire, pausing for a meal, waiting for a friend, or just to take a brief rest, the Wemic commonly assumes a posture in which his hindquarters rest on the ground as his front legs remain straight and his forepaws stay flat on the earth. The game refers to this as sitting, distinct from sprawling (both hind and forequarters on the ground, but with torso upright) or laying down.

==Subspecies==

Wemics entered the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons in the accessory Monsters of Faerûn, which also introduced the mountain wemic: essentially the same build, but the lion portions replaced by those of a large cougar. Mountain wemics are slightly smaller than common wemics and generally solitary.

==Wemics in the Forgotten Realms==

Wemics appear in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. In the game, they inhabit the vast, imaginary, african-savanna-like grassland known as the shaar, waging war with the Loxos, Thri-Kreen and Centaurs which also dwell there.

==Wemics in other systems==

Wemics are a player race in Maelstrom, a UK based live action roleplaying game. However, in this system they appear as highly cultured, bipedal felines, rather than quadrupeds.
Wemics in the Maelstom game-world are divided into two main cultural groups - those from Amun-Sa and those from Tritoni, although there are also populations in the Free Islands, Gerosos and Lyzanium. This said, individuals or small prides of Wemics are still found all over the Known World.
