In relation to these activities, the group, again together with Bob Barker, were also accused (and named in a libel lawsuit) as having engaged in a two-year 'vendetta' against the American Humane Association for allegedly condoning animal cruelty.Game Show Host Sued For Libel - The Spokesman-Review, Thursday 31 August 1989, Page A7 In a series of public ads along with the $10 million libel suit, the Humane Association accused Barker and the group of attacking them (and a number of media projects) based on insufficient and misleading information.Speaking Up for 'Abused' Animals, Bob Barker Is Hit with a Lawsuit - People'', 18 September 1989, Vol. 32, No. 12
