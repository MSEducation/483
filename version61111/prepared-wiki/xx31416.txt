Being endowed by nature with a comprehensive mind, Razi made fundamental and enduring contributions to various fields of science, which he recorded in over 200 manuscripts, and is particularly remembered for numerous advances in medicine through own observations and discoveries.Hakeem Abdul Hameed, Exchanges between India and Central Asia in the field of Medicine An early proponent of experimental medicine, he became a successful doctor; was appointed a court physician, and served as chief physician of Baghdad and Rey hospitals.Influence of Islam on World Civilization" by Prof. Z. Ahmed, p. 127. He was among the first to use Humoralism to distinguish one contagious disease from another and has been described as doctor's doctor,Ganchy, Sally. Islam and Science, Medicine, and Technology. New York: Rosen Pub., 2008. the father of pediatrics,David W. Tschanz, PhD (2003), "Arab(?) Roots of European Medicine", Heart Views 4 (2). and a pioneer of ophthalmology.
As a practicing physician, Razi wrote a pioneering book about smallpox and measles providing clinical characterization of the diseases."Handbook to Life in the Medieval World, 3-Volume Set", by Madeleine Pelner Cosman, Linda Gale Jones, page = 52, isbn=9781438109077, publisher = Infobase Publishing Through translation, his medical works and ideas became known among medieval European practitioners and profoundly influenced medical education in the Latin West. Some volumes of his work Al-Mansuri, namely "On Surgery" and "A General Book on Therapy", became part of the medical curriculum in Western universities. As a teacher of medicine, he attracted students of all backgrounds and interests and was said to be compassionate and devoted to the service of his patients, whether rich or poor.Rāzī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakarīyā, Fuat Sezgin, Māzin ʻAmāwī, Carl Ehrig-Eggert, and E.

==Biography==

Razi was born in the city of Rey situated on the Great Silk Road that for centuries facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between East and West.Richter-Bernburg His name Razi in Persian means "from the city of Rey", an ancient town called Ragha in old Persian or Ragâ in old Bactrian.[tpl]Cite book| first1 = Mary | last1 =Boyce | first2= Grenet| last2=Frantz |authorlink=| title =History of Zoroastrianism: Under The Achaemenians| place = Leiden | publisher =Brill | year = 1982|isbn=  90-04-06506-7| page =8[/tpl] (See also the following excerpt: "the question of the identification of Avestan Raya with the Raga in the inscription of Darius I at Bīsotūn ... with Ray... has by no means been settled".[tpl]cite encyclopedia | last = Gnoli| first = Gerardo| authorlink = | coauthors = | editor = | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Iranica | title = Avestan geography | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avestan-geography | accessdate = | year = | publisher = | volume = 3 | location =  | isbn =0-7100-9121-4 | oclc = | pages = | quote = [/tpl]) It is located on the southern slopes of the Alborz Range situated near Tehran, Iran.
In his youth, Razi moved to Baghdad where he studied and practiced at the local bimaristan (hospital). Later, he was invited back to Rey by Mansur ibn Ishaq, then the governor of Rey, and became a bimaristan's head.[tpl]Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Springer|  pages = 155–156| last = Iskandar| first = Albert| title = Al-Rāzī | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures| year = 2006| edition=2nd[/tpl] He dedicated two books on medicine to al-Mansur, The Spirtual Physic and Al-Mansūrī on Medicine. Because of his newly acquired popularity as physician, Razi was invited to Baghdad where he assumed the responsibilities of a director in a new hospital named after its founder al-Muʿtaḍid (d. 902 CE).
He spent the last years of his life in his native Rey suffering from glaucoma. His eye affliction started with cataracts and ended in total blindness.Magner, Lois N. A History of Medicine. New York: M. Dekker, 1992, p. 140. The cause of his blindness is uncertain. One account attributed the cause to a blow to his head by his patron, al-Mansour; while Abulfaraj and Casiri claimed that the cause was a diet of beans only.Pococke, E. Historia Compendosia Dynastiarum. Oxford, 1663, p. 291.[tpl]cite book|last=Long|first=George|title=The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volume 19|year=1841|publisher=C.

The Oxford Handbook of Atheism. Oxford, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 641.Stroumsa, Sarah.

Al-Razi then asked him how many layers does the eye contain and when he was unable to receive an answer, he declined the treatment stating "my eyes will not be treated by one who does not know the basics of its anatomy".[tpl]cite web|url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/saab/S16R27/html-640/003-002.html |title=Saab Medical Library - كتاب في الجدري و الحصبة - American University of Beirut |publisher=Ddc.aub.edu.lb |date=1 June 2003 |accessdate=15 October 2012[/tpl]
The lectures of Razi attracted many students. As Ibn al-Nadim relates in Fihrist, Razi was considered a shaikh, an honorary title given to one entitled to teach and surrounded by several circles of students. When someone raised a question, it was passed on to students of the 'first circle'; if they did not know the answer, it was passed on to those of the 'second circle', and so on. When all students would fail to answer, Razi himself would consider the query. Razi was a generous person by nature, with a considerate attitude towards his patients. He was charitable to the poor, treated them without payment in any form, and wrote for them a treatise Man la yahdurub al-tabib, or Who has no Physician to Attend Him, with medical advises.Porter, Roy. The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity. New York: W. W. Norton, 1997, p. 97. One former pupil from Tabaristan came to look after him, but as al-Biruni wrote, Razi rewarded him for his intentions and sent back home, proclaiming that his final days were approaching.Kamiar, Mohammad. Brilliant Biruni: A Life Story of Abu Rayhan Mohammad Ibn Ahmad. Lanham, Md: Scarecrow Press, 2009. According to Biruni, Razi died in Rey in 925 sixty years of age.Ruska, Julius. Al-Birūni als Quelle für das Leben und die Schriften al-Rāzi's. Bruxelles: Weissenbruch, 1922. Biruni, who considered Razi as his mentor, among the first penned a short biography of Razi including a bibliography of his numerous works.
After his death, his fame spread beyond the Middle East to Medieval Europe, and lived on. In an undated catalog of the library at Peterborough Abbey, most likely from the 14th century, Razi is listed as a part author of ten books on medicine.Gunton, Simon. The History of the Church of Peterborough. London, Richard Chiswell, publisher, 1686. Facsimile edition published by Clay, Tyas, and Watkins in Peterborough and Stamford (1990).

==Contributions to medicine==

===Smallpox vs. measles===

This diagnosis is acknowledged by the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911), which states: "The most trustworthy statements as to the early existence of the disease are found in an account by the 9th-century Persian physician Rhazes, by whom its symptoms were clearly described, its pathology explained by a humoral or fermentation theory, and directions given for its treatment."
Razi's book: al-Judari wa al-Hasbah (On Smallpox and Measles) was the first book describing smallpox and measles as distinct diseases.[tpl]Citation needed|date= May 2012[/tpl] It was translated more than a dozen times into Latin and other European languages. Its lack of dogmatism and its Hippocratic reliance on clinical observation show Razi's medical methods. For example:
"The eruption of smallpox is preceded by a continued fever, pain in the back, itching in the nose and nightmares during sleep. These are the more acute symptoms of its approach together with a noticeable pain in the back accompanied by fever and an itching felt by the patient all over his body. A swelling of the face appears, which comes and goes, and one notices an overall inflammatory color noticeable as a strong redness on both cheeks and around both eyes. One experiences a heaviness of the whole body and great restlessness, which expresses itself as a lot of stretching and yawning. There is a pain in the throat and chest and one finds it difficult to breathe and cough. Additional symptoms are: dryness of breath, thick spittle, hoarseness of the voice, pain and heaviness of the head, restlessness, nausea and anxiety. (Note the difference: restlessness, nausea and anxiety occur more frequently with 'measles' than with smallpox. At the other hand, pain in the back is more apparent with smallpox than with measles). Altogether one experiences heat over the whole body, one has an inflamed colon and one shows an overall shining redness, with a very pronounced redness of the gums."[tpl]Citation needed|date= May 2012[/tpl]

===Pharmacy===

Razi contributed in many ways to the early practice of pharmacy by compiling texts, in which he introduces the use of 'mercurial ointments' and his development of apparatus such as mortars, flasks, spatulas and phials, which were used in pharmacies until the early twentieth century.

===Ethics of medicine===

On a professional level, Razi introduced many practical, progressive, medical and psychological ideas. He attacked charlatans and fake doctors who roamed the cities and countryside selling their nostrums and "cures". At the same time, he warned that even highly educated doctors did not have the answers to all medical problems and could not cure all sicknesses or heal every disease, which was humanly speaking impossible. To become more useful in their services and truer to their calling, Razi advised practitioners to keep up with advanced knowledge by continually studying medical books and exposing themselves to new information. He made a distinction between curable and incurable diseases. Pertaining to the latter, he commented that in the case of advanced cases of cancer and leprosy the physician should not be blamed when he could not cure them. To add a humorous note, Razi felt great pity for physicians who took care for the well being of princes, nobility, and women, because they did not obey the doctor's orders to restrict their diet or get medical treatment, thus making it most difficult being their physician.
He also wrote the following on medical ethics:

===Translations===

Razi's notable books and articles on medicine (in English) include:

==Alchemy==

===The Transmutation of Metals===

Razi's interest in alchemy and his strong belief in the possibility of transmutation of lesser metals to silver and gold was attested half a century after his death by Ibn an-Nadim's book (The Philosophers Stone-Lapis Philosophorum in Latin). Nadim attributed a series of twelve books to Razi, plus an additional seven, including his refutation to al-Kindi's denial of the validity of alchemy. Al-Kindi (801-873 CE) had been appointed by the Abbasid Caliph Ma'mum founder of Baghdad, to 'the House of Wisdom' in that city, he was a philosopher and an opponent of alchemy.
 Finally we will mention Razi's two best-known alchemical texts, which largely superseded his earlier ones: al-Asrar (الاسرار "The Secrets"), and Sirr al-Asrar (سر الاسرار "The Secret of Secrets"), which incorporates much of the previous work.
Apparently Razi's contemporaries believed that he had obtained the secret of turning iron and copper into gold. Biographer Khosro Moetazed reports in Mohammad Zakaria Razi that a certain General Simjur confronted Razi in public, and asked whether that was the underlying reason for his willingness to treat patients without a fee. "It appeared to those present that Razi was reluctant to answer; he looked sideways at the general and replied":
According to one legend he could have been blinded by steaming vapors during an accident in one of his experiments. He managed to escape with no injuries.[tpl]cite book|title=E. J.

Th. Houtsma[/tpl][tpl]verify source|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Chemical instruments and substances===

Razi developed several chemical instruments that remain in use to this day. He is known to have perfected methods of distillation and extraction.
ar-Razi dismissed the idea of potions and dispensed with magic, meaning the reliance on symbols as causes. Although Razi does not reject the idea that miracles exist, in the sense of unexplained phenomena in nature, his alchemical stockroom was enriched with products of Persian mining and manufacturing, even with sal ammoniac, a Chinese discovery. He relied predominantly on the concept of 'dominant' forms or essences, which is the Neoplatonic conception of causality rather than an intellectual approach or a mechanical one).[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Razi's alchemy brings forward such empiric qualities as salinity and inflammability -the latter associated to 'oiliness' and 'sulphurousness'. These properties are not readily explained by the traditional composition of the elements such as: fire, water, earth and air, as al-óhazali and others after him were quick to note, influenced by critical thoughts such as Razi had.

===Major works on alchemy===

Razi's achievements are of exceptional importance in the history of chemistry, since in his books we find for the first time a systematic classification of carefully observed and verified facts regarding chemical substances, reactions and apparatus, described in a language almost entirely free from mysticism and ambiguity. Razi's scheme of classification of the substances used in chemistry shows sound research on his part.

===Books on alchemy===

Here is a list of Razi's known books on alchemy, mostly in Persian:

==Philosophy==

===On existence===

Razi is known to have been a free-thinking philosopher, since he was well-trained in ancient Greek science and philosophy although his approach to chemistry was rather naturalistic. Moreover, he was well versed in the theory of music, as so many other scientists of that time.

===Metaphysics===

His ideas on metaphysics were also based on the works of the ancient Greeks:

Notable books in English:

===On Religion===

A number of contradictory works and statements about religion have been ascribed to Razi. According to al-Biruni's Bibliography of Razi (Risāla fī Fihrist Kutub al-Rāzī), Razi wrote two "heretical books": "Fī al-Nubuwwāt (On Prophecies) and "Fī Ḥiyal al-Mutanabbīn (On the Tricks of False Prophets). According to Biruni, the first "was claimed to be against religions" and the second "was claimed as attacking the necessity of the prophets."[tpl]Cite journal| volume = 9| pages = 51–100| last = Deuraseh| first = Nurdeng| title = Risalat Al-Biruni Fi Fihrist Kutub Al-Razi: A Comprehensive Bibliography of the Works of Abu Bakr Al-Rāzī (d. 313 A.h/925) and Al-Birūni (d. 443/1051)| journal = Journal of Aqidah and Islamic Thought| year = 2008[/tpl] In his Risala, Biruni further criticized and expressed caution about Razi's religious views, noting an influence of Manichaeism. However, Biruni also listed some other works of Razi on religion, including Fi Wujub Da‘wat al-Nabi ‘Ala Man Nakara bi al-Nubuwwat (Obligation to Propagate the Teachings of the Prophet Against Those who Denied Prophecies) and Fi anna li al-Insan Khaliqan Mutqinan Hakiman (That Man has a Wise and Perfect Creator), among others, listed under his works on the "divine sciences". None of these works are now extant.
Other views and quotes that are often ascribed to Razi are found in a book written by Abu Hatim al-Razi, called Aʿlām al-nubuwwa, and not in any extant work of Razi. Abu Hatim was an Isma'ili missionary who debated Razi, but whether he has faithfully recorded the views of Razi is disputed. According to Abdul Latif al-'Abd, Islamic philosophy professor at Cairo University, Abu Hatim and his student, Ḥamīd al-dīn Karmānī (d. 411AH), were Isma'ili extremists who often misrepresented the views of Razi in their works. This view is also corroborated by early historians like al-Shahrastani who noted "that such accusations should be doubted since they were made by Ismāʿīlīs, who had been severely attacked by Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā Rāzī".Seyyed Hossein Nasr, and Mehdi Amin Razavi, An Anthology of Philosophy in Persia, vol. 1, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 353, quote: "Among the other eminent figures who attacked Rāzī are the Ismāʿīlī philosopher Abū Ḥatem Rāzī, who wrote two books to refute Rāzī's views on theodicy, prophecy, and miracles; and Nāṣir-i Khusraw. Shahrastānī, however, indicates that such accusations should be doubted since they were made by Ismāʿīlīs, who had been severely attacked by Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā Rāzī" Al-'Abd also points out that the views allegedly expressed by Razi contradict what is found in Razi's own works, like the Spiritual Medicine (Fī al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī). Al-'Abd considers the content of the Spiritual Medicine to be a refutation to the claims made by Abu Hatim about Razi's religious views.[tpl]Cite book| publisher = Maktabat al-Nahḍa al-Miṣriyya| last = Abdul Latif Muhammad al-Abd| title = Al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī li Abū Bakr al-Rāzī| location = Cairo| year = 1978| pages=4, 13, 18[/tpl]
According to Abu Hatim, Razi offered harsh criticism concerning religions, in particular those religions that claim to have been revealed by prophetic experiences.[tpl]cite book | title=Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn Al-Rawandi, Abu Bakr Al-Razi and Their Impact on Islamic Thought | author=Sarah Stroumsa | year=1999 | publisher=Brill[/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Islam | chapter=Al-Razi | author=Kraus, P & Pines, S | year=1913–1938 | page=1136[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=When Islamic atheism thrived | author=Amira Nowaira | publisher=guardian.co.uk | date=10 May 2010 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-freedom-expression[/tpl] Razi asserted that "God should not set some individuals over others, and there should be between them neither rivalry nor disagreement which would bring them to perdition." He argued,
 On what ground do you deem it necessary that God should single out certain individuals giving them prophecy, that he should set them up above other people, that he should appoint them to be the people's guides, and make people dependent upon them? 
Concerning the link between violence and religion, Razi expressed that God must have known, considering the many disagreements between different religions, that "there would be a universal disaster and they would perish in the mutual hostilities and fighting. Indeed, many people have perished in this way, as we can see."
He was also critical of the lack of interest among religious adherents in the rational analysis of their beliefs, and the violent reaction which takes its place:
 If the people of this religion are asked about the proof for the soundness of their religion, they flare up, get angry and spill the blood of whoever confronts them with this question. They forbid rational speculation, and strive to kill their adversaries. This is why truth became thoroughly silenced and concealed. 
Al-Razi believed that common people had originally been duped into belief by religious authority figures and by the status quo. He believed that these authority figures were able to continually deceive the common people "as a result of people being long accustomed to their religious denomination, as days passed and it became a habit. Because they were deluded by the beards of the goats, who sit in ranks in their councils, straining their throats in recounting lies, senseless myths and "so-and-so told us in the name of so-and-so…"
He believed that the existence of a large variety of religions was, in itself, evidence that they were all man made, saying, "Jesus claimed that he is the son of God, while Moses claimed that He had no son, and Muhammad claimed that he Jesus was created like the rest of humanity." and "Mani and Zoroaster contradicted Moses, Jesus and Muhammad regarding the Eternal One, the coming into being of the world, and the reasons for the existence of good and evil." In relation to the Hebrew's God asking of sacrifices, he said that "This sounds like the words of the needy rather than of the Laudable Self-sufficient One."
On the Qur'an, Razi said:
 You claim that the evidentiary miracle is present and available, namely, the Koran. You say: "Whoever denies it, let him produce a similar one." Indeed, we shall produce a thousand similar, from the works of rhetoricians, eloquent speakers and valiant poets, which are more appropriately phrased and state the issues more succinctly. They convey the meaning better and their rhymed prose is in better meter. … By God what you say astonishes us! You are talking about a work which recounts ancient myths, and which at the same time is full of contradictions and does not contain any useful information or explanation. Then you say: "Produce something like it"‽Jennifer Michael Hecht, "Doubt: A History: The Great Doubters and Their Legacy of Innovation from Socrates and Jesus to Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson", pg. 227-230 
The above is a translation of a quote from Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi's now lost treatise, Mahariq al anbiya مخارق الانبياء (The Prophets' Fraudulent Tricks), in Abu Hatim al-Razi's refutation, A'lam al-Nubuwwah (Signs of Prophecy).[ref][tpl]cite book | title=Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn Al-Rawandi, Abu Bakr Al-Razi and Their Impact on Islamic Thought | author=Sarah Stroumsa | year=1999 | publisher=Brill | pages=103–104[/tpl]

From the beginning of the human history, all of those who claimed to be prophets were, in his worst assumption, tortuous and devious and with his best assumption had psychological problems.

==Razi's masters and opponents==

Razi studied medicine under Ali ibn Sahl, however, Ibn al-Nadim indicates that he studied philosophy under al-Bakhi, who had travelled much and possessed great knowledge of philosophy and ancient sciences.
Razi's hamud opponents, on the contrary, are well-known. They are the following:
More names could be added to this list of all people opposed by al-Razi, specifically the Mu'tazilah and different Mutakallimin.

==Criticism==

Al-Razi's religious and philosophical views were later criticized by Abu Rayhan Biruni and Avicenna in the early 11th century. Biruni in particular wrote a short Risala treatise dealing with al-Razi, criticizing him for his sympathy with Manichaeism,[tpl]cite web|author=William Montgomery Watt|date=2004-04-14|title=BĪRŪNĪ and the study of non-Islamic Religions|url=http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article31|accessdate=2008-01-25[/tpl] his Hermetical writings, his religious and philosophical views,Seyyed Hossein Nasr (1993), An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, p. 166.
