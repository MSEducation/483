[[Timeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]

CATEGORIES: Israeli–Palestinian conflict

This timeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict lists events from 1948 to the present. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians emerged from intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine between Palestinian Jews and Arabs, often described as the background to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The conflict in its modern phase evolved since the declaration of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948 and consequent intervention of Arab armies on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs.

Between 1949 and 1953, there were 99 complaints made by Israel about the infiltration of armed groups or individuals and 30 complaints of armed Jordanian units crossing into Israeli territory.UN DOC S/PV 630 of 27 October 1953 Several hundred Israeli civilians were killed by infiltrators, and some were raped and mutilated.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YUthqHRF-m8C&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=bayit+vegan+border&source=web&ots=mAZ9dkmNCv&sig=jbCr1SB8Odgv4W8OuQP6BN9OfXk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result|title=Israel's Border Wars, 1949–1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War|last=Morris|first=Benny|authorlink=Benny Morris|accessdate=2012-11-30|isbn=0-19-829262-7|pages=61|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YUthqHRF-m8C&pg=PA217&dq=morris+beit+jala+1952&ei=L7leSIjLI6bQigG90fSLDA&sig=umH6BJl5BlLyz07vUFaYtSm726U|title=Israel's Border Wars, 1949–1956: Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War|last=Morris|first=Benny|authorlink=Benny Morris|accessdate=2012-11-30|isbn=0-19-829262-7|pages=215–18|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl] Israel launched numerous reprisal raids in response. Between 1949 and 1956, 286 Israeli civilians were killed. During the same period, excluding the Suez War, 258 Israeli soldiers were killed. Between 2,700 and 5,000 Arab infiltrators were killed. It is unclear whether these Arabs were really infiltrators or were simply unauthorized crossers, as many Palestinians were crossing into Israel for economic reasons.http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/6b189672cac9e58a85256d9f006554b8

==2005–present: Post-Intifada, Gaza conflict==

After Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Hamas and other terrorists unleashed a barrage of daily rocket attacks into Israel. The city of Sderot, for example, one mile away from Gaza, was hit by over 360 Qassam rockets within a six-month period after Israel's withdrawal. In June 2006, terrorists from Gaza tunneled into Israel, killing two soldiers and kidnapping one. Two weeks later, Hezbollah, supported by Iran and Syria, attacked Israel across the internationally recognized Israeli-Lebanese border, killing eight soldiers and kidnapping two, simultaneously launching a barrage of rockets against civilian towns in northern Israel. Israel responded with a military operation that lasted 34 days. After Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli communities and refused to renew a six-month truce, Israel responded with a military operation against Hamas to protect Israeli citizens. The 22-day operation ended on January 18, 2009. In May 2010, Turkish activists with the Free Gaza flotilla tried to break Israel’s naval blockade of Hamas-controlled Gaza. In August 2010, Lebanese soldiers shot and killed an Israeli soldier during routine IDF maintenance on the border. Three Lebanese soldiers and one Lebanese journalist were killed in the exchange of gunfire.
