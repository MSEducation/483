==History==

Before the arrival of white settlers, present-day central North Dakota was inhabited by the Mandan Native American tribe.PBS Online - Lewis and Clark: Native Americans The Hidatsa name of Bismarck is mirahacii arumaaguash ("Place of the tall willows"); the Arikara name is ituhtaáwe itUhtaáwe. In 1872 the future capital city was founded at what was then called Missouri Crossing, so named because  the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed the river there. The new town was called Edwinton, after Edwin Ferry Johnson (1803–1872), engineer-in-chief for the Northern Pacific Railway. In 1873, however, the Northern Pacific Railway renamed the city Bismarck, in honor of German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, in hopes of attracting German investment.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.bismarck.org/index.aspx?NID=642 | title = Bismarck City Portrait | accessdate = 2010-09-19 | publisher = City of Bismarck | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sqbJCEnl | archivedate = 2010-09-19[/tpl] The discovery of gold in the nearby Black Hills the following year was the real impetus for growth. Bismarck became a freight-shipping center on the "Custer Route" from the Black Hills. In 1883 Bismarck became the capital of the Dakota Territory, and in 1889 the state capital of North Dakota.

===Cityscape===

Downtown Bismarck is near the center of the city, and is distinctive because the city's major shopping center, Kirkwood Mall, is there rather than in a suburban setting. Several other major retail stores are in the vicinity of Kirkwood Mall, as is the Bismarck Civic Center. The two Bismarck hospitals, St. Alexius Medical Center and Sanford Health (previously Medcenter One Health Systems) are both downtown, and the streets are lined with small stores and restaurants.
Much recent commercial and residential growth has happened in the northern section of the city, largely because of expanding retail centers. Among the shopping centers in northern Bismarck are Gateway Fashion Mall, Northbrook Mall, Arrowhead Plaza, and the new Pinehurst Square "power center" mall.
The North Dakota State Capitol complex is just north of downtown Bismarck. The 19-story Art Deco capitol is the tallest building in the city, at a height of [tpl]convert|241.75|ft|m[/tpl]. The capitol building towers over the central part of the city and is easily seen from [tpl]convert|20|mi|km[/tpl] away on a clear day. Completed during the Great Depression in 1934, it replaced an earlier capitol building that burned to the ground in 1930. The capitol grounds house the North Dakota Heritage Center, the North Dakota State Library, the North Dakota Governor's Residence, the State Office Building, and the Liberty Memorial Building. The North Dakota State Penitentiary is in eastern Bismarck.
The Cathedral District is a historic neighborhood near downtown Bismarck. The neighborhood gets its name from the art deco Cathedral of the Holy Spirit that stands in the district. Some homes in this neighborhood date back to the 1880s, although many were built in the first decades of the 20th century. For years, the city[tpl]Vague|date=June 2009[/tpl] has put forth controversial proposals to widen the streets in the neighborhood, but any such project would require the removal of many of the towering American elms which line the streets.
After the completion of Garrison Dam by the Army Corps of Engineers, the flood plain of the Missouri became a more practical place for development, and significant residential and commercial building has taken place  on the south side of the city.
