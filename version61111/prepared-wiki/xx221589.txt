The Black Brook is a small river in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England.
The Black Brook rises near the border of Calderdale and Kirklees next to Scammonden Dam. It flows downwards through Stainland Dean, and then between Greetland and Stainland. Most of the river, at this point, forms a parish border between the parishes of Greetland and Stainland. The Holywell Brook flows into the Black Brook before flowing into West Vale and going on to join the River Calder.
The valley that the Black Brook flows through is named the Blackburne Valley.
