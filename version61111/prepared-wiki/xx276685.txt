==Critical reception==

Reception for The Years EP has been mixed. While many reviewers[tpl]who|date=February 2013[/tpl] were very positive in regards to Memoryhouse's particular ambient sound, they noted that with so little music under their belt it seemed regressive that Memoryhouse release a redux of music they already recorded.http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15788-memoryhouse-the-years-ep/
