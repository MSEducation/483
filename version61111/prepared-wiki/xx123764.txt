==Life==

Ivo Taillebois was a Norman most probably from Taillebois, a small hamlet in Saint-Gervais de Briouze, Calvados.K.S.B. Keats-Rohan, Domesday People, A Prosopography of Persons Occurring in English Documents 1066-1166, Vol. I (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 1999), p. 283 He sold land at Villers to the Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen and donated a church of Christot in Calvados. The latter diploma was attested by his brother Robert. Another brother, Ralph Taillebois, was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Ivo succeeded him as sheriff after Ralph's death shortly before 1086.
In 1071 King William, with Taillebois leading his army, besieged the Isle of Ely where the rebel leader Hereward the Wake was based.Outlaws in medieval and early modern England: crime, government and society, c.1066-c.1600, eds.

His power base appears to have been in Lincolnshire, where he probably became High Sheriff of Lincolnshire before 1068.W.

William Rufus further endowed him with the lands of Ribblesdale and Lonsdale in Cumbria on the border with Scotland, possibly for his service as a royal steward. He was also granted the Barony of Kendal by William Rufus, consisting of a sizable portion of Westmorland.I.J.
