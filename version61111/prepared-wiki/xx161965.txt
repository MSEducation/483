Alnmouth railway station (Signed as: Alnmouth for Alnwick) is a station on the East Coast Main Line about one mile from Alnmouth in Hipsburn, Northumberland, northern England. It is 10â€“15 minutes by road to the town of Alnwick.

==History==

The station was opened on 1 July 1847 as Bilton by the Newcastle and Berwick Railway[tpl]harvnb|Body|1989|p=193[/tpl] and from 1854 run by the North Eastern Railway. On 1 October 1850 it became the junction for the Alnwick branch line. On 2 May 1892 the station's name was changed to Alnmouth.
It became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the North Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.
When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by the Intercity Sector until the Privatisation of British Railways.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Services==

Alnmouth station is managed by Northern Rail, even though the majority of its services are provided by other operators.
The majority of services are provided by CrossCountry trains running between Newcastle and Edinburgh. East Coast services calling here were reduced in the May 2011 timetable change so that they are less frequent. However, these services are every two hours during the day for both Newcastle/London and Edinburgh.
Occasional Northern Rail local services operating to and from Chathill also call here - currently these consist of two morning and two evening train in each direction (except Sundays).
Alnmouth will also become the eastern terminus of the Aln Valley (Heritage) Railway which is being reconstructed along the Alnwick branch line.
