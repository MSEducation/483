In actuarial science and applied probability ruin theory (sometimes risk theory[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/978-3-642-33483-2_2[/tpl] collective risk theory) uses mathematical models to describe an insurer's vulnerability to insolvency/ruin. In such models key quantities of interest are the probability of ruin, distribution of surplus immediately prior to ruin and deficit at time of ruin.

==Classical model==

The theoretical foundation of ruin theory, known as the Cramér–Lundberg model (or classical compound-Poisson risk model, classical risk process[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0167-6687(87)90019-9[/tpl] or Poisson risk process) was introduced in 1903 by the Swedish actuary Filip Lundberg.Lundberg, F. (1903) Approximerad Framställning av Sannolikehetsfunktionen, Återförsäkering av Kollektivrisker, Almqvist & Wiksell, Uppsala. Lundberg's work was republished in the 1930s by Harald Cramér.[tpl]cite doi|10.1214/aos/1176350596[/tpl]
The model describes an insurance company who experiences two opposing cash flows: incoming cash premiums and outgoing claims. Premiums arrive a constant rate c > 0 from customers and claims arrive according to a Poisson process with intensity λ and are independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables with distribution F and mean μ (they form a compound Poisson process). So for an insurer who starts with initial surplus x,[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/978-3-540-31343-4_1[/tpl]
The central object of the model is to investigate the probability that the insurer's surplus level eventually falls below zero (making the firm bankrupt). This quantity, called the probability of ultimate ruin, is defined as
In the case where the claim sizes are exponentially distributed, this simplifies to

where N(t) is a renewal process and Xi independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables with no probability mass at zero.

==Expected discounted penalty function==

Michael R. Powers[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/0167-6687(95)00006-E[/tpl] and Gerber and Shiu[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/10920277.1998.10595671[/tpl] analyzed the behavior of the insurer's surplus through the expected discounted penalty function, which is commonly referred to as Gerber-Shiu function in the ruin literature. It is arguable whether the function should have been called Powers-Gerber-Shiu function due to the contribution of Powers.
In Powers’ notation, this is defined as
In Gerber and Shiu’s notation, it is given as
There are a great variety of ruin-related quantities that fall into the category of the expected discounted penalty function.
Other finance-related quantities belonging to the class of the expected discounted penalty function include the perpetual American put option,[tpl]cite journal | last1=Gerber | first1= H.U. |last2= Shiu |first2= E.S.W. | year=1997 | title= From ruin theory to option pricing | journal = AFIR Colloquium, Cairns, Australia 1997| url = http://www.actuaries.org/AFIR/Colloquia/Cairns/Gerber_Shiu.pdf[/tpl] the contingent claim at optimal exercise time, and more.
