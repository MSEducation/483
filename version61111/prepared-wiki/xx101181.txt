She is perhaps best known for portraying the Bond girl, Rosie Carver in the James Bond film Live and Let Die. In that film, she became the first African American woman to become romantically involved with 007. She is not, however, the first African-American Bond girl; that title went to Trina Parks. When the film was first released in South Africa, her love scenes with Roger Moore were cut out because it was prohibited by the Apartheid government.
She later starred in several 1970s blaxploitation films, including the 1973 film Black Caesar and its sequel, the 1973 film Hell Up in Harlem.  She also portrayed the martial arts expert, Sydney, in Black Belt Jones.
Gloria has recently completed her memoir, entitled "Gloria". In it she discusses Bond, the films of the 70s, working as a Bunny at the famous Playboy Club in the 60s, modeling, singing and her experiences as an African American woman during the 1960s.
