==French Pass==

The island is separated from the mainland by the dangerous French Pass, known to M훮ori as Te Aumiti, through which water passes at up to [tpl]convert|8|kn|km/h mph|lk=in[/tpl] at each tide. Several vortices occur near this passage. D'Urville investigated the passage for several days in 1827, and damaged his ship passing through it.
