==History==

The London, Tilbury & Southend railway franchise was due to start in February 1996 but, because of allegations of ticketing and settlement irregularities with the preferred bidder, Enterprise Rail, it was re-tendered.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nao.org.uk/pn/9596701.htm |title=Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF): The award of the first three passenger rail franchises |publisher=National Audit Office |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/inquiry-into-ticket-fraud-stalls-rail-selloff-1317124.html|title=Inquiry into ticket fraud stalls rail sell-off|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=4 February 1996|first=Paul|last=Routledge[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/government-orders-rail-fraud-inquiry-1317400.html|title= Government orders rail fraud inquiry|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=5 February 1996 |first=Christian|last=Wolmar[/tpl]
In May 1996 the franchise was awarded to Prism Rail by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising for 15 years with an average annual subsidy of £18.4 million. It began operating as LTS Rail on 26 May 1996.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/soaring-prism-renews-rail-sale-attack-1349842.html|title= Soaring Prism renews rail sale attack|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=30 May 1996|first=Magnus|last=Grimond[/tpl]
In July 2000 Prism Rail was bought by National Express.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4458960/National-Express-buys-Prism-for-166m.html|title=National Express buys Prism for £166m|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 July 2000|location=London|first=Alistair|last=Osborne[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2000/jul/19/5|title=National Express buys Prism for £166m|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=19 July 2000|first=Keith|last=Harper[/tpl]
The franchise was originally due to finish on 26 May 2011. In December 2010 the Department for Transport granted National Express an extension until 26 May 2013 to allow it time to conduct a review of the franchising process.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2010/12/23-c2c-extension-awarded-to-national.html|title=c2c extension awarded to National Express|newspaper=Railnews|location =Stevenage|date=23 December 2010[/tpl] In March 2013 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the franchise would again be extended until 13 September 2014."Railway plan puts new focus on passengers" Secretary of State for Transport statement 26 March 2013

==Branding and marketing==

The c2c name could be conceived to represent city to coast or capital to coast, reflecting the nature of the route, or commitment to customers.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.trackoff.org/railtoday.htm |title=Railways Today |author=Track Off |accessdate=19 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080619041622/http://www.trackoff.org/railtoday.htm|archivedate = 19 June 2008[/tpl]
The c2c website states:[tpl]quote|The name c2c doesn't mean anything specific. In a sense it can mean anything you want it to. Its uniqueness reflects the young, vibrant character of the people we serve. c2c could stand for coast to capital, or capital to coast. From our point of view, one of the most important things it stands for is commitment to customers.[/tpl]
c2c used the slogan way2go, but now uses the Making travel simpler slogan also used by other companies in the National Express Group. All stations on the route are managed by c2c except [tpl]stnlink|London Fenchurch Street[/tpl] (Network Rail) and West Ham (London Underground).

==Services==

c2c operates services on the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line from London Fenchurch Street to East London and along the northern Thames Gateway area of southern Essex, including Basildon, Chafford Hundred (for Lakeside Shopping Centre), Tilbury and Southend-on-Sea. The main route from Fenchurch Street to Shoeburyness via Basildon is [tpl]convert|39.5|mi|km|2[/tpl], with a fastest timetabled journey time of 58 minutes[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/content/download/14596/185937/file/C2C+Main+Timetable.pdf |title=Train Times |publisher=c2c |date=13 December 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2010[/tpl] giving an average speed of 40.7 mph, although the route can be done in 47 minutes, an average speed of 50 mph.Rail Performance: C2C. The line has a speed limit of [tpl]convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], although the Class 357 Electrostar trains are capable of [tpl]convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].
The typical off-peak service per hour consists of 8 trains arriving and departing Fenchurch Street:
On Sundays, the non-stopping service does not run and the Grays via Rainham service is reduced to an hourly shuttle from Barking.
As c2c is mainly a London commuter railway and the average c2c journey is between 40 and 70 minutes, c2c does not offer first-class seating. Its Class 357s have standard high-density 3+2 seating to meet high demand at peak times.
London Underground's District line connects with c2c indirectly at Tower Hill (for Fenchurch Street) and directly at West Ham, Barking and Upminster. Tickets are fully interchangeable between the two operators. There are also interchanges at Limehouse and West Ham with Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and at Barking with London Overground.
The number of peak services calling at West Ham is constrained by signalling.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/latest_updates/news/new_timetable_for_c2c_begins_11_december |title=New timetable for c2c begins 11 December |publisher =c2c |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] A peak timetable introduced on 11 December 2006, with the aim of improving services for the Thurrock and London Riverside sections of the Thames Gateway, was withdrawn on 8 January 2007 after a campaign by passengers as a result of delays and cancellations that affected other lines on the network.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/latest_updates/news/morning_and_evening_weekday_peak_schedules_to_return_to_previous_patterns_as_c2c_restores_old_timetable |title=Morning and evening weekday peak schedules to return to previous patterns as c2c restores old timetable | publisher=c2c | date=3 January 2007 | accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.echo-news.co.uk/display.var.1099738.0.old_c2c_timetable_back_on_monday.php |newspaper= Southend Echo |title=Old c2c timetable back on Monday |first=Rob |last= Pritchard |date=3 January 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl]

In 2005 c2c was awarded the Golden Spanner Award at the Annual National Rail Awards. This was presented to its East Ham Depot team for its work in maintaining the fleet. In 2006, c2c held on to this award.
c2c was criticised by the Transport for London over an incident on 2 April 2007. A power failure caused by a piece of rubbish wrapped around the overhead power lines caused trains in the West Ham area to become stranded. Some passengers forced open the doors on and walked along the line. As a safety precaution, London Underground cut the power to the adjacent District line, causing serious delays to its services.[tpl]cite news |title=Power Shut Off As Delayed Passengers Jump Onto the Tracks |url= http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/891908/power_shut_off_as_delayed_passengers_jump_onto_the_tracks/ |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=4 April 2007 |accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl]

==Rolling stock==

c2c inherited a fleet of Class 302, Class 310 and Class 312s from British Rail.
To replace the Class 302s, British Rail Class 317 were hired from West Anglia Great Northern from 1996 until 1999.
A franchise commitment was the replacement of the entire fleet, resulting in c2c ordering a new Class 357 Electrostar fleet.
In 2003 c2c became the first train operating company to replace its entire fleet with new trains. In March 2007, after extensive trials, c2c began fitting regenerative braking to its fleet, becoming the first UK train operator to do so.[tpl]cite press release |url=http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/latest_updates/news/c2c_takes_the_lead_in_energy_saving_train_travel |title=c2c takes the lead in energy saving train travel | publisher =c2c |date=3 June 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl] On 3 June 2007, the eve of World Environment Day, 357010 was given an all-over green vinyl sticker livery with the slogan "All c2c trains are greener now – find out more at – www.c2c-online.co.uk – c2c – the greener way to go" to highlight the completion of the scheme, which the company says has enabled energy savings of up to 20%.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/about_us/green_credentials |title=Green Credentials |publisher =c2c |date=4 June 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl] On 2 October 2007, c2c announced that it had switched to renewably-generated electricity in all its stations, maintenance facilities and offices in a contract with E.ON UK, said to be the largest of its kind in the transport sector.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/latest_updates/news/c2c_switches_to_renewable_energy_sources |title=c2c switches to renewable energy sources |publisher =c2c |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] 357010 lost its green livery in March 2011 as part of the relivery project.
With a few Class 357s being out of service at the same time, from late 2006 two Class 321s were hired from Silverlink for three months for weekday peak-hour use on between Fenchurch Street and Laindon, and Pitsea via Rainham, to cover for the unavailable units. The Class 321s were used with guards as they were incompatible with the positioning of c2c's Driver Only Operation mirrors.
In June 2009 Bombardier began repainting the Class 357 units.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/content/download/13056/166179/c2c_CommuterNews4ppA5june_09.pdf |title=c2c Commuter News – June 2009 |publisher=c2c |date=June 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2009[/tpl] The vinyl wraps carrying the original purplish blue and magenta c2c livery were removed and the units reliveried in white with dark blue doors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/sinkplunger/3950738444/in/pool-708898@N23/ |title=Flickr: Class 357001 National Express |author=sinkplunger |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=31 December 2009[/tpl]
