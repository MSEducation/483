The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as just Burton. At the time of the Norman invasion the village was part of the manor belonging to Thorkil, but afterwards the manor was granted to Geoffrey of Swaffham by Count Alan of Brittany, who had been awarded the lands by the Crown.[tpl]OpenDomesday|OS=SE0186/wets-burton|display=West Burton|accessdate=2 April 2013[/tpl] The manor befell the same fate as other lands belonging to Geofrey in that they eventually passed to Richard Duke of Gloucester in 1480. Thereafter the descent of the manor followed that of Castle Bolton into the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64744|title=History|accessdate=22 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890 |page=342|year=1890 |publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn= 1-86150-299-0|accessdate=22 March 2013[/tpl]
