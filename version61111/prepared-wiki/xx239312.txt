==Writing and development==

Like It Like That is an album of original soul music influenced by Sebastian's previous album, The Memphis Album, which was a covers album of Memphis soul songs recorded with members of The MGs including Steve Cropper in Memphis in 2007.Sebastian, Guy (29 August 2007). Guy's Memphis Diary – Week 4. Sunday Herald Sun. Archived from the original on 21 January 2012. Sebastian and Cropper remained friends, and Sebastian made several songwriting trips to Nashville in mid-2008, staying with the Croppers on these trips.Cashmere, Paul (21 April 2008).

Archived from the original on 21 January 2012. Sebastian said in an interview with The Age in October 2009, "The most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted me to make a record like this one."Like him like that. The Age. 18 October 2009. Archived from the original on 21 January 2012. Five of the songs on Like It Like That were co-written with the album's producer David Ryan Harris, four were written entirely by Sebastian himself, and three were co-written with other writers. He later said, "I wrote the music on this album based on how I feel when I listen to the Otis Reddings and the Wilson Picketts of the world. I'll put that music on and it always just lifts me and makes me feel great."Guy Sebastian Biography. getmusic.com. Archived from the original on 28 January 2012.
In late 2008 Sebastian again travelled to the US to record some of the tracks with members of John Mayer's band. Mayer was invited to the recording sessions to put a guitar solo on one track, but stayed to contribute guitar and backing vocals on four songs. One of these songs was not included on the album. The three which are on the album are "All to Myself", "Failed to Mention" and "Never Be You". The album's second single "Art of Love" is a ballad co-written by Sebastian and Adam Rielly. It was written as a duet, but Sebastian was unable to find a singer in Australia to record it with. He had also submitted the track to Jordin Sparks, and shortly before the album was due to be released Sparks agreed to sing on the track. Sebastian flew to Los Angeles to record her vocals and later returned to film the video with her. The final track on the album, "Perfection", was written by Sebastian as a tribute to his wife Jules, and was sung by him at their wedding. He was not going to release it originally, but was persuaded by friends and family to add it to the album.
Sebastian said in an interview in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean "Like It Like That" for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product".The Yes interview. yesdating.com.au. Archived from the original on 28 January 2012. Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world."

The album received many positive reviews. Paul Cashmere from Undercover Music wrote, "By covering the classics on the The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. He has drawn from that epitome and created what should be considered the debut album from the next phase of his career. ...

Archived from the original on 22 October 2009. Ara Jansen said in The West Australian, "While there are plenty of pop elements to the album, Sebastian has finally and unabashedly unleashed his soul side.

A reviewer for TV Central wrote, "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, but it works — it really works. It's probably one of the most cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey. ... The album, while not without its flaws, is definitely one of the most artistically complex records we've heard from an 'Australian Idol' artist to date. It's rich, multi-layered and engaging."Guy Sebastian: "Like It Like That". tvcentral.com.au. 9 November 2009. Archived from the original on 28 January 2012.
In a review in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA production that seems to be the fate of most Idol winners. It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter... Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man."Patterson, Bryan. Album Review of Like it Like That. blogspot.com (Source: Sunday Herald Sun, 1 November 2009). Archived from the original on 28 January 2012. The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. "All to Myself" is a knock-out song, and book-end song "Attention" is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range."McCabe, Kathy (30 October 2009).

American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, "Great soul music is still out there, you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. ... "All to Myself" and "Attention" both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while "Bring Yourself" has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian had a hand in composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it."About Tony Peters. iconfetch.com. Archived from the original on 1 February 2012.Peters, Tony.
