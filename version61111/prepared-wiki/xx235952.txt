==Usage and association==

At least in the Anglosphere, women who own cats have long been associated with the concept of spinsterhood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with "romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women".
The term is also used to denote an animal hoarder who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them.[tpl]Citation| last = Davis| first = Susan| author-link = | last2 = Flaherty (illus)| first2 = Jake| author2-link = | title = Prosecuting Animal Hoarders is like Herding Cats| journal = California Lawyer| volume = | issue = September| pages = 26, 28, 29, 67| date = | year = 2002| url = http://www.tufts.edu/vet/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf| accessdate = June 26, 2011 [/tpl] They may be ignorant about their situation.

Naftali Berrill, Ph.D., Director of the New York Center for Neuropsychology and Forensic Behavioral Science told AOL Health, "These may be people who have a very hard time expressing themselves to other people. They may find the human need for affection is met most easily through a relationship with a pet." This devotion can sometimes signal mental or emotional issues such as depression.[tpl]cite web | last = Huso| first = Deborah| authorlink = | title = Some Live Among Hundreds of Cats |  publisher = AOL Health | date = November 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/mental-health/cat-lady | accessdate = November 2009[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
