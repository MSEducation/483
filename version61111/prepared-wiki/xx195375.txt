CATEGORIES: Austrian airliners 1920â€“1929, Hopfner aircraft

The Hopfner HV-3/27 was a small airliner built in Austria in the late 1920s. A development of the HV-2, it was a conventional, high-wing cantilever monoplane with a fully enclosed cabin and a strong resemblance to the contemporary Fokker F.II. A single example was built in 1927 and used by Hopfner's own airline until 1934.
