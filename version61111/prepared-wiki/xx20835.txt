[tpl]Nihongo|Kenjutsu|剣術[/tpl] is the umbrella term for all (koryū) schools of Japanese swordsmanship, in particular those that predate the Meiji Restoration.

This is opposed to kendo, which means "the way of the sword".
The exact activities and conventions undertaken when practicing kenjutsu vary from school to school, where the word school here refers to the practice, methods, ethics, and metaphysics of a given tradition, yet commonly include practice of battlefield techniques without an opponent and techniques whereby two practitioners perform kata (featuring full contact strikes to the body in some styles and no body contact strikes permitted in others).Contact striking during kata is used for example in Ono Ha Ittō-ryū
Historically, schools incorporated sparring under a variety of conditions, from using solid wooden bokutō to use of bamboo sword (shinai) and armor (bōgu).[tpl]rp|XII, XIII[/tpl] In modern times sparring in Japanese martial art is more strongly associated with kendo.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Early development===

It is thought likely that the first iron swords were manufactured in Japan in the fourth century, based on technology imported from China via Korean peninsula.[tpl]rp|1[/tpl] While swords clearly played an important cultural and religious role in ancient Japan,[tpl]rp|5, 14[/tpl] in the Heian period the globally recognised curved Japanese sword was developed and swords became important weapons and symbolic items.[tpl]rp|15[/tpl] The oldest schools in existence today arose in the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573), known for long periods of inter-state warfare. Three major schools emerged during this period.[tpl]rp|XII[/tpl]
These schools form the ancestors for many descendent styles, for example, from Ittō ryū has branched Ono-ha Ittō ryū and Mizoguchi-ha Ittō-ryū (among many others).
On the island of Okinawa, the art of Udundi includes a unique method of both Kenjutsu and Iaijutsu. This is the only surviving sword system from Okinawa. It was the martial art of the noble Motobu family during the Ryukyu Kingdom.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]

===Edo period===

During the Edo period schools proliferated to number more than 500,[tpl]rp|XIII[/tpl] and training techniques and equipment advanced. The 19th century led to the development of the bamboo practice sword, the shinai, and protective armor, bogu. This allowed practice of full speed techniques in sparring, while reducing risk of serious harm to the practitioner.[ref]
