"Hey Lover" is the Grammy Award winning first single released from LL Cool J's sixth album, Mr. Smith, featuring Boyz II Men. It was released on October 31, 1995 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by The Trackmasters and LL Cool J. Hey Lover would prove to be the most successful single from the album, making it to #3 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs charts, as well as #17 on the UK Singles Chart. The song sampled Michael Jackson's "The Lady in My Life" from his 1982 album Thriller, thus Rod Temperton, the writer of that song, was given credit as a writer of this song. On the B-side was the "I Shot Ya" remix.
At the Grammy Awards of 1997, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, becoming his second Grammy in that category after 1992's "Mama Said Knock You Out".
The video starred television and film actress Gillian Iliana Waters as LL Cool J's love interest in the music video.
