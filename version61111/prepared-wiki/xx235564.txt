==History==

The settlement began c.1860 when blacks who came to BC from the United States settled there.  One account of the name says it was their singing which inspired the name, another says it was one of  them, Isaac Mull, who conferred it because of his happiness at becoming a free man under British rule.British Columbia Place Names, Helen B. and G.P.V.
