Ashburton House, also known as St. John's Church Parish House or British Legation, is a house on Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C..
It was the site of 10 months of U.S.-British negotiations leading to the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.  This settled U.S.-Canada border disputes and ended the Aroostook War.
It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973.[tpl]Cite document|title=[tpl]PDFlink|National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: St. John's Church Parish House / Ashburton House (British Legation)|32 KB[/tpl]|date=April 13, 1973 |author=Benjamin Levy and Paul Ghioto |publisher=National Park Service|postscript=[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying three photos, exterior and interior, from 1973|32 KB[/tpl]
