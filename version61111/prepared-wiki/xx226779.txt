Princess Mária Antónia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya (2 July 1797 – 25 September 1862) was a Hungarian noblewoman and the ancestress of several European monarchs. She was the heiress of the Koháry family and one of the three largest landowners in Hungary.

==Life==

She was born in Buda, the only daughter of Franz Josef, Count Koháry and his wife, Countess Maria Antoinetta Josefa von Waldstein-Wartenburg.[tpl]cite book | url=http://archive.org/stream/almanachdegoth1825goth#page/106/mode/2up | title=Almanach de Gotha | publisher=Justus Perthes | chapter=Kohary | year=1825 | location=Gotha, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha | pages=3, 106-107[/tpl] Her brother Anton died in 1795, at the age of two, leaving Antónia the sole heir to the vast fortune of House Koháry. 
She inherited over [tpl]gaps|150|000[/tpl] hectares of land in Lower Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, including estates, forests, mines and factories. According to a list of assets appended to the marriage contract of her son, Prince August, at the time of his marriage to Princess Clémentine of Orléans in 1843, the Koháry properties included the enormous Palais Koháry in the center of Vienna and several Viennese manors, a summer home and lands at Ebenthal, Lower Austria, estates in Austria at Velm, Durnkrut, Walterskirchen, Bohmischdrut and Althoflein, as well as a dozen manors in Hungary, the domaine of Kiralytia, and a mansion at Pest.[tpl]cite book | title=Fortunes & Infortunes des Princes d'Orléans | publisher=Editions Artena | author=Paoli, Dominique | year=2006 | location=France | pages=107, 113, 372 | isbn=2-35154-004-2[/tpl] As late as 1868, when Antónia's grandson Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alencon, married, it was estimated that he and his three siblings stood to inherit a total of a million francs just from their share of their late grandmother's estate. Until the first world war, her descendants, the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Koháry line of the House of Wettin, were among the three largest landowners in Hungary.
On 30 November 1815, in Vienna, she married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was an elder brother of  Prince Leopold, future King of the Belgians but then consort to Princess Charlotte of Wales, who was expected to inherit the crown of Great Britain, and also elder brother of the Duchess of Kent, mother of the future Queen Victoria. To make her a suitable bride for a prince, the emperor had raised her father (whose ancestors had been created counts in the Hungarian nobility in July 1685 and barons in February 1616) to Prince Koháry of Csábrág and Szitnya in Austria's nobility on 15 November 1815, two weeks before the wedding, thereby allowing her to come to her bridesgroom already a princess.
She died in Vienna in 1862, and was buried in the ducal mausoleum on the Glockenberg cemetery in Coburg.Harald Sandner: Das Haus Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha 1826 bis 2001; Eine Dokumentation zum 175-jährigen Jubiläum des Stammhauses in Wort und Bild, Neue Presse, Coburg, 2001, ISBN 3-00-008525-4, p. 321
