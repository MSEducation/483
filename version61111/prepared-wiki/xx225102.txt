Neck or Nothing Passage ([tpl]Coord|62|28|16|S|60|20|24|W||display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a narrow passage leading from Blythe Bay between Iratais Point in the south end of Desolation Island and Miladinovi Islets, in the South Shetland Islands.  The name was applied prior to 1830, probably by whalers who frequented Blythe Bay and who at times ran their vessels to sea via this passage to escape severe easterly gales.
