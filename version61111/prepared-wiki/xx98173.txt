[[Tea bag (sexual act)]]

To tea bag is a slang term for the sexual act of a man placing his scrotum in the mouth of a willing sexual partner for pleasure or onto the face or head of another person. The name of the practice, when it is done in a repeated in-and-out motion, is derived from its passing resemblance to the dipping of a tea bag into a cup of hot water as a method of brewing tea. As a form of non-penetrative sex, it can be done for its own enjoyment or as foreplay.

==Oral sex==

Along with the penis, the scrotum is sensitive and considered to be an erogenous zone. This makes varying degrees of stimulation an integral part of oral sex for many men.[tpl]cite book|last1=MacLeod |first1=Debra |last2=MacLeod |first2=Don |title=Lip Service: A His and Hers Guide to the Art of Oral Sex & Seduction|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2009|pages=141–142|isbn=978-1-58542-696-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=htH8JeSH9XwC&pg=PA142&dq=tea%20bagging&cd=7#v=onepage&q=tea%20bagging&f=false[/tpl] Although it may be unappealing to some, it does not need to be physically harmful or uncomfortable for the individual performing the oral stimulation.[tpl]cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713105012/http://www.jhunewsletter.com/2.8146/make-sure-your-bed-is-always-comfortable-1.1133986|title=Make sure your bed is always comfortable|last=Wietsma|first=Ashley|date=22 March 2007|work=John Hopkins News-Letter|accessdate=2 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=March 2014[/tpl] It is also an activity that may be practiced within the context of BDSM and male dominance, with a dominant man tea bagging his submissive partner as a variation of facesitting or to inflict erotic humiliation.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Who says it's practiced in the context of BDSM and male dominance?

According to columnist Dan Savage, the person whose scrotum is being stimulated is known as "the teabagger" and "the teabaggee" is the one giving the stimulation: "A teabagger dips sack; a teabaggee receives dipped sack."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1473684|title=Savage Love|last=Savage|first=Dan|date=April 23, 2009|work=The Stranger|accessdate=April 19, 2010[/tpl] Sex and relationship experts have varying definitions on how the act is performed. Some consider the act to be as simple as fellatio involving the scrotum. Others consider the position to involve the man squatting over his reclined partner while the testicles are repeatedly raised and lowered into the mouth. Whether or not licking and fondling is considered tea bagging was once debated on  the Howard Stern Show.[tpl]cite book|last=Marx|first=Eve|title=What's Your Sexual IQ?|publisher=Citadel Press|year=2004|page=91|isbn=978-0-8065-2610-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UYTThJX7Vq8C&pg=PA85&dq=teabag&cd=5#v=twopage&q=teabagging&f=false[/tpl]

==Social ridicule and harassment==

Tea bagging is not always carried out consensually, such as when it is done as a practical joke, which, in some jurisdictions, is legally considered sexual assault or sexual battery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/LSU-Bama-Fans/last-time-met|title=Last Time They Met|author=Mark Winegardner|date=November 14, 2012|work=ESPN The Magazine[/tpl] It has been practiced during hazing or bullying incidents with reports including groups holding down victims while the perpetrator "shoved his testicles in victim's face"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=6927&issue=950|title=Is forcible ‘tea-bagging’ just hazing?|last=DeKoven|first=Robert|date=9 March 2006|work=Gay and Lesbian Times|accessdate=2009-11-02[/tpl] or puts his "crotch to his head."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/50966|title=Halo Inspires Schoolyard Bullies to Teabag Victims|last=Linde|first=Aaron|date=25 January 2008|work=Shacknews.com (from  Asbury Park Press)|accessdate=2009-10-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legalreader.com/archives/003197.html|title=Legal Reader: Definition of Teabagging|accessdate=2007-05-20[/tpl]

===In video games===

Mimicking the act, by repeatedly crouching over a fallen enemy, has become a popular taunt in multiplayer first person shooter video games and platform games, to imply domination, humiliation, or as a teasing joke.  Although considered to be bad sportsmanship, its use has become widespread in gaming.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sbpress.com/2008/09/the-art-and-history-of-tea-bagging/|title=The Art and History of Tea Bagging|last=Najib|first=Aminy|date=September 22, 2008|work=The Stony Brook Press|accessdate=April 15, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100713082325/http://www.sbpress.com/2008/09/the-art-and-history-of-tea-bagging/ |archivedate=July 13, 2010[/tpl]
