[[Archaeopteryx (evolutionary tree visualization and analysis)]]

CATEGORIES: Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics software, Computational phylogenetics

Archaeopteryx is an interactive computer software program, written in Java, for viewing, editing, and analyzing phylogenetic trees. This type of program can be used for a variety of analyses of molecular data sets, but is particularly designed for phylogenomics.   
Besides tree description formats with limited expressiveness (such as Newick/New Hamphshire, Nexus), ATV also implements the phyloXML[tpl]cite journal | last = Han | first = Mira V. | authorlink = | author2 = Zmasek, Christian M. | title = phyloXML: XML for evolutionary biology and comparative genomics | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 10 |issue = | publisher = BioMed Central | location = United Kingdom | year = 2009 | pmid = 19860910 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/356 | pmc = 2774328 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-10-356 | accessdate =  | pages = 356 [/tpl] format.
