The Kaiserbach or Sparchenbach is a stream in the Kaisertal in the Kaisergebirge mountains in the Tyrolean  Unterland of Austria. It rises at about [tpl]Höhe|1500|DE-NN|link=true[/tpl] near the Stripsenjoch saddle and empties near Kufstein/Sparchen into the River Inn.
The Kaiserbach was important for forestry until the beginning of the 20th century. Felled logs were hauled from many wooded mountainsides in the side valleys of the Kaisertal to the stream. The Kaiserbach was impounded ast several weirs. On subsequently opening the lock gates a strong current flowed, enabling the assembled logs to be transported in several stages to Kufstein.
The weirs were known as Klausen and the log transportation as Trift. Today all that has survived is the Haupttrift Klause, a restored collection basin on the stream bed, and its associated Klaushütte (weir hut) that used to provide worker accommodation.
The stream forms most of the municipal boundary between Kufstein and Ebbs.
