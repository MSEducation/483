Woodside Railway Station is a single-platform rural railway station on the Wairarapa Line, serving the town of Greytown in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand about five kilometres to the east. It is 30 minutes from Masterton, one hour and ten minutes from Wellington, and is served by Metlink Wairarapa Connection trains.  
The station building has in recent years been restored by the Woodside Station Preservation Society.

==History==

The original survey for the Wairarapa Line, completed in 1876, considered two routes for the line between Featherston and Masterton: the Central route and the Western route.  Despite the protestations of the residents of Greytown, the Western route was chosen due to concerns about the possibility of flooding north of Greytown, which meant that the line bypassed Greytown and passed through Woodside instead.
Woodside opened on 14 May 1880 with the extension of the line from Featherston. Until the line from Woodside to Masterton was completed and opened in November of that year, Woodside was the northern terminus of the Wairarapa Line and was operated by the Public Works Department, initially with two mixed trains between Greytown and Wellington each day.
The amenities at Woodside initially consisted of a station building and stationmaster’s house.  The station building was on an island platform between the main line and the Greytown Branch, with the junction at the southern end of the platform.  There was road access from north of the platform.  The branch (eastern) side had two loops, with capacities of 18 and 11 wagons, while on the main line (western) side there were two loops with capacities of 44 and 35 wagons.
Some years after the closure of the Greytown Branch in 1953 the main line yard was removed, and the station building relocated to a new platform on the western side of the main line.  A new crossing loop was installed, and the branch sidings reconfigured.  In 1954 the Greytown station building was relocated to Woodside and modified to serve as a goods shed. It is now disused and the loop and sidings have been removed.
With the opening of the line to Masterton and the reversion of the line to Greytown to branch-line status, Woodside became known as Woodside Junction until the closure of the Greytown Branch in 1953: the platform name board read “Woodside Junction. Change here for Greytown.”

==Services==

There are five Metlink Wairarapa Connection trains both ways on Monday to Thursday, six on Friday and two each way on Saturday and Sunday. Because of the short platforms at Woodside and Maymorn stations, passengers are asked to alight from the first three northern carriages only. 
A shuttle bus service to Greytown, Route 204, connects with the commuter trains. It is operated by Tranzit Coachlines for Metlink.
