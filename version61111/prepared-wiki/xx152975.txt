Hector Harold Whitlock (16 December 1903 â€“ 27 December 1985) was an English athlete who competed mainly in the 50 kilometre walk. He attended Hendon School, then Hendon County School, in North London, where he planted in 1936 an oak tree sapling presented to him, along with his Gold Medal, by Adolf Hitler at the Olympic Games.
Whitlock won his first national title in 1933. Two years later, he set a new world record for a 30-mile walk, finishing in 4 hours, 29 minutes, 31.8 seconds. In the same year, he also became the first recorded man to walk between London and Brighton in under eight hours.[tpl]cite news|title=Mr Harold Whitlock: Distinguished Olympic walker|newspaper=The Times|date=31 December 1985[/tpl] 
His main achievement came in 1936, where he won the gold medal in the 50 kilometre walk at the Summer Olympics held in Berlin, Germany, representing Great Britain, finishing in a time of 4 hours, 30 minutes, 41.4 seconds. He gained this victory despite being affected by sickness about 38 kilometres into the race. This sickness, apparently food-related, also affected his fellow British competitors Tebbs Lloyd Johnson and Joe Hopkins. 
During the 1936 Olympics, oak saplings were given to gold medallists. Rather than planting the oak in his garden, Whitlock offered his as a gift to his former school, Hendon School. The oak remained at the school until 2007, when it had to be removed due to a dangerous amount of rot.[tpl]cite book|last=Laffaye|first=Horace A.|title=The Evolution of Polo|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9i-bgOjaVysC&pg=PA126|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5415-0|page=126[/tpl]
He continued to represent Britain at an international level until 1952, when he came 11th at the Helsinki Olympics. Competing at the age of 48, he was Britain's oldest ever international athlete.
After this, Whitlock continued as a coach and judge. Notably, he coached Don Thompson, who won gold in the 50 kilometre walking event at the 1960 Olympics.  Whitlock served as an official at those same Olympics.
He died on 27 December 1985 at the age of 82.
In 2011, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame.
