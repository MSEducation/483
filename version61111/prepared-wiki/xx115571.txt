==Academic career==

He was assistant professor of political science at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis from 1948 to 1950, before becoming associate professor of political science Brown University. He was appointed at Stanford University in 1952 as director of the Committee for Research in the Social Sciences, supported by a Ford Foundation grant, but in 1955 he was turned down for academic tenure at Stanford.Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1997: "In 1955, he Grazia accepted a grant from the Relm Foundation for a study of "the origins and present restrictions on the political activities of workers." In preparing notes for a meeting of Stanford's board of trustees, Fred Glover flagged the grant and de Grazia's name. Two months later, Provost Terman informed de Grazia that he would not be given tenure."
From 1959 he was professor of government and social theory at New York University.Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.
In 1957 Alfred de Grazia founded PROD; Political Research: Organization and Design, later renamed The American Behavioral Scientist, an academic journal devoted to the Chicago school of behaviorist sociology. In 1965, he created the Universal Reference System, the first computerized reference system in the Social Sciences.Cliford Brock, "Political Science" in Library Trends (April 1967): "The leading exponent-and practitioner-in this area, however, has been Alfred de Grazia, professor of government at New York University and founder-editor of the American Behavioral Scientist, originally entitled PROD; Political Research: Organization and Design.(...) Through the early 1960s de Grazia made the American Behavioral Scientist a forum for writings on bibliographic and data problems in the social sciences. By 1963 he had developed a "Topical and Methodological Index," a special social science classification system consisting of some 250 terms emphasizing methodological and theoretical approaches and adaptable to computerization. This classification system was further refined and in 1965 was applied to the first of a projected ten-volume series of bibliographies in "Political Science, Government, and Public Policy. Volume 1 of this Universal Reference System series, on "International Affairs" (New York, 1965),was produced on IBM 1401/1410computers and contains citations, annotations, and indexed descriptors of over 3,000 books and articles...."

==Support for Velikovsky==

De Grazia became interested in Immanuel Velikovsky's catastrophism. Following considerable criticism of Velikovsky's claims by the scientific community, de Grazia dedicated the whole September 1963 issue of American Behavioral Scientist to the issue.Michael Polanyi, Lecture 4: Myths, ancient and modern, Lecture at University of Chicago Spring 1969. Polanyi archiveImre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and Matteo Motterlini, For and against method: including Lakatos's lectures on scientific method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend correspondence. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. ISBN 0-226-46774-0 ISBN 0-226-46775-9 He also published two books on it, The Velikovsky Affair: The Warfare of Science and Scientism and Cosmic Heretics: A Personal History of Attempts to Establish and Resist Theories of Quantavolution and Catastrophe in the Natural and Human Sciences.
Michael Polanyi stated:
In a review of the second book, Henry Bauer suggests that de Grazia's efforts may be responsible for Velikovsky's continuing notability.[tpl]cite journal  | last = Bauer| first = Henry H.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Inside the Velikovsky Affair| journal = Skeptical Inquirer| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 284–288| publisher = | location = | year = 1985| url = http://www.henryhbauer.homestead.com/DeGraziaReviewSI1985.pdf| issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = [/tpl]
In both books de Grazia subscribes to the thesis that, in the words of Henry Bauer, "the affair revealed something seriously rotten in the state of science". The review however suggests that the rejection came about…
The review further suggests that "de Grazia does not understand how the content of science is generated" and that his "understanding of science as a social activity is ambiguous."
In the second book, de Grazia upholds Velikovsky's most general claim, that geologically recent (in the last 15,000 years) extraterrestrially-caused catastrophes occurred, and had a significant impact on the Earth and its inhabitants. De Grazia terms this belief Quantavolution.

==Later career==

In the early 1970s, de Grazia founded the "University of the New World" in Haute-Nendaz Switzerland, as an unstructured alternative to American universities. He invited Beat author William S. Burroughs to teach at it. In his biography of Burroughs, Ted Morgan described the students that it attracted as "drifters and dropouts on the international hippie circuit"; he suggested that this resulted in a culture clash with the "prim Swiss", and that the university lacked adequate facilities or a sound business model.[tpl]cite book | last = Morgan | first = Ted | authorlink= Ted Morgan (writer)| title = Literary Outlaw | publisher = Avon | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8050-0901-9 |pages= 453–454[/tpl]
In 2002, de Grazia was appointed "visiting professor" in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, Computing and Applications of the University of Bergamo.unibg.it staff entry He has previously been a visiting lecturer at the University of Rome, University of Bombay, University of Istanbul, and University of Gothenburg.
