[[Van Allen radiation belt]]

CATEGORIES: Geomagnetism, Space physics, Space plasmas

A Van Allen radiation belt is one of  at least two layers of energetic charged particles (plasma) that is held in place around the planet Earth by the planet's magnetic field. The belts extend from an altitude of about 1,000 to 60,000 kilometers above the surface in which region radiation levels vary. Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays.[tpl]cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/astronomy-terms/van-allen-radiation-belts-info.htm |title=Van Allen Radiation Belts |work=HowStuffWorks |publisher=Discovery Communications, Inc. |location=Silver Springs, MD |accessdate=2011-06-05[/tpl] The belts are named after their discoverer, James Van Allen, and are located in the inner region of the Earth's magnetosphere. The belts contain energetic electrons that form the outer belt and a combination of protons and electrons that form the inner belt. The radiation belts additionally contain lesser amounts of other nuclei, such as alpha particles. The belts endanger satellites, which must protect their sensitive components with adequate shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the radiation belts. In 2013, NASA reported that the Van Allen Probes had discovered a transient, third radiation belt, which was observed for four weeks until destroyed by a powerful, interplanetary shock wave from the Sun.[tpl]cite web |url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/28feb_thirdbelt/ |title=Van Allen Probes Discover a New Radiation Belt |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |date=February 28, 2013 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |accessdate=2013-04-05[/tpl]

==Discovery==

Kristian Birkeland, Carl Størmer, and Nicholas Christofilos had investigated the possibility of trapped charged particles before the Space Age. Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 confirmed the existence of the belt in early 1958 under James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. The trapped radiation was first mapped out by Explorer 4, Pioneer 3 and Luna 1.
The term Van Allen belts refers specifically to the radiation belts surrounding Earth; however, similar radiation belts have been discovered around other planets. The Sun itself does not support long-term radiation belts, as it lacks a stable, global dipole field. The Earth's atmosphere limits the belts' particles to regions above 200–1,000 km,[tpl]cite book |last=Walt |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Walt |title=Introduction to Geomagnetically Trapped Radiation |origyear=Originally published 1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-61611-5 |oclc=63270281 |lccn=2006272610[/tpl] while the belts do not extend past 7 Earth radii RE. The belts are confined to a volume which extends about 65° from the celestial equator.

==Research==

The NASA Van Allen Probes mission will go further and gain scientific understanding (to the point of predictability) of how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind.
NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts–funded studies have proposed magnetic scoops to collect antimatter that naturally occurs in the Van Allen belts of Earth, although only about 10 micrograms of antiprotons are estimated to exist in the entire belt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/abstracts/1071Bickford.pdf |title=Extraction of Antiparticles Concentrated in Planetary Magnetic Fields |last=Bickford |first=James |publisher=NASA/NIAC |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-05-24[/tpl]
The Van Allen Probes mission successfully launched on August 30, 2012.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/news/rbsp-launchnews.html |title=RBSP Launches Successfully - Twin Probes are Healthy as Mission Begins |date=August 30, 2012 |editor-last=Zell |editor-first=Holly |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-09-02[/tpl]  The primary mission is scheduled to last two years with expendables expected to last four. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center manages the overall Living With a Star program of which the Van Allen Probes is a project, along with Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The Applied Physics Laboratory is responsible for the overall implementation and instrument management for the Van Allen Probes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://rbsp.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/intheloop/2010_01.php |title=Construction Begins! |date=January 2010 |website=The Van Allen Probes Web Site |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl]
Van Allen radiation belts exist on other planets and planets in the solar system that have a magnetic field that is powerful enough to sustain a radiation belt. However, many of these radiation belts have been poorly mapped. The Voyager Program (namely Voyager 2) only nominally confirmed the existence of similar belts on Uranus and Neptune.

==Outer belt==

The large outer radiation belt is almost toroidal in shape, extending from an altitude of about three to ten Earth radii (RE) or [tpl]convert|13000|to|60000|km|mi[/tpl] above the Earth's surface. Its greatest intensity is usually around 4–5 RE. The outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by the inward radial diffusion and local acceleration due to transfer of energy from whistler-mode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons. Radiation belt electrons are also constantly removed by collisions with atmospheric neutrals, losses to magnetopause, and the outward radial diffusion. The outer belt consists mainly of high energy (0.1–10 MeV) electrons trapped by the Earth's magnetosphere. The gyroradii for energetic protons would be large enough to bring them into contact with the Earth's atmosphere. The electrons here have a high flux and at the outer edge (close to the magnetopause), where geomagnetic field lines open into the geomagnetic "tail", fluxes of energetic electrons can drop to the low interplanetary levels within about [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl], a decrease by a factor of 1,000.
The trapped particle population of the outer belt is varied, containing electrons and various ions. Most of the ions are in the form of energetic protons, but a certain percentage are alpha particles and O+ oxygen ions, similar to those in the ionosphere but much more energetic. This mixture of ions suggests that ring current particles probably come from more than one source.
The outer belt is larger than the inner belt and its particle population fluctuates widely. Energetic (radiation) particle fluxes can increase and decrease dramatically as a consequence of geomagnetic storms, which are themselves triggered by magnetic field and plasma disturbances produced by the Sun. The increases are due to storm-related injections and acceleration of particles from the tail of the magnetosphere.
On February 28, 2013, a third radiation belt was reported to be discovered. In a news conference by NASA's Van Allen Probe team, it was stated that this third belt is generated when a mass coronal ejection is created by the Sun. It has been represented as a separate creation which splits the Outer Belt, like a knife, on its outer side, and exists separately as a storage container for a month's time, before merging once again with the Outer Belt.[tpl]youtube|yLw9a5t-sUs|NASA's Van Allen Probes Discover Third Radiation Belt Around Earth[/tpl]

==Inner belt==

While protons form one radiation belt, trapped electrons present two distinct structures, the inner and outer belt. The inner electron Van Allen Belt extends typically from an altitude of 0.2 to 2 Earth radii (L values of 1 to 3) or 600 miles (1,000 km) to 3,700 miles (6,000 km) above the Earth. In certain cases when solar activity is stronger or in geographical areas such as the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), the inner boundary may go down to roughly 200 kilometers[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spacewx.com/Docs/ECSS-E-ST-10-04C_15Nov2008.pdf |title=Space Environment Standard ECSS-E-ST-10-04C |date=November 15, 2008 |publisher=ESA Requirements and Standards Division |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] above the Earth's surface. The inner belt contains high concentrations of electrons in the range of hundreds of keV and energetic protons with energies exceeding 100 MeV, trapped by the strong (relative to the outer belts) magnetic fields in the region.
It is believed that proton energies exceeding 50 MeV in the lower belts at lower altitudes are the result of the beta decay of neutrons created by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei of the upper atmosphere. The source of lower energy protons is believed to be proton diffusion due to changes in the magnetic field during geomagnetic storms.[tpl]cite book |last=Tascione |first=Thomas F. |title=Introduction to the Space Environment |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Krieger Publishing Co.| location=Malabar, FL | isbn=0-89464-044-5 |oclc=28926928 |lccn=93036569[/tpl]
Due to the slight offset of the belts from Earth's geometric center, the inner Van Allen belt makes its closest approach to the surface at the South Atlantic Anomaly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/tour/AAvan.html |title=The Van Allen Belts |publisher=NASA/GSFC |accessdate=2011-05-25[/tpl]

On March 2014, a pattern resembling  'zebra stripes'  was discovered in the radiation belts by NASA in their energetic particle experiment, RBSPICE. The reason reported was that due to the tilt in Earth's magnetic field axis, the planet’s rotation generated an oscillating, weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt.  The field affects the electrons as if they behave like fluids.[tpl]cite web|title=Twin NASA probes find 'zebra stripes' in Earth's radiation belt|url=http://www.universetoday.com/110482/twin-nasa-probes-find-zebra-stripes-in-earths-radiation-belt|publisher=Universe Today|accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]
The global oscillations slowly stretch and fold the fluid resulting in the striped pattern observed across the entire inner belt, extending from above Earth’s atmosphere, about 800 km above the planet’s surface up to roughly 13,000km.NASA's Van Allen Probes Reveal Zebra Stripes in Space, NASA, Retrieved March 19, 2014

==Flux values==

In the belts, at a given point, the flux of particles of a given energy decreases sharply with energy.
At the magnetic equator, electrons of energies exceeding 500 keV (resp. 5 MeV) have omnidirectional fluxes ranging from 1.2×106 (resp. 3.7×104) up to 9.4×109 (resp. 2×107) particles per square centimeter per second.
The proton belts contain protons with kinetic energies ranging from about 100 keV (which can penetrate 0.6 µm of lead) to over 400 MeV (which can penetrate 143 mm of lead).[tpl]cite book |last=Hess |first=Wilmot N. |author-link=Wilmot N. Hess |title=The Radiation Belt and Magnetosphere |year=1968 |publisher=Blaisdell Pub. Co. |location=Waltham, MA |oclc=712421 |lccn=67019536[/tpl]
Most published flux values for the inner and outer belts may not show the maximum probable flux densities that are possible in the belts. There is a reason for this discrepancy: the flux density and the location of the peak flux is variable (depending primarily on solar activity), and the number of spacecraft with instruments observing the belt in real time has been limited. The Earth has not experienced a solar storm of Carrington event intensity and duration while spacecraft with the proper instruments have been available to observe the event.
Regardless of the differences of the flux levels in the Inner and Outer Van Allen belts, the beta radiation levels would be dangerous to humans if they were exposed for an extended period of time.[tpl]cite conference |url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/69-19.htm |title=Radiation Plan for the Apollo Lunar Mission |last1=Modisette |first1=Jerry L. |last2=Lopez |first2=Manuel D. |last3=Snyder |first3=Joseph W. |date=January 20–22, 1969 |conference=AIAA 7th Aerospace Sciences Meeting |location=New York |id=AIAA Paper No. 69-19 |accessdate=2011-05-25[/tpl]

==Antimatter confinement==

In 2011, a study has confirmed earlier speculation that the Van Allen belt could confine antiparticles. The PAMELA experiment detected orders of magnitude higher levels of antiprotons than are expected from normal particle decays while passing through the SAA. This suggests the Van Allen belts confine a significant flux of antiprotons produced by the interaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere with cosmic rays.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/737/2/L29 | title = The Discovery of Geomagnetically Trapped Cosmic-Ray Antiprotons | year = 2011 | last1 = Adriani | first1 = O. | last2 = Barbarino | first2 = G.

==Implications for space travel==

Missions beyond low Earth orbit leave the protection of the geomagnetic field, and transit the Van Allen belts. Thus they may need to be shielded against exposure to cosmic rays, Van Allen radiation, or solar flares. The region between two to four Earth radii lies between the two radiation belts and is sometimes referred to as the "safe zone".[ref]

Solar cells, integrated circuits, and sensors can be damaged by radiation. Geomagnetic storms occasionally damage electronic components on spacecraft. Miniaturization and digitization of electronics and logic circuits have made satellites more vulnerable to radiation, as the total electric charge in these circuits is now small enough so as to be comparable with the charge of incoming ions. Electronics on satellites must be hardened against radiation to operate reliably. The Hubble Space Telescope, among other satellites, often has its sensors turned off when passing through regions of intense radiation.[tpl]cite press release |last=Weaver |first=Donna |title=Hubble Achieves Milestone: 100,000th Exposure |date=July 18, 1996 |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |location=Baltimore, MD |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/25/text/ |id=STScI-1996-25 |accessdate=2009-01-25[/tpl] A satellite shielded by 3 mm of aluminium in an elliptic orbit ([tpl]convert|200|by|20000|mi|km[/tpl]) passing the radiation belts will receive about 2,500 rem (25 Sv) per year. Almost all radiation will be received while passing the inner belt.[tpl]cite web | last=Ptak |first=Andy| year=1997| title=Ask an Astrophysicist | publisher = NASA/GSFC | url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970228a.html | accessdate=2006-06-11[/tpl]
The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[tpl]cite web|last=Bailey|first=J. Vernon|title=Radiation Protection and Instrumentation|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch3.htm|work=Biomedical Results of Apollo|accessdate=2011-06-13[/tpl] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them.[tpl]Cite book| last=Woods |first=W. David| title=How Apollo Flew to the Moon| year=2008| publisher=Springer-Verlag| location=New York| isbn=978-0-387-71675-6|page=109[/tpl] The command module's inner structure was an aluminum "sandwich" consisting of a welded aluminium inner skin, a thermally bonded honeycomb core, and a thin aluminium "face sheet". The steel honeycomb core and outer face sheets were thermally bonded to the inner skin.
In fact, the astronauts' overall exposure was dominated by solar particles once outside Earth's magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.

==Causes==

It is generally understood that the inner and outer Van Allen belts result from different processes. The inner belt, consisting mainly of energetic protons, is the product of the decay of so-called "albedo" neutrons which are themselves the result of cosmic ray collisions in the upper atmosphere. The outer belt consists mainly of electrons. They are injected from the geomagnetic tail following geomagnetic storms, and are subsequently energized through wave-particle interactions.
In the inner belt, particles are trapped in the Earth's nonlinear magnetic field, that originate from the sun. Particles gyrate and move along field lines. As particles encounter regions of larger density of  magnetic field lines, their "longitudinal" velocity is slowed and can be reversed, reflecting the particle. This causes the particles to bounce back and forth between the Earth's poles.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html |title=The Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere |last1=Stern |first1=David P. |last2=Peredo |first2=Mauricio |website=The Exploration of the Earth's Magnetosphere |publisher=NASA/GSFC |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] Globally, the motion of these trapped particles is chaotic.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Dilão |first1=R. |last2=Alves-Pires |first2=R. |year=2007 |title=Chaos in the Störmer problem |journal=Progress In Nonlinear Differential Equations and Their Applications |volume=75 |pages=175–194 |publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag Basel |oclc=225210556[/tpl]
A gap between the inner and outer Van Allen belts, sometimes called safe zone or safe slot, is caused by the Very Low Frequency (VLF) waves which scatter particles in pitch angle which results in the gain of particles to the atmosphere. Solar outbursts can pump particles into the gap but they drain again in a matter of days. The radio waves were originally thought to be generated by turbulence in the radiation belts, but recent work by James L. Green of the Goddard Space Flight Center comparing maps of lightning activity collected by the Microlab 1 spacecraft with data on radio waves in the radiation-belt gap from the IMAGE spacecraft suggests that they are actually generated by lightning within Earth's atmosphere. The radio waves they generate strike the ionosphere at the right angle to pass through it only at high latitudes, where the lower ends of the gap approach the upper atmosphere. These results are still under scientific debate.
There have been nuclear tests in space that have caused artificial radiation belts. Starfish Prime, a high altitude nuclear test, created an artificial radiation belt that damaged or destroyed as many as one third of the satellites in low Earth orbit at the time.

==Proposed removal==

The belts are a hazard for artificial satellites and are dangerous for human beings, and are difficult and expensive to shield against.
High Voltage Orbiting Long Tether, or HiVOLT, is a concept proposed by Russian physicist V.V. Danilov and further refined by Robert P. Hoyt and Robert L. Forward for draining and removing the radiation fields of the Van Allen radiation belts[tpl]cite web |url=http://radbelts.gsfc.nasa.gov/outreach/RadNews.html |title=NASA outreach: RadNews |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130613193849/http://radbelts.gsfc.nasa.gov/outreach/RadNews.html |archivedate=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] that surround the Earth.  A proposed configuration consists of a system of five 100 km long conducting tethers deployed from satellites, and charged to a large voltage. This would cause charged particles that encounter the tethers to have their pitch angle changed, thus over time dissolving the inner belts. Hoyt and Forward's company, Tethers Unlimited, performed a preliminary analysis simulation, and produced a chart depicting a theoretical radiation flux reduction,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tethers.com/WebImages/HiVOLT_Results.jpg |title=HiVOLT_Results.jpg |publisher=Tethers Unlimited |accessdate=2013-09-27[/tpl] Chart depicting radiation flux reduction. to less than 1% of current levels within two months for the inner belts that threaten LEO objects.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tethers.com/HiVOLT.html | title=High-Voltage Orbiting Long Tether (HiVOLT): A System for Remediation of the Van Allen Radiation Belts | accessdate=2011-06-18 | publisher=Tethers Unlimited [/tpl]
