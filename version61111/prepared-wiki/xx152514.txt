===May 2008 Hardball appearance===

James achieved notoriety for a May 15, 2008, guest spot on the MSNBC television program Hardball with Chris Matthews, in which James supported an apparent comparison by President George W. Bush of Democratic primary presidential candidate Barack Obama to American Senator William Borah of Idaho, who was serving at the time of Hitler's invasion of Poland.Video Clip Appearance from MSNBC
Earlier that day, President George W. Bush, addressing the Israeli Knesset, had said:
"Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals, as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along. We have heard this foolish delusion before. As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939, an American senator declared: 'Lord, if I could only have talked to Hitler, all this might have been avoided.' We have an obligation to call this what it is -- the false comfort of appeasement, which has been repeatedly discredited by history."
"Some people suggest if the United States would just break ties with Israel, all our problems in the Middle East would go away. This is a tired argument that buys into the propaganda of the enemies of peace, and America utterly rejects it."http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/05/20080515-1.html White House Transcript, May 15, 2008
On the show, James said, "Well, I don't know who he was talking about for sure, Chris, but if he wasn't talking about Barack Obama, he should have been talking about Barack Obama, I hope he was talking about Barack Obama."  The other guest, Air America Radio president and Democratic politician Mark J. Green, denounced Bush's comparison.
In the interview, host Chris Matthews asked James what he thought British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did wrong in 1938-1939 in the lead-up to Hitler invading Poland. When James failed to give an answer more specific than "he was an appeaser," and pointed out that it was President Bush who made the reference to history, not James himself, Matthews repeated the same questions, eventually stating that Chamberlain's appeasement came in the form of giving away half of Czechoslovakia, rather than merely talking to Hitler. After this back and forth went on for a few minutes, James stated that if you are going to negotiate with your enemies, you have to negotiate from strength. A clearly frustrated Matthews ended the segment by saying,  "You trying to defend something, you don't know what you're talking about. If you don't understand 'appeasement' then don't use the word. It's giving away things to the enemy. Not talking to the enemy." 
James appeared on the January 12, 2009, episode of The Daily Show, the American late night satirical news show, as a direct result of his Hardball appearance.Huffington Post article: ""Daily Show's" Jason Jones Goes To Pundit School (VIDEO)".
