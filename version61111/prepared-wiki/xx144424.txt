Kelana Jaya LRT station is a light rail station on the Kelana Jaya Line. It is the western terminus for passenger services on the line. The line extends further to the maintenance depot in Lembah Subang.
The station is located besides the southbound carriageway on the Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP) between exit 1108 and 1109, although there is an overhead crossing for pedestrians to cross the highway. It is one of the 5 stations on the Kelana Jaya line located in the city of Petaling Jaya
Located nearby are the neighbourhoods of SS2, Kelana Jaya (SS4 and SS5), and Taman Mayang (SS25). As the station is on a major expressway, it is well served by bus connections that take passengers to the areas of PJ Utara, Tropicana, Subang Jaya, and Sunway. It is also a local taxi hub.

==Station layout==

The station is built in a similar design to most of the other above-ground stations on the Kelana Jaya Line. The large roof over the platform level is reminiscent of traditional Malay kampung architectural design. In addition to the main station, there is a side building that connects to the platform level which houses more shops and connects to the pedestrian overhead bridge over the Damansara-Puchong Expressway.

==Bus services==

Kelana Jaya LRT station is also a rapidKL bus hub for the surrounding areas of Petaling Jaya. To serve this purpose, there is a major bus stop located opposite the expressway on the northbound carriageway, linked to the station by a pedestrian bridge. Buses depart from the station on the southbound carriageway, but many buses drop their passengers at the bus stop as this avoids congestion in the station bus terminal.
