==History==

The area was part of the [tpl]convert|100,000|acre|sp=us|adj=on[/tpl] grant to the family of Col. John Preston's wife, which he administered on her behalf. The grant was intended to permit British colonization beyond the Blue Mountains but subsequent French and Indian resistance and a reversal of British policy limited its impact. The land was not settled until John Spurlock of Montgomery County, Virginia, arrived in 1791. He laid out the town of Preston's Station in 1797. Other early settlers included Solomon Stratton, Matthias Harman, and Andrew Hood.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] It became the seat of Floyd Co. upon its formation in 1799 and was formally established in 1818. The post office was known as Floyd Court House from its establishment in 1816 until the late 1820s, when it was renamed Prestonsburg.Rennick, Robert. Kentucky Place Names, p. 242.
