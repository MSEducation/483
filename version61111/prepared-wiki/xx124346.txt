The Geto Boys is a Remix album by the Geto Boys released in 1990. The album contains one track from the group’s debut album Making Trouble (1988), 10 from their previous album Grip It! On That Other Level (1989), and two new songs. All tracks on the album were remixed and revamped by acclaimed producer Rick Rubin with his protégé Brendan O'Brien. The cover of the album resembles The Beatles' album Let It Be, and the songs attracted much controversy upon its release.

==Controversy and release==

The original Def American pressing is the only WEA-distributed album with the following warning in addition to the standard explicit-lyrics sticker:
Due to the controversial nature of the lyrics, especially in the songs "Mind of a Lunatic" and "Assassins", the album's originally intended distributor, Geffen Records, and CD manufacturer Sony DADC, which manufactured Geffen's releases, refused to have any part in the release.Pareles.

Records, which agreed to distribute the album and all following Def American releases with product manufacturing by WEA Manufacturing.Hochman, Steve.

Subsequent pressings on Rap-a-Lot and various distributors do not contain the secondary warning and an alternative version of "Gangster of Love" that uses a sample from Lynyrd Skynyrd’s "Sweet Home Alabama" instead of the Steve Miller Band’s "The Joker."[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] "Do It Like a G.O." was released as a single with a music video but did not chart.

==Reception==

In a 3.5-mike out of 5 review, The Source wrote positively of Rick Rubin's contribution to the album, writing, "The group's fuck-everybody attitude and simple straight-forward music is a perfect match for Rubin...." (Summer 1990) "Classic review : Grip It On That Other Level in The Source (1990)". The Source. Andy Kellman of AllMusic also praised Rick Rubin's contribution, writing, "The album is expertly sequenced, and some songs seem to have twice the impact of their original incarnations."Kellman, Andy. "The Geto Boys - Geto Boys". AllMusic. Retrieved 17 June 2011
Robert Christgau, on the other hand, criticized the album, comparing it negatively to slasher films. Christgau ended the review, writing, "I'm impressed by its pungent beats and vernacular. I'm glad they put Reagan in bed with Noriega. I'm sorta touched when one of them thinks to thank the first girl to lick his asshole. I admire their enunciation on 'Fuck ’Em.' But fuck ’em."Christgau, Robert. "Robert Christgau: Album: The Geto Boys: The Geto Boys". Consumer Guide. Retrieved 17 June 2011 In another mixed review, Entertainment Weekly's Greg Sandow ridiculed the album's glorification of violence, writing, "The catalog starts to seem silly. Stealing from the poor? On their next album, the Geto Boys might just as well do a song about tearing wings off flies."Sandow, Greg (12 October 1990). "The Geto Boys Review". Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved 18 June 2011
