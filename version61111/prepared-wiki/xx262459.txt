[[Shirakawa River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Kyoto Prefecture

The [tpl]nihongo|Shirakawa River|白川|Shirakawa[/tpl] is a river in the Kyoto prefecture of Japan. It flows into the Kamo River. 
Its name means "white river" in Japanese, due to the fine-grained white sand that it carries from the hills east of Kyoto.
Directly before entering the Kamo River, it passes through the geisha district of Gion, where many traditional establishments, such as ochaya (geisha houses) and restaurants, line the river.
