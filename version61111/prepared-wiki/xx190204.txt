Scott & Muriel is the stage name of the comedy duo Scott Nelson and Muriel Brugman, a husband and wife team of comedy illusionists and entertainers.  Their style of performance can best be described as "slapstick magic," a combination of visual comedy, slapstick, modern clowning, and illusions.
All the material and illusions they perform they created, designed and built themselves.  
They began working together in 1999.  In June, 2000, they won the title "National Champions of Holland" at the Dutch National Congress of Magic.  
One month later in July 2000, they won the highest award in magic, the FISM Grand Prix, and with it the title "World Champions of Magic." http://www.fism.org/GrandPrixWinners.htm They are the first and only comedy magic duo to have won this award.

In 2006 Scott & Muriel took over the production of the show and it has since toured in Austria and Germany.
