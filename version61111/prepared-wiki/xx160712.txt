Samson Cerfberr of Medelsheim (born at Strasburg about 1780; committed suicide at Paris, 1826) was a French soldier and author.
He led an erratic and adventurous life, wandering over the world, changing his name and even his religion several times. At one time he is disguised as a Muslim with the name of "Ibrahim Manṣur Effendi", serving in the Turkish army; at another he is found holding office in Westphalia under the name of "Medelsheim".
In 1813, he took on the name Ibrahim Cerfberovic[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] and fought against the Serbians in Bosnia serving alongside men such as Osman Gradaščević while serving in the district of Zvornik; the Serbs were eventually defeated after the arrival of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Hursid Pasha in 1813.
