==Biography==

Halit Refiğ graduated from Şişli Terakki High School in 1951 and studied engineering at Robert College in Istanbul.
Refiğ directed his first films in 8mm while he served as a military reserve officer in Korea, Japan and Ceylon. He wrote articles on cinema at newspapers in 1956 and published the Sinema Dergisi magazine together with Nijat Özön. He began his career as Atıf Yılmaz's assistant in 1957 together with Yılmaz Güney. He worked as scriptwriter for Atıf Yılmaz and Memduh Ün. His directorial debut was Forbidden Love (Yasak Aşk) (1961). His 1962 film Stranger in the City was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1963 |title=3rd Moscow International Film Festival (1963) |accessdate=2012-12-01 |work=MIFF[/tpl]
In the 1970s, with the decline in Turkish cinema, he started to work extensively for TV. In 1974, he contributed as an instructor to the first cinema education programs initiated by the Istanbul State Fine Arts Academy (the Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts of today) where he started to work as lecturer in 1975.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=halit-refig-laid-to-rest-2009-10-13 |newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News |title= Film director, lecturer Halit Refiğ laid to rest |author= |date=October 13, 2009 |language= |accessdate=October 21, 2009[/tpl] In 1975, he directed the TV series Aşk-ı Memnu (Forbidden Love) which was aired on the Turkish Radio Television, TRT. This TV serial is considered to be the first miniseries on Turkish television stations. In 1978, he wrote a script for a documentary about the life of Mimar Sinan on commission from the Mimar Sinan University. The project was not completed but the script was published.
In 1999, on commission from the then Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit, he began developing a feature film project titled Devlet Ana (Mother State), to be released on the 700th anniversary of the establishment of the Ottoman Empire. The project was going to be conducted in collaboration with the Mimar Sinan University (MSU). In 2001, Refiğ stated that he will not collaborate with MSU and thus the project was not realized.

==Censorship==

Refiğ's 1979-81 adaptation of Kemal Tahir's novel, Yorgun Savaşçı, for TRT, where he served as an advisor, was banned from broadcast by TRT on accounts of incorporating scenes which were anti-Atatürk, anti-Turkish Independence War, and pro-Çerkes Ethem. A commission of seven people comprising three colonels, a representative of the Ministry of Interior, a representative of the press office of the Prime Minister, two TRT representatives, and Turgut Özakman, the director of the Turkish State Theatres, representing the Ministry of Culture, was formed on order from President Kenan Evren and Prime Minister Bülent Ulusu and the prints were burnt in 1983 by TRT director Macit Akman, at the furnaces of the Turkish General Staff printhouse under the supervision of the said commission. This censorship caused public controversy. A surviving copy surfaced in 1993 and the 8-episode miniseries was broadcast in its entirety on TRT.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Ombudsman/HaberDetay.aspx?aType=HaberDetay&ArticleID=1151864&Date=21.10.2009&Kategori=ombudsman&b=Ask-i%20Memnu%20degil%20Kaynanalar |newspaper=Milliyet|title=Aşk-ı Memnu değil Kaynanalar |author=|date=October 19, 2009|language=Turkish |accessdate=October 21, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/2009/10/15/haber/yasam/2418/_komisyonda_olmam_buyuk_talihsizlikti_.html |newspaper=Akşam|title='Komisyonda olmam büyük talihsizlikti'|author=Güney Elbir, Nurbanu |date=October 15, 2009|language=Turkish |accessdate=October 21, 2009[/tpl]
