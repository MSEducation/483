Professor Abe, through his teaching and books, has made an important contribution to the Western understanding of Japanese Buddhism. His book on Kūkai underscores Kūkai’s impact on 9th century Japanese society.  At a time when Confucian discourse dominated Japan, Kūkai developed a “voice” for Buddhism. He has also written about Ryōkan, and Saichō.

He then received his M.Phil and Ph.D in religious studies from Columbia University.
