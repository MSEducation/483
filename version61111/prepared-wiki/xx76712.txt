Operations are subsidized by the state of Vermont, and the train is popular among vacationers travelling to the ski resort area of Killington, Vermont. The Ethan Allen Express is named for the American Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen.

==History==

When Amtrak's Vermonter began operating in the central and eastern portions of Vermont with state funds in 1995, the western side of the state pushed for train service to Rutland as well. Federal funds were secured to rebuild the Clarendon and Pittsford Railroad to permit speeds up to [tpl]convert|59|mph|km/h[/tpl]. Service was initiated in December 1996. It was the first train on that route since 1953. Notably, the Rutland–Whitehall segment had not seen a passenger train since 1936.[tpl]cite news | title=Train Trip to Vermont Offers Some of the Fun | first=Barbara | last=Lloyd | publisher=New York Times | date=December 19, 1996 | accessdate=2010-08-14 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/19/sports/train-trip-to-vermont-offers-some-of-the-fun.html[/tpl]
Until May 2002, the train included a baggage car for skis and unboxed bicycles as well as checked baggage.FW: Erosion of Amtrak bike access Posted June 11, 2002
In October 2008, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) proposed eliminating the Ethan Allen Express and replacing it with a bus citing budgetary restrictions. The proposal was rejected by the appropriate legislative committee.Ethan Allen Safe . . . Until January Posted Thursday, 18 December 2008 VTrans again proposed ending service in January 2009.

On February 23, 2011, VTrans began an investigation into the Vermont Rail System's (VRS) handling of the Ethan Allen Express between Whitehall, New York and Rutland after Amtrak notified the state that track conditions meant the train was frequently delayed. Amtrak evaluated the line as the worst in the nation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110224/NEWS02/110223031/Amtrak-ranks-Vermont-last-as-worst-railroad | title=Amtrak ranks Vermont last as worst railroad | accessdate=February 25, 2011 | date=February 24, 2011 | publisher=Burlington Free Press | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wkd0adOe | archivedate=February 24, 2011[/tpl] During the summer of 2011, VRS conducted work to improve the track in question, planned to result in an eighteen-minute reduction in travel time by the end of the year, with additional work planned for the summer of 2012. The project was funded by both the railroad and the state of New York at a cost of $3.25 million, and involved rebuilding about [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] of track and eight grade crossings.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/passenger_rail/article/Vermont-Rail-System-posts-progress-on-trackwork-for-Amtraks-Ethan-Allen-service--27612 | title=Vermont Rail System posts progress on trackwork for Amtrak's Ethan Allen service | publisher=Progressive Railroading | date=August 12, 2011 | accessdate=August 13, 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60uP870rp | archivedate=August 13, 2011[/tpl]  By February 2012, the trackwork had resulted in a 15-minute southbound and 25-minute northbound reduction in travel time between Rutland and Whitehall, while the total time the Ethan Allen Express operated behind schedule fell to 135 minutes in December 2011, from 11,068 minutes a year earlier.[tpl]cite web|title=Vermont Rail System's bolstered track improves Amtrak transit times|url=http://www.progressiverailroading.com/short_lines_regionals/news/Vermont-Rail-Systems-bolstered-track-improves-Amtrak-transit-times--29853|publisher=Progressive Railroading|accessdate=9 February 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65JKINGRY|archivedate=8 February 2012|date=8 February 2012[/tpl]

===Proposed extension to Burlington===

Plans have existed to extend the Ethan Allen to Burlington from at least 2000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/80554/ | title=Critics question whether money for rail in western Vermont is being well spent | publisher=Vermont Public Radio | date=15 May 2008 | accessdate=7 September 2011[/tpl]  A $30 million earmark was obtained by Senator Jim Jeffords in 2005, partially to fund the work, of which $19 million remained by 2011, the remainder having been used for other projects such as a new spur for freight traffic.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110821/NEWS02/110820005/To-Rutland-by-train-68-miles-many-millions-dollars | title=To Rutland by train: 68 miles and many millions of dollars | publisher=Burlington Free Press | date=21 August 2011 | accessdate=7 September 2011[/tpl]
Advocates, led by Chambers of Commerce and the Vermont Rail Action Network renewed the push for an extension to Burlington.Rutland Herald: Chambers push for revitalized rail system March 26, 2009  Advocates believed that service to Burlington (an hour and 40 minutes north of Rutland and the state's largest city) would secure the long-term sustainability of the service by generating much more ridership than Rutland is capable of.Vermont Rail Action Network: Extending the Ethan Allen To Burington April 6, 2008
The Vermont Agency of Transportation applied for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds to rebuild the tracks to passenger standards (59 mph) which would enable the extension.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.timesargus.com/article/20091228/NEWS01/912280344 | publisher=Times-Argus | title=Rutland to Burlington state rail service tied to stimulus | date=December 28, 2009 | accessdate=2010-08-15 | first=Peter | last=Hirschfeld[/tpl]  While the initial application was not approved, the state subsequently entered a second US$70 million application for similar grants,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railvermont.org/news/93-ethan-allen-to-burlington/222-state-will-re-submit-application-to-rebuild-track-for-ethan-allen-to-burlington.html|title=State Will Re-Submit Application to Rebuild Track for Ethan Allen to Burlington|publisher=Vermont Rail Action Network|date=21 April 2010|accessdate=26 June 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and later a third, all of which were rejected.
In 2013, the extension received additional funding via a $9 million TIGER V (fifth round of Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grant.  The money will pay for the replacement of jointed rail with continuously welded rail.Tiger V grants awarded, NARP News, September 2013, National Association of Rail Passengers, p.3
