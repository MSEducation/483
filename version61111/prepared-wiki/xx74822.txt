Her first major photography project documented strippers at New England fairs and carnivals, which she worked on during summers while teaching in New York public schools. The project resulted in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum and a book, Carnival Strippers, which incorporated audio interviews with the subjects on a CD packaged with the book. In the late 1970s Meiselas also documented the insurrection in Nicaragua and human rights issues in Latin America. In 1981, she visited a village destroyed by the armed forces in El Salvador and took pictures of the El Mozote massacre, working with journalists Raymond Bonner and Alma Guillermoprieto. Her photographs of the Nicaraguan Revolution have been incorporated into local textbooks in Nicaragua. Her 1991 documentary "Pictures from a Revolution" depicts her return to sites she photographed and conversations with subjects of the photographs as they reflect on the images 10 years after the war.IMDB   In 2004, Meiselas returned to Nicaragua and installed 19 mural sized images of her photographs on the original locations where they were taken. The project was called "Reframing History."Reframing History web gallery
Meiselas has published several books of her own photographs and has edited and contributed to many others. She edited and contributed to El Salvador: The Work of Thirty Photographers(Writers & Readers, 1983). She edited Chile from Within (W.W. Norton, 1991). Beginning in 1992, she used MacArthur Foundation funding to curate a photographic history of Kurdistan, resulting in Kurdistan: In the Shadow of History (Random House, 1997; reprinted by the University of Chicago Press, 2008), as well as a website and an exhibition at the Menil Collection. Pandora's box is a monograph of her work on S&M in New York.

In 2007, Harper Magazine published an article titled, On the Rights of Molotov Man.http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/On-the-Rights-of-Molotov-Man.pdf This article is a collaboration between Susan Meiselas and Joy Garnett on the topic of the use of Meiselas's photo in Garnett's gallery showing.
In a 2008 interview with Phong Bui in The Brooklyn Rail, Meiselas says:  "I don’t want to relinquish the role and the necessity of witnessing and the photographic act as a response, a responsible response. But I also don’t want to assume in a kind of naïve way … that the act of the making of the image is enough. What’s enough? And what can we know in this process of making, publishing, reproducing, exposing, and recontextualizing work in book or exhibition form? … I can only hope that it registers a number of questions."[tpl]cite journal|last=Bui|first=Phong|title=In Conversation: Susan Meiselas with Phong Bui|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=November 2008|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2008/11/art/susan-meiselas-with-phong-bui[/tpl]
