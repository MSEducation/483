Llyn Mair (Welsh  for 'Mary's lake') is a [tpl]convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] artificial lake located at [tpl]gbmappingsmall|SH652412[/tpl] in North Wales.  It lies in the area of Tan-y-Bwlch, a little above Plas Tan-y-Bwlch, and is in the catchment area of the River Dwyryd. It was created by William Edward Oakeley (of Plas Tan-y-bwlch) as a 21st birthday present to his daughter Mair and as a water supply.[tpl]when|date=August 2010[/tpl] 
Nearby Plas Tan y Bwlch was believed to be the first house in North Wales to be lit by electricity from its own hydro-electric source, this during the 1890s. This was generated by a form of Pelton wheel, fed from Llyn Mair by means of a pipeline. The small power house was on the hillside immediately behind the house and is said to have operated until after the opening of Maentwrog public hydro-electric power station in 1928.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/a-sense-of-place/history-of-snowdonia/plas-tan-y-bwlch-history |title=Plas Tan y Bwlch History |publisher=Eryri-npa.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl]  In June 2013 a new hydro-scheme, costing Â£400,000, and similarly tapping the water from Llyn Mair, was opened. The water falls 60m to the turbine, and is expected to meet most of the Plas's electricity needs.Post Prynhawn, Radio Cymru, 13-6-2013
The lake is set alongside the B4410 road, a minor road linking the village of Rhyd. The position of the lake bordered with ancient oak woods and its tranquil appearance makes this a popular picnic site for visitors and it also provides a starting point for a number of local country walks. There is some limited parking available just off the road.
The narrow gauge Ffestiniog Railway runs through the woods above the lake and Tan-y-Bwlch railway station can be reached on foot from the lake.
The lake also has a notable echo because of the shape of the surrounding hills.
