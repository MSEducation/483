"Every Song is a Cry for Love" was the Irish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, which was written and sung by Brian Kennedy in English. He came 10th in the final, and his performance in the semi-final marked the 1000th Eurovision song of all time.[tpl]cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Kennedy (singer)|title=Hot off the press information|year=2006|url=http://www.briankennedy.co.uk/hotoffthepress.html|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] He wore a black suit and was backed by Calum MacColl on an acoustic guitar and singing and three specialist singers: Una Healy, Fran King and Paula Gilmer, who wore maroon dresses and black shirts and suits. The gentle ballad did not involve any dancing.[tpl]cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Kennedy (singer)|title=Every Song Is A Cry For Love|work=Eurovision Song Contest 2006|publisher=YouTube|date=2006-05-21|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-1AQkS5Nt4|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl]
Kennedy was selected to represent Ireland at the discretion of national broadcaster RTÉ who then allowed the general public to choose the song during an edition of The Late Late Show in February,[tpl]cite web|last=Rodrigues|first=André|title="Every song is a cry for love" for Ireland|publisher=ESCToday|date=2006-02-17|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/5615|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl] which involved Kennedy singing two other songs which were not submitted by himself. After Every Song Is A Cry For Love garnered 47% of the vote, it was selected. A fourth song had earlier been disqualified by RTÉ, whose panel of judges Brendan Graham, Paul Brady and Shay Healy had shortlisted for the final.[tpl]cite news|title=Brian Kennedy: He’ll be singing for both his redemption and Ireland’s|work=The Times|date=2005-11-20|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2091-1879939,00.html|accessdate=2006-08-29 | location=London[/tpl] It was marred by controversy, as his own song was included after the judging panel had called for additional songs, leading to claims that he had gained an unfair advantage.[tpl]cite news|title=Kennedy 'flattered' at Eurovision bid|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-02-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4727048.stm|accessdate=2006-08-29[/tpl]

It was performed eighth in the semi-final, following Belgium's Kate Ryan with "Je t'adore" and preceding Cyprus' Annette Artani with "Why Angels Cry", the 1000th Eurovision song ever according to the European Broadcasting Union, after Ireland was forced to qualify due to its failure to make the final the previous year, and came 9th with 79 points, thus becoming one of ten songs to qualify from the semi-final. BBC commentary during the semi-final set Kennedy's task up as "saving Ireland's Eurovision soul" (a reference to his country's dominant performance of the early 1990s before it fell away later that decade). Indeed, after Ireland was announced as a qualifier, television footage clearly showed Kennedy mouthing "thank God" in the green room backstage.
The song was performed 21st in the final, following Croatia's Severina with "Moja štikla" and preceding Sweden's Carola with "Invincible". At the close of voting, it had received 93 points, placing 10th in a field of 24, thus giving Ireland an automatic berth in the final at the next edition of the Contest.
The song was succeeded as Irish representative by Dervish with "They Can't Stop the Spring".
