==Development plans==

The Globus Alliance announced a release of Globus Toolkit version 5 (GT5) in late 2009.http://www.mail-archive.com/gt-user@lists.globus.org/msg01311.htmlhttp://www.globus.org/news.html#161 A major change will be abandoning GRAM4 (although continuing support at least through December, 2010) in favor of an enhanced GRAM2, called GRAM5, which will solve scalability issues and add features. The Reliable File Transfer (RFT) service will be replaced by a new Globus.org service. Globus.org is an online, hosted service (i.e., Software-as-a-Service) that provides higher-level, end-to-end Grid capabilities, initially concentrating on reliable, high-performance, fire-and-forget data transfer. To retain the Web-Service functionality without  technology and standards now considered obsolete, a new project called Globus Crux http://confluence.globus.org/display/whi/Crux+for+GT+Developers has been started, which expects to release an alpha version by the end of 2009. The monitoring and discovery tasks currently performed by MDS will be taken up by a new, Crux-based Integrated Information Services (IIS). No releases of the IIS are planned until sometime in 2010.
The release of GT 5.0.2 was announced on 19 July 2010. GT 5.0.3 is reported due for release in February 2011.
