The complex has incorporated many post-9/11 security measures into its design, such as large steel barriers that can be raised to prevent cars from entering the glass atrium. One difference between the CCC and conventional buildings is its ability to withstand structural damage. The structure has been designed to remain standing even after 2/3s of the exterior columns on the first six floors have experienced failure. This is possible because each tower contains more structural steel than both of the 52 story Bankers Hall towers combined, rendering the building virtually airplane-proof. The courtrooms feature bullet-proof judges' benches, jury boxes, and witness stands.
In April 2007, Telus was awarded the $16.3 million contract to provide the buildings with high-tech video recording, video conferencing, remote witness facilitation and remote management. The west block of the complex is scheduled to open in August 2007.
