The average residence time is six weeks, but there are many patients who have been patients for up to six months or longer, with very little progress made.  However a patients length of stay depends on their recovery rate and cooperation with treatment.
Longview is closely associated with the Colchester Mind Advocacy service, a service that helps stand up and protect the patient's view about his or her educational and emotional needs. More recently, it has become associated with the Patient Advice and Liaison Service, (PALS), which serve a similar purpose.

==Layout==

The Longview Psychiatric hospital is primarily an open unit, meaning patients can roam around freely throughout the facility, but while dealing with patients with more severe illnesses, such as severe psychosis or Schizophrenia they have been known to lock down and prevent patients from exploring the facility and grounds.
The unit has two residential wings; the south-eastern side being for the male patients, and the south-western side for the females. Each wing has a toilet, shower, and sink.  In between these two wings is a long wide hallway which leads towards the basic educational facilities, as well as the numerous counselling rooms. At the bottom of this hallway is the Nurse's office, which the staff write up their notes on their assigned patients, as well as relax during night shifts.  In each patient bedroom, there are windows which are locked so they cannot be opened far enough for one to fit through. 
Officially, Longview qualifies as a Special Needs education facility, as one of the focuses is of educating the patients with the required syllabuses while they are recovering from their mental health problems, this allows them to keep up with mainstream education, in a safer, more friendly environment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
