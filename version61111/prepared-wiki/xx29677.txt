[[Game classification]]

CATEGORIES: Game terminology

Game classification is the classification of games, forming a game taxonomy.  Many different methods of classifying games exist.

==Physical education==

There are four basic approaches to classifying the games used in physical education:[tpl]cite book|title=Developmental Physical Education for Today's Children|author=David P. Swain, David L. Gallahue, and Frances Cleland Donnelly|pages=571–573|year=2003|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0-7360-3388-2[/tpl]

==Video games==

There are several methods of classifying video games.
Solomon[tpl]cite book|title=Games Programming|author=Eric Solomon|pages=10–11|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-27110-X[/tpl] puts forward a "commonsense, but broad" classification of video games, into simulations (the game reflects reality), abstract games (the game itself is the focus of interest), and sports.  In addition to these he points out that games (in general, not just video games) fall into classes according to numbers of players.  Games with two players encompass board games such as chess.  Games with multiple players encompass card games such as poker, and marketed family games such as Monopoly and Scrabble.  Puzzles and Solitaire are one-player games.  He also includes zero-player games, such as Conway's Game of Life, although acknowledging that others argue that such games do not constitute a game, because they lack any element of competition.  He asserts that such zero-player games are nonetheless games because they are used recreationally.
Another method, developed by Wright, divides games into the following categories: educational or informative, sports, sensorimotor (e.g. action games, video games, fighting and shoot-em-up games, and driving and racing simulators), other vehicular simulators (not covered by driving and racing), strategy games (e.g. adventure games, war games, strategic simulations, role-playing games, and puzzles), and "other".[tpl]cite book|title=Children, Adolescents and the Media|author=Victor C. Strasburger and Barbara J. Wilson|pages=122–123|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-7619-2125-7[/tpl]
A third method, developed by Funk and Buchman, and refined by others, classifies electronic games into six categories: general entertainment (no fighting or destruction), educational (learning or problem solving), fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal), human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters), nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction), and sports violence (fighting or destruction involved).

==Classification by causes of uncertainty==

Games can be categorized by the source of uncertainty which confront the players:[ref]

Based on these three causes three classes of games arise:

==Game theory==

Game theory classifies games according to several criteria: whether a game is a symmetric game or an asymmetric one, what a game's "sum" is (zero-sum, constant sum, and so forth), whether a game is a sequential game or a simultaneous one, whether a game comprises perfect information or imperfect information, and whether a game is determinate.
