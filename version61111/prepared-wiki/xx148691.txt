===Sheffield United===

Born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, McAughtrie began his professional career as a trainee with Sheffield United, he joined the club on 1 August 1997, but failed to force his way into the first team.

McAughtrie was released Carlisle at the end of the 2001–02 season.

===Stafford Rangers===

In the summer of 2002, McAughtrie made a move to Stafford Rangers of the Southern Football League Premier Division. He made his debut on 17 August and during the season formed a great partnership at the heart of the Stafford defence with captain Wayne Daniel.
McAughtrie marked his 200th appearance for the club on 24 March 2007 with a goal against Grays Athletic in a 4–2 home win. Since the arrival of former Northampton Town defender Fred Murray on 28 August, McAughtrie found first team chances hard to come by.
