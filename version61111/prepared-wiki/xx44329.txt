</ref> The [[Parallax#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]] of the Sun was accurately measured during the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769,<ref>

The first person to estimate the mass of the Sun was Isaac Newton. In his work Principia, he estimated that the ratio of the mass of the Earth to the Sun was about 1/28,700. Later he determined that his value was based upon a faulty value for the solar parallax, which he had used to estimate the distance to the Sun (1 AU). He corrected his estimated ratio to 1/169,282 in the third edition of the Principia. The current value for the solar parallax is smaller still, yielding an estimated mass ratio of 1/332,946.[ref]

As a unit of measurement, the solar mass came into use before the AU and the gravitational constant were precisely measured. This is because the relative mass of another planet in the Solar System or the combined mass of two binary stars can be calculated in units of Solar mass directly from the orbital radius and orbital period of the planet or stars using Kepler's third law, provided that orbital radius is measured in astronomical units and orbital period is measured in years.
The mass of the Sun has decreased since the time it formed. This has occurred through two processes in nearly equal amounts. First, in the Sun's core hydrogen is converted into helium by nuclear fusion, in particular the pp chain, and this reaction converts some mass into energy in the form of gamma ray photons. Most of this energy eventually radiates away from the Sun. Second, high energy protons and electrons in the atmosphere of the Sun are ejected directly into outer space as a solar wind. 
The original mass of the Sun at the time it reached the main sequence remains uncertain. The early Sun had much higher mass loss rates than at present, so it may have lost anywhere from 1–7% of its natal mass over the course of its main sequence lifetime. The Sun gains a very small mass through the impact of asteroids and comets; however the Sun already holds 99.86% of the Solar System's total mass, so these impacts cannot offset the mass lost by radiation and ejection.
