Trefoil (from Latin [tpl]lang|la|trifolium[/tpl], "three-leaved plant", French [tpl]lang|fr|trèfle[/tpl], Italian [tpl]lang|it|trifoglio[/tpl], German [tpl]lang|de|Dreiblatt[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|de|Dreiblattbogen[/tpl]) is a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings used in architecture and Christian symbolism.  The term is also applied to other symbols of three-fold shape.

==Architecture==

===Ornamentation===

Trefoil is a term in Gothic architecture given to the ornamental foliation or cusping introduced in the heads of window-lights, tracery, panellings, etc., in which the center takes the form of a three-lobed leaf (formed from three partially overlapping circles).  One of the earliest examples is in the plate tracery at Winchester (1222–1235).  The fourfold version of an architectural trefoil is a quatrefoil.
A simple trefoil shape in itself can be symbolic of the Trinity,Our Christian Symbols by Friedrich Rest (ISBN 0-8298-0099-9), p. 17 while a trefoil combined with an equilateral triangle was also a moderately common symbol of the Christian Trinity during the late Middle Ages in some parts of Europe.  Two forms of this are shown below:

A dove, symbolic of the Holy Spirit, is sometimes depicted within the outlined form of the trefoil combined with a triangle.

===Architectural layout===

In architecture and archaeology, trefoil describes a layout or floorplan consisting of three apses in clover-leaf shape, as for example in the Megalithic temples of Malta.
Particularly in church architecture, such a layout may be called a "triconchos".

==Heraldry==

The heraldic trefoil is a stylized clover. It should not be confused with the figure named in French heraldry tiercefeuille, which is a stylized flower with three petals. It differs from the heraldic trefoil in being not slipped. It could be translated as threefoil.[ref]
. The French terms quartefeuille and quintefeuille are translated as quatrefoils and cinquefoils.[/ref]

==Symbols==

Symmetrical Trefoils are particularly popular as warning symbols. If a box containing hazardous material is moved around and shifted into different positions, it is still easy to recognize the symbol.http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm Easily stenciled symbols are also favored.

File:WikiProject Scouting trefoil fade.svg|One particular stylized form of the heraldic trefoil is used as the main element in the logo of most Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting organizations. For Girl Scouts, the three trefoil leaves represent the three-fold promise:  "To serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout law."

While the green trefoil is considered by many to be the symbol of Ireland, the harp has much greater officially recognized status.  Therefore shamrocks generally do not appear on Irish coins or postage stamps.
A trefoil is also part of the logo for Adidas Originals, which also includes the iconic three stripes.
