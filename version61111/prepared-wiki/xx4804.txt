[[Ideogram]]

CATEGORIES: Communication design, Graphic design, Pictograms, Writing systems

An ideogram or ideograph (from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|·º∞Œ¥Œ≠Œ±[/tpl] id√©a "idea" + [tpl]lang|grc|Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜœâ[/tpl] gr√°ph≈ç "to write") is a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept.  Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as pictograms.

==Terminology==

The term "ideogram" is commonly used to describe logograms in writing systems such as Egyptian hieroglyphs, Sumerian cuneiform and Chinese characters. Dongba script used without Geba decorating is an example of a real ideogram (it is also a pictogram).
In the history of writing, symbols proceeded from ideographic (such as an icon of a bull's head in a list inventory, denoting that the following numeral refers to head of cattle) to logographic (an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word  æƒÅlep "ox"),  to phonetic (the bull's head used as a symbol in rebus writing, indicating the glottal stop at the beginning of the word for "ox", namely, the letter aleph).
Bronze Age writing systems used a combination of these applications, and many signs in hieroglyphic as well as in cuneiform writing could be used either logographically or phonetically.
For example, the Akkadian sign AN ([tpl]script|Xsux|íÄ≠[/tpl]) could be an ideograph for "deity", an ideogram for the god Anum in particular, a logograph for the  Akkadian stem il- "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word  ≈°amu "sky", or a syllabogram for either the syllable an or il.
Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the traditional classification are ideographic in origin:
