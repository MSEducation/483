The Norwood culture was a subculture or subperiod[tpl]cite thesis|type=M.A.|last=Kratt|first=Henry J., Jr.|title=The Lewis Camp Mound (8Je182), Jefferson County, Florida|year=2005|publisher=Florida State University|location=Tallahassee, Florida|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11102005-105611/unrestricted/Kratt_Thesis.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] of the late Archaic culture. 
The Norwood culture was located in the Apalachee region, a forested and hilly part of what is now north Florida and was typical of other Archaic cultures using triangular-shaped projectile point knives which showed notches for attaching stone implements to shafts. It is widely accepted that Archaic cultures began using hand held spears to atlatls to more effectively bring down animals for clothing and consumption. 
The specific difference between the Norwood and other Archaic cultures was that they were the first people to create and use fiber-tempered pottery of Spanish moss or strands of fiber from the palmetto and decorated by making stick impressions on its outer surface prior to firing. Much of the Gulf coastal shell middens date to this Archaic period however some sites have been covered by rising sea level. Other sites have been destroyed by modern borrowing activities and development.[tpl]cite web|last=Wisenbacker|first=Michael|title=Aboriginal Settlement in the Apalachee Region of Florida|url=http://www.globalunderwaterexplorers.org/content/aboriginal-settlement|work=Florida Geological Survey Special Publication No. 46|publisher=Global Underwater Explorers|accessdate=6 May 2012|year=1998[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Carbone|first=Victor A.|title=Late Quaternary Environments in Florida and the Southeast|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=March–June 1983|volume=36|issue=1-2|pages=3–18|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00011/6j|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl]
