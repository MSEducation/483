McCashin's Brewery is a microbrewery based in Nelson, New Zealand. It was founded in 1981 by former All Black and farmer Terry McCashin.  Terry has been credited with starting the micro-brewery renaissance in New Zealand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]   Prior to opening McCashin's Brewery in 1981 there were only two breweries in New Zealand: New Zealand Breweries and Dominion Breweries.  Today, Nelson alone has 11 breweries.
McCashin's Brewery is housed in the Rochdale Cider factory.  Rochdale Cider was started in the late 1930s, but the current building was built in the 1950s.  Rochdale Cider is still being made there today.
In 1999 Lion Breweries, part of the Lion Nathan group, bought the Mac's brand. The brewery itself is still owned by Terry McCashin but in August 2000 Lion leased it. In 2005 Lion Nathan moved half of the production of Mac's best-selling beer, Mac's Gold, from Nelson to Auckland.
In March, 2005, Wellington's Shed 22 Brewing Company came under the Mac's brand. Shed 22's brewpub, The Brewery Bar and Restaurant, was refurbished and became the first Mac's Brewbar, on October 3, 2006
In November 2006 Mac's underwent a re-branding exercise and released a new line of six core  beers, which are all lagers of different colours, from Great White wheat beer through to Black Mac.[ref]

In April 2009, the family who set up Mac's Brewery moved back in. Dean McCashin, the son of Mac's founders Terry and Bev McCashin, said the family hoped to restore the neglected building and plant.  "We want to take it back to its former glory and employ as many people as we did once. We don't want to repeat the cycle of a corporation coming in and thinning it out."
McCashin's Brewery currently produces Rochdale Cider, Frute, 26000 Vodka and Stoke beer.
