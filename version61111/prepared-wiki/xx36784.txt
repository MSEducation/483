DTV Services' delivery of standard-definition television and radio is labelled Freeview, while its delivery of HDTV is called Freeview HD. Reception of Freeview requires a Freeview tuner, either in a separate set-top box or built into the TV set. Since 2008 all new TV sets sold in the United Kingdom must have a built-in Freeview tuner. Freeview HD requires a special tuner, capable of handling HDTV signals. Digital video recorders (DVRs) with a built-in Freeview tuner are labelled Freeview+, in line with the British tradition of calling TV service dependent DVRs the service name plus a "+", established in 2002 by BSkyBs Sky+ DVRs. Depending on model, DVRs and HDTV sets with a Freeview tuner may offer regular Freeview or Freeview HD.
The technical specification for Freeview is published and maintained by the Digital TV Group, the industry association for digital TV in the UK who also provide the test and conformance regime for Freeview, Freeview + and Freeview HD products. DMOL (DTT Multiplex Operators Ltd.), a company owned by the operators of the six DTT multiplexes (BBC, ITV, C4, and Arqiva) is responsible for technical platform management and policy, including the electronic programme guide and channel numbering.http://www.dmol.co.uk
Since the completion of the digital switchover on 24 October 2012, there is no terrestrial analogue television being broadcast in the United Kingdom, and all terrestrial TV is delivered through Freeview.

==History==

Freeview officially launched on 30 October 2002 at 5 am when the BBC and Crown Castle (now Arqiva) officially took over the digital terrestrial television (DTT) licences to broadcast on the three multiplexes from the defunct ITV Digital (originally called ONdigital). The founding members of DTV Services, who trade as Freeview, were the BBC, Crown Castle UK (now part of Arqiva) and British Sky Broadcasting. On 11 October 2006, ITV plc and Channel 4 became equal shareholders. Since then, the Freeview model has been copied in Australia and New Zealand.
Although all pay channels had been closed down on ITV Digital, many free-to-air channels continued broadcasting, including the five analogue channels and digital channels such as ITV2, ITN News Channel, S4C2, TV Travel Shop and QVC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&hist=ftv |title=UK DTT Channel List (free-to-view including yr2002 dtt trials) |publisher=Unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2009[/tpl] With the launch of Freeview other channels were broadcast free-to-air, such as: Sky Travel, UK History, Sky News, Sky Sports News, The Hits (now 4Music) and TMF (now Viva) were available from the start. BBC Four and the interactive BBC streams were moved to multiplex B.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk/dtt/dtt.cgi?reg=UK&by=mux&type=VRDIPTSAG&mux=12ABCD&hist=freeview&data=&col=LoNMTC&disp=1&grp=&oair= |title=UK DTT Channel List (Freeview) |publisher=Unsatisfactorysoftware.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2009[/tpl] Under the initial plans, the two multiplexes operated by Crown Castle would carry eight channels altogether. The seventh stream became shared by UK Bright Ideas and Ftn  which launched in February 2003. The eighth stream was left unused until April 2004 when the shopping channel Ideal World launched on Freeview. There are now 14 streams carried by the two multiplexes, with Multiplex C carrying 6 streams, and Multiplex D carrying 8. It has recently[tpl]when|date=January 2014[/tpl] been announced that more streams are now available on the multiplexes, and that bidding is under way.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

===2009 retune===

The Freeview service underwent a major upgrade on 30 September 2009 which required 18 million households to retune their Freeview receiving equipment.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8280067.stm|title= 18m Freeview homes in TV retune|publisher= BBC News|date= 30 September 2009|accessdate= 30 September 2009[/tpl] The changes, meant to ensure proper reception of Channel 5, led to several thousand complaints from people who lost channels (notably ITV3 and ITV4) as a result of retuning their equipment. The Freeview website crashed and the call centre was inundated as a result of the problems. The change involved an update to the NIT (Network Information Table), which some receivers could not accommodate. Many thousands of people could not receive some channels. This included 460,000 fed from relay stations who lost access to ITV3 and ITV4. Updates were broadcast to enable firmware changes, but in some cases the receiver must be left on and receiving broadcasts to accept the updates; not everyone was aware of this.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8283452.stm|title= Complaints over Freeview retune|publisher= BBC News|date= 30 September 2009|accessdate= 30 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= http://absolutegadget.com/200910012671/news/television/viewers-enraged-over-freeview-retune-debacle.html|title= Viewers enraged over Freeview retune debacle|publisher= Absolute Gadget|date= 1 October 2009|accessdate= 1 October 2009[/tpl]
On 23 August 2010, Sky Sports News was removed from Freeview and replaced with Sky3 +1.

==Channels==

The Freeview service broadcasts free-to-air television channels, radio stations and interactive services from the existing public service broadcasters. Channels on the service include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 terrestrial channels, as well as their digital services. In addition, channels from other commercial operators, such as Sky and UKTV, are available, as well as radio services from a number of broadcasters.
The full range of channels broadcast via digital terrestrial television includes pay television services from operators such as VuTV and BT Sport. These channels, although available only to subscribers with appropriate equipment, are listed in the on-screen electronic programme guides displayed by many Freeview receivers but may not be viewed.

==Reception equipment==

===Receivers===

To receive Freeview, either a television with an integrated digital tuner, or an existing standard analogue TV plus a digital set-top box is required.

===Aerial===

An aerial is required for viewing any broadcast television transmissions. For all transmissions indoor, loft-mounted, and external aerials are available. In regions of strong signal an indoor aerial may be adequate; in marginal areas a high-gain external aerial mounted high above the ground with an electronic amplifier at its top may be needed.
Aerial requirements for analogue (the old standard) and digital reception in the UK are identical; there is no such thing as a special "digital aerial", although installers and suppliers often falsely say one is necessary.BBC: Digital switch advice 'shocking'  9 of 14 installers gave bad or misleading advice, suggesting that people are likely to need a new aerial for digital switchover ... 5 told the mystery shopper they would need a "digital aerial", when in fact there is no such thing. As the signal degrades, the analogue picture degrades gradually, but the digital picture holds up well then suddenly becomes unwatchable; an aerial which gave poor analogue viewing may give unwatchable, rather than poor, digital viewing, and need replacing, at a cost of typically £80 to £180, most of which is fitting cost.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cai.org.uk/asp/faq.asp | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Confederation of Aerial Industries Ltd | accessdate=22 June 2006[/tpl]

==Service costs==

Freeview channels can be received at no charge (other than the annual television licence required for television reception required for all viewers of broadcast television in the UK which must be purchased by anyone who has and uses the appropriate equipment to receive television signals[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/information/index.jsp#link1|title=TV Licensing - TV Licence Information|accessdate=4 May 2007[/tpl]).
A subscription-based DTT service, Top Up TV, launched in March 2004 using unused channel space on multiplexes that were owned by parties who, at the time, were not members of the Freeview consortium. The Top Up TV service is not connected with the Freeview service; it simply runs alongside it on the DTT platform. It was possible to receive Top Up TV on selected Freeview set-top boxes or televisions equipped with a card slot or CI slot, however, this was replaced in 2006 by "Top Up TV Anytime", a service which requires a proprietary set top box. ESPN can be received with televisions equipped with a card slot.
The Digital TV Group the industry association for digital television in the UK, is responsible for co-ordination between Freeview, Top Up TV, and other digital services.[tpl]cite web|title=DTG Objectives|url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/dtg/objectives.html|publisher=DTG|accessdate=11 July 2013[/tpl]

===Technical===

The Digital TV Group publishes and maintains the UK technical specification for high-definition services on digital terrestrial television (Freeview) based on the new DVB-T2 standard. The specification is known as the D-book. Freeview HD is the first operational TV service in the world using the DVB-T2 standard. This standard is incompatible with DVB-T, and can only be received using compatible reception equipment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2008/04/nr_20080403b|title=More choice and new services on digital terrestrial TV|publisher=Ofcom|date=3 April 2008[/tpl] Some television receivers sold before the HD launch claimed to be "HD-ready", but this usually implies that the screen can display HD, rather than that DVB-T2 signals can be received—a suitable tuner (typically built into a STB or PVR) is additionally required. Freeview HD set-top boxes and televisions are available. In order to qualify for the Freeview HD logo, receivers will need to be IPTV-capable and display Freeview branding, including the logo, on the electronic programme guide screen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/12/03/freeview_hd_launch_report/|title=Freeview HD goes live|publisher=Register Hardware|date=3 December 2009[/tpl] The Freeview HD trademark requirements state that any manufacturer applying for the Freeview HD logo should submit their product to the Digital TV Group's test centre (DTG Testing) for conformance testing.
On 2 February 2010, Vestel became the first manufacturer to gain Freeview HD certification, for the Vestel T8300 set top box.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/vestel-receives-first-freeview-hd-certification|title=Vestel Receives First Freeview HD Certification|publisher=PressReleasePoint|date=2 February 2010[/tpl] Humax released the first Freeview HD reception equipment, the Humax HD-FOX T2, on 13 February 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/02/15/first-dvb-t2-receiver-in-uk-stores/|title=First DVB-T2 receiver in UK stores|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=15 February 2010[/tpl]
It was announced on 10 February 2009 that the signal would be encoded with MPEG-4 AVC High Profile Level 4, which supports up to 1080i30/1080p30, so 1080p50 cannot be used.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.dtg.org.uk/news/news.php?id=3270|title=Ofcom opts for AVC 4.0 for UK HD DTT|publisher=The Digital TV Group|date=10 February 2009[/tpl] The system has been designed from the start to allow regional variations in the broadcast schedule. Services are statistically multiplexed – bandwidth is dynamically allocated between channels, depending on the complexity of the images – with the aim of maintaining a consistent quality, rather than a specific bit rate. Video for each channel can range between 3 Mbit/s and 17 Mbit/s. AAC or Dolby Digital Plus audio is transmitted at 320 kb/s for 5.1 surround sound, with stereo audio at 128 kbit/s; audio description takes up 64 kbit/s, subtitles 200 kbit/s and the data stream, for interactive applications, just 50 kbit/s. Recording sizes for Freeview HD television transmissions average around 3 GB per hour.[tpl]cite web | url = http://gonedigital.net/2010/08/12/freeviewhd-bit-rates-and-file-sizes-revisited/ | title = FreeviewHD bit-rates and file sizes revisited | work = Gone Digital | date=12 August 2010 | accessdate = 10 May 2011 | first=Nigel | last = Whitfield [/tpl] Between 22 and 23 March 2011, an encoder software change allowed the Freeview version of BBC HD to automatically detect progressive material and change encoding mode appropriately, meaning the channel can switch to 1080p25.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2011/04/software-upgrade-for-bbc-hd-on.shtml|title=Software Upgrade for BBC HD on Freeview HD|work=BBC|date=5 April 2011[/tpl] This was extended to all of the other Freeview HD channels in October 2011.
To ensure provision of audio description, broadcasters typically use the AAC codec.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/02/freeview_hd_surround_sound/|title=Freeview HD sacrifices surround sound for World Cup scramble|publisher=Register Hardware|date=2 June 2010[/tpl] Hardware restrictions allow only a single type of audio decoder to operate at any one time, so the main audio and the audio description must use the same encoding family for them to be successfully combined at the receiver. In the case of BBC HD, the main audio is coded as AAC-LC and only the audio description is encoded as HE-AAC.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/06/questions_around_surround_soun.html|title=Questions around surround sound on Freeview HD|publisher=BBC|date=4 June 2010[/tpl] Neither AAC nor Dolby Digital Plus codecs are supported by most home AV equipment, which typically accept Dolby Digital or DTS, leaving owners with stereo, rather than surround sound, output. Transcoding from AAC to Dolby Digital or DTS and multi-channel output via HDMI was not originally necessary for Freeview HD certification. As of June 2010 the DTG D-Book includes the requirement for mandatory transcoding when sending audio via S/PDIF, and for either transcoding or multi-channel PCM audio when sending it via HDMI in order for manufacturers to gain Freeview HD certification from April 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gonedigital.net/2010/06/02/surrounded-by-questions-freeviewhd/|title=Surrounded by questions|publisher=Gone Digital|date=2 June 2010[/tpl] Thus equipment sold as Freeview HD before April 2011 may not deliver surround sound to audio equipment (some equipment may, but this is not mandatory); later equipment must be capable of surround sound compatible with most suitable audio equipment.
In early February 2011 it was announced that 1,000,000 Freeview HD set-top boxes had been sold.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cable.co.uk/news/digital-tv-service-freeview-hd-passes-1m-sales-800381182/|title=Digital TV service Freeview HD passes 1m sales|publisher=Cable UK|date=2 February 2011[/tpl]

====Copy protection====

In August 2009 the BBC wrote to Ofcom after third-party content owners asked the BBC to undertake measures to ensure that all Freeview HD boxes would include copy protection systems as required by the Digital TV Group's D-Book, which sets technical standards for digital terrestrial television in the UK.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a175535/bbc-wants-freeview-hd-copy-protection.html|title=BBC wants Freeview HD copy protection|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2 September 2009[/tpl] The BBC proposed to ensure compliance with copy-protection standards on the upgraded Freeview HD multiplex by compressing the service information (SI) data, which receivers need to understand the TV services in the data stream. To encourage boxes to adopt copy protection, the BBC made its own look-up tables and decompression algorithm, necessary for decoding the EPG data on high-definition channels, available without charge only to manufacturers who implement the copy-protection technology. This technology would control the way HD films and TV shows are copied onto, for example Blu-ray discs, and shared with others over the internet. No restrictions will be placed on standard-definition services. In a formal written response, Ofcom principal advisor Greg Bensberg said that wording of the licence would probably need to be changed to reflect the fact that this new arrangement is permitted. The BBC had suggested that as an alternative to the SI compression scheme, the Freeview HD multiplex may have to adopt encryption. Bensberg said that it would appear "inappropriate to encrypt public service broadcast content on DTT".
On 14 June 2010 Ofcom agreed to allow the BBC to limit the full availability of its own and other broadcasters' high definition (HD) Freeview services to receivers that control how HD content can be used.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consumer/2010/06/hd-on-freeview-5/|title=HD on Freeview|publisher=Ofcom|date=14 June 2010[/tpl] Ofcom concluded that the decision to accept the BBC’s request will deliver net benefits to licence-holders by ensuring they have access to the widest possible range of HD television content on DTT.
