The Garden of the Gods (American title: Fauna and Family) is the third book in the autobiographical Corfu trilogy by naturalist and author, Gerald Durrell (1925-1995), following My Family and Other Animals and Birds, Beasts, and Relatives.

==Summary==

This book is a humorous description of events that took place on the Greek island of Corfu between the years 1935 and 1939. The author was just ten years of age when he moved to Corfu with his family: his mother, Louisa Florence Durrell, his brothers Lawrence Durrell and Leslie Durrell, and his sister, Margaret Durrell (referred-to in the book as Margo). As in the first two volumes of the Corfu trilogy, the book is filled with amusing and atmospheric descriptions of the author's exploits catching, and making pets of, many of the local fauna, and the subsequent effects on his family who again feature as major characters. Other characters from the prequels also reappear here, such as Spiro (their Greek friend and chauffeur), Theodore Stephanides (family friend, doctor, poet and naturalist) and Mr Kralefsky (Gerald's one-time tutor in Corfu). Humour is also brought in the form of several new and colourful characters, including Lumis Bean, Harry Bunny, Prince Jeejeebuoy, and Count Rossignol.
The Garden of the Gods was first published in 1978 by William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd, and simultaneously in America by Simon and Schuster (ISBN 0-671-24729-8).
