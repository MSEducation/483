==History==

The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. First Russian settlements on the Mezen River were mentioned in the 16th century: Yuroma (1513) and Koynas (1554). The middle course of the Mezen, the current area of the district, was where Russian and Komi cultures mixed the most.[tpl]cite book|last=Иванова|first=Т. Г.|title=К истории региона.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. In 1796, the area was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. The current territory of the district was included into Mezensky Uyezd. On December 28, 1917, a new Ust-Vashsky Uyezd with the administrative center in Ust-Vashka (currently Leshukonskoye) was established; however, in 1925 it was merged back into Mezensky Uyezd.
In 1929, several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, and Leshukonsky District was established. It became a part of Arkhangelsk Okrug of Northern Krai. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Leshukonsky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guides.rusarchives.ru/browse/guidebook.html?bid=79&sid=185080|title=Административно-территориальное деление Архангельской губернии в XVIII-XX вв.

==Geography==

The district lies almost entirely in the basin of the Mezen River, which crosses the district from southeast to northwest, and of its major tributaries, the Mezenskaya Pizhma, the Sula, the Kyma, the Vashka, the Kimzha, and, in the northern part, the Pyoza. Minor areas in the west of the district lie in the basin of the Yezhuga River, a tributary of the Pinega, and into the Nemnyuga River, a tributary of the Kuloy. Some areas in the east of the district are in the basin of the major tributaries of the Pechora, the Tsilma, and the Pizhma. In particular, the source of the Tsilma River is located in the district. The divide between the White Sea (the Mezen) and the Barents Sea (the Pechora) runs thus through the eastern part of the district.
The northern part of the Timan Ridge lies in the district, creating the hilly landscape. Almost the whole of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). There are many glacial lakes across the district.

The backbone of the district's economy is the timber industry. However, although the district has the best timber resources in the area, poor infrastructure impedes the expansion of this industry.

===Agriculture===

The special breed of horses, Mezen horse, was bred in the Mezen River valley. The Mezen horses are rather small but suitable for difficult work and easily survive cold winters.[tpl]cite book|title=Мезенская лошадь|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article075114.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia[/tpl]

===Transportation===

The Mezen and the Vashka Rivers are both navigable within the district limits; however, there is no passenger navigation in Leshukonsky District except for the ferry crossing between Leshukonskoye and the village of Smolenets. The ferry connects to the all-seasonal road to Arkhangelsk. Until 2008, there were no all-seasonal roads in the district. During winter, temporary roads (zimniks) are built in snow; in summer, the air transport is the only means for passenger connections to Arkhangelsk and the rest of the world.
There is an airport in Leshukonskoye, with several weekly flights to Arkhangelsk. There are also three minor airports in Koynas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://myarkhangelsk.ru/adresa/8/414/|title=Аэропорт Койнас|publisher=МойАрхангельск.Ру|language=Russian|accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl] Olema,[tpl]cite web|url=http://myarkhangelsk.ru/adresa/8/418/|title=Аэропорт Олема|publisher=МойАрхангельск.Ру|language=Russian|accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl] and Vozhgora.[tpl]cite web|url=http://myarkhangelsk.ru/adresa/8/413/|title=Аэропорт Вожгора|publisher=МойАрхангельск.Ру|language=Russian|accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl]
