==Education==

Literacy rates (percentage of people over 15 who can read and write) are high in Malaysia, with an overall Literacy rate of 88.7%.[ref]
</ref> Literacy rates are higher among males (92%) than females (85.4%)
Education in Malaysia is monitored by the federal government Ministry of Education.[tpl]Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=Ninth Schedule|verse=|range= [/tpl] The education system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Most Malaysian children start schooling between the ages of three to six, in kindergarten.

===Primary education===

Children begin primary schooling at the age of seven for a period of six years. Primary schools are divided into two categories, national primary schools and vernacular school.[tpl]cite web|last=Mustafa |first=Shazwan |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malay-groups-want-vernacular-schools-abolished/ |title=Malay groups want vernacular schools abolished |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date=22 August 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl] Vernacular schools (Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan) use either Chinese or Tamil as the medium of instruction, whereas national primary schools (Sekolah Kebangsaan) uses Bahasa Malaysia as the medium of instruction for subjects except English, Science and Mathematics.
Before progressing to the secondary level of education, pupils in Year 6 are required to sit the Primary School Achievement Test (Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah, UPSR).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malaysia.gov.my/EN/Relevant%20Topics/Education%20and%20Learning/Non%20Citizen/nTheNationalEducationSystem/nPrimaryEducation/Pages/PrimarySchoolEducation.aspx |title=Primary School Education |publisher=Malaysia.gov.my |accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl] A programme called First Level Assessment (Penilaian Tahap Satu, PTS) taken during Primary Year 3 was abolished in 2001.

===Secondary education===

Secondary education in Malaysia is conducted in secondary schools (Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan) for five years. National secondary schools use Malay as the main language of instruction. The only exceptions are Mathematics and Science and languages other than Malay, however this was only implemented in 2003, prior to which all non-language subjects were taught in Malay. At the end of Form Three, which is the third year, students are evaluated in the Lower Secondary Assessment (Penilaian Menengah Rendah, PMR). However, PMR is to be abolished by 2016. Secondary students no longer sit for PMR in Form Three but to directly sit for SPM in Form Five. In the final year of secondary education (Form Five), students sit the Malaysian Certificate of Education (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, SPM) examination, which is equivalent to the former British Ordinary or 'O' Levels. The government has decided to abandon the use of English in teaching maths and science and revert to Bahasa Malaysia, starting in 2012.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/world/asia/10iht-malay.html?ref=world |title=In Malaysia, English Ban Raises Fears for Future |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=9 July 2009 |last=Gooch |first=Liz |date=10 July 2009[/tpl] 
Malaysian national secondary schools are sub-divided into several types: National Secondary School (Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan), Religious Secondary School (Sekolah Menengah Agama), National-Type Secondary School (Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan) (also referred to as Mission Schools), Technical Schools (Sekolah Menengah Teknik), Residential Schools and MARA Junior Science College (Maktab Rendah Sains MARA).
There are also 60 Chinese Independent High Schools in Malaysia, where most subjects are taught in Chinese. Chinese Independent High Schools are monitored and standardised by the United Chinese School Committees' Association of Malaysia (UCSCAM). However, unlike government schools, independent schools are autonomous. It takes six years to complete secondary education in Chinese independent schools. Students will sit a standardised test conducted by UCSCAM, which is known as the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) in Junior Middle 3 (equivalent to PMR) and Senior Middle 3 (equivalent to A level). A number of independent schools conduct classes in Malay and English in addition to Chinese, enabling the students to sit the PMR and SPM additionally.

===Tertiary education===

Before the introduction of the matriculation system, students aiming to enter public universities had to complete an additional 18 months of secondary schooling in Form Six and sit the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia, STPM); equivalent to the British Advanced or 'A' levels.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.studymalaysia.com/education/art_education.php?id=smhappendixC|title=Academic Qualification Equivalence|work=StudyMalaysia.com|accessdate=15 September 2010[/tpl] Since the introduction of the matriculation programme as an alternative to STPM in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges (kolej matrikulasi in Malay) can enrol in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of the places are open to non-Bumiputra students.[ref]

There are a number of public universities established in Malaysia. Private universities are also gaining a reputation for international quality education and students from all over the world attend these universities. In addition, four reputable international universities have set up their branch campuses in Malaysia since 1998. A branch campus can be seen as an ‘offshore campus’ of the foreign university, which offers the same courses and awards as the main campus. Both local and international students can acquire these identical foreign qualifications in Malaysia at a lower fee. The foreign university branch campuses in Malaysia are: Monash University Malaysia Campus, Curtin University of Technology Sarawak Campus, Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus and University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus.
Students also have the option of enrolling in private tertiary institutions after secondary studies. Most institutions have educational links with overseas universities especially in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, allowing students to spend a portion of their course duration abroad as well as getting overseas qualifications. One such example is SEGi University which partnered with University of Abertay Dundee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.segi.edu.my/partners/p_uad.htm|title=University Partners: University of Abertay Dundee, UK|publisher=SEGi University|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl]

===International schools===

In addition to the Malaysian National Curriculum, Malaysia has many international schools such as Nobel International School, the International School Kuala Lumpur, the Alice Smith School, Gardens International School, Cempaka Schools Malaysia and The International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM). These schools amongst others mainly cater to the growing expatriate population in the country.

==Health==

The Malaysian government places importance on the expansion and development of health care, putting 5% of the government social sector development budget into public health care[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myhealthcare.gov.my/en/index.asp?page=MHTC&subpage=MHTC_mission |title=The Official Site of Malaysia Healthcare Travel & Medical Tourism |publisher=Myhealthcare.gov.my |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]—an increase of more than 47% over the previous figure. This has meant an overall increase of more than RM 2 billion. With a rising and aging population, the Government wishes to improve in many areas including the refurbishment of existing hospitals, building and equipping new hospitals, expansion of the number of polyclinics, and improvements in training and expansion of telehealth. A major problem with the health care sector is the lack of medical centres for rural areas, which the government is trying to counter through the development of and expansion of a system called "tele-primary care".[tpl]cite web|author=moveforward |url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-malaysia.html |title=Health Care in Malaysia |publisher=Expatforum.com |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] Another issue is the overperscription of drugs, though this has decreased in recent years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allianzworldwidecare.com/healthcare-in-malaysia |title=Healthcare in Malaysia |publisher=Allianzworldwidecare.com |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] Since 2009 the Malaysian Health Ministry has increased its efforts to overhaul the system and attract more foreign investment.
The country generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a universal healthcare system, which co-exists with the private healthcare system. Infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6 deaths per 1000 births, and life expectancy at birth in 2009 was 75 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/malaysia_statistics.html |title=Malaysia – Statistics |publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=22 May 2011[/tpl] Malaysia has the highest levels of obesity among ASEAN countries.
The Malaysian health care system requires doctors to perform a compulsory three years service with public hospitals to ensure that the manpower in these hospitals is maintained. Recently foreign doctors have also been encouraged to take up employment in Malaysia. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment.
The majority of private hospitals are in urban areas and, unlike many of the public hospitals, are equipped with the latest diagnostic and imaging facilities. Private hospitals have not generally been seen as an ideal investment—it has often taken up to ten years before companies have seen any profits. However, the situation has now changed and companies are now exploring this area again, corresponding with the increased number of foreigners entering Malaysia for medical care and the recent government focus on developing the health tourism industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/corporate/mediacentre.asp?page=news_desk&subpage=archive&news_id=127|title=Media Release:Health Tourism in Malaysia|first=Ministry of Tourism|publisher=Tourism Malaysia|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] The Government has also been trying to promote Malaysia as a health care destination, regionally and internationally.

==Major cities==

Kuala Lumpur is the capital and largest city of Malaysia. Although many executive and judicial branches of the federal government have moved to Putrajaya, Kuala Lumpur is the seat of the Parliament of Malaysia, making it the country's legislative capital. It is also the economic and business centre of the country, and is a primate city. Kuala Lumpur is also rated as a global city, and is the only global city in Malaysia. Along with Subang Jaya, Klang, Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Kajang-Sungai Chua, Ampang Jaya and Selayang it forms the country's largest and most important urban area, the Klang Valley.
Penang is the second largest city and second largest urban area in Malaysia. It used to be Malaysia's largest city until the 1970s when Kuala Lumpur became the capital. Today, the city remains a major hub in Malaysia, serving the northern region.
Johor Bahru is the third largest urban area in the country. It is close to Singapore, and receives more than 60% of the country's annual 16 million foreign tourists. The city is also an important industrial, tourism and commercial hub for southern Malaysia.
Other major cities in Malaysia include Ipoh, Kota Kinabalu and  Kuching.
