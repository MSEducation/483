[[High pressure receptor zones]]

CATEGORIES: Sensory receptors

In physiology high pressure receptor zones are the places you find baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus. They are only sensitive above 60mmHg blood pressure. 
When these receptors are active they elicit a depressor response; which decreases the heart rate and gives a general vasodilation. An increase in arterial blood pressure reflexly elicits an increase in vagal neuronal activity to the heart (i.e. the resulting decreased heart rate). 
The afferent nerves from the baroreceptors are called buffer nerves.
