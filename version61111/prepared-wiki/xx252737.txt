Amelia Griffiths (1768–1858), often referred to in contemporary works as Mrs Griffiths of Torquay, was a beachcomber and amateur phycologist who made many important collections of algae specimens. She corresponded with William Henry Harvey for many years, becoming a close friend. Harvey dedicated his 1849 Manual of British Algae to her, and once wrote [tpl]quote|"If I lean to glorify any one, it is Mrs Griffiths, to whom I owe much of the little acquaintance I have with the variations to which these plants are subject, and who is always ready to supply me with fruits of plants which every one else finds barren. She is worth ten thousand other collectors."[tpl]cite book | author = Praeger, Robert Lloyd | year = 1913 | chapter = William Henry Harvey 1811—1866 | pages = 204–224 | editor = Oliver, Francis Wall | title = Makers of British botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press[/tpl][/tpl]
