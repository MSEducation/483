==Reception==

Music critic Jeff Burger praised the release in his Allmusic review, writing Brown "remains a national treasure, and so does his songwriting, which has gone from great to better over the years. Wisely keeping the production simple and his voice upfront on this release, he unveils some of his best songs about love, life, friendship, dreams, and the American scene." Jim Musser of No Depression wrote "Greg Brown has the rare gift of creating songs that unwind with the roundabout informality of a thoughtful yet unstructured conversation. Regardless of how much work may or may not have gone into a particular tuneâ€™s genesis, the resulting piece feels of-the-moment, complete with interjections and sparky, synaptic sidebars."
