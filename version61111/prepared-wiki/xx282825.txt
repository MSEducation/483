[[Shale gas in the United Kingdom]]

CATEGORIES: Energy in the United Kingdom, Natural gas industry of the United Kingdom

Shale gas in the United Kingdom has attracted increasing attention since 2007, when onshore shale gas production was proposed. A number of wells have been drilled, but as of August 2013, there has been no commercial production of shale gas in the UK. 
In July 2013 UK Prime Minister David Cameron claimed that, "fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down".  However since then figures from industry and government have stated that fracking in the UK alone will not lower prices as the UK is part of a well connected European market.  Such figures included former BP Chief Executive and government advisor Lord Browne, Energy Secretary Ed Davey and economist Lord Stern."Lord Browne: fracking will not reduce UK gas prices", The Guardian 29th Nov 2013"Fracking won't lower energy bills, says Davey", The Telegraph 9th Sep 2013 "'Baseless economics': Lord Stern on David Cameron’s claims that a UK fracking boom can bring down price of gas"
Favourable tax treatment was being offered to shale gas producers.[tpl]cite news|title=George Osborne unveils 'most generous tax breaks in world' for fracking: Environmental groups furious as chancellor sets 30% rate for shale gas producers in bid to enhance UK energy security|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jul/19/george-osborne-tax-break-fracking-shale-environment|accessdate=July 19, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 19, 2013|author=Terry Macalister|author2=Fiona Harvey|quote=Shale gas is a resource with huge potential to broaden the UK's energy mix," said the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. "We want to create the right conditions for industry to explore and unlock that potential in a way that allows communities to share in the benefits.  "This new tax regime, which I want to make the most generous for shale in the world, will contribute to that. I want Britain to be a leader of the shale gas revolution – because it has the potential to create thousands of jobs and keep energy bills low for millions of people[/tpl]

==Shale gas areas==

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has identified large areas of eastern and southern England as having the "best shale gas potential":[tpl]quote|The main area identified runs from just south of Middlesbrough in a crescent through East Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire and the Cotswolds to Somerset and Wiltshire. It then turns along the South Coast and Downs, including most of Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey and Kent. Shale gas sites are under investigation in the Sussex commuter belt, near Haywards Heath, the Mendip Hills, south of Bath, in Kent, Lincolnshire, south Wales, Staffordshire and Cheshire, as well as more sites near the existing find in Lancashire.[/tpl]

===Bowland Basin===

As of June 2013, the Bowland Basin was the only area in the UK where wells have been drilled specifically for shale gas. Four wells have been drilled by Cuadrilla Resources, and one by IGAS Energy. None of the wells has produced gas.
Cuadrilla started drilling Britain's first shale gas exploration well, the Preece-Hall-1, in August 2010. The well penetrated 800m of organic-rich shale. The company hydraulicly fractured the well in early 2011, but suspended the operation when it triggered two small earthquakes, one of which was large enough to be felt by people at the surface. Work on the well stopped in May 2011, and the government declared a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that was lifted in December 2012, subject to additional controls to limit seismic risk.http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20707574http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/policy/projects/shale-gas/2012-06-28-Shale-gas.pdfEd Davey, New controls announced for shale gas exploration, 13 Dec. 2011.
In September 2011, Cuadrilla announced a huge discovery of 200 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas in place under the Fylde Coast in Lancashire.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/21/gas-field-blackpool-dallas-sea |title=Vast reserves of shale gas revealed in UK |author=Terry Macalister |date=21 September 2011 |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Lancashire’s Shale Gas Estimated at 136bn by Cuadrilla | newspaper =BBC News | date = 1 February 2013| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-21296679 | accessdate =19 March 2013 [/tpl] Cuadrilla stated that it would be happy if it could recover 10–20% of the gas in place.

In 2011 and 2012, IGas Energy drilled a deep well to evaluate shale gas, and found gas shows in the Bowland Shale, with total organic content averaging 2.7%. The formation was reported to be thermally mature, in the wet gas window. IGAS bought large blocks of gas licences in 2011, much of which is reportedly prospective for shale gas.US Energy Information Administration, Technically recoverable shale oil and shale gas resources, June 2013, chapter XI. 
IGas announced that it would drill a well to evaluate shale gas at Barton, near Manchester. Drilling would begin in October 2013, and take two to three months. IGas has not applied for a permit to hydraulically fracture the well.Emily Gosden, IGas Energy prepares to drill near Manchester, The Telegraph, 9 Sept. 2013.

According to reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers, there could be £80 billion in reserves in Northern Ireland, although these claims were criticised as being sensationalist.BBC, Shale gas in Northern Ireland, accessed 17 Dec. 2013

==Resource estimates==

According to a 2011 report of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, "Shale gas resources in the UK could be considerable—particularly offshore—but are unlikely to be a "game changer" to the same extent as they have been in the US, where the shale gas revolution has led to a reduction in natural gas prices."[tpl]citation |separator=. |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmenergy/795/795.pdf |title=Shale Gas: Fifth Report of Session 2010–12, Volume I |author=House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee |date=23 May 2011 |location=London |publisher=The Stationery Office |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] The Committee's chairperson, Tim Yeo, has since revised his personal opinion, however, and now argues shale gas is a "game changer" that could "transform the UK's energy independence".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/article3322649.ece |title=Controversial gas mining technique given green light by US expert study |author=Tom Whipple |date=17 February 2012 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/naturalresources/article3214645.ece |title= Blackpool earthquakes send shudder through hopes of onshore gas boom |author= Tim Webb |date= 3 November 2011 |newspaper= The Times |accessdate= 5 March 2011 [/tpl] Interest in fracking comes just as imports of gas to the UK have surpassed domestic production for the first time since the 1960s.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9173373/UK-gas-imports-outstrip-production-for-first-time-since-1967.html |title= UK gas imports outstrip production for first time since 1967 |author= Emily Gosden |date= 29 March 2012 |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |accessdate= 31 March 2012[/tpl]
The size of recoverable resource is made difficult by the uncertainty of the percentage, usually small, of shale gas in place that is recoverable. In addition, companies may embrace large estimations of reserves to boost share prices. In the United States, companies have been subpoenaed on suspicion that the projections they provided to investors, including press-release figures, were inflated. In 2012, national agencies in the U.S and Poland revised dramatically downward their estimates of shale gas reserves.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/us/new-data-not-so-sunny-on-us-natural-gas-supply.html |title=New Report by Agency Lowers Estimates of Natural Gas in U.S. |author=Ian Urbina |date=28 January 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=23 February 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-02/poland-says-22-shale-gas-wells-underway-planned-for-this-year.html |title=Poland Says 22 Shale Gas Wells Under Way or Planned in 2012 |author=Marek Strzelecki |date=2 March 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=4 March 2012[/tpl]
Part of the problem in evaluation is the uncertainty of decline curve analysis from early data: shale gas wells can fall off sharply during the first year or two, then level off to a slower decline rate; the shape of the curve, and therefore the ultimate recovery, is difficult to predict from early production rates.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/columnists/article3200289.ece |title=American Notebook: Squeezing another drop from the barrel |author=Alexandra Frean |date=20 October 2011 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=4 March 2012 |quote=A typical well in North Dakota's seemingly prolific Bakken shale oil and gasfield, for example, may produce more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day in year one, but only 200 in year two, according to Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Existing fracking methods are capable of extracting only 5 per cent of the oil content of the shale. This can be raised to 15 per cent by multiple extractions from each wellhead. Even then, 85 per cent of the oil remains below ground.[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date = September 2013[/tpl]

===US Energy Information Administration===

In June 2013, the US Energy Information Administration issued a world-wide estimate of shale gas, which included an incomplete estimate of recoverable shale gas resources in the UK. The Carboniferous shale basins of North of England and Scotland, which include the Bowland Basin, were estimated to have 25 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas. The Jurassic shales of the Wessex Basin and Weald Basin of southern England were estimated to have 600 billion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 700 million barrels of associated oil. The agency noted that the UK shale basins are more complex than those in the US, and therefore more costly to drill. On the other hand, as of June 2013, the price of natural gas in the United Kingdom was reported to be more than double the price in the US and Canada by one source and three times higher by other sources.Natural gas prices BP web page, Retrieved 11 January 2014(25 March 2013) UPDATE 3-Britain's Centrica to buy U.S. natural gas in landmark deal  Reuters, Retrieved 11 January 2014
