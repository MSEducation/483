"Souchong" refers to the fourth and fifth leaves of the tea plant, further away from the more highly prized bud (pekoe) of the tea plant. These leaves are coarser than the leaves closer to the bud, and have less aromatic compounds. Smoking provides a way to create a marketable product from these less desirable leaves.Delmas">[/ref]
According to some sources, Lapsang souchong is the first black tea in history, even earlier than Keemun tea. After the lapsang souchong tea was used for producing black tea called Min Hong (meaning "Black tea produced in Fujian"), people started to move the tea bush to different places like Keemun, India and Ceylon.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

Lapsang souchong from the original source is increasingly expensive, as Wuyi is a small area and there is increasing demand for this variety of tea.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==History==

According to some sources, Lapsang souchong is the first black tea in history, even earlier than Keemun tea. After the lapsang souchong tea was used for producing black tea called Min Hong (meaning "Black tea produced in Fujian"), people started to move the tea bush to different places like Keemun, India and Ceylon.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

==Processing==

"Souchong" refers to the fourth and fifth leaves of the tea plant, further away from the more highly prized bud (pekoe) of the tea plant. These leaves are coarser than the leaves closer to the bud, and have less aromatic compounds. Smoking provides a way to create a marketable product from these less desirable leaves.Delmas">[/ref]
The leaves are roasted in a bamboo basket called a honglong ([tpl]linktext|烘|笼[/tpl]), which is heated over burning firewood which contributes to the dried longan aroma and smoky flavour. Pine wood is used as the firewood for lapsang souchong and contains the characteristic resin aroma and taste.

==Chemistry==

The aroma of lapsang souchong is due to a variety of chemical compounds. The two most abundant constituents of the aroma are longifolene and α-terpineol. Many of the compounds making up the aroma of lapsang souchong, including longifolene, originate only in the pine smoke, and are not found in other kinds of tea.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Yao |first1=Shan-Shan |last2=Guo |first2=Wen-Fei |last3=Lu |first3=Yi |last4=Jiang |first4=Yuan-Xun |title=Flavor Characteristics of Lapsang Souchong and Smoked Lapsang Souchong, a Special Chinese Black Tea with Pine Smoking Process |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=53 |issue=22 |date=2005[/tpl]

Tea merchants marketing to Westerners note that this variety of tea generally produces a strong reaction, with most online reviews extremely positive or strongly negative.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Tea connoisseurs often note that Formosan lapsang souchong typically has a stronger flavour and aroma, the most extreme being tarry souchong (smoked, as the name implies, over burning pine tar).[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
