Purush Pal is a village in Mathiura Union, Beanibazar Upazila, Sylhet district, Bangladesh.

==History==

There two different traditional anecdotal accounts as to how the name Purushpal became into existence and how the village was formed. 
First, it is believed that in Middle Ages, a group of Brahman men, i.e. purush, came from northern parts of India and established a settlement, which eventually developed into a village. As it was predominantly a settlement of purush, i.e. men; their zealous effort to befriend people from neighbouring villages, particularly women from different tribes and caste earned them the reputation of friend, i.e. paal; thus their settlement attained the name of Purushpaal, deriving from the compound of words purush + paal = Purushpaal. 
Second, the name Purush Pal came from Paresh Paul, who was the founder of the village by the end of 13th century. As Hazrat Shah Jalal arrived in Sylhet in 1303 CE with his 360 dervish disciples, the local inhabitants of Bangladesh, particularly from animist and pagan denomination, had begun to accept Islam as their region. Likewise, the people of Pareshpaul embraced Islam as their  religion; this way, most of the village inhabitants became Muslim. However, a sizeable village population remained Hindu, who sold their village homestead after 1947 and migrated to urban parts of the country, mainly to the city of Sylhet, Maulvi Bazar, Srimangal, Sunamganj and Chhatak. It is said that some of the wealthy Hindus have migrated to Shillong, Karimganj and Kolkata in India. There is no written record as to where the village pioneers, Paul Family, has migrated and settled.
