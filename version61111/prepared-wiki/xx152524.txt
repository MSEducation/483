CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Upper Hutt

There are two places in New Zealand called Heretaunga. For the region in Hawke's Bay see Heretaunga Plains.
Heretaunga is a suburb of Upper Hutt located in the lower North Island of New Zealand. The suburb takes its name from a Hawkes Bay district that early European settlers in the Hutt Valley used to name the nearby Hutt River. It is directly next to the suburb of Silverstream, and the two are commonly thought to be merged.Te Ara:The Encyclopedia of New Zealand - Hutt Valley - south
