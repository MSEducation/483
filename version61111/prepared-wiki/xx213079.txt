The winner of this Beovizija represented Serbia in the second semi-final of the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest on May 14, 2009, at the Olympic Indoor Arena in Moscow, Russia. The winning song was "Cipela" by Marko Kon and Milaan.

==At Eurovision==

Since Serbia is not one of the "Big Four" and is not the host of the 2009 contest, it had to compete in one of the two semi-finals. At the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January, it was decided that the country would compete in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1857|title=LIVE: The Semi-Final Allocation Draw|publisher=Eurovision.tv|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2009-01-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=4958|title=LIVE FROM MOSCOW, THE ALLOCATION DRAW|last=Konstantopolus|first=Fotis|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-01-30|date=2009-01-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/13083|title=Live: The Eurovision Semi Final draw|last=Floras|first=Stella|date=2009-01-30|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-01-30[/tpl]
Marko and Milaan performed 4th in the running order of the semi-final, following Latvia and preceding Poland. The duo failed to qualify Serbia to the final for the first time in the country's Eurovision history. However, if Latvia had indeed withdrawn as it was going to at one stage, it would've actually placed 9th, so it would've qualified to the final in favour of Lithuania.
