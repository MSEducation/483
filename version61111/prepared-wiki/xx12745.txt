===The world at the end of the 20th century===

By the end of the 20th century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]  Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances had radically altered daily lives.  Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history.  The people of the Indian subcontinent, a sixth of the world population at the end of the 20th century, had attained an indigenous independence for the first time in centuries.  China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally open to the world in a new and powerful synthesis of west and east, creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order.  With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left with truly independent new nation states, some cut from whole cloth, standing up after centuries of foreign domination.
The world was undergoing its second major period of globalization; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I.  Since the US was in a position of almost unchallenged domination, a major part of the process was Americanization. This led to[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] anti-Western and anti-American feelings in parts of the world, especially the Middle East.  The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations, long marginalized by the West and by their own rulers, were rapidly integrating with the world economy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
Terrorism, dictatorship, and the spread of nuclear weapons were some issues requiring attention. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts. Despots such as Kim Jong-il of North Korea continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons.
Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world.  New viruses such as SARS and West Nile continued to spread. Malaria and other diseases affected large populations.  Millions were infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.  The virus was becoming an epidemic in southern Africa.
Some[tpl]Who|date=September 2012[/tpl] speculate that in the long term, environmental problems may threaten the planet's livability.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]  One argument is that of global warming occurring, and that it may be due (at least partially) to human-caused emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]  This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the Kyoto treaty, which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.

===World population===

World population increased from about 1.6 billion people in 1901 to 6.1 billion at the century's end.  Some[tpl]Who|date=September 2012[/tpl] believe that a significant driver of many of the problems of the 20th century was overpopulation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Overpopulation has been a fascination of many, including economic theorist Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus whose "An Essay on the Principal of Population" was first published in 1798.  Some demographers[tpl]Who|date=July 2012[/tpl] have predicted that the population will reach a plateau of 9 to 10 billion around 2100.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
