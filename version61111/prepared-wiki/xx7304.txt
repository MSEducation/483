The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts known traditionally for research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well.
Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, the institute used a polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction. MIT's early emphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry. Curricular reforms under Karl Compton and Vannevar Bush in the 1930s emphasized basic science. MIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current [tpl]convert|168|acre|ha|1|adj=on[/tpl] campus opened in 1916 and extends over [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|1[/tpl] along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.
Today, the Institute comprises various academic departments with a strong emphasis on scientific, engineering, and technological education and research. It has five schools and one college, which contain a total of 32 departments. Eighty-one Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 45 Rhodes Scholars, and 38 MacArthur Fellows have been affiliated with the university. It is one of the most selective higher learning institutions, and received 18,357 undergraduate applicants for the class of 2018—only admitting 1,419, an acceptance rate of 7.73%.
MIT also has a strong entrepreneurial culture. The aggregated revenues of companies founded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventh-largest economy in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=Entrepreneurial Impact The Role of MIT Edward Roberts Charles Easley |url=http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedFiles/MIT_impact_brief_021709.pdf|work=MIT History|publisher=Kauffman Foundation|accessdate=February 2009[/tpl]

Two days after the charter was issued, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[tpl]cite web |last=Andrews |first=Elizabeth |coauthors=Nora Murphy and Tom Rosko |year=2000 |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/wbr-visionary/ |publisher=MIT Archives |title=William Barton Rogers: MIT's Visionary Founder[/tpl] The new institute had a mission that matched the intent of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions "to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes", and was a land-grant school.[tpl]cite book|last1=Stratton |first1=Julius Adams |last2=Mannix |first2=Loretta H. |title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT |pages=251–276 |chapter=The Land-Grant Act of 1862 |isbn=0-262-19524-0 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005[/tpl]In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The curriculum became more vocational, with less focus on theoretical science.Lewis 1949, p. 12. During these "Boston Tech" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W.

===Curricular reforms===

In the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lecuyer |first=Christophe |title=The making of a science based technological university: Karl Compton, James Killian, and the reform of MIT, 1930–1957 |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=1992 |pages=153–180 |doi=10.2307/27757693[/tpl] The Compton reforms "renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering."Lewis 1949, p. 13.

Still, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that "the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school", a "partly unjustified" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.Lewis 1949, p. 113.Bourzac, Katherine, "Rethinking an MIT Education: The faculty reconsiders the General Institute Requirements", Technology Review, Monday, March 12, 2007 The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/sch-hum.html |title=History: School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311064018/http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/sch-hum.html|archivedate=March 11, 2010|publisher=MIT Archives |accessdate=July 25, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/sch-sloan.html |title=History: Sloan School of Management |accessdate=July 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621002719/http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/histories-offices/sch-sloan.html|archivedate=June 21, 2010|publisher=MIT Archives[/tpl] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W.

===Defense research===

MIT's involvement in  military research surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[tpl]cite book |last=Zachary|first=Gregg |title=Endless Frontier: Vannevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century |publisher= Free Press |year=1997 |pages=248–249 |isbn = 0-684-82821-9 [/tpl] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar.

These activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of "any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the "academic tranquility of the prewar years", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.Lewis 1949, p. 49. The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.Lecuyer, 1992

The four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences, and is selective, admitting few transfer students and 7.7% of its applicants in the 2013–2014 application season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mit-regular-action-decisions-now-available-online1|title=MIT Admissions |publisher=MIT |year=2014[/tpl] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/front.degre.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Degree Charts |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |accessdate=September 6, 2010[/tpl] In the 2010–2011 academic year, 1,161 bachelor of science (abbreviated SB) degrees were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[tpl]cite web|title=MIT Degrees Awarded|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/students/degrees.html|publisher=Institutional Research, Office of the Provost|accessdate=June 26, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Academic Programs |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |accessdate=September 6, 2010[/tpl] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%). The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ([tpl]nowrap|Course 6–2[/tpl]), Computer Science and Engineering ([tpl]nowrap|Course 6–3[/tpl]), Mechanical Engineering ([tpl]nowrap|Course 2[/tpl]), Physics ([tpl]nowrap|Course 8[/tpl]), and Mathematics ([tpl]nowrap|Course 18[/tpl]).
All undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap3-gir.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Undergraduate General Institute Requirements |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |accessdate=September 6, 2010[/tpl] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be "communication-intensive",[tpl]cite web |title=About the Requirement |url=http://web.mit.edu/commreq/index.html |work=Undergraduate Communication Requirement |publisher=MIT |accessdate=May 30, 2012[/tpl] including "substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation".[tpl]cite web|title=Faculty and Instructors|url=http://web.mit.edu/commreq/faculty.html|work=Undergraduate Communication Requirement|publisher=MIT |accessdate=May 30, 2012[/tpl] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test; non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.
Most classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets ("p-sets"), and tests.

In 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers.

In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published The Hidden Curriculum, arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled "course bibles''—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[tpl]cite book|last=Benson|first=Snyder|title=The Hidden Curriculum|year=1970|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-69043-8|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=4398&ttype=2[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Mahoney|first=Matt|title=Unwritten Rules|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/mitnews/427509/unwritten-rules/|accessdate=June 21, 2012|newspaper=Technology Review|date=May 2012[/tpl]

===Graduate program===

MIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees. The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (MS), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (ScD); professional degrees such as Master of Architecture (MArch),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naab.org/schools/view.aspx?id=14406&origin=results&QS='&vSchoolYMGHFREschool_name=&vSchoolYMGHFREState=MA&startrec=1&searchtype=A&nextbttn=Search&union=AND&top_parent=99 |title=NAAB: Schools Database (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) |publisher=NAAB |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] Master of Business Administration (MBA),[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.aacsb.net/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AACSB&WebKey=ED088FF2-979E-48C6-B104-33768F1DE01D |title=AACSB – General |publisher=AASCB |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] Master of City Planning (MCP),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.planningaccreditationboard.org/index.php?id=30 |title=Planning Accreditation Board: Accredited Planning Programs |publisher=Planning Accreditation Board |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] Master of Engineering (MEng),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx |title=Accredited Programs Search |publisher=ABET |accessdate=April 16, 2011[/tpl] Master of Finance (MFin) and Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED),;[tpl]cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu/masters-program/about-the-program|title=MIT master of science in real estate development |publisher=MIT Center For Real Estate |accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl] and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD/PhD (with Harvard Medical School).[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/overv.chap4-gdr.html |title=MIT Course Catalog: Graduate Education: General Degree Requirements |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |accessdate=September 6, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/catalog/inter.gradu.html |title=Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs |publisher=Officer of the Registrar, MIT |accessdate=September 6, 2010[/tpl]
Admission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[tpl]cite web|title=Graduate Education|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/graduate.html|work=MIT Facts 2012|publisher=MIT|accessdate=June 25, 2012[/tpl]
MIT awarded 1,547 master's degrees and 609 doctoral degrees in the 2010–11 academic year. In the 2011 fall term, the School of Engineering was the most popular academic division, enrolling 45.0% of graduate students, followed by the Sloan School of Management (19%), School of Science (16.9%), School of Architecture and Planning (9.2%), Whitaker College of Health Sciences (5.1%),Figure includes 196 students working on Harvard degrees only. and School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (4.7%). The largest graduate degree programs were the Sloan MBA, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering.

===Faculty and staff===

[tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], MIT had 1,030 faculty members, of whom 225 were women.[tpl]cite web|title=Faculty and Staff|url=http://web.mit.edu/facts/faculty.html|work=MIT Facts|publisher=MIT|accessdate=2014-03-11[/tpl] Faculty are responsible for lecturing classes, advising both graduate and undergraduate students, and sitting on academic committees, as well as conducting original research. Between 1964 and 2009, a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT were awarded Nobel Prizes (thirteen in the last 25 years).[tpl]cite book|last=Nobel Foundation|title=Nobel laureates and universities|year=2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/universities.html[/tpl] MIT faculty members past or present have won a total of twenty-seven Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/awards/nobel.html |title=Awards and Honors |publisher=Institutional Research, Office of the Provost |accessdate=October 18, 2011[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2013|October[/tpl], among current faculty and teaching staff there are 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows. Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures.
A 1998 MIT study concluded that a systemic bias against female faculty existed in its School of Science,[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html |title=A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT |publisher=MIT Faculty News Letter |year=1999[/tpl] although the study's methods were controversial.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaf.edu/northern/mitstudy/ |first=Judith |last=Kleinfeld |title=MIT Tarnishes Its Reputation with Gender Junk Science |accessdate=April 10, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208134206/http://www.uaf.edu/northern/mitstudy/ |archivedate = February 8, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment041001b.shtml |title=Feminist Mythology |first=Kathryn Jean |last=Lopez |date=April 10, 2001 |publisher=National Review |accessdate=April 10, 2007[/tpl] Since the study, though, women have headed departments within the Schools of Science and of Engineering, and MIT has appointed several female vice presidents, although allegations of sexism continue to be made.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2007/12/06/tenure_at_mit_still_largely_a_male_domain/ |title=Tenure at MIT Still Largely a Male Domain |last=Wertheimer |first=Linda |work=The Boston Globe |date=December 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 25, 2008[/tpl] Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, was MIT's president from 2004 to 2012 and was the first woman to hold the post.
Tenure outcomes have vaulted MIT into the national spotlight on several occasions. The 1984 dismissal of David F. Noble, a historian of technology, became a cause célèbre about the extent to which academics are granted freedom of speech after he published several books and papers critical of MIT's and other research universities' reliance upon financial support from corporations and the military. Former materials science professor Gretchen Kalonji sued MIT in 1994 alleging that she was denied tenure because of sexual discrimination.[tpl]cite news|title=Ex-MIT professor who was denied tenure files sex bias suit |work=The Boston Globe |last=Vaznis |first=James |date=January 15, 1994[/tpl] In 1997, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination issued a probable cause finding supporting James Jennings' allegations of racial discrimination after a senior faculty search committee in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning did not offer him reciprocal tenure.[tpl]cite news|title=MCAD supports scholar's claim of bias by MIT; University Offered job, but no tenure |date=October 22, 1997 |work=The Boston Globe |last=Dowdy |first=Zachary[/tpl] In 2006–2007, MIT's denial of tenure to African-American biological engineering professor James Sherley reignited accusations of racism in the tenure process, eventually leading to a protracted public dispute with the administration, a brief hunger strike, and the resignation of Professor Frank L. Douglas in protest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/06/professor_accuses_mit_of_racism/|title=Professor accuses MIT of racism |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 18, 2007 | date=February 6, 2007 | first=April | last=Simpson[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/06/04/mit_center_director_resigns_in_protest_of_tenure_decision/|title=MIT center director resigns in protest of tenure decision |work=The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 19, 2007 | date=June 4, 2007 | first=Peter | last=Schworm[/tpl]
MIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities.  Founding faculty member Charles W. Eliot was recruited in 1869 to become president of Harvard University, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence on both American higher education and secondary education.  MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.
[tpl]As of|2014[/tpl], former provost Robert A. Brown is president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004-2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008-2013); former professor David Baltimore had been president of Caltech (1997-2006); and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST.

MIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper, The Guardian, "a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms between them generate global revenues of about $1.9tn (£1.2tn) a year. If MIT were a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world."[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217327 |title=Gurus and Grads |journal=Entrepreneur|date=September 20, 2010|author1=Ericka Chickowski[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Kauffman Foundation study finds MIT alumni companies generate billions for regional economies |publisher=MIT News Office |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/kauffman-study-0217.html |date=February 17, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=The MIT factor: celebrating 150 years of maverick genius |author=Ed Pilkington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/may/18/mit-massachusetts-150-years-genius|newspaper=The Guardian |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl]
