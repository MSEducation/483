[[Bucks point lace]]

CATEGORIES: Lace, Textile arts of England

Bucks point is a bobbin lace from the East Midlands in England. "Bucks" is short for Buckinghamshire, which was the main centre of production. The lace was also made in the nearby counties of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.[tpl]cite book|last=Powys|first=Marian|title=Lace and Lace Making|url=http://books.google.es/books?id=2G1sifycRUAC&pg=PA31&dq=Bucks+point+lace&lr=lang_en&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&sig=4krNZQKy1Pp24OaXJhXnq0BiXy4|accessdate=2008-05-22|date=March 2002|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-41811-1|pages=31[/tpl] Bucks point is very similar to the French Lille lace, and thus is often called English Lille.[tpl]cite book|last=Raffel|first=Marta Cotterell|title=The Laces of Ipswich: The Art and Economics of an Early American Industry, 1750-1840 |url= http://books.google.es/books?id=taavyQa65oAC&pg=PA71&dq=Bucks+point+lace&lr=lang_en&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a&sig=uZ-AdGEil72ExMx_azz1pHxmRUI |accessdate=2008-05-22|date=January 2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=1-58465-163-6|pages=151[/tpl] It is also similar to Mechlin lace and Chantilly lace.
Bucks lace has a gimp thread outlining the pattern. It is made in one piece on the lace pillow,[tpl]cite book|last=Earnshaw|first=Pat|title=A Dictionary of Lace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mjYWZ2mogv8C&pg=PA127&dq=Bucks+point+lace&lr=&as_brr=3&client=opera&sig=84X5gNvYUIljgzLCZ090BPKcL3k|accessdate=2008-05-22|date=February 1999|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-40482-X|pages=25[/tpl] at full width and not in strips like Honiton lace. Common designs are floral and geometric. The floral designs are like those in Mechlin and Lille laces, but Bucks lace is generally simpler than the Belgian laces, and is made of linen or silk. It can have picots along the edge.

==Etymology==

The word lace is from Middle English, from Old French las, noose, string, from Vulgar Latin *laceum, from Latin laqueus, noose; probably akin to lacere, to entice, ensnare.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lace |title=Show election|publisher=Lace|accessdate=2012-05-23[/tpl]

==History==

Although Buckinghamshire was a centre of English lacemaking from as early as the 16th century,[tpl]cite book|last=Levey|first=Santina|title=Lace, A History|year=1983|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|location=London|isbn=090128615X[/tpl] the styles of the lace made would have varied at different periods, reflecting what was fashionable at the time. The style referred to as Bucks Point lace did not appear until the end of the 18th century. It seems to have been based on contemporary Mechlin lace, but with Mechlin ground replaced by a simpler point ground to give a lighter lace as had become popular at the time.[tpl]cite web|title=British Bobbin Lace|url=http://www.laceguild.org/craft/britain.html#bucks|publisher=The Lace Guuild|accessdate=27 May 2013[/tpl]
