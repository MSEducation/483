With an estimated population of 90,000 to 100,000 people, Manhattan's Chinatown is also one of the oldest ethnic Chinese enclaves outside of Asia, consisting primarily of Cantonese and Min-speaking residents, although there are now some Mandarin speakers. It is one of six Chinatown neighborhoods in New York City and eight in the New York City Metropolitan Area, which contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, enumerating an estimated 735,000 individuals;[tpl]cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP05&prodType=table|title=ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES  2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA CSA|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2013-10-27[/tpl] the remaining Chinatowns are located in the boroughs of Queens (two or three, depending upon definition)[tpl]cite web|url=http://geographyplanning.buffalostate.edu/MSG%202002/13_McGlinn.pdf|title=Beyond Chinatown: Dual immigration and the Chinese population of metropolitan New York City, 2000, p. 115|author=Lawrence A.

==History==

===Ah Ken and early Chinese immigration===

Ah Ken is claimed to have arrived in the area during the 1840s; he is the first Chinese person credited as having permanently immigrated to Chinatown. As a Cantonese businessman, Ah Ken eventually founded a successful cigar store on Park Row.Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time.

(pg. 9) ISBN 0-7385-5517-7 He first arrived around 1858 in New York City, where he was "probably one of those Chinese mentioned in gossip of the sixties 1860s as peddling 'awful' cigars at three cents apiece from little stands along the City Hall park fence – offering a paper spill and a tiny oil lamp as a lighter", according to author Alvin Harlow in Old Bowery Days: The Chronicles of a Famous Street (1931).
Later immigrants would similarly find work as "cigar men" or carrying billboards, and Ah Ken's particular success encouraged cigar makers William Longford, John Occoo, and John Ava to also ply their trade in Chinatown, eventually forming a monopoly on the cigar trade.Tchen, John Kuo Wei.

(pg. 82–83) ISBN 0-8018-6794-0 It has been speculated that it may have been Ah Ken who kept a small boarding house on lower Mott Street and rented out bunks to the first Chinese immigrants to arrive in Chinatown. It was with the profits he earned as a landlord, earning an average of $100 a month, that he was able to open his Park Row smoke shop around which modern-day Chinatown would grow.[ref]Federal Writers' Project.

===Chinese exclusion period===

Faced with increasing racial discrimination and new laws which prevented participation in many occupations on the West Coast, some Chinese immigrants moved to the East Coast cities in search of employment. Early businesses in these cities included hand laundries and restaurants. Chinatown started on Mott, Park, Pell, and Doyers Streets, east of the notorious Five Points district. By 1870, there was a Chinese population of 200. By the time the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed, the population was up to 2,000 residents. By 1900, there were 7,000 Chinese residents, but fewer than 200 Chinese women.
The early days of Chinatown were dominated by Chinese "tongs" (now sometimes rendered neutrally as "associations"), which were a mixture of clan associations, landsman's associations, political alliances (Kuomintang (Nationalists) vs Communist Party of China), and more secretly, crime syndicates. The associations started to give protection from harassment due to anti-Chinese sentiment. Each of these associations was aligned with a street gang. The associations were a source of assistance to new immigrants – giving out loans, aiding in starting business, and so forth.
Wenfei Wang, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan, authors of "Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing," wrote that because of the immigration restrictions, until 1965 the New York Chinatown continued to be "virtually a bachelor society".Wang, Wenfei, Shangyi Zhou, and C. Cindy Fan. "Growth and Decline of Muslim Hui Enclaves in Beijing" (Archive). Eurasian Geography and Economics, 2002, 43, No. 2, pp. 104-122. Cited page: 106.
The associations formed a governing body named the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (中華公所). Though this body was meant to foster relations between the Tongs, open warfare periodically flared between the On Leong (安良) and Hip Sing (協勝) tongs.  Much of the Chinese gang warfare took place on Doyers street. Gangs like the Ghost Shadows (鬼影) and Flying Dragons (飛龍) were prevalent until the 1990s. The Chinese gangs controlled certain territories of Manhattan's Chinatown. The On Leong (安良) and its affiliate Ghost Shadows (鬼影) were of Cantonese and Toishan descent, and controlled Mott, Bayard, Canal, and Mulberry Streets. The Flying Dragons (飛龍) and its affiliate Hip Sing (協勝) also of Cantonese and Toishan descent controlled Doyers, Pell, Bowery, Grand, and Hester Streets. Other Chinese gangs also existed, like the Hung Ching and Chih Kung gangs of Cantonese and Toishan descent, which were affiliated with each other and also gained control of Mott Street. Born-to-Kill also known as Canal Boys, of Vietnamese and Chinese descent had control over Broadway, Canal, Baxter, Centre, and Lafeyette Streets. Fujianese gangs also existed, such as the Tung On gang, which affiliated with Tsung Tsin, and had control over East Broadway, Catherine and Division Streets and the Fuk Ching gang affiliated with Fukien American controlled East Broadway, Chrystie, Forsyth, Eldridge, and Allen Streets. At one point, a gang named the Freemasons gang, which were of Cantonese descent, had attempted to claim East Broadway as their territory.[tpl]cite book|author=Ko-Lin Chin|title=Chinatown Gangs: Extortion, Enterprise, and Ethnicity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7TEr5XRoSs0C&pg=PA8|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=February 10, 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513627-2|pages=8–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Patrick Radden Keefe|title=The Snakehead: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SKxptmGzIoMC&pg=PA75|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-52130-7|pages=75–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Jan Lin|title=Reconstructing Chinatown: Ethnic Enclave, Global Change|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=W5h_49sX0SQC&pg=PA52|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=July 1, 1998|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2905-3|pages=52–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=INgBAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=February 14, 1983|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=38–|id=[tpl]ISSN|00287369[/tpl][/tpl]
Columbus Park, the only park in Chinatown, was built on what was once the center of the infamous Five Points neighborhood of New York. During the 19th century, this was the most dangerous ghetto area of immigrant New York (as portrayed in the book and film Gangs of New York).

===Post-immigration reform===

In the years after the United States enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, allowing many more immigrants from Asia into the country, the population of Chinatown increased dramatically. Geographically, much of the growth was to neighborhoods to the north.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Chinatown grew and became more oriented on families due to the lifting of restrictions.
In the 1990s, Chinese people began to move into some parts of the western Lower East Side, which 50 years earlier was populated by Eastern European Jews and 20 years earlier was occupied by Hispanics.
Chinatown was adversely affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks. Being so physically close to Ground Zero, tourism and business had been very slow to return to the area for several years but appears to have rebounded more recently. Part of the reason was the New York City Police Department closure of Park Row – one of two major roads linking the Financial Center with Chinatown.
By 2007, luxury condominiums began to spread from SoHo into Chinatown. Previously Chinatown was noted for its crowded tenements and primarily Chinese residents. While some projects have targeted the Chinese community, the development of luxury housing has increased Chinatown's economic and cultural diversity.Toy, Vivian S. "Luxury Condos Arrive in Chinatown." The New York Times. September 17, 2006. Retrieved on April 2, 2010.
Currently, the rising prices of Manhattan real estate and high rents are also affecting Chinatown. Many new and poorer Chinese immigrants cannot afford their rents; as a result, most of the growth in new Chinese immigration has shifted to other Chinatowns in New York City, including the Flushing Chinatown (法拉盛華埠) and Elmhurst Chinatown (艾浒 唐人街) in Queens, the Brooklyn Chinatown (布鲁克林華埠) and its satellite Chinatowns in Brooklyn on Avenue U (唐人街, U大道) and in Bensonhurst (唐人街,本生浒), as well as to East Harlem (東哈萊姆) in Upper Manhattan. Many apartments, particularly in the Lower East Side and Little Italy, which used to be affordable to new Chinese immigrants, are being renovated and then sold or rented at much higher prices. Building owners, many of them established Chinese-Americans, often find it in their best interest to terminate leases of lower-income residents with stabilized rents as property values rise.
By 2009 many newer Chinese immigrants settled along East Broadway instead of the historic core west of Bowery. In addition Mandarin began to eclipse Cantonese as the predominant Chinese dialect in New York's Chinatown during the period. The New York Times says that the Flushing Chinatown now rivals Manhattan's Chinatown in terms of being a cultural center for Chinese-speaking New Yorkers' politics and trade.Semple, Kirk. "In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin." The New York Times. October 21, 2009. Retrieved on December 6, 2012.

==Economy==

Chinese green grocers and fishmongers are clustered around Mott Street, Mulberry Street, Canal Street (by Baxter Street), and all along East Broadway (especially by Catherine Street).  The Chinese jewelers' district is on Canal Street between Mott and Bowery. Due to the high savings rate among Chinese, there are many Asian and American banks in the neighborhood. Canal Street, west of Broadway (especially on the North side), is filled with street vendors selling knock-off brands of perfumes, watches, and handbags. This section of Canal Street was previously the home of warehouse stores selling surplus/salvage electronics and hardware.
In addition, tourism and restaurants are major industries.Indo New York, "Chinatown", http://indonewyork.com/contents/New%20York/Kota%20New%20York/Chinatown/Chinatown.htm. 2007. The district boasts many historical and cultural attractions, and it is a destination for tour companies like Big Onion and NYC Chinatown Tours.Big Onion, http://bigonion.com/description/index.html; NYC Chinatown Tours, http://www.nycchinatowntours.com/ Tour stops often include landmarks like the Church of the Transfiguration and the Lin Zexu and Confucius statues.Big Onion, http://bigonion.com/description/index.html. The enclave’s many restaurants also support the tourism industry. The New York Food Tours company runs programs taking visitors to the area’s eateries for dishes like Shanghai Scallion Pancakes and wonton soup.New York Food Tours, Tastes of Chinatown, http://foodtoursofny.com/p/chinatown.html The Chinatown restaurant scene is large and vibrant, with more than 300 Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood providing employment.

Other contributors to the economy include factories. The proximity of the fashion industry has kept some garment work in the local area, which at its peak employed 30,000 workers, though much of the garment industry has since moved to China. The local garment industry now concentrates on quick production in small volumes and piece work, which is generally done at the worker's home.  Much of the population growth is due to immigration.
The September 11, 2001 attacks caused a decline in business for stores and restaurants in Chinatown, although the area's economy as well as tourism have rebounded since then. A Chinatown business improvement district has been proposed, but is being resisted by some merchants.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/nyregion/chinatown-considers-business-improvement-district.html|title=Chinatown Considers Business Improvement District|last=Berger|first=Joseph|date=September 21, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 21, 2011[/tpl]

==Demographics==

Unlike most other urban Chinatowns, Manhattan's Chinatown is both a residential area as well as commercial area. Many population estimates are in the range of 90,000 to 100,000 residents.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/|title=Alaska Dispatch[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nyhabitat.com/blog/category/new-york/new-york-travel-guide/new-york-neighborhoods/lower-east-side/|title=New York Neighborhoods – Lower East Side[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/24/magazine/there-s-more-to-chinatown.html?pagewanted=all?pagewanted=all|title=There's More To Chinatown | work=The New York Times | first=D.

===Influx of Hong Kong and Cantonese immigrants===

In the earliest years of the existence of Manhattan's Chinatown, it was primarily populated by Taishanese-speaking Chinese immigrants and the borderlines of the enclave was originally Canal Street to the north, Bowery to the east, Worth Street to the south, and Mulberry Street to the west. 
Immigration reform in 1965 opened the door to a huge influx of Cantonese speakers from Hong Kong and Guangdong province in Mainland China, and Standard Cantonese became the dominant tongue. With the influx of Hong Kong immigrants, it was developing and growing into a Hong Kongese neighborhood, however the growth slowed down later on during the 1980s-90s.[tpl]cite book|author=Ronald Skeldon|title=Reluctant Exiles?: Migration from Hong Kong and the New Overseas Chinese|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1JFiyWCjrOQC&pg=PA256|accessdate=July 25, 2012|year=1994|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-334-8|pages=256–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Ming K.

===Development stages===

Through the 1970s-80s, the influx of Guangdong and Hong Kong immigrants began to develop newer portions of Manhattan's Chinatown going north of Canal Street and then later the east of the Bowery. However until the 1980s, the western section was the most primarily fully Chinese developed and populated part of Chinatown and the most quickly flourishing busy central Chinese business district with still a little bit of remaining Italians in the very north west portion around Grand Street and Broome Street, which eventually all moved away and became all Chinese by the 1990s.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael S.

Until the 1980s, the eastern portion of Chinatown east of the Bowery, which is considered part of the Lower East Side was developing more slowly as being part of Chinatown, the proportion and concentration of Chinese residents was lower and more scattered than the western section, and there was still a higher proportion of Non-Chinese residents than Chinatown's western section consisting of Jewish, Puerto Ricans, and a few Italians and African Americans.[tpl]cite book|author=Time Inc|title=LIFE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bUkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=September 7, 1959|publisher=Time Inc|pages=36–|id=[tpl]ISSN|00243019[/tpl][/tpl] 
During the 1970s and 1980s, the eastern portion of Chinatown east of the Bowery was a very quiet section, and like in all of the rest of the Lower East Side, many people and especially many Chinese people were afraid to walk through or even reside on the streets east of the Bowery due to deteriorating building conditions and high crime rates such as gang activities, robberies, building burglaries, and rape as well as fear of racial tensions with other ethnic people that were still residing there.

CHINATOWN YOUTH ARRESTED IN SHOOTING THAT INJURED 7, New York Times, May 25, 1985.2 in a Chinatown Gang Convicted in Shootings, New York Times, May 13, 1986. 
Starting in the 1970s and especially throughout the 1980s-90s, Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese immigrants and then later on many other Non-Cantonese Chinese immigrants also were arriving into New York City. However, due to the traditional dominance of Cantonese-speaking residents, which were largely working class in Manhattan's Chinatown and the neighborhood's poor housing conditions, they were unable to relate to Manhattan's Chinatown and mainly settled in Flushing and created a more middle class Mandarin-Speaking Chinatown and even smaller one in Elmhurst, since most of the newer upcoming generations of ethnic Chinese were already using Mandarin although still their regional dialects in everyday conversations, whereas Cantonese speaking populations largely don't speak Mandarin or only speak it with other Non-Cantonese Chinese speakers. As a result, Manhattan's Chinatown and Brooklyn's emerging Chinatown were able to continue retaining it's traditional almost exclusive Cantonese society and were nearly successful at permanently keeping it's Cantonese dominance. 
However, there was already a small and slow growing Fuzhou immigrant population in Manhattan's Chinatown since the 1970s-80s in the eastern section of Chinatown east of the Bowery, which was still underdeveloped as being part of Chinatown.

===Little Fuzhou emerges===

In the late 1980s-90s, when a large influx of Fuzhou immigrants, whom also largely speak Mandarin along with their Fuzhou dialect started to arrive into New York City, they were the only exceptional group of Chinese to largely settle in Manhattan's Chinatown and eventually Brooklyn's Chinatown, which was also originally Cantonese dominated. This is due to many of them having no legal status and being forced into the lowest paying jobs, Manhattan's Chinatown was the only place they can receive affordable housing and be around other Chinese people despite the heavy Cantonese dominance until the 1990s since the more Mandarin-speaking enclaves in Flushing and Elmhurst would be too expensive to rent a vacancy. 
Since the Fuzhou immigrants have a strong cultural and linguistic background difference from the Cantonese people, the Fuzhou immigrants were unable to integrate well into Manhattan's Chinatown, which was still very Cantonese dominated and as a result they settled in the eastern portion of Chinatown, which was still an overlap of Chinese, Hispanics and Jewish in addition the higher availability of housing vacancies is another reason why they settled in that section. The eastern section became more fully developed as being part of Chinatown, and these new immigrants began to establish their own Fuzhou community along East Broadway and Eldridge Street. This has resulted in referring to East Broadway as Fuzhou Street No. 1, emerged during the late 1980s-early 1990s and Eldridge Street as Fuzhou Street No. 2, which developed more towards after the mid 1990s-early 2000s. Little Fuzhou started becoming known as the New Chinatown of Manhattan, separate from the long time heavily dominated Cantonese community, which is the western section of Chinatown or the Old Chinatown of Manhattan; although significant minor to moderate numbers of long time Cantonese people and businesses still continue to exist in the eastern portion of Chinatown.[tpl]cite book|author=Bonnie Tsui|title=American Chinatown: A People's History of Five Neighborhoods|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VpTuJeqbGR4C&pg=PA69|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=August 11, 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5723-4|pages=69–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Ko-Lin Chin|title=Smuggled Chinese: Clandestine Immigration to the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7gxBEkvPIxUC&pg=PA20|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=December 9, 1999|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-733-9|pages=20–[/tpl]
Very soon, in the early 2000s, gentrification immediately came into Manhattan's Chinatown and in addition to the shortage of housing vacancies, it caused the Fuzhou influx to shift to Brooklyn's Chinatown, which was now the most affordable NYC Chinese enclave to live in and unlike in Manhattan's Chinatown where the Fuzhou population continues to be mainly concentrated, although now slowly declining due to gentrification in the East Broadway and Eldridge Street portion, the Fuzhou immigrant population has now managed to dominate the whole Brooklyn's Chinatown diluting the Cantonese population as well as beginning to sideline Manhattan's Chinatown's Little Fuzhou as the Fuzhou cultural center in New York City. Brooklyn's Chinatown then became more fully developed and as well as causing it's ethnic enclave size to expand tremendously as a result of the shift of the Fuzhou influx.
Not only did the Fuzhou immigration influx establish a new portion of Manhattan's Chinatown, they contributed significantly in maintaining the Chinese population in the neighborhood, they also played a role in property values increasing quickly during the 1990s, in contrast to during the 1980s, when the housing prices were dropping. As a result, landlords were able to generate twice as much income in Manhattan's Chinatown, Flushing's Chinatown and eventually Brooklyn's Chinatown.[tpl]cite book|author=Xiaojian Zhao|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6glk5aF8FQYC&pg=PA114|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=January 19, 2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4692-6|pages=114–[/tpl]
If Flushing or Elmhurst was more affordable to live in or if the Mandarin-speaking populations had settled in a more affordable neighborhood in New York City, more than likely they would have largely settled with the Mandarin-speaking enclaves to be around other Mandarin speakers and not Manhattan's and Brooklyn's Chinatowns. This means Manhattan's and Brooklyn's Chinatowns would have continued to permanently retain it's traditional almost exclusively Cantonese society, but this also means the eastern portion of Manhttan's Chinatown would have continued to remain underdeveloped as part of Chinatown and possibly the Chinese population would not have been well maintained and Brooklyn's Chinatown size would have continued to remain very small and less developed. However, many of Fuzhou immigrants who made enough money eventually began to flood Flushing and Elmhurst as well.

===Fuzhou and Cantonese relations===

The Fuzhou immigration pattern started out in the 1970s very similarly like the Cantonese immigration during the late 1800s to early 1900s that had established Manhattan's Chinatown on Mott Street, Pell Street, and Doyers Street. Starting out as mostly men arriving first and then later on bringing their families over. The beginning influx of Fuzhou immigrants arriving during the 1980s and 1990s were entering into a Chinese community that was extremely Cantonese dominated. Due to the Fuzhou immigrants having no legal status and inability to speak Cantonese, many were denied jobs in Chinatown as a result causing many of them to resort to crimes to make a living that began to dominate the crimes going on in Chinatown. There was a lot of Cantonese resentment against Fuzhou immigrants arriving into Chinatown.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chinatown-latest-wave-of-immigrants-is-splitting-chinatown.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jane H. | last=Lii | title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN; Latest Wave of Immigrants Is Splitting Chinatown | date=June 12, 1994[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Andrew Rosenberg|author2=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to New York|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0z8ZSwQ-sC&pg=PA81|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8565-7|pages=81–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=David Kyle|author2=Rey Koslowski|title=Global Human Smuggling: Comparative Perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5blzwmEvZG4C&pg=PA236|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=May 11, 2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6590-9|pages=236–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Kenneth J.

===Little Hong Kong/Guang Dong===

As the epicenter of the massive Fuzhou influx has shifted to Brooklyn in the 2000s, Manhattan's Chinatown's Cantonese population still remains viable and large and successfully continues to retain its stable Cantonese community identity, maintaining the communal gathering venue established decades ago in the western portion of Chinatown, to shop, work, and socialize — in contrast to the Cantonese population and community identity which are declining very rapidly in Brooklyn's Chinatown.
Although the term Little Hong Kong was used a long time ago to describe Manhattan's Chinatown relating to when an influx of Hong Kong immigrants were pouring in at that time and even though not all Cantonese immigrants come from Hong Kong, this portion of Chinatown has heavy Cantonese characteristics, especially with the Standard Cantonese, which is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China being widely used, so it is in many ways a Little Hong Kong.
A more appropriate term would be Little GuangDong since the Cantonese immigrants do come from different regions of the Guangdong province of China. The long time established Cantonese Community, which can be considered Little Hong Kong/Guang Dong or known as the Old Chinatown of Manhattan lies along Mott, Pell, Doyer, Bayard, Elizabeth, Mulberry, Canal, and Bowery Streets, within Manhattan's Chinatown.
Newer satellite Little GuangDong/Little Hong Kong have started to emerge in sections of Bensonhurst and in Sheepshead Bay/Homecrest in Brooklyn. However, there are more scattered and mixed in with other ethnic enclaves. This is a result of many Cantonese residents migrating to these neighborhoods. Originally Brooklyn's Chinatown in Sunset Park was a satellite of Manhattan's Western Cantonese Chinatown, but because of the Fuzhou influx in the 2000s and with the Cantonese residents now rapidly moving away, it is now more of a satellite of Manhattan's Eastern Fuzhou Chinatown. 

===Chinese cultural standards===

Despite the large Fuzhou population, many of the Chinese businesses in Chinatown are still Cantonese owned and because of still the large Cantonese population on the Lower East Side, Cantonese still carries a strong presence in Chinatown including to the additional large influx of Cantonese speaking customers coming from other places to neighborhood on the weekends to do shopping and eat in restaurants even though Mandarin Chinese is rapidly sweeping Cantonese aside as the lingua franca of Chinatown,[tpl]cite book|author=Patrick Radden Keefe|title=The Snakehead: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c7zknWPpNuIC&pg=PA38|accessdate=February 9, 2013|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-52130-7|pages=38–[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/nyregion/22chinese.html|title=In Chinatown, Sound of the Future Is Mandarin|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2013 | work=The New York Times | first=Kirk | last=Semple[/tpl] allowing Cantonese to continue to exert a significant level of influence upon the cultural standards and economic resources of Manhattan's Chinatown. The Cantonese dominated western section of Chinatown also continues to be the main busy Chinese business district. 
As a result, it has influenced many Fuzhou people to learn the Cantonese language as well to maintain a job and to be able to bring more Cantonese customers as additional contributions to their businesses, especially large businesses like the Dim Sum restaurants on what is known as Little Fuzhou on East Broadway (小福州), the center of Fuzhou culture.[tpl]cite book|author=Let's Go Inc.|title=Let's Go USA 24th Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SMGOgKLHbz8C&pg=PA99|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=November 27, 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-37445-7|pages=99–[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://nychinatown.org/ebway.html |title=A journey through China town |publisher=Nychinatown.org |accessdate=November 15, 2009[/tpl] Due to many Fuzhou immigrants having the most interaction with Cantonese people out all of the other Non-Cantonese Chinese people, the Fuzhou immigrants that mastered the Cantonese language constitute the vast majority of Chinese people who are not native Cantonese speakers, but learned to speak Cantonese in NYC. Linguistically, however, in the past few years, the Cantonese dialect that has dominated Chinatown for decades is being swiftly uprooted by Mandarin Chinese, the national language of China and the lingua franca of most of the latest Chinese immigrants.
A significant difference between the two separate Chinese provincial communities in Manhattan's Chinatown is that the Cantonese part of Chinatown not only serves Chinese customers but is also a tourist attraction, whereas the Fuzhou part of Chinatown caters less to tourists, but it is now slowly receiving tourists as well.[tpl]cite book|author=Jan Lin|title=The Power of Urban Ethnic Places: Cultural Heritage and Community Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7a2_J2Z8s-YC&pg=PA226|accessdate=July 25, 2012|year=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-87982-8|pages=226–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Xinyang Wang|title=Surviving the City: The Chinese Immigrant Experience in New York City, 1890–1970|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PzynALMFtEEC&pg=PA79|accessdate=July 25, 2012|year=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0891-0|pages=79–[/tpl] Bowery, Chrystie Street, Catherine Street, and Chatham Square encompass the approximate border zone between the Fuzhou and Cantonese communities in Manhattan's Chinatown.[tpl]cite book|author=Ko-Lin Chin|title=Smuggled Chinese: Clandestine Immigration to the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7gxBEkvPIxUC&pg=PA112|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=December 9, 1999|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-733-9|pages=112–[/tpl]

===Fuzhou Influx Shifts to Brooklyn's Chinatown===

Now the increasing Fuzhou influx has shifted into the Brooklyn Chinatown in the Sunset Park section of the Brooklyn borough of New York City. This shift is replacing the Cantonese population throughout Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown significantly more rapidly than in Manhattan's Chinatown. Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown is becoming the new Little Fuzhou in NYC, or figuratively, Brooklyn's East Broadway (布鲁克林区的東百老匯).
During the late 1980s and 1990s, most of the new Fuzhou immigrants arriving into New York City were settling in Manhattan's Chinatown and later formed the first Fuzhou community in the city amongst the waves of Cantonese who had settled in Chinatown over decades; but by the 2000s, the Fuzhou population growth had slowed within Manhattan's Chinatown and began to accelerate in Brooklyn's Chinatown instead.
Gentrification in Manhattan's Chinatown has slowed the growth of Fuzhou immigration as well as the growth of Chinese immigrants to Manhattan in general,[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/answers-about-the-gentrification-of-chinatown/|title=Answers About the Gentrification of Chinatown|author=Peter Kwong|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl] which is why New York City's rapidly growing Chinese population has now shifted primarily to the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.
Some Chinese landlords, especially the many real estate agencies in Manhattan's Chinatown mainly of Cantonese descent, have been accused of prejudice against the Fuzhou immigrants, supposedly making Fuzhou immigrants feel unwelcome with concerns that they will not be able to pay rent secondary to debt to gangs that may have helped smuggled them in illegally into the United States and out of fear that gangs will come up to the apartments to cause trouble.http://books.google.com/books?id=6glk5aF8FQYC&pg=PA108&dq=East+Broadway+was+once+Cantonese&hl=en&ei=EEjQTZrGLszpgAfw7cGhDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=East%20Broadway%20was%20once%20Cantonese&f=falsehttp://books.google.com/books?id=Xm2rhPCjPrAC&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=Landlords+not+wanting+to+rent+to+Fuzhou+immigrants&source=bl&ots=CtS1e7F4xC&sig=SJnNTlS3Sp2NhzsiJNVEyKC5NWw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uCwoT8GVOKnL0QHypam_Ag&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Landlords%20not%20wanting%20to%20rent%20to%20Fuzhou%20immigrants&f=false
There is also supposedly concern that Fujianese are more likely to make the apartments too overcrowded by subdividing an apartment into multiple very tiny spaces to rent to other Fuzhou immigrants. East Broadway, Manhattan's center of Fuzhou culture, has perhaps the most blatant results of illegal apartment subdivisions including having many bunk beds in just one small room.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indypressny.org/nycma/voices/270/news/news_2/|title=High demand for illegal Chinatown apartments|author=Jian-Cuo, World Journal, May 9, 2007, then translated from Chinese by Connie Kong|date=May 17, 2007|publisher=New York Community Media Alliance|accessdate=October 1, 2012[/tpl] As a result of fear of being evicted by Cantonese landlords, many Fuzhou immigrants resort to renting a tiny space from Fujianese landlords inside apartments already occupied by Fuzhou immigrants.
With the rapid growth of Fuzhou homeownership in Brooklyn's Chinatown, and like many other Chinese immigrants and other ethnic immigrants who have become successful homeowners, the Fuzhou homeowners subdivide the houses into multiple apartments to rent out to tenants. This has created opportunities for the newly arriving Fuzhou immigrants to NYC to seek landlords of Fuzhou descent in Brooklyn's Chinatown. Here they are able to rent an apartment at a lower price and in better conditions than ones in Manhattan's Chinatown with fewer barriers imposed on them, however there are Fuzhou landlords that can sometimes still discriminate Fuzhou tenants by imposing high rent prices.http://www.indypressny.org/nycma/voices/397/news/news/ Brooklyn's Chinatown is now the new nexus for new arriving Fuzhou immigrants to settle in NYC and many of them in Brooklyn's Chinatown have also illegally subdivided their apartments into tiny rooms to rent to other Fuzhou immigrants.[tpl]cite book|author=Xiaojian Zhao|title=The New Chinese America: Class, Economy, and Social Hierarchy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6glk5aF8FQYC&pg=PA108|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=January 19, 2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4692-6|pages=108–[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/answers-about-the-gentrification-of-chinatown/ | work=The New York Times | title=Answers About the Gentrification of Chinatown | date=September 16, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Daniel E.

Although Mandarin is spoken as a native language among only ten percent of Chinese speakers in Manhattan's Chinatown, it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them.  Although Min Chinese, especially the Fuzhou dialect, is spoken natively by a third of the Chinese population in the city, it is not used as a lingua franca because speakers of other dialect groups do not learn Min.[tpl]Cite book| last = García | first = Ofelia |author2=Fishman, Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 3-11-017281-X[/tpl]

===Satellite Chinatowns===

For a long time, Manhattan's Chinatown has always been the most largely concentrated Chinese population in NYC, which is 6% Chinese American overall. However, in recent years growing Chinese populations in the outer boroughs of NYC have tremendously outnumbered Manhattan's Chinese population.[tpl]Cite web|author=Ramirez, Jeanine|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/special_reports/making_census_of_it/140908/making-census-of-it--as-brooklyn-s-chinese-american-population-grows--some-call-for-more-services |title=Making Census Of It: As Brooklyn's Chinese-American Population Grows, Some Call For More Services |publisher=NY1 |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|author=Khan, Shazia|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/special_reports/making_census_of_it/143332/making-census-of-it--chinatown-no-longer-home-to-nyc-s-largest-chinese-population |title=Making Census Of It: Chinatown No Longer Home To NYC's Largest Chinese Population|publisher=NY1 |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2012[/tpl] Other New York City Chinese communities have been settled over the years, including that of Flushing in Queens, particularly along from Roosevelt Avenue to Main Street through Kissena Blvd.
Another Chinese community is located in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, particularly along 8th Avenue from 40th to 65th Streets. New York City's newer Chinatowns have recently sprung up in Elmhurst and Corona, Queens (which border each other and are part of the same Chinatown), on Avenue U in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn, as well as in Bensonhurst, also in Brooklyn. Outside of New York City proper, rapidly growing suburban Chinatowns are developing within the New York metropolitan area in nearby Edison, New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geographyplanning.buffalostate.edu/MSG%202002/13_McGlinn.pdf|title=BEYOND CHINATOWN: DUAL IMMIGRATION AND THE CHINESE POPULATION OF METROPOLITAN NEW YORK CITY, 2000, Page 6|author=Lawrence A.

While the composition of these satellite Chinatowns are as varied as the original, the political factions in the original Manhattan Chinatown (Tongs, Republic of China loyalists, People's Republic of China loyalists, and those apathetic) have led to some factionalization in the satellite Chinatowns.
The Flushing Chinatown was spearheaded by many Chinese fleeing the Communist retaking of Hong Kong in 1997 as well as Taiwanese who used their considerable capital to buy out land from the former residents. The Brooklyn Chinatown was originally settled by Cantonese immigrants, but today it is mostly populated by Fujianese immigrants with still some Cantonese immigrants, who are longtime Chinese residents.

==Buildings==

===Housing===

The housing stock of Chinatown is still mostly composed of cramped tenement buildings, some of which are over 100 years old. It is still common in such buildings to have bathrooms in the hallways, to be shared among multiple apartments.
A federally subsidized housing project, named Confucius Plaza, was completed on the corner of Bowery and Division streets in 1976. This 44-story residential tower block gave much needed new housing stock to thousands of residents. The building also housed a new public grade school, P.S. 124 (or Yung Wing Elementary). Besides being the first and largest affordable housing complex specifically available to the Chinatown population Confucius Plaza is also a cultural and institutional landmark, springing forth community organization, Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE), one of Chinatown's oldest political/community organizations, founded in 1974.

===Landmarks===

For much of Chinatown's history, there were few unique architectural features to announce to visitors that they had arrived in the neighborhood (other than the language of the shop signs). In 1962, at Chatham Square the Lieutenant Benjamin Ralph Kimlau Memorial archway was erected in memorial of the Chinese-Americans who died in World War II. This memorial, which bears calligraphy by the great Yu Youren 于右任 (1879—1964), is mostly ignored by the residents due to its poor location on a busy car thoroughfare with little pedestrian traffic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] A statue of Lin Zexu (林則徐), also known as Commissioner Lin, a Foochowese Chinese official who opposed the opium trade, is also located at the square; it faces uptown along East Broadway, now home to the bustling Fuzhou neighborhood and known locally as Fuzhou Street (Fúzhóu jiē 福州街). In the 1970s, New York Telephone, then the local phone company started capping the street phone
booths with pagoda-like decorations. In 1976, the statue of Confucius in front of Confucius Plaza became a common meeting place. In the 1980s, banks which opened new branches and others which were renovating started to use Chinese traditional styles for their building facades.

===Chinese theaters===

In the past, Chinatown had Chinese theaters that provided entertainment to the Chinese population. The first Chinese-language theater in the city was located at 5–7 Doyers Street from 1893 to 1911. The theater was later converted into a rescue mission for homeless from Bowery. In 1903, the theater was the site of a fundraiser by the Chinese community for Jewish victims of a massacre in Kishinev.[tpl]cite news|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=The Night New York’s Chinese Went Out for Jews|url=http://forward.com/articles/134950/|accessdate=February 23, 2011|newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=February 4, 2011[/tpl]
Among the theaters that existed in Chinatown in later years were the Sun Sing Theater under the Manhattan Bridge and the Pagoda Theater, both on the street of East Broadway, the Governor Theater on Chatham Square, the Rosemary Theater on Canal Street across the Manhattan Bridge, as well as the Music Palace on the Bowery, which was the last Chinese theater to close. Others have existed in different sections of Chinatown. The Chinese theaters also played movies with Chinese and English subtitles for the non-Chinese viewers, which were very often black Muslims that enjoyed movies with non-white heroes,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] Caucasian martial arts students and people who were film cognoscenti. During the 1970s, the Chinese theaters became less attractive due to increasing gang-violence.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] These theaters now have all closed because of more accessibility to videotapes, which were more affordable and provided more genres of movies and much later on DVDs and VCDs became available. Other factors such as, availability of Chinese cable channels, karaoke bars, and gambling in casinos began to provide other options for the Chinese to have entertainment also influenced the Chinese theaters to go out of business.http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g128/davidbellel/david2/pagoda2.jpghttp://knickerbockervillage.blogspot.com/2008_01_01_archive.htmlhttp://www.nychinatown.org/articles/nytimes980614.html[tpl]cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-gCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16|accessdate=July 25, 2012|date=April 21, 1997|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=16–|id=[tpl]ISSN|00287369[/tpl][/tpl]
