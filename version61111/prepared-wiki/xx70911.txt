==Early life and politics==

Seaton was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Dorothea Elizabeth (née Schmidt) and Fay Noble Seaton.  He attended the Manhattan High School in Manhattan, Kansas. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1931, and married Gladys Hope Dowd (November 5, 1910 - January 5, 1999), in the same year.  They had four children: Donald Richard, Alfred Noble, Johanna Christine and Monica Margaret Seaton.  In 1937, Seaton moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where he was the publisher of Hastings Tribune for many years.
Seaton was active in Republican politics. He served in the Nebraska Legislature 1945-1949.  He was appointed by the U.S. Senate on December 10, 1951, by the Nebraska Governor Val Peterson. He filled the vacancy created by the death of Kenneth S. Wherry.  He served that office until November 4, 1952.
Seaton served in the various White House and subcabinet posts in the Eisenhower's administration before he was appointed the Secretary of the Interior. He served that in office from June 8, 1956 until January 20, 1961.  During his tenure, Alaska and Hawaii became the 49th and 50th states admitted to the Union.  He ran for the Governor of Nebraska in 1962.  He was defeated by the incumbent Governor Frank B. Morrison (Olson, p. 335). Following his defeat, Seaton became a strong advocate for campaign finance reform in that state.
Seaton died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 16, 1974, and is interred in Parkview Cemetery in Hastings, Nebraska.
