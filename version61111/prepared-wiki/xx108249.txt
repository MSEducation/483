[[Nawab of Bhopal]]

CATEGORIES: Nawabs of India, People from Bhopal, History of Bhopal

The Nawabs of Bhopal were the Muslim rulers of the princely state of Bhopal, now part of the modern state of Madhya Pradesh, in India. The last Nawab was Hamidullah Khan, who acceded his state to India in 1947.
The female Nawabs were also known as the Begums, their official title being Nawab Begum of Bhopal. The term “Begum of Bhopal” may in theory also refer to the wives of male Nawabs of Bhopal; however, in practice such ladies are only rarely referred to by that title.
