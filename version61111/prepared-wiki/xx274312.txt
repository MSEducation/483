[[Euro step]]

CATEGORIES: Basketball terminology

The Euro step (capitalization of "step" optional), or Eurostep, is a term for a basketball move in which an offensive player picks up his dribble, takes a step in one direction, and then quickly takes a second step in another direction. It is intended to allow the offensive player to evade a defender and attack the basket.

==Background==

According to New York Times writer Jonathan Abrams,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/sports/basketball/18moves.html |title=An N.B.A. Move That Crossed an Ocean |first=Jonathan |last=Abrams |work=The New York Times |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 23, 2011[/tpl] The move is a crafty way to distribute the two steps allocated to a player after he stops dribbling, and it goes right to the edge of being a traveling violation.  Anecdotal reports indicate that officials not familiar with the move may call it a violation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hoopspeak.com/2010/03/let-me-see-you-euro-step/ |title=Let me see you Euro Step |first=Beckley |last=Mason |work=HoopSpeak.com |publisher=ESPN TrueHoop Network |date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl] Today, the Euro step is often used when a player drives to the hoop, and it can be especially effective when a shorter guard takes on a taller forward or center.

==History==

Developed in European basketball, the move is generally accepted to have been brought to the NBA by Lithuanian Šarūnas Marčiulionis, though there is footage of Elgin Baylor performing a similar move in an early-1960s game, possibly before Marčiulionis was born, as well as Julius Erving in a 1974 ABA playoff game, and Archie Clark in a 1972 ABA vs. NBA All-Star Game,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAEPA-_ulPE |title=The Origin of the NBA Eurostep |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl] and was popularized in North America by Manu Ginóbili, an Argentine who arrived in the NBA from the Italian league.  It has since been adopted by many American-born players, among them James Harden, Dwyane Wade and Rajon Rondo, as well as Slovenian point guard Goran Dragić. Noted college coach John Calipari is also known for teaching the move; among his former players who frequently use the move in the NBA are Tyreke Evans, Derrick Rose and John Wall. It has become a popular move in streetball used by many notable blacktop players such as Alazar "The Czar" Moges among others.
