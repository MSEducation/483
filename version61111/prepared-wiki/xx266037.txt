</ref> The Latin text of the Gospel is a representative of the [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulphianus]] recension of the Vulgate, and is considered the most important witness of this recension (other manuscripts are [[Codex Annicensis]] and [[Codex Hubertatus]]).<ref name = Metzger/> It bears a strong textual resemblance to the Codex Hubertanus, although it is written in a smaller hand.<ref name = Scrivener/> The text of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] is very close to the [[Codex Cavensis]]. The [[Books of Kings]], [[Book of Chronicles]], [[Book of Ezra]], and [[Pauline epistles]] (partially) are close textually to the Spanish type of the Vulgate. In [[Book of Genesis]], [[Book of Joshua]], and [[Book of Judges]], the text is close to the [[Codex Amiatinus]].<ref>[tpl]Cite book|first=Samuel|last= Berger|title=Histoire de la Vulgate pendant les premiers siècles du Moyen Age|location=Paris|year=1893|pages=150–151|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/histoiredelavul01berggoog#page/n180/mode/2up |language=fr[/tpl]</ref>
The Codex contains the Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7), a spurious text referring to the trinity, in its usual location (unlike the Codex Cavensis and Codex Toletanus).

==History==

E. A. Lowe dated the manuscript to the eight or ninth century. Formerly it belonged to the Cathedral of Orleans, the family of the Mesmes, then to the National Library of France. The manuscript was examined and described by Samuel Berger. It was collated by John Wordsworth and H. J. White for their edition of the text of the Vulgate. Currently the manuscript is housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (Lat. 9380).
