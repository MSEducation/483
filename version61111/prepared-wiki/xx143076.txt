Sometimes the term "martini" is used to refer to other mostly-hard-liquor cocktails such as Manhattan (cocktail), Cosmopolitan (cocktail), and ad hoc or local concoctions whose only commonality with the drink is the cocktail glass in which they are served. Chefs with a more whimsical bent are even producing dessert "martinis" which are not a drink at all, but are merely served in martini glasses.
Another popular form is the espresso martini, popular in restaurants instead of having dessert. Many variations exist but most involve shaking an espresso shot with the ingredients and served in a chilled martini glass. By shaking a fresh espresso shot it creates a hard layer of crema which is garnished with three coffee beans in the centre.
