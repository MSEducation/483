After the team ended play in 1931, Johnson organized a semi-pro version of the Steam Roller in 1932 to play small-scale local teams. He also managed a minor league version of the Providence Steam Roller in the American Association in the 1940s.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Steam Roller | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=1980 | pages=1–13 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-03-029.pdf | authors=Hogrogian, John[/tpl] Later in life, he became a football historian for the Pro Football Researchers Association and was at one time their oldest member.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rCnbhSRZpgIC | title=Pigskin: The Early Years of Pro Football | first=Robert W. | last=Peterson | isbn=0-19-511913-4 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997[/tpl]
During football season, Johnson rented out several rooms in his house on High Service Avenue in North Providence, to Steam Roller players. His mother also helped by boarding several of the players under her roof. She kept them well-fed until, and did their laundry all for $15 a week. The day after Thanksgiving, while out shopping for groceries for "her boys," Mrs. Johnson was struck and killed by a streetcar.[tpl]cite journal | title=The Steam Roller | journal=Coffin Corner | publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association | volume=2 | issue=3 | year=1980 | pages=1–13 | url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/02-03-029.pdf | authors=Hogrogian, John[/tpl]
