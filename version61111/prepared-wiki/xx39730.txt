[[Brain teaser]]

CATEGORIES: Puzzles

A brain teaser is a form of puzzle that requires thought to solve. It often requires thinking in unconventional ways with given constraints in mind; sometimes it also involves lateral thinking. Logic puzzles and riddles are specific types of brain teasers.
One of the earliest known brain teaser enthusiasts was the Greek mathematician Archimedes.[tpl]cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Editors of Time-Life books, Inc. |title=The Puzzle Master |year=1989 |publisher=Time-Life Books |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |isbn=0-8097-0928-7 |pages=18[/tpl] He devised mathematical problems for his contemporaries to solve.

==Example==

One can argue about the answers of many brain teasers; in the given example with hens, one might claim that all the eggs in the question were laid in the first day, so the answer would be three.

==Intuition==

The difficulty of many brain teasers relies on a certain degree of fallacy in human intuitiveness. This is most common[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl] in brain teasers relating to conditional probability, because the casual human mind tends to consider absolute probability instead. As a result, controversial discussions emerge from such problems, the most famous probably[tpl]weasel-inline|date=January 2014[/tpl] being the Monty Hall problem. Another (simpler) example of such a brain teaser is the Boy or Girl paradox.
