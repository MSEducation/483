==History of the Apostolical Contest==

An apocryphal work in ten books called Historia Certaminis Apostolici ("History of the Apostolical Contest")often referred to as the "Apostolic History of pseudo-Abdias" was traditionally ascribed to an Abdias, assumed to be this bishop of Babylon.[tpl]Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=2[/tpl] It is a major collection of New Testament apocrypha, which tells of the labors and miracles, persecution and deaths of the Apostles, exhibiting a taste for the marvelous that places the narratives in the genre of heroic romances, of which "these stories came at length to form a sort of apostolic cycle", Matthew B. Riddle noted in his Introductory Notice to Apocrypha of the New Testament (1870).Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. VIII
This compilation purports to have been translated from Hebrew into Greek by "Eutropius", a disciple of Abdias, and, in the third century, from Greek into Latin by Julius Africanus, the friend of Origen, or as reported in Legenda Aurea by  his disciple Tropaeus Africanus.The Golden Legend: The Lives of Saints Simon and Jude
Later scholarship determined the book was originally written in Latin, probably around 910 AD, long after the death of the Abdias who served as Bishop of Babylon.[ref]
