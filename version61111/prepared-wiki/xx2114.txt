Cola is a carbonated beverage that originally contained caffeine from the kola nut and cocaine from coca leaves, and was flavored with vanilla and other ingredients. Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste and no longer contain cocaine. It became popular worldwide after pharmacist John Pemberton invented Coca-Cola in 1886.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm |title=Coca Wine |publisher=Cocaine.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29[/tpl] His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the Coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863. Coca-Cola is a major international brand. It usually contains caramel color, caffeine and sweeteners such as sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

==Etymology==

The word cola may have been introduced into mainstream culture by the major producer Coca-Cola,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] as it saw its trademark slipping into common use, like other genericized trademarks. It has tried to maintain the exclusive right to sell products using the "Coca-Cola" name and its diminutive form "Coke", by suggesting the alternative of "cola drink" as a generic name for similar types of carbonated soft drinks.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] The word cola as part of the Coca-Cola trademark may have originated from the kola nuts that were originally used as the source of caffeine.

==Flavorings==

Despite the name, the primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are sugar, citrus oils (from oranges, limes, or lemon fruit peel), cinnamon, vanilla, and an acidic flavorant.[tpl]cite web|author=DeNeefe, Janet |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html |title=The Exotic Romance of Tamarind |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2013-09-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm |title=Cola 2 |publisher=Sparror.cubecinema.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29[/tpl] Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace ingredients to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include nutmeg and a wide variety of ingredients, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Coca-Cola's recipe and several others[tpl]which|date=August 2013[/tpl] are maintained as corporate trade secrets.
A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.[tpl]cite book |editor=M. Ataman Aksoy, John C. Beghin |title=Global Agricultural Trade and Developing Countries |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=0-8213-5863-4 |page=329 |chapter=Sugar Policies: An Opportunity for Change[/tpl] In addition, stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used; "sugar-free" or "diet" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.
Consumers may prefer the taste of soda manufactured with sugar; as in the United States, with imported Mexican Coca-Cola.[ref]

These are marketed under the name Throwback and became "permanent" products on the lineup.[tpl]cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=Pepsi, Frito-Lay capitalize on fond thoughts of the good ol' days|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2011-03-11-1Athrowback11_ST_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=29 September 2011|date=2011-03-11[/tpl]

==Health==

A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.[tpl]cite journal |author=Tina M. Saldana, Olga Basso, Rebecca Darden, and Dale P.
