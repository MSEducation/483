BuyWithMe was a social commerce company that was known as the first competitor to group buying website Groupon.  Launched in Boston and then later based in New York, BuyWithMe allowed consumers to leverage group buying power to get discounts with local merchants online.
BuyWithMe launched May 2009 and was acquired by Gilt Groupe in November 2011, Galen Moore "Gilt Groupe acquires BuyWithMe for undisclosed terms" Boston Business Journal November 2, 2011 http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2011/11/02/gilt-groupe-acquires-buywithme.html It has been absorbed into Gilt Groupe's Gilt City daily deals division. http://www.gilt.com/company/press/gilt-city-subsidiary-gilt-groupe-acquires-assets-buywithmecom

==Business Model==

In a similar manner to Groupon, except that their deals always lasted a week, BuyWithMe introduced at least one new deal every day in each of the local markets it served. The deal was emailed to all local BuyWithMe subscribers, made available on the company's website and distributed through a network of group buying media partnerships (including Boston.com, owned by New York Times). The deal only completed if a minimum number of consumers signed up, therefore assuring the merchant a minimum return.Sam Oches "Coupon Companies Ditch Standard Format with Internet's Help" QSR Magazine August 6, 2009 http://www.qsrmagazine.com/articles/news/story.phtml?id=9104 BuyWithMe was named in the Lead411's 86 Hottest Boston Companies list.Lead411 launches "Hottest Boston Companies" awards
