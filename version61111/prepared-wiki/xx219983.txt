Gold Hill, in Grass Valley, California, was the site of one of the first discoveries of quartz gold[tpl]cite book |pages=124 |title=Mining in the Pacific States of North America |last=Hittell |first=John Shertzer  |year=1861 |publisher=J. Wiley |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-665-16737-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Jj0DAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22quartz+gold%22[/tpl] in California. While quartz gold was also found in other areas of Nevada County, California during the same time, it is this find near Wolf Creek that led to quartz-mining frenzy and subsequent creation of the Gold Country quartz-mining industry. The location is honored as a California Historical Landmark.

==History==

George Knight (sometimes known as McKnight) was a California Gold Rush miner. In October 1850, he was on a Grass Valley hillside when he came across an outcropping of white quartz rock laced with yellow.  He pounded the rock with a cast iron skillet and hammer, then washed out the gold. Searching for more gold in the same spot, he dug down into the outcropping and found a [tpl]convert|4|in|cm[/tpl] gold vein.  His find was announced by another miner, George Crandall (1825–1908), who ran down to Boston Ravine, a small settlement nearby, with the news.[tpl]cite book |title=Eldorado : the California Gold Rush |last=Walker  |first=Dale L. |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-312-87833-8 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2QprmFagCuMC&pg=RA1-PA255&lpg=RA1-PA255&dq=%22george+mcknight%22+quartz |pages=255[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Patricia L. |last=Minch |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The search for George Crandall |url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20080728/NEWS/671953860&parentprofile= |publisher=The Union |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2008-08-18[/tpl] 
Knight named the location Gold Hill and his claim became the Gold Hill Mine. He and friends constructed a crude stamp mill made out of the local forest's pine tree logs and equipped it with metal boots.  The contraption was propelled by Wolf Creek's rushing water.
