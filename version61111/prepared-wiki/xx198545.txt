[[DAMPs]]

CATEGORIES: Immunology

Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) also known as danger-associated molecular pattern molecules, are molecules that can initiate and perpetuate immune response in the noninfectious inflammatory response. (In contrast, Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) initiate and perpetuate the infectious pathogen inflammatory response.)[tpl]cite journal |author=Janeway C |title=Immunogenicity signals 1,2,3 ... and 0 |journal=Immunol. Today |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=283–6 |date=September 1989 |pmid=2590379 |doi=10.1016/0167-5699(89)90081-9 [/tpl] Many DAMPs are nuclear or cytosolic proteins. When released outside the cell or exposed on the surface of the cell following tissue injury, they move from a reducing to an oxidizing milieu, which results in their denaturation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rubartelli A, Lotze MT |title=Inside, outside, upside down: damage-associated molecular-pattern molecules (DAMPs) and redox |journal=Trends Immunol. |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=429–36 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17845865 |doi=10.1016/j.it.2007.08.004 [/tpl] Also, following necrosis (a kind of cell death), tumor DNA is released outside the nucleus, and outside the cell, and becomes a DAMP.[tpl]cite journal |author=Farkas AM, Kilgore TM, Lotze MT |title=Detecting DNA: getting and begetting cancer |journal=Curr Opin Investig Drugs |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=981–6 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18058568 [/tpl] 

==History==

Two papers appearing in the same year presaged the deeper understanding of innate immune reactivity, dictating the subsequent nature of the adaptive immune response. The first [tpl]cite journal |author=Land W, Schneeberger H, Schleibner S, et al. |title=The beneficial effect of human recombinant superoxide dismutase on acute and chronic rejection events in recipients of cadaveric renal transplants |journal=Transplantation |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=211–7 |date=January 1994 |pmid=8310510 |doi=10.1097/00007890-199401001-00010 [/tpl] came from transplant surgeons who conducted a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Administration of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (rh-SOD) in recipients of cadaveric renal allografts demonstrated prolonged patient and graft survival with improvement in both acute and chronic rejection events. They speculated that the effect was related to its antioxidant action on the initial ischemia/reperfusion injury of the renal allograft, thereby reducing the immunogenicity of the allograft and the "grateful dead" or stressed cells. Thus free radical-mediated reperfusion injury-was seen to contribute to the process of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. The second,[tpl]cite journal |author=Matzinger P |title=Tolerance, danger, and the extended family |journal=Annu. Rev. Immunol. |volume=12 |issue= |pages=991–1045 |year=1994 |pmid=8011301 |doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.12.040194.005015 [/tpl]  suggested the possibility that the immune system detected "danger", through a series of what we would now call damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), working in concert with both positive and negative signals derived from other tissues. Thus these two papers together presaged the modern sense of the role of DAMPs and redox reviewed here, important apparently for both plant and animal resistance to pathogens and the response to cellular injury or damage. Although many immunologists have noticed that various "Danger signal" could initiate innate immune responses, the "DAMP" was described by Seong and Matzinger in 2004 for the first time.>[tpl]cite journal |author=Seong S, Matzinger P |title=Hydrophobicity: an ancient damage-associated molecular pattern that initiates innate immune responses|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology  |volume=4 |issue= 6|pages=469–478|year=2004 |pmid=15173835 |doi=10.1038/nri1372[/tpl]

==Examples of DAMPs==

DAMPs vary greatly depending on the type of cell (epithelial or mesenchymal) and injured tissue. Protein DAMPs include intracellular proteins, such as heat-shock proteins [tpl]cite journal |author=Panayi GS, Corrigall VM, Henderson B |title=Stress cytokines: pivotal proteins in immune regulatory networks; Opinion |journal=Curr. Opin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=531–4 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15245751 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2004.05.017 [/tpl] or HMGB1 [tpl]cite journal |author=Scaffidi P, Misteli T, Bianchi ME |title=Release of chromatin protein HMGB1 by necrotic cells triggers inflammation |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=191–5 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12110890 |doi=10.1038/nature00858 [/tpl] (high-mobility group box 1), and proteins derived from the extracellular matrix that are generated following tissue injury, such as hyaluronan fragments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Scheibner KA, Lutz MA, Boodoo S, Fenton MJ, Powell JD, Horton MR |title=Hyaluronan fragments act as an endogenous danger signal by engaging TLR2 |journal=J.

===HMGB1===

The chromatin-associated protein high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a prototypical leaderless secreted protein LSP secreted by hematopoietic cells through a lysosome-mediated pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gardella S, Andrei C, Ferrera D, et al. |title=The nuclear protein HMGB1 is secreted by monocytes via a non-classical, vesicle-mediated secretory pathway |journal=EMBO Rep. |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=995–1001 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12231511 |pmc=1307617 |doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf198 [/tpl] It is a major mediator of endotoxin shock [tpl]cite journal |author=Wang H, Bloom O, Zhang M, et al. |title=HMG-1 as a late mediator of endotoxin lethality in mice |journal=Science |volume=285 |issue=5425 |pages=248–51 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10398600 |doi=10.1126/science.285.5425.248 [/tpl] and acts on several immune cells to trigger inflammatory responses as a DAMP. Known receptors for HMGB1 include TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts). HMGB1 can induce dendritic cell maturation via upregulation of CD80, CD83, CD86 and CD11c, induce production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines in myeloid cells (IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) as well as upregulate expression of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells.

===DNA and RNA===

The presence of DNA anywhere other than the nucleus or mitochondria is perceived as a DAMP and triggers responses mediated by TLR9 and DAI that drive cellular activation and immunoreactivity. Interestingly, some tissues such as the gut are inhibited by DNA in their immune response.  Similarly, damaged RNAs released from UVB-exposed keratinocytes activate TLR3 on intact keratinocytes.  TLR3 activation stimulates TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, which initiate the cutaneous inflammation associated with sunburn.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bernard JJ, Cowing-Zitron C, Nakatsuji T, Muehleisen B, Muto J, Borkowski AW, Martinez L, Greidinger EL, Yu BD, Gallo RL.|title=Ultraviolet radiation damages self noncoding RNA and is detected by TLR3 |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=18 |pages=1286–1290 |year=2012 |doi=10.1038/nm.2861[/tpl]

===S100 Molecules===

S100 is a multigenic family of calcium modulated proteins involved in intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities with a connection to cancer as well as tissue, particularly neuronal, injury.[tpl]cite journal |author=Diederichs S, Bulk E, Steffen B, et al. |title=S100 family members and trypsinogens are predictors of distant metastasis and survival in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=64 |issue=16 |pages=5564–9 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15313892 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2004 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Emberley ED, Murphy LC, Watson PH |title=S100A7 and the progression of breast cancer |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=153–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15217486 |pmc=468668 |doi=10.1186/bcr816 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Emberley ED, Murphy LC, Watson PH |title=S100 proteins and their influence on pro-survival pathways in cancer |journal=Biochem.

===Purine Metabolites adenosine, uric acid===

Nucleotides (such as ATP) and nucleosides (such as adenosine) that have reached the extracellular space can also serve as ‘‘danger’’signals.[tpl]cite journal |author=la Sala A, Ferrari D, Di Virgilio F, Idzko M, Norgauer J, Girolomoni G |title=Alerting and tuning the immune response by extracellular nucleotides |journal=J. Leukoc. Biol. |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=339–43 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12629147 |doi=10.1189/jlb.0802418 [/tpl] ATP and adenosine are released in high concentrations after catastrophic disruption of the cell, as occurs in necrotic cell death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zeh HJ, Lotze MT |title=Addicted to death: invasive cancer and the immune response to unscheduled cell death |journal=J. Immunother. |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15614039 |doi=10.1097/00002371-200501000-00001 [/tpl] The immunobiology of these molecules once released into the extracellular milieu is complex. At lower concentrations, extracellular ATP serves as a chemoattractant for immature DCs as well as a maturation signal to upregulate co-stimulatory molecules. At higher concentrations, ATP blocks the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines.[tpl]cite journal |author=la Sala A, Sebastiani S, Ferrari D, et al. |title=Dendritic cells exposed to extracellular adenosine triphosphate acquire the migratory properties of mature cells and show a reduced capacity to attract type 1 T lymphocytes |journal=Blood |volume=99 |issue=5 |pages=1715–22 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11861288 |doi=10.1182/blood.V99.5.1715 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=la Sala A, Ferrari D, Corinti S, Cavani A, Di Virgilio F, Girolomoni G |title=Extracellular ATP induces a distorted maturation of dendritic cells and inhibits their capacity to initiate Th1 responses |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=166 |issue=3 |pages=1611–7 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11160202 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Haskó G, Kuhel DG, Salzman AL, Szabó C |title=ATP suppression of interleukin-12 and tumour necrosis factor-α release from macrophages |journal=Br.

Uric acid is also an endogenous danger signal released by injured cells [tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature01991 | author = Shi Y., Evans J.
