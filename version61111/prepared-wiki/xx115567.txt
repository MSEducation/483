spiders).
Of all 150 salticid genera known from Australia and the entire Pacific, only Chalcotropis, Donoessus and Panysinus resemble Xenocytaea.

The genus name is a combination of Greek ξένος "strange, foreign" and the salticid genus Cytaea. Indicates that despite the similarity of the two genera in male palpal structure, this group of species does not belong in Cytaea.
