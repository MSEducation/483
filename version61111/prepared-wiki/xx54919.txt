==International career==

===International Debut===

Dravid made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup replacing Vinod Kambli.[tpl]cite news|title=Happy b'day Rahul Dravid|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130110/sports-cricket/gallery/happy-bday-rahul-dravid|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=10 January 2013|page=2[/tpl]  He wasn't particularly impressive with the bat scoring just three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan but took two catches in the match.[tpl]cite web|title=2nd Match, Singer Cup 1995/96, Ind v SL|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/66027.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 April 1996[/tpl]  He followed it up with another failure in the next ODI of the series scoring just 4 runs before getting run out against Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|title=3rd Match, Singer Cup 1995/96, Ind v Pak|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/66028.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=5 April 1996[/tpl]

Dravid managed to hold on to his position in the playing XI in the Third Test despite Manjrekar's return. A hundred against British Universities in the tour game further strengthened Dravid's cause.[tpl]cite web|title=Tour match, India tour of England 1996, Ind v British Universities|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/580531.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl]  Eventually Ajay Jadeja was dropped to accommodate Manjrekar in the team.

====Struggle in ODIs====

In a stark contrast to his test career, Dravid had to struggle a lot to make a mark in the ODIs.[tpl]cite web|title=ODI Retirement?

Dravid accompanied the Indian ODI squad to the tour of Zimbabwe but didn't get a game  despite a good performance in the previous triangular series in South Africa, though he got to play all the games in the following ODI series on the West Indies tour, thanks largely to a good performance in the test series preceding it.

Dravid was recalled to the ODI squad in May 1998 for the Coca-Cola triangular series, but had a poor comeback scoring just 88 runs in 4 games including a 22-ball 5 runs and a 21-ball one run innings, both coming against Bangladesh.[tpl]cite web|title=1st match, Coca-Cola Triangular Series 1998, IND vs BD|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66144.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=5th match, Coca-Cola Triangular Series 1998, IND vs BD|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66148.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]  He was duly dropped from the playing XI for the Finals of the series[tpl]cite web|title=Final, Coca-Cola Triangular Series 1998, IND vs KEN|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/66150.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]  and later dropped from the ODI squad for the Singer Nidahas triangular series in Sri Lanka.
Dravid returned to the ODI fold for the 1998 segment of Sahara Cup in Toronto but struggled with the bat scoring just 32 runs in 4 games,[tpl]cite web|title=Top scorers in Sahara 'Friendship' Cup 1998|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=772;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]  thereby getting himself dropped from the playing XI once again for the last game of the series.[tpl]cite web|title=5th match, Sahara 'Friendship' Cup 1998|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66045.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]  He managed to keep his place intact in the ODI squad and had a decent show against Zimbabwe in a bilateral ODI series.[tpl]cite web|title=Top scorers in India in Zimbabwe ODI series 1998/99|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=773;type=series|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]  He represented India in Wills International Cup but without much success. Dravid accompanied Indian ODI squad to Sharjah for the 1998–99 Coca-Cola Champions Trophy, but didn't play the first 3 games of the round-robin league.

By now, Dravid had been branded as a Test specialist by experts and sports journalists alike.  While he continued to score runs in Test cricket, his poor strike rate in ODIs came under scanner.  He drew criticism for not being able to adjust his style of play to the needs of ODI cricket, his inability to rotate strike and play big strokes, thereby putting pressure on fellow batsmen.[tpl]cite web|title=The misfit who thrived|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/532534.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=13 May 2013|author=Sidharth Monga|date=16 September 2011[/tpl]  That changed in the year 1999.  Dravid worked hard to change his game by increasing his range of strokes and adjusting his batting style to suit the requirement of ODI cricket.
Dravid began his ODI campaign in the new year with a run-a-ball hundred against New Zealand in Taupo,[tpl]cite web|title=1st match, India in New Zealand ODI series 1998/99|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64598.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]  fresh from his twin hundreds in the Hamilton test just a week back.

India won the match to end up as the group runner-up and advanced into the Super Six stage.  Dravid scored 2, 61 & 29 in the three Super Six matches against Australia, Pakistan & New Zealand respectively.  India won against Pakistan but lost the other two games to end up at the bottom of the points table.[tpl]cite web|title=Points Table: ICC World Cup 1999|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/61046.html?view=pointstable|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]  Dravid emerged as the top scorer of the tournament with 461 runs from 8 games at an average of 65.85 and a strike rate of 85.52.[tpl]cite web|title=Top scorers: ICC World Cup 1999|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=787;type=tournament|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 May 2013[/tpl]  Though India failed to qualify for the semi-finals,  Dravid's success at the World Cup established him as the quintessential no. 3 batsman of Indian team in both formats of the game.
Dravid's post-World Cup campaign started on a poor note with just 40 runs coming in 4 games of Aiwa Cup in August 1999. He finally came into his own in the ensuing Singapore Challenge, where he top scored for India, including a hundred in the Finals. He also top scored for India in the DMC Cup including a fifty in the third game. While India lost Singapore Challenge Finals to West Indies, they took their revenge by beating them in the DMC Cup 2-1. By now, Dravid had started to keep wickets on an infrequent basis with India fielding him as a wicket-keeper in 4 out of last 10 ODIs. Dravid failed to make a mark in the LG Cup where he scored 81 runs in 4 games.
Dravid started off his post-World Cup Test cricket season on a positive note with a hundred against New Zealand in the First of a 3-match home series at Mohali in October 1999. Before this inning, Dravid had five test hundreds to his name from 29 tests, all of which came in away tests, this being his first test hundred on Indian soil. Except for this inning, he struggled throughout the rest of the season with just 281 runs in the next 7 tests at a poor average of 20.07 that included a 0-3 whitewash for India in Australia and a 0-2 whitewash against South Africa in a home series. He managed to cross 40 run mark just once in this 7 test span.
Meanwhile, Dravid continued his good run in ODI cricket. He scored 260 runs at an average of 60.00 in the 3-2 series win against New Zealand in November 1999. In the second game at Hyderabad, he scored 153 runs- his career best inning, which included 15 fours and two sixes. He featured in a 331 run partnership with Tendulkar- highest partnership in ODI cricket history. In 1999, Dravid scored 1761 runs in 43 ODIs at an average of 46.34 and a strike rate of 75.16 including 6 hundreds and 8 fifties. This was to be the best year of Dravid's ODI career.
Dravid followed up his previous year's ODI success with moderate success in the 1999–2000 Carlton & United Series and the bilateral series against South Africa and a below par performance in a tri-nation series in Sharjah. Dravid took two wickets in a single over against South Africa in the First ODI of the bilateral series at Kochi. Gary Kirsten became Dravid's first victim in ODI cricket. His bowling figures of 2/43 in 9 overs remained his career best ODI bowling figures. It was also the best bowling figure by any bowler for that particular match.
He was appointed the vice-captain during 2003 World Cup, in which India reached the finals, playing as a wicket-keeper batsman to accommodate an additional batsman, a strategy that worked out well. Dravid was appointed the captain for the Indian team for 2007 World Cup, where India had an unsuccessful campaign.
He then scored 200 not out – his first double century – against Zimbabwe in Delhi, and followed with a second innings of 70 not out to help India win the match. It was the first time in 12 months that he had passed 50 runs. He scored 162 runs in the next Test, getting him 432 runs in the series, with an average of 432 runs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl]

===After 2000===

In the second Test of a three-match series against Australia at Eden Gardens in 2001, Dravid had a partnership with VVS Laxman which led to a comeback victory for India.

His 602-run total in the four-Test series against England also got him the man of the series award.
In 2003–2004 season, Dravid scored three double centuries: one each against New Zealand, Australia and Pakistan. In the first innings of the second Test against Australia at Adelaide, India reached 85–4 in reply to Australia's 556, when Dravid and Laxman made 303 for the fifth wicket.

===2011 Tour of England===

Having regained his form on the tour to West Indies, where he scored a match-winning hundred in Sabina park, Jamaica, Dravid then toured England in what was billed as the series which would decide the World No. 1 ranking in tests. It would later be hailed as one of his greatest series performances by experts.
In the first test at Lord's, in reply to England's 474, Dravid scored an unbeaten 103, his first hundred at the ground where he debuted in 1996. He received scant support from his teammates as India were bowled out for 286 and lost the test.1st Test: England v India at Lord's, Jul 21-25, 2011 | Cricket Scorecard. ESPN Cricinfo. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. The 2nd test at Trentbridge, Nottingham again saw Dravid in brilliant form. Sent out to open the batting in place of an injured Gautam Gambhir, he scored his second successive hundred.

ESPN Cricinfo. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. However, he came back brilliantly in the fourth and final match at The Oval. Again opening the batting in place of Gambhir, he scored an unbeaten 146 out of India's total of 300, carrying his bat through the innings.

==Playing style==

Dravid is known for his technique, and had been one of the best batsmen for the Indian cricket team. In the beginning, he was known as a defensive batsman who should be confined to Test cricket, and was dropped from the ODI squad due to a low strike rate. However in a period of his career, he began consistently scoring runs in ODIs as well, earning him the award of ICC Player of the year award. His nickname of 'The Wall' in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname. Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket at an average of 53.19; this included five double centuries. In one-dayers, he has an average of 39.49, and a strike rate of 71.22. He is one of the few Indians whose Test average is better at away than at home, averaging almost five runs more in foreign pitches.Rahul Dravid- Analysis of Performances at Home and Away. Retrieved 23 November 2010. As of 23 September 2010, Dravid's Test average in abroad is 55.53, and his Test average at home is 50.76; his ODI average in foreign is 37.93[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/28114.html?class=2;home_or_away=2;home_or_away=3;spanmax1=23+Sep+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=allround|title=Rahul Dravid away batting stats in ODI|accessdate=23 November 2010[/tpl] and his ODI average at home is 43.11.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/statistics/Players/PlayerCountries_ODI.asp?PlayerID=2060|title=Rahul Dravid home batting stats in ODI|accessdate=23 November 2010[/tpl] Taking those matches in consideration that were won by India, Dravid averages 66.34 runs in Tests[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/28114.html?class=1;result=1;spanmax1=23+Sep+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=allround|title=Rahul Dravid Test analysis in matches won|accessdate=23 November 2010[/tpl] and 50.69 runs in ODIs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/28114.html?class=2;result=1;spanmax1=23+Sep+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=allround|title=Rahul Dravid ODI analysis in matches won|accessdate=23 November 2010[/tpl]
Dravid's sole Test wicket was of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test match against the West Indies during the 2001–2002 series. While he has no pretensions to being a bowler, Dravid often kept wicket for India in ODIs. Dravid is now a specialist batsman, averaging 63.51 in matches played since 1 January 2000.
Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs: a 318-run partnership with Sourav Ganguly, the first pair to combine for a 300-run partnership, and then a 331-run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar, which is a world record. He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings played since debut before being dismissed for a duck. His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270 respectively. Each of his five double centuries in Tests was a higher score than his previous double century (200*, 217, 222, 233, 270).
Also, Dravid is the current world record holder for the highest percentage of runs scored in matches won under a single captain, where the captain has won more than 20 Tests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/221152.html |title=Cricinfo – The Man Fridays |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] In the 21 Test matches India won under Ganguly's captaincy, Dravid scored at a record average of 102.84 runs; scoring 2571 runs, with nine hundreds, three of them being double-centuries, and ten fifties in 32 innings. He contributed nearly 23% of the total runs scored by India in those 21 matches, which is almost one run out of every four runs the team scored.
He was named one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in 2000. Though primarily a defensive batsman, Dravid scored 50 runs not out in 22 balls (a strike rate of 227.27) against New Zealand in Hyderabad on 15 November 2003, the second fastest 50 among Indian batsmen. Only Ajit Agarkar's 67 runs of 21 balls is faster than that of Dravid.
In 2004, Dravid was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. On 7 September 2004, he was awarded the inaugural Player of the year award and the Test player of the year award by the International Cricket Council (ICC). On 18 March 2006, Dravid played his 100th Test against England in Mumbai.
In 2006, it was announced that he would remain captain of the Indian team up to the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies.
However after the series against England, he stepped down as the Indian captain due to personal reasons. MS Dhoni took over as ODI captain, whereas Anil Kumble replaced him in test matches.
In 2007, he was dropped from the Indian ODI Squad following poor series against Australia. Dravid went back to play for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 218 runs against Mumbai.
In 2008, he made 93 runs in the first innings of the Perth test, the highest score of the match, to help India win and make the series 1–2. However, he was ignored by selectors for the subsequent one-day tri-series.
After a barren run in Test matches in 2008, Dravid came under increasing media pressure to retire or be dropped. In the Second Test against England in Mohali, he scored 136 runs, putting on a triple-century stand with Gautam Gambhir.
After reaching 10,000 test runs milestone, he said,"It's a proud moment for sure. For me, growing up, I dreamt of playing for India. When I look back, I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years. I never had an ambition to do it because I never believed – it is just a reflection of my longevity in the game."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/7320087.stm |title=Dravid reaches Test runs landmark |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]
Dravid is also one of the two batsmen to score 10,000 runs at a single batting position and is the third highest run scorer in Test Cricket, next to Tendulkar and Ponting.

==Controversies==

===Ball-tampering incident===

In January 2004, Dravid was found guilty of ball tampering during an ODI with Zimbabwe. Match referee Clive Lloyd adjudged the application of an energy sweet to the ball as a deliberate offence, although Dravid himself denied this was his intent. Lloyd emphasised that television footage caught Dravid putting a lozenge on the ball during the Zimbabwean innings on Tuesday night at the Gabba. According to the ICC's Code of Conduct, players are not allowed to apply substances to the ball other than sweat and saliva. Dravid was fined half of his match fee.
Indian coach John Wright came out in defence of Dravid, stating that "It was an innocent mistake". Wright argued that Dravid had been trying to apply saliva to the ball when parts of a losenge he had been chewing stuck to the ball; Dravid then tried to wipe it off. ICC regulations prevented Dravid from commenting about the issue, but former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly also stated that Dravid's act was "just an accident".

===Multan declaration===

One of Dravid's most debated decisions was taken in March 2004, when he was standing in as the captain for injured Sourav Ganguly. India's first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 runs with 16 overs remaining on Day 2.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/04/30/stories/2004043000932100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Multan declaration was a mistake: Ganguly | date=30 April 2004[/tpl] Rahul Dravid has had a mixed record when leading India in Tests. India lost the Karachi Test in 2006, giving Pakistan the series 1–0. However the loss could be put down to several Indian batsmen playing badly. In March 2006, India lost the Mumbai Test, giving England its first Test victory in India since 1985, enabling it to draw the series 1–1. The defeat in Mumbai was arguably the result of Dravid's decision to bowl first on a flat dry pitch, which later deteriorated and ended with an Indian collapse in the run chase. Coincidentally, it was Dravid's 100th test match in which the Indians were all out for 100 runs in the second innings. He was criticised by Vijay Mallya for not picking the team with right balance after his then IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore finished seventh out of the eight teams that participated in the 2008 season.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/indveng/content/current/story/241706.html |title=Cricinfo – Dravid regrets top-order failure |publisher=Content-ind.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] After India failed to qualify for the final of the DLF Cup, Dravid, the skipper, was criticised by former all-rounder Ravi Shastri who said that he was not assertive enough and let Greg Chappell make too many decisions.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/25/stories/2006092509681900.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shastri criticises Dravid | date=25 September 2006[/tpl] When asked for a response, Dravid said that Shastri, while a 'fair critic', was 'not privy' to the internal decision-making process of the team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=328034&ssid=88&sid=SPO |title=Pathan's destiny is in his own hands: Dravid |publisher=Zee News |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=20 December 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110524140240/http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=328034&ssid=88&sid=SPO |archivedate = 24 May 2011|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
