A Byzantine–Mongol alliance[ref]

==Diplomatic overtures==

Soon after the Battle of Kose Dag in 1243, the Empire of Trebizond surrendered to the Mongol Empire while the court of Nicaea put its fortresses in order.A. A. Vasiliev History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, p.531 In the early 1250s, the Latin emperor of Constantinople Baldwin II sent an embassy to Mongolia in the person of the knight Baudoin de Hainaut, who, following his return, met in Constantinople with the departing William of Rubruck.Richard, p. 377.
William of Rubruck also noted that he met an envoy of John III Doukas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, at the court of Möngke Khan in circa 1253.

==Alliance under Michael VIII (1263–1282)==

Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, after re-establishing Byzantine Imperial rule, established an alliance with the Mongols,Richard, p. 453. "The sustained attacks by the Sultan Baibars (…) rallied the Occidentals to this alliance the Mongols, to which the Mongols also convinced the Byzantines to adhere." who themselves were highly favourable to Christianity, many of them being Nestorian Christians. 
He signed a treaty in 1263 with the Mongol Khan of the Kipchak (the Golden Horde),Cambridge, p. 304. and he married two of his daughters (conceived through a mistress, a Diplovatatzina) to Mongol kings: Euphrosyne Palaiologina, who married Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, and Maria Palaiologina, who married Abaqa Khan of Ilkhanid Persia.Canal and Runciman, p. 320. 
According to a 1267 letter by Pope Clement IV from Viterbo, Abaqa had agreed to combine forces with his father-in-law Michael VIII to help the Latins in the Holy Land, in preparation for the Eighth Crusade (the second of Louis IX):
In 1265 Berke Khan sent the Golden Horde army under Noghai to Thrace, prompting to force the Byzantine to release the Mamluk envoy and the former Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II. According to Egyptian sources, Michael agreed to send fabrics to the Mongol Khan in Russia. When Michael realized the importance of the Mongols and became an ally of Noghai, he used his help to defend himself against Bulgaria when it tried to attack the Byzantine Empire in 1273 and 1279.Jackson, pp. 202-203. A group of 4,000 Mongol soldiers were dispatched to Constantinople in 1282, just before the death of Michael, to fight against the despot of Thessaly.Jackson, p. 203.Heath and McBride, p. 24.

==Alliance under Andronikos II (1282–1328)==

After 1295, Andronikos II offered Ghazan a marital alliance, in exchange for Mongol help to fight against the Turcomans at the Oriental frontier of the Byzantine Empire. Ghazan accepted the offer and promised to stop the incursions.Luisetto, pp. 144-145, referencing Pachymeres. The death of Ghazan in 1308 was mourned by the Byzantines.Luisetto, p. 145.
This alliance would continue under Ghazan's successor, Oljeitu. In 1305 Ilkhan Oljeitu promised Andronicus II 40,000 men, and in 1308 dispatched 30,000 men to recover many Byzantine towns in Bithynia.Heath and McBride, pp. 24–33. Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a, as well as his successor Uzbek (1312–1341), but relations turned sour at the end of Andonicus's reign and the Mongols mounted raids on Thrace between 1320 to 1324, until the Byzantine port of Vicina Macaria was occupied by the Mongols.

==End of friendly relations==

Under Andronikos III relations seem to have turned even more conflictual. In 1341, the Mongols planned to attack Constantinople, and Andronikos III had to send an embassy to stop the attack.
