</ref> Coventry would continue being [[Collingwood Magpies|Collingwood's]] leading goal kicker during the years 1931–1934, and would win his first and only, [[Copeland Trophy]] in [[1933 VFL season|1933]], where he kicked another 108 goals for the season.
In 1935 Coventry played in his fifth premiership, kicking four goals to get his side across the line. He would, however, miss the 1936 VFL Grand Final due to suspension, where he was found guilty of striking Richmond defender Joe Murdoch. Coventry played the match against the Tigers with a crop of painful boils on his neck, and when Murdoch repeatedly struck his neck, Coventry retaliated and was subsequently suspended for eight matches. It was his first report in 280 appearances for the Magpies. Nevertheless Collingwood went on to win the premiership without their champion full forward.  Coventry retired after the 1937 season, winning his sixth league leading goal kicker award, and his 16th consecutive club leading goal kicker award. Coventry also represented Victoria on 25 occasions for a total of 100 goals.
