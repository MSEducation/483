==Biography==

Borel was born in Saint-Affrique, Aveyron, the son of a Protestant pastor.[tpl]cite book |author=McElroy, Tucker |title=A to Z of Mathematicians |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MiZIWtX9AJUC&pg=PA46 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0921-3 |page=46[/tpl] He studied at the Collège Sainte-Barbe and Lycée Louis-le-Grand before applying to both the École normale supérieure and the École Polytechnique. Although he qualified for both, he chose to attend the latter institution in 1889. That year he won the concours général, an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the agrégation, a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agrégé. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled Sur quelques points de la theory des functions ("On some points in the theory of functions"). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the University of Lille, during which time he published 22 research papers. He returned to the École normale in 1897, and was appointed to the chair of theory of function, which he held until 1941.[tpl]cite book |author=Chang, Sooyoung |title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&pg=PA107 |year=2011 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-4282-29-1 |page=107[/tpl]
In 1901, Borel married 17-year-old Marguerite, the daughter of colleague Paul Émile Appel; she later wrote more than 30 novels under the pseudonym Camille Marbo. Émile Borel died in Paris on 3 February 1956.

==Work==

Along with René-Louis Baire and Henri Lebesgue, Émile Borel was among the pioneers of measure theory and its application to probability theory. The concept of a Borel set is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing thought experiment that entered popular culture under the name infinite monkey theorem or the like.  He also published a series of papers (1921–27) that first defined games of strategy."Émile Borel," Encyclopædia Britannica
In 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity with expository work.

==Political career==

In the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, he was active in politics. In 1922, he founded Paris Institute of Statistics, the oldest French school for statistics. From 1924 to 1936, he was a member of the French National Assembly. In 1925, he was Minister of Marine in the cabinet of fellow mathematician Paul Painlevé. During the Second World War, he was a member of the French Resistance.

and a crater on the Moon, the following mathematical notions are named after him:
 
 
Borel also described a poker model which he coins La Relance in his 1938 book Applications de la théorie des probabilités aux Jeux de Hasard.Émile Borel and Jean Ville. Applications de la théorie des probabilités aux jeux de hasard. Gauthier-Vilars, 1938
Borel was awarded the Resistance Medal in 1950.
