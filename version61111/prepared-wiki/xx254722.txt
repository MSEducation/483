Blackie and the Rodeo King was the third album released by Canadian singer-songwriter Willie P. Bennett and was released as an LP album by Posterity-Woodshed Records in 1979 (PWS-013). 
"Blackie and the Rodeo King" would be the inspiration for the name of the band, Blackie & The Rodeo Kings, something of a Canadian folk/roots supergroup whose first album was a collection of new covers of Willie P. Bennett songs.  
Bennett re-released the album in remastered form on compact disc in 2001 on his own label, Bnatural Music.  Digital remastering was done by Paul Riemens at the same facility the album was originally recorded: Grant Avenue Studios, Hamilton, Ontario.
