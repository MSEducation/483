==Investigations==

===Jimmy Savile===

Immediately after Jimmy Savile's death in October 2011 Jones and his colleague Liz MacKean began an investigation for Newsnight into reports that Savile had been a paedophile. They interviewed one victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told anonymously. The victims alleged abuse at Duncroft approved school in Staines, Stoke Mandeville hospital and the BBC. Jones and MacKean also discovered that Surrey police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile. The programme was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011 but the film was never shown and the BBC broadcast tributes to Savile at Christmas 2011. The decision to pull the Newsnight investigation eventually led to a major crisis in public trust of the BBC. The later Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean had found cogent evidence that Savile was an abuser and that the programme could have exposed Savile in 2011 but a flawed decision was made not to broadcast http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/pollard-report-newsnight-jimmy-savile There was no public mention of the Newsnight investigation into Savile at the time but In early 2012, several newspapers reported that BBC had investigated allegations of sexual abuse immediately after Savile's death, but the report was not broadcast. An article by Miles Goslett in the The Oldie alleged there had been a cover-up by the BBC.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9073142/BBC-buried-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-to-save-its-reputation.html |title= BBC 'buried Savile sex abuse claims to save its reputation' |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |author= Singh, Anita |location= London |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012[/tpl] On 3 October 2012, almost a year after Savile's death, ITV broadcast a documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile,.[tpl]cite news |last= Quinn |first= Ben |title= Jimmy Savile alleged to have abused girls as young as 13 |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/28/jimmy-savile-abused-girls-alleged |accessdate=26 October 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=28 September 2012 |quote= Documentary to air claims by several women that TV presenter assaulted them when they were children ...

The programme included the Duncroft, BBC and Stoke Mandeville allegations as well as other claims of abuse by Savile.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9576863/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-abused-us-at-the-BBC-claim-women.html |title= 'Sir Jimmy Savile abused us at the BBC', claim women |date= 30 September 2012 |newspaper= The Sunday Telegraph |location= London |accessdate=30 September 2012 |author= Adams, Stephen[/tpl]  It was alleged that rumours of Savile's activities had circulated at the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, but no action had been taken. On 16 October 2012 the Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised, and appointed former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith to review the culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there,[tpl]cite news |first= Rowena |last= Mason |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9613014/BBCs-Jimmy-Savile-probe-to-be-led-by-Harold-Shipman-inquiry-judge.html |title= BBC's Jimmy Savile probe to be led by Harold Shipman inquiry judge |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012[/tpl] and Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, to look at why the Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission in December 2011.

Sixteen victims reported being raped by Savile under the age of 16 and four of those had been under the age of ten. Thirteen others reported serious sexual assaults by Savile including four under ten-year-olds. Another ten victims reported being raped by Savile while over the age of sixteen.http://www.hmic.gov.uk/media/review-into-allegations-and-intelligence-material-concerning-jimmy-savile.pdf Although Jones's Savile film was never broadcast by the BBC, in 2013 the London Press Awards awarded their Scoop of the Year prize for the Savile investigation jointly to Jones and MacKean, Miles Goslett who had first put the allegations into print, and Williams-Thomas who had made the Exposure documentary.

===Trafigura===

Jones made a series of films over three years exposing how toxic waste from the oil trader Trafigura came to be illegally dumped in Abidjan in Africa rather than safely disposed of in the Netherlands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm |title=Newsnight - Trafigura knew of waste dangers |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] According to the government of Ivory Coast 16 people died and thousands were poisoned by the waste. The films were made in the face of pressure from Trafigura’s lawyers Carter-Ruck who were attempting to close down press coverage of Trafigura’s role in the scandal. Ultimately Carter-Ruck even attempted to use a super-injunction to stop The Guardian reporting mentions of Trafigura in Parliament. In response to the pressure Jones set up a network of international journalists and investigators to share information on the dumping, informally known as “Team Trafigura”. As David Leigh of The Guardian wrote "This time, the reporters were determined not to be picked off one by one. They included journalists from Norway, the Netherlands and Estonia, and Meirion Jones from BBC Two's Newsnight, which has led the way in doggedly analysing Trafigura's activities."[tpl]cite news|author=David Leigh |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/sep/21/journalists-collaborate-trafigura-scoop |title=Investigative teamwork pays off over Trafigura scoop | Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2009-09-21|accessdate=2013-03-07 |location=London[/tpl] In April 2010 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists gave the Daniel Pearl Award for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting to the members of that team for exposing “how a powerful offshore oil trader tried to cover up the poisoning of 30,000 West Africans”. The six named on the award were Meirion Jones and reporter Liz Mackean from Newsnight, David Leigh from The Guardian, Kjersti Knudsson and Synnove Bakke from NRK in Norway and Jeroen Trommelen from De Volksrant in the Netherlands. In July 2010, Jones and Mackean reported on the final conviction of Trafigura in the Dutch courts for illegally exporting toxic waste to Africa.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10735255 |title=BBC News - Trafigura found guilty of exporting toxic waste |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] The Trafigura row along with the Simon Singh case and others has helped motivate the Libel Reform Campaign which has persuaded the British government to begin reform of the libel laws in 2011.

===Vulture funds===

Since 2007 Jones and Greg Palast have been investigating Vulture fund operations, which attempt to divert into their own pockets, the money given by Western governments to pay off the debts of poor countries. The Vultures buy up the debt cheaply, and then when it is about to be written off, sue for the full value plus interest often in the British courts. These films formed the centrepiece of a campaign backed by Oxfam and the Jubilee Debt Campaign to outlaw this practice through a Debt Relief Bill. The first film in 2007 exposed an American vulture who liked to call himself 'Goldfinger' who was suing Zambia.[tpl]cite news|author=Meirion Jones |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6362783.stm |title=Programmes | Newsnight | 'Vulture funds' threat to developing world |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] It was rebroadcast in the USA and seen by two Congressmen who immediately went to the White House and asked President Bush face-to-face to curb the vulture funds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/2/16/citing_democracy_now_bbc_broadcast_rep |title=Citing Democracy Now!/BBC Broadcast, Rep.

===Nuclear weapons and Israel===

In 2005-6 Meirion Jones made three films with Michael Crick on nuclear weapons and Israel which revealed for the first time how Britain had helped Israel's nuclear weapons programme. Papers obtained through Freedom of Information showed how the UK had secretly exported the heavy water to Israel to start up the Dimona nuclear reactor and had supplied Israel with samples of uranium 235, plutonium and lithium 6.[tpl]cite news|last=Jones |first=Meirion |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4789832.stm |title=Programmes | Newsnight | Secret sale of UK plutonium to Israel |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-10 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] Jones wrote a print version of the revelations which New Statesman ran as their cover story.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Olympics cash for gold medals scandal===

Jones and Anna Adams uncovered evidence of secret payments of nine million dollars from Azerbaijan to a competition called World Series Boxing run by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) which organises boxing at the Olympics. Whistleblowers from inside AIBA/WSB claimed that WSB's chief said the money was in return for a guarantee that Azerbaijani fighters would win two boxing gold medals at the London 2012 Olympics. AIBA and WSB admit they received the money but deny there was any deal to guarantee Azerbaijan gold medals at London. The Ethics Committee of the International Olympic Committee has now asked the BBC for their evidence so they can investigate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-15020658 |title=BBC News - Allegations of deal to fix 2012 Olympic boxing medals |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl] Days later the Daily Mail revealed that the rules at the World Boxing Championships, which AIBA had already controversially moved to Baku, had been switched "to favour Azerbaijan" and give them a better chance of qualifying boxers for the Olympics.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2042457/London-2012-Olympics-MP-calls-IOC-probe-boxing-seedings.html#ixzz1ZXLkSWXx |title=London 2012 Olympics: MP calls for IOC to probe boxing seedings | Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl]
