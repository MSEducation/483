The Improved Load Bearing Equipment or ILBE is a United States Marine Corps program that includes individual load carriage equipment, individual hydration systems (Source One Hydration) and individual water purification.  Since the rucksack was the first part of the program issued to Marines, the ruck is commonly referred to as simply "ILBE". The ILBE ruck was designed to replace the existing ALICE and MOLLE packs. The ILBE is designed by Arc'teryx's Law Enforcement and Armed Forces "LEAF" program and manufactured by [tpl]Not a typo|Propper[/tpl] Inc. The backpack is made from Cordura 725 denier fabric, with MARPAT camouflage pattern printed onto it. The pack is also covered with a PALS grid, for the attachment of smaller modular pouches. It includes a main pack, a detachable assault pack and a 100-ounce (3 liter) water reservoir. The ILBE can hold up to 120 pounds and has room for 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds outside the main pack. Specialized bags for corpsmen and reconnaissance units are also available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice/IndustryInfo/ABPIMay07/LoadCaryEquip/USMCILBE.pdf |title=Advanced Planning Brief for Industry |date=2007-05-10 |format=PDF[/tpl]Gordon Rottman The M16 2011 Page 71 "The Marines used MOLLE until fielding the Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE) in 2005 with three two-magazine pouches and a.."
Because the ILBE was fielded before the creation of the Modular Tactical Vest, the pack does not integrate well, and this stress with body armor can cause discomfort and injury.

In 2011, the Corps finished testing and released a solicitation for prototypes under the name "USMC Pack", outlying design requirements that are similar to improved MOLLE.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=b165840eb67a6adf31d1d517f9421a9f&tab=core&_cview=0|title=Solicitation Number M6785411R3019; USMC Pack|work=Marine Corps Systems Command|publisher=Federal Business Opportunities|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=May 6, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/12/marine-ILBE-pack-replacement-120810w/|title=Corps looks to field 100,000 new packs|first=Dan|last=Lamothe|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=Marine Corps Times|accessdate=May 6, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://soldiersystems.net/2011/04/08/breaking-news-usmc-to-buy-new-pack/|title=Breaking News – USMC to Buy New Pack|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=Soldier Systems Daily|accessdate=May 6, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Your New Pack: Testing Finished for Unpopular ILBE's Replacement|first=James K.|last=Sanborn|publisher=Marine Corps Times|date=May 9, 2011|pages=16|accessdate=May 6, 2011[/tpl]
