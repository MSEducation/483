Vancouver ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=en-ca-Vancouver.ogg|v|æ|ŋ|ˈ|k|uː|v|ər[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|v|æ|n|ˈ|k|uː|v|ər[/tpl]), officially the City of Vancouver, is a coastal seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia, Canada.
The 2011 census recorded 603,502 people in the city, making it the eighth largest Canadian municipality.
Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada; 52% of its residents have a first language other than English.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915022&Geo2=CMA&Code2=933&Data=Count&SearchText=Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= |title=Census 2006 Community Profiles: Vancouver, City and CMA|publisher=Government of Canada |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-10-10[/tpl]

The Greater Vancouver area of around 2.4 million inhabitants is the third most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada.
The City of Vancouver encompasses a land area of about 114 square kilometres, giving it a population density of about 5,249 people per square kilometre (13,590 per square mile). Vancouver is the most densely populated Canadian municipality, and the fourth most densely populated city over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, San Francisco,[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&T=307&SR=1&S=10&O=D |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities) with 5,000-plus population, 2011 and 2006 censuses |accessdate=2012-02-09[/tpl]

and Mexico City.
The original settlement, named Gastown, grew around the Hastings Mill logging sawmill and a nearby tavern, both established in 1867. Enlarging to become the townsite of Granville, with the announcement that the railhead would reach the site it was renamed "Vancouver" and incorporated as a city in 1886. By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and London.
As of 2009, Port Metro Vancouver is the busiest and largest port in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America.[ref]

===Indigenous people===

Archaeological records indicate the presence of Aboriginal people in the Vancouver area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.[ref]

The city is located in the traditional territories of the Squamish, Musqueam, and Tseil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples of the Coast Salish group.
They had villages in various parts of present day Vancouver, such as Stanley Park, False Creek, Kitsilano, Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River.

===Exploration and contact===

The first European to explore the coast of present-day Point Grey and parts of Burrard Inlet was José María Narváez of Spain, in 1791, although one author contends that Francis Drake may have visited the area in 1579.[tpl]cite book|last=Bawlf|first=R. Samuel|year=2003|title=The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake: 1577–1580|publisher=Walker & Company|isbn=978-0-8027-1405-3[/tpl]
The city is named after George Vancouver, who explored the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names.[ref]The name Vancouver itself originates from the Dutch "van Coevorden", denoting somebody from Coevorden, Netherlands.

The explorer and North West Company trader Simon Fraser and his crew were the first known Europeans to set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808, they travelled from the east down the Fraser River, perhaps as far as Point Grey.[tpl]cite web| title = History of City of Vancouver| publisher=Caroun.com| url = http://www.caroun.com/Countries/America/Canada/Vancouver/2-VancouverHistory.html|accessdate =2007-01-17[/tpl]

===Early growth===

The Fraser Gold Rush of 1858 brought over 25,000 men, mainly from California, to nearby New Westminster (founded 14 February 1859) on the Fraser River, on their way to the Fraser Canyon, bypassing what would become Vancouver.[ref][tpl]cite book |last=Hull |first=Raymond |title=Vancouver's Past |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1974 |location=Seattle |coauthors=Soules, Christine; Soules, Gordon |isbn=978-0-295-95364-9[/tpl]

[/ref]
the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McLeery's Farm on the Fraser River, just east of the ancient village of Musqueam in what is now Marpole. A sawmill established at Moodyville (now the City of North Vancouver) in 1863, began the city's long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp, who had begun logging in the Port Alberni area, first attempted to run a mill at Brockton Point, but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of Gore Street. This mill, known as the Hastings Mill, became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s.[ref][tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Chuck |title=The Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopaedia |publisher=Linkman Press |year=1997 |location=Surrey, British Columbia |pages=39–47 |isbn=1-896846-00-9[/tpl]

The settlement which came to be called Gastown grew up quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by "Gassy" Jack Deighton in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gastown.org/history/index.html|title=Welcome to Gastown|date=28 March 2008|publisher=Gastown Business Improvement Society|accessdate=2009-12-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
[/ref]
In 1870, the colonial government surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite, renamed "Granville" in honour of the then-British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Granville. This site, with its natural harbour, was selected in 1884[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology.html |title=Chronology1757–1884[/tpl]
as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to the disappointment of Port Moody, New Westminster and Victoria, all of which had vied to be the railhead. A railway was among the inducements for British Columbia to join the Confederation in 1871, but the Pacific Scandal and arguments over the use of Chinese labour delayed construction until the 1880s.[ref][tpl]cite book |last=Morton |first=James |title=In the Sea of Sterile Mountains: The Chinese in British Columbia |publisher=J.J.

[/ref]

===Incorporation===

The City of Vancouver was incorporated on 6 April 1886, the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived. CPR president William Van Horne arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie, and gave the city its name in honour of George Vancouver. The Great Vancouver Fire on 13 June 1886, razed the entire city. The Vancouver Fire Department was established that year and the city quickly rebuilt. Vancouver's population grew from a settlement of 1,000 people in 1881 to over 20,000 by the turn of the century and 100,000 by 1911.[tpl]cite book| last = Davis| first = Chuck|coauthors = Richard von Kleist|title = Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopaedia|publisher=Linkman Press| year = 1997|location = Surrey, BC| page = 780|isbn = 978-1-896846-00-2[/tpl]
Vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. One of those merchants, Charles Woodward, had opened the first Woodward's store at Abbott and Cordova Streets in 1892 and, along with Spencer's and the Hudson's Bay department stores, formed the core of the city's retail sector for decades.[tpl]cite web|title = Our History: Acquisitions, Retail, Woodward's Stores Limited| publisher=Hudson's Bay Company| url = http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/woodwards.asp| accessdate=2011-06-09[/tpl]
The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR, which fuelled economic activity and led to the rapid development of the new city;[tpl]cite web |title=British Columbia facts - economic history |url=http://www.britishcolumbia.name/facts.htm |accessdate=2011-06-12[/tpl] in fact the CPR was the main real estate owner and housing developer in the city. While some manufacturing did develop, natural resources became the basis for Vancouver's economy. The resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport, where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s.[tpl]cite journal| last = McCandless|first = R.

===Twentieth century===

The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement. The first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks, becoming the movement's first martyr in British Columbia.[tpl]cite book| last = Phillips| first = Paul A.| title = No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia| publisher=BC Federation of Labour/Boag Foundation| year = 1967| location = Vancouver| pages = 39–41 [/tpl] The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada's first general strike in 1918, at the Cumberland coal mines on Vancouver Island.[tpl]cite book| last = Phillips| first = Paul A.| title = No Power Greater: A Century of Labour in British Columbia| publisher=BC Federation of Labour/Boag Foundation| year = 1967| location = Vancouver| pages = 71–74 [/tpl] Following a lull in the 1920s, the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province.[tpl]cite journal| last = Manley| first = John|title = Canadian Communists, Revolutionary Unionism, and the 'Third Period': The Workers' Unity League,| journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, New Series| volume = 5| pages = 167–194| year = 1994| url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1994/v5/n1/031078ar.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Brown| first = Lorne| title = When Freedom was Lost: The Unemployed, the Agitator, and the State| publisher=Black Rose Books| year = 1987| location = Montreal| isbn = 978-0-920057-77-3[/tpl] After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting, the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the On-to-Ottawa Trek, but their protest was put down by force.

Other social movements, such as the first-wave feminist, moral reform, and temperance movements were also instrumental in Vancouver's development. Mary Ellen Smith, a Vancouver suffragist and prohibitionist, became the first woman elected to a provincial legislature in Canada in 1918.[tpl]cite book| last = Robin| first = Martin| title = The Rush for Spoils: The Company Province,| publisher=McClelland and Stewart| year = 1972| location = Toronto| page = 172| isbn = 978-0-7710-7675-6[/tpl] Alcohol prohibition began in the First World War and lasted until 1921, when the provincial government established control over alcohol sales, a practice still in place today.[tpl]cite book|last = Robin| first = Martin| title = The Rush for Spoils: The Company Province,| publisher=McClelland and Stewart| year = 1972| location = Toronto| pages = 187–188| isbn = 978-0-7710-7675-6[/tpl] Canada's first drug law came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal Minister of Labour and future Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. King was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the Asiatic Exclusion League led a rampage through Chinatown and Japantown. Two of the claimants were opium manufacturers, and after further investigation, King found that white women were reportedly frequenting opium dens as well as Chinese men. A federal law banning the manufacture, sale, and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations.[tpl]cite journal| author=Catherine Carstairs|title = 'Hop Heads' and 'Hypes':Drug Use, Regulation and Resistance in Canada,|publisher=University of Toronto|year = 2000| url =http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ53757.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate =2011-06-09[/tpl] These riots, and the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League, also act as signs of a growing fear and mistrust towards the Japanese living in Vancouver and throughout B.C. These fears were exacerbated by the attack on Pearl Harbor leading to the eventual internment or deportation of all Japanese-Canadians living in the city and the province.[tpl]cite book|last=Roy|first=Patricia E.|title=Mutual Hostages: Canadians and Japanese during the Second World War|date=1990|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=0-8020-5774-8|page=103[/tpl] After the war, these Japanese-Canadian men and women were not allowed to return to cities like Vancouver causing areas, like the aforementioned Japantown, to cease to be ethnically Japanese areas as the communities never revived.[tpl]cite book|last=La Violette|first=Forrest E.|title=The Canadian Japanese and World War II|date=1948|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|page=v[/tpl] 
Amalgamation with Point Grey and South Vancouver gave the city its final boundaries not long before it became the third-largest metropolis in the country. As of 1 January 1929, the population of the enlarged Vancouver was 228,193.[tpl]cite book| last = Francis| first = Daniel| title = L.D.:Mayor Louis Taylor and the Rise of Vancouver| publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press| year = 2004| location = Vancouver| page = 135| isbn = 978-1-55152-156-5[/tpl]

==Geography==

Located on the Burrard Peninsula, Vancouver lies between Burrard Inlet to the north and the Fraser River to the south. The Strait of Georgia, to the west, is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by Vancouver Island. The city has an area of [tpl]convert|114|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], including both flat and hilly ground, and is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC−8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl][/ref]
Until the city's naming in 1885, "Vancouver" referred to Vancouver Island, and it remains a common misconception that the city is located on the island.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://1canada.ca/?p=1159|title=Vancouver Is Not On Vancouver Island[/tpl]
[/ref]
The island and the city are both named after Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver (as is the city of Vancouver, Washington in the United States).
Vancouver has one of the largest urban parks in North America, Stanley Park, which covers [tpl]convert|404.9|ha|acre|abbr=off[/tpl]. The North Shore Mountains dominate the cityscape, and on a clear day, scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano Mount Baker in the state of Washington to the southeast, Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest, and Bowen Island to the northwest.

===Ecology===

The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally temperate rain forest, consisting of conifers with scattered pockets of maple and alder, and large areas of swampland (even in upland areas, due to poor drainage).
The conifers were a typical coastal British Columbia mix of Douglas fir, Western red cedar and Western Hemlock.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
[/ref]
The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the British Columbia Coast. Only in Elliott Bay, Seattle did the size of trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the Gastown area, where the first logging occurred, and on the southern slopes of False Creek and English Bay, especially around Jericho Beach. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s, and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.
Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the Pacific. Examples include the monkey puzzle tree, the Japanese Maple, and various flowering exotics, such as magnolias, azaleas, and rhododendrons. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native Douglas Maple can also attain a tremendous size. Many of the city's streets are lined with flowering varieties of Japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year, an occasion celebrated by the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut, horse chestnut and other decorative shade trees.

===Climate===

Vancouver is one of Canada's warmest cities.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/winners/categorydata_e.html?SelectedCategory=7&submit=Submit | title = Weather Winners - Warmest Year Round | publisher = Environment Canada | accessdate = 2013-02-23[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Vancouver's climate is temperate by Canadian standards and is usually classified as Oceanic or Marine west coast, which under the Köppen climate classification system would be Cfb. However, during summer months the inland temperatures are significantly higher, causing Vancouver to have the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas. The summer months are typically dry, with an average of only one in five days during July and August receiving precipitation. In contrast, precipitation falls during nearly half the days from November through March.
Vancouver is also one of the wettest Canadian cities; however, precipitation varies throughout the metropolitan area. Annual precipitation as measured at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond averages [tpl]convert|1,189|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], compared with [tpl]convert|1588|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in the downtown area and [tpl]convert|2044|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in North Vancouver.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=888&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VANCOUVER&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12|title=Station Results | Canada's National Climate Archive |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=820&lang=e&dCode=0&StationName=VANCOUVER&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12 |title=Station Results | Canada's National Climate Archive |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-27[/tpl]  The daily maximum averages [tpl]convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] in July and August, with highs rarely reaching [tpl]convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl].

On average, snow falls on eleven days per year, with three days receiving [tpl]convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] or more. Average yearly snowfall is [tpl]convert|38.1|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] but typically does not remain on the ground for long.
Winters in Greater Vancouver are the fourth mildest of Canadian cities after nearby Victoria, Nanaimo and Duncan, all on Vancouver Island.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
[/ref]
Vancouver's growing season averages 237 days, from March 18 until November 10. Vancouver's 2000 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone ranges from 8A in North Vancouver, to 7A at the UofBC, to 6B Downtown and at the Vancouver Int'l Airport.

===Urban planning===

As of 2011, Vancouver is the most densely populated city in Canada. Urban planning in Vancouver is characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres, as an alternative to sprawl.[tpl]cite web|title = Vancouverism| publisher=Canadian Architect| url = http://www.canadianarchitect.com/issues/ISArticle.asp?aid=1000205807&issue=08012006#|author=Julie Bogdanowicz|date=August 2006|accessdate=2011-06-09[/tpl] As part of the larger Metro Vancouver region, it is influenced by the policy direction of livability as illustrated in the Livable Region Strategic Plan.
Vancouver has been ranked one of the most livable cities in the world for more than a decade.

===Architecture===

The Vancouver Art Gallery is housed downtown in the neoclassical former courthouse built in 1906. The courthouse building was designed by Francis Rattenbury, who also designed the British Columbia Parliament Buildings and the Empress Hotel in Victoria, and the lavishly decorated second Hotel Vancouver.[tpl]cite web|last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/archives_rattenbury.htm|title = Rattenbury|work=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver|accessdate =2006-11-23[/tpl]
The 556-room Hotel Vancouver, opened in 1939 and the third by that name, is across the street with its copper roof. The Gothic-style Christ Church Cathedral, across from the hotel, opened in 1894 and was declared a heritage building in 1976.
There are several modern buildings in the downtown area, including the Harbour Centre, the Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as Robson Square (designed by Arthur Erickson) and the Vancouver Library Square (designed by Moshe Safdie), reminiscent of the Colosseum in Rome, and the recently completed Woodward's building Redevelopment (designed by Gregory Henriquez).
The original BC Hydro headquarters building (designed by Ron Thom and Ned Pratt) at Nelson and Burrard Streets is a modernist high-rise, now converted into the Electra condominia.The Electra[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl], at vancouver.ca Also notable is the "concrete waffle" of the MacMillan Bloedel building on the north-east corner of the Georgia and Thurlow intersection.
A prominent addition to the city's landscape is the giant tent-frame Canada Place, the former Canada Pavilion from the 1986 World Exposition, which includes part of the Convention Centre, the Pan-Pacific Hotel, and a cruise ship terminal. Two modern buildings that define the southern skyline away from the downtown area are City Hall and the Centennial Pavilion of Vancouver General Hospital, both designed by Townley and Matheson in 1936 and 1958 respectively.[tpl]cite web|url=http://memorybc.ca/townley-matheson-and-partners;isaar|title=Townley, Matheson and Partners|publisher=Archives Association of British Columbia|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-30[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last = Kalman| first = Harold| title = Exploring Vancouver: Ten Tours of the City and its Buildings| publisher=University of British Columbia Press| year = 1974| location = Vancouver| pages = 160–161| isbn = 978-0-7748-0028-0[/tpl]
A collection of Edwardian buildings in the city's old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest commercial buildings in the British Empire. These were, in succession, the Carter-Cotton Building (former home of The Vancouver Province newspaper), the Dominion Building (1907) and the Sun Tower (1911), the former two at Cambie and Hastings Streets and the latter at Beatty and Pender Streets.

==Demographics==

The 2011 census recorded more than 603,000 people in the city, making it the eighth largest among Canadian cities. More specifically, Vancouver is the fourth largest in Western Canada after Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg. The metropolitan area referred to as Greater Vancouver, with more than 2.4 million residents, is the third most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada. The larger Lower Mainland-Southwest economic region (which includes also the Squamish-Lillooet, Fraser Valley, and Sunshine Coast Regional District) has a population of over 2.93 million.[ref][tpl]cite web |title=Canada 2011 Census Lower Mainland Economic Region |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=ER&Code1=5920&Geo2=CD&Code2=5915&Data=Count&SearchText=greater%20vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |accessdate=2012-02-19[/tpl]

==Economy==

With its location on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada's transcontinental highway and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres. Port Metro Vancouver, Canada's largest and most diversified port, does more than C$172 billion in trade with over 160 different trading economies annually. Port activities generate $9.7 billion in gross domestic product and $20.3 billion in economic output.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portmetrovancouver.com/about/factsandstats.aspx |title=Port Metro Vancouver |publisher=Port Metro Vancouver |date=2013-06-04 |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl] Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies.

Each year over a million people pass through Vancouver on cruise ship vacations, often bound for Alaska.

Since the 1990s development of high-rise condominia in the downtown peninsula has been financed, in part, by an inflow of capital from Hong Kong immigrants due to the former colony's 1997 handover to China.[tpl]cite web| author= Bhatty, Ayesha| title = Canada prepares for an Asian future|publisher=BBC News| date = 25 May 2012| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-18149316|accessdate =2012-05-29[/tpl] Such development has clustered in the Yaletown and Coal Harbour districts and around many of the SkyTrain stations to the east of the downtown. The city's selection to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics has also been a major influence on economic development. Concern was expressed that Vancouver's increasing homelessness problem may be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single room occupancy hotels, which house many of the city's lowest income residents, converted their properties in order to attract higher income residents and tourists.[tpl]cite news| title = Homelessness could triple by 2010: report|publisher=CBC News|date = 21 September 2006|url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/09/21/bc-pivot-housing.html|accessdate =2010-01-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Another significant international event held in Vancouver, the 1986 World Exposition, received over 20 million visitors and added $3.7 billion to the Canadian economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002692|title=Expo 86|accessdate=2012-09-09|author=O'Leary, Kim Patrick|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia (Historica-Dominion)|year=2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Some still-standing Vancouver landmarks, including the SkyTrain public transit system and Canada Place, were built as part of the exposition.

==Government==

Vancouver, unlike other British Columbia municipalities, is incorporated under the Vancouver Charter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/vanch_00|title=Vancouver Charter|publisher=Queen's Printer (British Columbia)|date= 18 November 2009|accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] The legislation, passed in 1953, supersedes the Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921 and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under BC's Municipalities Act.
The civic government has been dominated by the centre-right Non-Partisan Association (NPA) since World War II, albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008. The NPA fractured over the issue of drug policy in 2002, facilitating a landslide victory for the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) on a harm reduction platform. Subsequently, North America's only legal safe injection site was opened for the significant number of intravenous heroin users in the city.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15130282|title=Vancouver Insite drug-injection facility can stay open|publisher=BBC News|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl]
Vancouver is governed by the eleven-member Vancouver City Council, a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Park Board, all of whom serve three-year terms. Unusually for a city of Vancouver's size, all municipal elections are on an at-large basis. Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along conservative or liberal lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along left-wing lines.[tpl]cite journal|author=Andrea Barbara Smith| title = The Origins of the NPA: A Study in Vancouver Politics| version = MA thesis| publisher=University of British Columbia| year = 1981[/tpl] This was reaffirmed with the results of the 2005 provincial election and the 2006 federal election.
Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of rapid transit as opposed to a freeway system, a harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use, and a general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the political spectrum in Vancouver.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In the 2008 Municipal Election campaign, NPA incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in a close vote, which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. Gregor Robertson, a former MLA for Vancouver-Fairview and head of Happy Planet, was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver, the other main contender. Vision Vancouver candidate Gregor Robertson defeated Ladner by a considerable margin, nearing 20,000 votes. The balance of power was significantly shifted to Vision Vancouver, which held seven of the 10 spots for councillor. Of the remaining three, COPE received two and the NPA one. For park commissioner, four spots went to Vision Vancouver, one to the Green Party, one to COPE, and one to NPA. For school trustee, there were four Vision Vancouver seats, three COPE seats, and two NPA seats.

===Regional government===

Vancouver is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, a regional government. In total there are 22 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation comprising Metro Vancouver,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metrovancouver.org/about/Pages/default.aspx|title=Who is Metro Vancouver|publisher=Metro Vancouver|accessdate=2012-08-09[/tpl] the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby.

===Provincial and federal representation===

In the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Vancouver is represented by 11 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). As of January 2012, there are six seats held by the BC Liberal Party and five by the BC New Democratic Party.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/mla/MLALookup/LocIndex.asp?Community=V |title= MLA Finder |accessdate=2012-01-30 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |date=21 July 2009 [/tpl]
In the House of Commons of Canada, Vancouver is represented by five Members of Parliament. In the most recent 2011 Federal Election, the NDP held on to two seats (Vancouver East and Vancouver Kingsway) while the Liberals retained two (Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver Centre), their only seats in BC. The Conservatives broke through by winning Vancouver South, their first win in the city since 1988.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In the 2004 federal elections, the Liberal Party of Canada won four seats and the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) one. In the 2006 federal elections, all the same Members of Parliament were re-elected. However, on 6 February 2006, David Emerson of Vancouver Kingsway defected to the Conservative Party, giving the Conservatives one seat in Vancouver. In the 2008 federal election, the NDP took the Vancouver Kingsway seat vacated by Emerson, giving the NDP two seats to the Liberals' three.[tpl]cite web |author=Beers, David| url=http://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/Federal-Politics/2008/10/15/KingswayRookie/index.html?commentsfilter=1|title= In Vancouver-Kingsway, an NDP rookie replaces Emerson |accessdate=2008-08-02 |work=The Tyee |date=15 October 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canadavotes/ridings/|title= Canada Votes 2008: Results, Ridings & Candidates |accessdate=2008-08-02 |publisher=CBC News |date=7 November 2008 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Vancouver's streetcar system began on 28 June 1890, and ran from the (first) Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue (now Main Street and Kingsway). Less than a year later, the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada's first interurban line between the two cities and beyond to Chilliwack, with another line, the Lulu Island Railroad, from the Granville Street Bridge to Steveston via Kerrisdale, which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop.[tpl]cite web|last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology2.html| title = 1885–1891|work=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver| accessdate =2006-11-23[/tpl] The British Columbia Electric Railway (BCER) became the company that operated the urban and interurban rail system, until 1958 when its last vestiges were dismantled in favour of "trackless" trolley and gasoline/diesel buses;[tpl]cite web|last = Davis| first = Chuck| url = http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1958.htm| title = 1958|work=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver| accessdate =2006-11-14[/tpl] in that same year the BCER became the core of the newly created, publicly owned BC Hydro.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Vancouver currently has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America, after San Francisco.[tpl]cite web|last = Snider| first = Drew| url = http://www.masstransitmag.com/article/10221148/light-rail-vs-trolley-bus| title = Light Rail vs. Trolley Bus|work=Masstransitmag.com| date =1 June 2007| accessdate =2012-05-30[/tpl]

This is, in part, the result of a push by city planners for a solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. Transportation demand management policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers.
TransLink is responsible for roads and public transportation within Metro Vancouver. It provides a bus service, including the B-Line rapid bus service, a foot passenger and bicycle ferry service (known as SeaBus), an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain, and West Coast Express commuter rail.
