[[Jewish communities of Portugal]]

CATEGORIES: Jews and Judaism in Portugal

The roots of Portuguese Jewry lay much prior to the forging of the Portuguese kingdom. When Afonso I of Portugal obtained recognition of his independent kingdom, in 1143, Jews had lived in the Iberian Peninsula for at least one millennium.STEINHARDT, Inácio - Raízes dos judeus em Portugal: entre Godos e Sarracenos. S.l.: Nova Vega, 2012 Jews differed from other people since they always considered themselves a nation in exile, whose millennial longing was to return to their land. Nurturing no territorial ambitions wherever they found asylum, Jews solely contributed to the prosperity of their host countries which ensured a good reception.
Nevertheless, there were times when Jews were not welcome. With the Edict of expulsion of the jews by Manuel I (1496) and the official establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition by John III (1536) came a period of intolerance and prejudice that lasted for several centuries and led to the almost complete extermination of Judaism and the Jews in Portugal.TÁVARES, Maria José Pimenta Ferro -  Judaísmo e Inquisição: Estudos. Lisboa: Presença, 1987 It wasn’t until the twentieth century that organized Jewish communities settled again in Portugal.
