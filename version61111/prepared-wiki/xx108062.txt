==History==

===Historic brewing company===

Mitchells & Butlers Brewery was formed by the merger of two breweries in 1898.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mbplc.com/index.asp?pageid=16 |title=Our history |publisher=Mitchells & Butlers |accessdate=2008-03-26[/tpl] The company merged with Bass in 1961. With the brand currently under ownership of Coors Brewers, the brewery closed in 2002 with production switched to Burton upon Trent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.quaffale.org.uk/php/brewery/474 |title=Brewery at Quaffle |author= |publisher=Directory of Real Ale Breweries |date= |accessdate=2008-10-03[/tpl] Their most famous beer was Brew XI (using Roman numerals, and so pronounced Brew Eleven), advertised with the slogan "for the men of the Midlands". It is now brewed under licence for Coors by Brains of Cardiff.

===Bass===

Bass plc, based in Birmingham, transformed into separate brewing and retail divisions following the Beer Orders of 1989 and then proceeded to build a large hotel portfolio alongside its bingo, betting and electronic leisure interests. In the late 1990s the latter interests were sold. On 21 July 1995, Bass bought 78 Harvester restaurants for £165 million from the Forte Group.

===Six Continents===

In 2000, Bass also divested its brewing arm and rebranded itself Six Continents before another split in April 2003 into two separate companies, with the hotel assets forming InterContinental Hotels Group and the Mitchells & Butlers name brought back for the pubs and restaurants company. In March 2003, Six Continents fought off a proposed £5.5 billion takeover by Hugh Osmond (Punch Taverns).[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2842249.stm |title=Business | Six Continents wins £5.5bn bid battle |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-03-13 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
