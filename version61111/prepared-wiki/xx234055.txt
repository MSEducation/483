==Lithuania Academy of Music==

 
 "Music brings people of different cultures together- there is a bond and understanding that develops among musicians and that's very important, especially in maintaining world peace," Maxey said.

Since 1995, she has established a scholarship fundhttp://lmta.lt/english/index.php?a=13&b=62&c=0 at the Lithuanian Academy of Music as well as an exchange program for students and professors between the Academy and various U.S. institutions. Lithuania was the first country to declare its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 but because it had remained isolated from contact with other nations, the country's music professionals had not necessarily experienced the advancements of the percussion world. Her contributions to the Academy include updating the percussion curriculum, introducing new developments in percussion techniques and facilitating exchanges with guest clinicians as "cultural ambassadors" of jazz and percussion to join her in teaching. Within the last decade, the Academy has become one of the leaders in percussion studies in Eastern Europe.
