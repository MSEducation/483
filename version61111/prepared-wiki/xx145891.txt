"Girlfriend" is a single released by Billie in 1998, from her debut album Honey to the B. It reached No. 1 in the UK, making her the youngest and first female solo singer to reach the top spot with her first two singles. A radio edit was released for the single which differs significantly from the Album Version. The Australian single has become one of Billie's rarest CD Singles. The cover for the Australian single differs slightly, as on the UK cover it says "Includes Tin Tin Out Mix & Exlusive Track" while on the Australian cover it says "Includes Because We Want To". The "Girlfriend / She Wants You" was the second single released from the Japanese edition, released almost a whole year after the previous single, Because We Want To was released.
On the American tracklisting for Honey To The B, the radio mix replaces the original album version.
The B-Side "Love Groove" was included on Billie's debut album, Honey To The B.
