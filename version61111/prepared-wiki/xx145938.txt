Gurnard's Head ([tpl]lang-kw|Ynyal[/tpl], meaning desolate one) ([tpl]gbmapping|SW432386[/tpl]) is a prominent headland on the north coast of the Penwith peninsula in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.  It is near the hamlet of Treen in the parish of Zennor, one mile to the west of Zennor Head.
The name is supposed to reflect the fact that the rocky peninsula resembles the head of the gurnard fish.
The headland is the site of an Iron Age promontory fort known as Trereen Dinas.Craig Weatherhill Cornovia: Ancient Sites of Cornwall & Scilly (Alison Hodge 1985; Halsgrove 1997, 2000)
Almost entirely owned by the National Trust, the headland is also part of the Aire Point to Carrick Du SSSI.
