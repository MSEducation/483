[[Wayne deck]]

CATEGORIES: Broadcast engineering

Wayne deck is a term used by video engineers to describe a backup program video record deck.
A Wayne deck is dedicated to recording the on-air program in addition to the standard program record decks installed.  Long tapes (often DVCAM 184min) are run in the Wayne deck to avoid frequent tape changes.
The term has become standard among event and corporate video engineers since 2001.   It is named after a video engineer Wayne Stockton based in Phoenix, Arizona.  Due to an undetected audio board failure in a Sony Betacam SP recorder, Wayne unfortunately recorded the video without any audio, rendering the program tape useless.  Event production companies started adding an extra video record deck in addition to the ones ordered by the clients as a safety record.
