==Submissions==

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Azerbaijan for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.
Azerbaijan was first invited by AMPAS to submit a film in the Best Foreign Language Film category in the summer of 2006,http://mimiatthemovies.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html and they submitted for the first time in fall of 2007.
Azerbaijan's first Oscar submission was "Caucasia" by Farid Gumbatov- the story of an old woman leaving her war-torn Caucasian homeland for Russia, aboard a train. The following year, the Azerbaijanis sent "Fortress", a drama about a film crew making a movie in an isolated mountain town famous for its ancient fortress, and what happens when the town is threatened by a modern-day foreign invasion. Neither film made much of an impact on the international film festival circuit, and neither film managed to get an Oscar nomination.
