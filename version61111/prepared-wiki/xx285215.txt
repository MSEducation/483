The Oresharski Government is the eighty-ninth and current cabinet of Bulgaria which took office on 29 May 2013. The government, led by Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski, is one of technocrats created following the 2013 election.

==Formation==

After President Rosen Plevneliev invited the Bulgarian Socialist Party to form a government, the BSP nominated Plamen Oresharski to head the government and was joined by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. The Council of Ministers was approved by the 120 members of the BSP and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, while GERB's 97 MPs voted against the government and Ataka's 23 MPs were absent from the session.[tpl]cite news|title=2nd LD Writethru: Bulgarian parliament elects new government|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2013-05-29/content_9172065.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=China Daily|date=29 May 2013[/tpl] Outside support to the Oresharski government is also given by nationalist party Ataka.[tpl]cite news|title=Mass rallies grip Bulgarian politics|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/mass-rallies-grip-bulgarian-politics-20131116145545504800.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Aljazeera|date=16 November 2013[/tpl]

==Vote of confidence==

The government survived three vote of confidences as of early 2014. The third vote was tabled by the opposition due to alleged mismanaging of refugees from the Syrian civil war and a failure to curb crime. Out of 217 voting MPs, the governing coalition voted to support the administration with 116 votes.[tpl]cite news|title=Bulgaria PM survives third no-confidence vote|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/bulgaria-pm-survives-third-no-confidence-vote-201421283943314886.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Aljazeera|date=12 February 2014[/tpl]
