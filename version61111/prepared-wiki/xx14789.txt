The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an intergovernmental organisation, located in The Hague, Netherlands.
The organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their destruction. The verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by member states and on-site inspections.
The organisation was awarded the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize because it had, with the Chemical Weapons Convention, "defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law" according to Thorbjørn Jagland, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24490925|title=Syria chemical weapons monitors win Nobel Peace Prize|date=2013-10-11|accessdate=2013-10-12|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]

==Organisational structure==

The activities of the OPCW and its core organisational structure are described in the Chemical Weapons Convention (whose members are all in OPCW). The principal body is the conference of states parties, which normally is convened yearly, and in which all countries participate and have equal voting rights. Countries are generally represented in the Conference by a permanent representative to the organisation, which in most cases is also the ambassador to the Netherlands.  The conference decides on all main topics regarding the organisation (for example, taking retaliation measures) and the convention (approving guidelines, imposing retaliating measures against members).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/treaties-and-regimes/organization-for-the-prohibition-of-chemical-weapons/|work=Nuclear Threat Initiative|title=Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)|accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl]
The Executive Council is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 States Parties, which are appointed by the Conference on a 2-year term. The Council amongst others oversees the budget and cooperates with the General Secretariat on all matters related to the convention.
The Technical Secretariat applies most of the activities mandated by the Council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation work. The main activities of the OPCW are performed by the verification and the inspection division.
All States Parties make contributions to the OPCW budget, based on a modified UN scale of assessments.http://www.nti.org

==Inspections==

===Chemical weapons destruction facilities===

At all operational chemical weapons destruction facilities (as of August 2010 only in Russia and the United States), 24/7 inspections by the OPCW take place on site to verify the success of the destruction as well as the amounts of weapons being destroyed.Destruction of Chemical Weapons and Its Verification Pursuant to Article IV. CWC, Verification Annex In view of the hazardous environment in which the inspections take place, they are generally performed by evaluation via CCTV-systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=3923|title=List of new inspection equipment and revised specifications for approved inspection equipment|publisher=OPCW|accessdate=1 November 2010[/tpl]

===Industry inspections===

Inspections are designed to verify compliance of States Parties with the requirements imposed on production and use of scheduled chemicals and to verify that industrial activities of member states have been correctly declared according to the obligation set by the CWC. The intensity and frequency of the inspections is dependent on the type of chemical produced (in descending order: Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3 or DOC, see Scheduled Chemicals),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/cwco/index.html|title=Australia's National Authority for the Chemical Weapons Convention|accessdate=31 March 2011|work=Australian Government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade[/tpl] but is regardless of the standing of the member state.
For Schedule 1 and 2 facilities, a mass balance is prepared to identify whether all produced chemicals can be accounted for and whether the amounts are consistent with the declarations made by member states.Verification Annex, part VI,VII, VIII and IX of the Chemical Weapons Convention. OPCW Furthermore, at Schedule 2 and 3 facilities clues are investigated whether, contrary to the declaration and to the rules in the convention, Schedule 1 chemicals are produced. At Schedule 3 and DOC, the main aim is to check the declaration and to verify the absence of Schedule 2 and Schedule 1 production units. The time limit Schedule 2 inspections is 96 hours while Schedule 3 and DOC inspections can take a maximum of 24 hours. There is no time limit on Schedule 1 inspections.[tpl]cite web|title=An inspector calls!

===Challenge inspections and investigations of alleged use===

In case of allegation of use of chemical weapons or the prohibited production, a fact finding inspection can be employed according to the convention. None of those activities have taken place, although the OPCW contributed to investigations of alleged use of Chemical Weapons in Syria as part of a United Nations mission. The OPCW only undertakes these inspections on request of another member state, after verification of the presented proof. To avoid misuse, a majority of three quarters can block a challenge inspection request.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/cwcglance|work=Armscontrol.org|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) at a Glance|author=Tom Z. Collina[/tpl] Furthermore, the OPCW can only be involved after bilateral diplomatic solutions have failed.

==Relation with the United Nations==

The organisation is not an agency of the United Nations, but cooperates both on policy and practical issues. On 7 September 2000 the OPCW and the United Nations signed a cooperation agreement outlining how they were to coordinate their activities.[tpl]UN document |docid=A-RES-55-283 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=55 |accessdate=21 August 2007[/tpl] The inspectors furthermore travel on United Nations Laissez-Passer in which a sticker is placed explaining their position, and privileges and immunities.OPCW, The Legal Texts TMC Asser Press, p336 The United Nations Regional Groups also operate at the OPCW to govern the rotations on the Executive Council and provide informal discussion platform.

==Membership==

All 190 parties to the Chemical Weapons convention are automatically members of the OPCW.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/member-states/ |title=OPCW Member States |publisher=Opcw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] Non-members are Israel and Myanmar, which are signatory states that have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and Angola, Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan, which have neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-opcw/non-member-states/ |title=Non-Member States |publisher=Opcw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl] Syria was the most recent state to submit its instrument of accession to the treaty following the Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons.

==Leadership==

The Organisation is led by the Director-General, which is directly appointed by the Conference. An overview of Directors-General is shown below.
The first Director-General only served about one year of his 2nd term, after which he was removed from office on grounds of lack of confidence by the member states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/index.php?eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=5103 |title=Draft decision of the First Special Session of the Conference of the States Parties of the OPCW |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1944879.stm | work=BBC News | title=Chemical weapons body sacks head | date=22 April 2002 | accessdate=19 August 2010[/tpl] Some suspect that Director-General Bustani was forced out by the U.S. government because Bustani wanted international chemical weapons monitors inside Iraq and thus was seen as impeding the U.S. push for war against Iraq.The Guardian, 2002 April 16, "The War against the Peacemaker," http://www.monbiot.com/2002/04/16/a-war-against-the-peacemaker/The Institute for Public Accuracy, 24 April 2002, "Chemical Weapons Agency 'Coup'"?, http://www.accuracy.org/release/668-chemical-weapons-agency-coup/The New York Times, 13 October 2013, "To Ousted Boss, Arms Watchdog Was Seen as an Obstacle in Iraq," http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/world/to-ousted-boss-arms-watchdog-was-seen-as-an-obstacle-in-iraq.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1& The US gave three main arguments for the removal of Bustani's from his position: "polarising and confrontational conduct", "mismanagement issues" and "advocacy of inappropriate roles for the OPCW".[tpl]cite web|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/t/ac/rls/fs/9120.htm|title=Preserving the Chemical Weapons Convention: The Need For A New Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Director-General|date=2002-04-01|accessdate=2013-10-11|publisher=US Bureau of Arms Control[/tpl]  The removal was subsequently determined to be improper by an Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization and consequently Bustani was awarded €50,000 in moral damages, his pay for the remainder of his second term, and his legal costs.The ILO called the decision "an unacceptable violation of the principles on which international organisations' activities are founded ..., by rendering officials vulnerable to pressures and to political change."

==2013 Nobel Peace Prize==

On 11 October, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the OPCW had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons". In the announcement, the OPCW and the Chemical Weapons Convention were praised. The committee further indicated how "Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.”[tpl]cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |title=Chemical Weapons Watchdog Wins Nobel Peace Prize |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/world/chemical-weapons-watchdog-wins-nobel-peace-prize.html |date=11 October 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=11 October 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2013/press.html | title=Official press release from Nobel prize Committee | publisher=Nobel Prize Organization | date=11 October 2013 | accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Chemicals-weapons-watchdog-OPCW-wins-Nobel-peace-prize/articleshow/23970428.cms?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=referral | title= Chemicals weapons watchdog OPCW wins Nobel peace prize| publisher=Times of India | date=11 October 2013 | accessdate=11 October 2013[/tpl]
