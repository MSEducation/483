==Quotes about Yictove==

Yictove has left his magical fingerprints everywhere. He writes with the resonance of a native New Orleans bluesman, the sharp eye of a New York City street poet, the rolling rhythm of a Jamaican dub-poet, and the vision of a prophet circling the modern Jericho. These poems are alive, whispering and booming, testifying to what Yictove means when he says: "Tongues that do speak the truth / are remarkable to listen to."
—James Nolan, author What Moves Is Not the Wind
This "Brother/Man" from New Orleans who has touched spirits on one shore and the next has come touch base with ours. He speaks of the conditions that are within our control, and the necessity for some changes of the urgency in the need to learn to learn how to truly love ourselves in order to be free enough to open up and learn to love each other. Offering no panacea, he speaks of the reality of the hard work intrinsic in the finding of solutions. He is a believer in the wondrous results of honest attempts at communications with our lovers, families and friends—a direct path to broader communications with our people.
