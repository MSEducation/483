[[Pepsin]]

CATEGORIES: EC 3.4.23, Peptidase, Stomach

Pepsin is an enzyme whose zymogen (pepsinogen) is released by the chief cells in the stomach and that degrades food proteins into peptides.  It was discovered in 1836 by Theodor Schwann who also coined its name from the Greek word πέψις pepsis, meaning "digestion" (from πέπτειν peptein "to digest").[tpl]cite journal | author=Florkin M | title=Discovery of pepsin by Theodor Schwann. | language=French | journal=Rev Med Liege | volume=12 | issue=5 | pages=139–44 |date=March 1957 | pmid=13432398[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Asimov, Isaac | title=A short history of biology | publisher=Greenwood Press | location=Westport, Conn | year=1980 | chapter=page 95 | isbn=0-313-22583-4 | accessdate=[/tpl] It was the first enzyme to be discovered, and, in 1929, it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized, by John H.

Pepsin is one of three principal protein-degrading, or proteolytic, enzymes in the digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. The three enzymes were among the first to be isolated in crystalline form. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the intestinal lining. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.[tpl]cite journal | author=Dunn BM | title=Overview of pepsin-like aspartic peptidases | journal=Curr Protoc Protein Sci | volume=Chapter 21 | pages=Unit 21.3 |date=November 2001 | pmid=18429164 | doi=10.1002/0471140864.ps2103s25| isbn=0471140864 [/tpl]

==History==

The term "pepsin" was first coined by Theodor Schwann in the early 19th century. Scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes and pepsin was one of them. It was with the identification of a chemical agent found in the stomachs of animals, This acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen based foods into water soluble material was determined to be pepsin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fruton JS | title = A history of pepsin and related enzymes | journal = Q Rev Biol | volume = 77 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–47 |date=June 2002 | pmid = 12089768 | doi = 10.1086/340729| issn = | jstor=3071644[/tpl]

==Precursor==

Pepsin is expressed as a pro-form zymogen, pepsinogen, whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids.
In the stomach, chief cells release pepsinogen. This zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment, which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin (the active form). Pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin. Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially after the N-terminal[tpl]cite book | author = Cox, Michael; Nelson, David R.; Lehninger, Albert L | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition = | language = | publisher = W.H.

Increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs if there is a sulfur-containing amino acid close to the peptide bond, which has an aromatic amino acid.  Pepsin cleaves Phe1Val, Gln4His, Glu13Ala, Ala14Leu, Leu15Tyr, Tyr16Leu, Gly23Phe, Phe24

==Activity and stability==

Pepsin is most active in acidic environments between 37 °C and 42 °C.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/introbiochem/effectspH.html|title=Effects of pH|accessdate=2010-04-29[/tpl]"Brenda-enzymes: Entry of pepsin A (EC-Number 3.4.23.1 )". Retrieved 2008-12-14 Accordingly, its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach (pH 1.5 to 2). Pepsin exhibits maximal activity at pH 2.0 and is inactive at pH 6.5 and above, however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0.[tpl]cite journal | author = Johnston N, Dettmar PW, Bishwokarma B, Lively MO, Koufman JA | title = Activity/stability of human pepsin: implications for reflux attributed laryngeal disease | journal = Laryngoscope | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1036–9 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17417109 | doi = 10.1097/MLG.0b013e31804154c3 [/tpl] Therefore pepsin in solution of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification. The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event.[tpl]cite journal | author = Johnston N, Knight J, Dettmar PW, Lively MO, Koufman J | title = Pepsin and carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme III as diagnostic markers for laryngopharyngeal reflux disease | journal = Laryngoscope | volume = 114 | issue = 12 | pages = 2129–34 |date=December 2004 | pmid = 15564833 | doi = 10.1097/01.mlg.0000149445.07146.03 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Johnston N, Dettmar PW, Lively MO, Postma GN, Belafsky PC, Birchall M, Koufman JA | title = Effect of pepsin on laryngeal stress protein (Sep70, Sep53, and Hsp70) response: role in laryngopharyngeal reflux disease | journal = Ann.

==In laryngopharyngeal reflux==

Pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux.[tpl]cite journal | author = Goldberg HI, Dodds WJ, Gee S, Montgomery C, Zboralske FF | title = Role of acid and pepsin in acute experimental esophagitis | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–30 |date=February 1969 | pmid = 4884956 | doi = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Lillemoe KD, Johnson LF, Harmon JW | title = Role of the components of the gastroduodenal contents in experimental acid esophagitis | journal = Surgery | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 276–84 |date=August 1982 | pmid = 6808683 | doi =  [/tpl] Pepsin remains in the larynx (pH 6.8) following a gastric reflux event. While enzymatically inactive in this environment, pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events. Exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin, but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid, results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage.
Pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux. Weak or non-acid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury.[tpl]cite journal | author = Tamhankar AP, Peters JH, Portale G, Hsieh CC, Hagen JA, Bremner CG, DeMeester TR | title = Omeprazole does not reduce gastroesophageal reflux: new insights using multichannel intraluminal impedance technology | journal = J.

==Storage==

Pepsins should be stored at very cold temperatures (between −80 °C and −20 °C) to prevent autolysis (self-digestion).

==Inhibitors==

Pepsin may be inhibited by high pH (see "Activity" and "Stability", above) or by inhibitor compounds. Pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a Ki of about 10−10 M for pepsin. The statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases. Pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marciniszyn J, Hartsuck JA, Tang J | title = Pepstatin inhibition mechanism | journal = Adv.
