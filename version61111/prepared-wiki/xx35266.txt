The following is a list of ''The Twilight Zone'' episodes. The anthology series began on October 2, 1959 and ended on June 19, 1964—with five seasons and 156 episodes. It was created by Rod Serling and broadcast on CBS.
Later popularity of the series brought about a 1983 feature film and two "revival" television series in 1985 and 2002.

==Pre-series pilot==

Rod Serling wrote a teleplay intending for it to be the pilot episode of a new series called The Twilight Zone. Although it ended up airing on a different show, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, it is still considered the pilot episode and has even been adapted as one of The Twilight Zone radio-show episodes.

==The Twilight Zone television series (1959–1964)==

Except for season four, each episode is 30 minutes long (including commercials). Season four epsiodes ran for a full hour. The series is hosted by Rod Serling.

===Season 1 (1959–1960)===

Note: Episode titles were shown at the beginning of the end credits, and also announced by Serling at the end of the preceding week's episode. "Where is Everybody?" is an exception, as it was the first episode. Serling's promotional announcements were stripped from syndicated versions of season one, but restored (often only in audio form) on the Image Entertainment DVD releases.

===Season 2 (1960–1961)===

Six episodes of this season were recorded on videotape (not on film as were all other episodes) at CBS Television City, as a cost-cutting measure mandated by CBS programming head James T. Aubrey. They are "The Lateness of the Hour", "The Night of the Meek", "The Whole Truth", "Twenty-Two", "Static", and "Long Distance Call". These have a visual appearance which is distinctly different from those of episodes shot on film. In addition, videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early 1960s; the editing of tape was next to impossible. Each of the episodes was therefore "camera-cut" as in live TV—on a studio sound stage, using a total of four cameras. The requisite multi-camera setup of the videotape experiment made location shooting difficult, severely limiting the potential scope of the storylines, so the short-lived experiment was abandoned.

===Season 3 (1961–1962)===

===Season 4 (1963)===

This season was used as a mid-season replacement for the The Nurses on the 1962 fall schedule. To fill the time slot, episodes were lengthened to one hour and moved to Thursday nights.

===Season 5 (1963–1964)===
