Notes: Surrey and Worcestershire one point each for tie on first innings in match drawn; Gloucestershire and Hampshire one point each for tie on first innings in match lost. Hampshire five points in drawn match when scores finished level and they were batting.

==Test series==

Australia retained the Ashes by beating England 1-0.  Australia won the Third Test at Headingley and the other four were all drawn. In the match that Australia won, they were 187-7 in reply to England's 268 when Ted Dexter decided to take the new ball. In response, Peter Burge, the last recognised batsman, went on the attack. He scored 160, well supported by Neil Hawke and Wally Grout, and the last three wickets added 211. 121 behind on first innings, England could not recover. Since a draw in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford would ensure that Australia would retain the Ashes, they batted on till they had reached 656-8 before declaring, with Bobby Simpson scoring 311, his first Test century. England responded with 611 (Ken Barrington 256, Ted Dexter 174) and the match ended in the dullest of draws.
