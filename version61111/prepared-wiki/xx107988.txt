[[Fourth Letts Executive]]

CATEGORIES: Northern Territory ministries

The Fourth Letts Executive was the fourth ministry to come from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in Australia. It oversaw the Northern Territory under Country Liberal Party Majority Leader Dr Goff Letts from December 1976 to September 1977. It came into existence not because of personnel changes, but as a result of a reshuffle to prepare for the 1977 election. Letts made a short-lived change with this executive, styling its members as "cabinet members" instead of "executive members", which was abandoned when Paul Everingham succeeded Letts as Majority Leader after the election.
While both the fourth and other early executives did not have anywhere near the range of powers as ministries after the granting of self-government in 1978, they nevertheless fulfilled similar functions. This executive was devastated at the 1977 election; five executive members (Goff Letts, Grant Tambling, Liz Andrew, Dave Pollock and Roger Ryan) were among the six Country Liberal Party members to lose their seats. Jim Robertson, MLA, while not technically a member of the executive, served as Manager of Government Business during this period.
