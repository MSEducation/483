[[Hopwood Program]]

CATEGORIES: University of Michigan

The Hopwood Program administers the University of Michigan Hopwood Award in literature, as well as several other awards in writing. It is located in the Hopwood Room at the University of Michigan and serves the needs and interests of Hopwood contestants. The Room was established by Professor Roy W. Cowden, Director of the Hopwood Awards from 1933 to 1952, who generously contributed a part of his library, which has grown through the addition of many volumes of contemporary literature. In addition to housing the winning manuscripts from the past years of the contests, the Hopwood Room has a lending library of twentieth -century literature, a 
generous supply of non-circulating current periodicals, some reference 
books on how to get published, information on graduate and summer writing 
programs, and a collection of screen plays donated by former Hopwood winner 
Lawrence Kasdan.
