==History==

The true name of this city seems to have been Hawârin; as such it appears in a Syriac inscription of the fourth to the sixth century. According to PtolemyV, xiv. it was situated in the Palmyrene province. Georgius Cyprius calls it Euarios or Justinianopolis.

The Notitiae episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Antioch (6th century) gives Euroea as a suffragan see of the archdiocese of Damascus.See Echos d'Orient, X (1907), 145. One of its bishops, Thomas, is known in 451; there is some uncertainty about another, John, who lived a little later.Lequien, Oriens christianus, II, 847.
