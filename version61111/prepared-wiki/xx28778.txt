==History==

Chili peppers have been a part of the human diet in the Americas since at least 7500 BC. The most recent research shows that chili peppers were domesticated more than 6000 years ago in Mexico, in the region that extends across southern Puebla and northern Oaxaca to southeastern Veracruz, "Birthplace of the domesticated chili pepper identified in Mexico" Eurekalert April 21, 2014
and were one of the first self-pollinating crops cultivated in Mexico, Central and parts of South America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1996/V3-479.html |title=Bosland, P.W. 1998.

ASHS Press, Arlington, VA. |publisher=Hort.purdue.edu |date=22 August 1997 |accessdate=23 December 2010[/tpl]
Christopher Columbus was one of the first Europeans to encounter them (in the Caribbean), and called them "peppers" because they, like black and white pepper of the Piper genus known in Europe, have a spicy hot taste unlike other foodstuffs. Upon their introduction into Europe, chilis were grown as botanical curiosities in the gardens of Spanish and Portuguese monasteries. But the monks experimented with the chili culinary potential and discovered that their pungency offered a substitute for black peppercorns, which at the time were so costly that they were used as legal currency in some countries.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Thenibble.com |title=Chile Pepper Glossary |date=August 2008 |url=http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/salts/scoville.asp |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl]
Chilies were cultivated around the globe after Columbus.Heiser Jr., C.B. 1976. Pp. 265–268 in N.W. Simmonds (ed.). Evolution of Crop Plants. London: Longman.Eshbaugh, W.H. 1993. Pp. 132–139 in J. Janick and J.E. Simon (eds.). New Crops. New York: Wiley. Diego Álvarez Chanca, a physician on Columbus' second voyage to the West Indies in 1493, brought the first chili peppers to Spain and first wrote about their medicinal effects in 1494.
The spread of chili peppers to Asia was most likely a natural consequence of its introduction to Portuguese traders (Lisbon was a common port of call for Spanish ships sailing to and from the Americas) who, aware of its trade value, would have likely promoted its commerce in the Asian spice trade routes then dominated by Portuguese and Arab traders.[tpl]cite book | last = Collingham| first = Elizabeth | title = Curry | publisher = Oxford University Press |date=February 2006 | isbn = 0-09-943786-4 [/tpl] Today chillies are an integral part of Indian cuisine.
There is a verifiable correlation between the chili pepper geographical dissemination and consumption in Asia and the presence of Portuguese traders, India and southeast Asia being obvious examples.
The chili pepper features heavily in the cuisine of the Goan region of India, which was the site of a Portuguese colony (e.g., vindaloo, an Indian interpretation of a Portuguese dish). Chili peppers journeyed from India,[tpl]cite news|last=Robinson|first=Simon|title=Chili Peppers: Global Warming|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1628191_1626317_1632291,00.html|publisher=www.time.com|accessdate=23 Oct 2013|date=14 June 2007[/tpl]  through Central Asia and Turkey, to Hungary, where they became the national spice in the form of paprika.
An alternate, although not so plausible account (no obvious correlation between its dissemination in Asia and Spanish presence or trade routes), defended mostly by Spanish historians, was that from Mexico, at the time a Spanish colony, chili peppers spread into their other colony the Philippines and from there to India, China, Indonesia. To Japan, it was brought by the Portuguese missionaries in 1542, and then later, it was brought to Korea.
In 1995 archaeobotanist Hakon Hjelmqvist published an article in Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift claiming there was evidence for the presence of chili peppers in Europe in pre-Columbian times.[tpl]cite news|title=Cayennepeppar från Lunds medeltid|first=Hakon|last=Hjelmqvist|work=Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift, vol 89|pages=193–[/tpl] According to Hjelmqvist, archaeologists at a dig in St Botulf in Lund found a Capsicum frutescens in a layer from the 13th century. Hjelmqvist thought it came from Asia. Hjelmqvist also said that Capsicum was described by the Greek Theophrastus (370–286 BCE) in his Historia Plantarum, and in other sources. Around the first century CE, the Roman poet Martialis (Martial) mentioned "Piperve crudum" (raw pepper) in Liber XI, XVIII, allegedly describing them as long and containing seeds (a description which seems to fit chili peppers - but could also fit the long pepper, which was well known to ancient Romans).

==Species and cultivars==

The five domesticated species of chili peppers are as follows:
Though there are only a few commonly used species, there are many cultivars and methods of preparing chili peppers that have different names for culinary use. Green and red bell peppers, for example, are the same cultivar of C. annuum, immature peppers being green. In the same species are the jalapeño, the poblano (which when dried is referred to as ancho), New Mexico (which is also known as chile [tpl]sic|hide=y|colo|rado[/tpl]), Anaheim, serrano, and other cultivars.
Peppers are commonly broken down into three groupings: bell peppers, sweet peppers, and hot peppers. Most popular pepper varieties are seen as falling into one of these categories or as a cross between them.

==Intensity==

The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) and several related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids.S Kosuge, Y Inagaki, H Okumura (1961). Studies on the pungent principles of red pepper. Part VIII. On the chemical constitutions of the pungent principles. Nippon Nogei Kagaku Kaishi (J. Agric. Chem. Soc.), 35, 923–927; (en) Chem. Abstr. 1964, 60, 9827g.(ja) S Kosuge, Y Inagaki (1962) Studies on the pungent principles of red pepper. Part XI. Determination and contents of the two pungent Capsaicin is also the primary component in pepper spray, a less-than-lethal weapon.
When consumed, capsaicinoids bind with pain receptors in the mouth and throat that are responsible for sensing heat. Once activated by the capsaicinoids, these receptors send a message to the brain that the person has consumed something hot. The brain responds to the burning sensation by raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and release of endorphins. A 2008 study[tpl]cite journal | author = Yasser A. Mahmmoud | title = Capsaicin Stimulates Uncoupled ATP Hydrolysis by the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Pump | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | pages = 21418–21426 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/283/31/21418.abstract | issue=31 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M803654200 | pmid = 18539598[/tpl] reports that capsaicin alters how the body's cells use energy produced by hydrolysis of ATP. In the normal hydrolysis the SERCA protein uses this energy to move calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When capsaicin is present, it alters the conformation of the SERCA, and thus reduces the ion movement; as a result the ATP energy (which would have been used to pump the ions) is instead released as thermal energy.Hot News about Chili Peppers, Chemical & Engineering News, 86, 33, 18 Aug 2008, p. 35
The "heat" of chili peppers was historically measured in Scoville heat units (SHU), which is a measure of the dilution of an amount of chili extract added to sugar syrup before its heat becomes undetectable to a panel of tasters; the more it has to be diluted to be undetectable, the more powerful the variety and therefore the higher the rating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tabasco.com/info_booth/faq/scoville_how.cfm |title=History of the Scoville Scale | FAQS |publisher=Tabasco.Com |accessdate=23 December 2010[/tpl] The modern commonplace method for quantitative analysis of SHU rating uses high-performance liquid chromatography to directly measure the capsaicinoid content of a chili pepper variety. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, and crystalline-to-waxy solid at room temperature, and measures 16,000,000 SHU.

==Uses==

===Culinary uses===

Chili pepper pods, which are berries, are used fresh or dried. Chilies are dried to preserve them for long periods of time, which may also be done by pickling.
Dried chilies are often ground into powders, although many Mexican dishes including variations on chiles rellenos use the entire chili. Dried whole chilis may be reconstituted before grinding to a paste. The chipotle is the smoked, dried, ripe jalapeño.
Many fresh chilies such as poblano have a tough outer skin that does not break down on cooking. Chilis are sometimes used whole or in large slices, by roasting, or other means of blistering or charring the skin, so as not to entirely cook the flesh beneath. When cooled, the skins will usually slip off easily.
The leaves of every species of Capsicum are edible. Though almost all other Solanaceous crops have toxins in their leaves, chile peppers do not. The leaves, which are mildly bitter and nowhere near as hot as the fruit, are cooked as greens in Filipino cuisine, where they are called dahon ng sili (literally "chili leaves"). They are used in the chicken soup, tinola.http://www.tribo.org/vegetables/dahongsili.html[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] In Korean cuisine, the leaves may be used in kimchi.http://sfood.info/cuisine/kimchi/k35.htm[tpl]Dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] In Japanese cuisine, the leaves are cooked as greens, and also cooked in tsukudani style for preservation.
Chili is by far the most important fruit in Bhutan. Local markets are never without chili, always teemed with different colors and sizes, in fresh and dried form. Bhutanese call this crop ema (in Dzongkha) or solo (in Sharchop). Chili is a staple fruit in Bhutan; the ema datsi recipe is entirely made of chili mixed with local cheese. Chili is also an important ingredient in almost all curries and food recipes in the country.
In India, most households always keep a stack of fresh hot green chilis at hand, and use them to flavor most curries and dry dishes. It is typically lightly fried with oil in the initial stages of preparation of the dish. Some states in India, such as Rajasthan, make entire dishes only by using spices and chilies.
Chilies are present in many cuisines.  Some notable dishes other than the ones mentioned elsewhere in this article include:
Fresh or dried chilies are often used to make hot sauce, a liquid condiment – usually bottled when commercially available – that adds spice to other dishes. Hot sauces are found in many cuisines including harissa from North Africa, chili oil from China (known as rāyu in Japan), and sriracha from Thailand.

===Psychology===

Psychologist Paul Rozin suggests that eating chilis is an example of a "constrained risk" like riding a roller coaster, in which extreme sensations like pain and fear can be enjoyed because individuals know that these sensations are not actually harmful. This method lets people experience extreme feelings without any risk of bodily harm.[tpl]cite journal |last= Paul Rozin1 and Deborah Schiller|year= 1980|title= The nature and acquisition of a preference for chili pepper by humans |journal= Motivation and Emotion |volume= 4 |issue= 1 |pages= 77–101 |url=|doi= 10.1007/BF00995932 |first1= Paul |last2= Schiller |first2= Deborah [/tpl]

===Medicinal===

Capsaicin is considered a safe and effective topical analgesic agent in the management of arthritis pain, herpes zoster-related pain, diabetic neuropathy,  mastectomy pain, and headaches.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=HXsl_PhXG0kC&pg=PA682&dq=capsaicin+cancer+oncologist|title=Cancer nursing: principles and practice – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=23 December 2010|isbn=978-0-7637-4720-6|year=2005[/tpl] However, a study published in 2010 has linked capsaicin to skin cancer.Science Daily: Capsaicin can act as co-carcinogen, study finds; Chili pepper component linked to skin cancer, 3 September 2010[tpl]Cite doi|10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4393[/tpl]

===Pepper spray===

Capsaicin extracted from chilis is used in pepper spray as an irritant, a form of less-lethal weapon.

===Crop defense===

Conflicts between farmers and elephants have long been widespread in African and Asian countries, where pachyderms nightly destroy crops, raid grain houses, and sometimes kill people. Farmers have found the use of chilies effective in crop defense against elephants. Elephants don't like capsaicin, the chemical in chilies that makes them hot.  Because the elephants have a large and sensitive olfactory and nasal system, the smell of the chili causes them discomfort and deters them from feeding on the crops. By planting a few rows of the pungent fruit around valuable crops, farmers create a buffer zone through which the elephants are reluctant to pass. Chilly-Dung Bombs are also used for this purpose. They are bricks made of mixing dung and chili, and are burned, creating a noxious smoke that keeps hungry elephants out of farmers fields. This can lessen dangerous physical confrontation between people and elephants.[tpl]cite web|last=Mott|first=Maryann|title=Elephant Crop Raids Foiled by Chili Peppers, Africa Project Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2006/09/060918-elephants-chili.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=23 Oct 2013[/tpl]

===Food defense===

As birds have a lessened sensitivity to the effects of chili it can be used to keep mammalian vermin from bird seed (see Evolutionary Advantages below).

==Nutritional value==

Red chilies contain large amounts of vitamin C and small amounts of carotene (provitamin A). Yellow and especially green chilies (which are essentially unripe fruit) contain a considerably lower amount of both substances. In addition, peppers are a good source of most B vitamins, and vitamin B6 in particular. They are very high in potassium, magnesium, and iron. Their very high vitamin C content can also substantially increase the uptake of non-heme iron from other ingredients in a meal, such as beans and grains.

===Evolutionary advantages===

Birds do not have the same sensitivity to capsaicin, because it targets a specific pain receptor in mammals. Chili peppers are eaten by birds living in the chili peppers' natural range. The seeds of the peppers are distributed by the birds that drop the seeds while eating the pods, and the seeds pass through the digestive tract unharmed. This relationship may have promoted the evolution of the protective capsaicin.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Tewksbury | first1 = J. J. | last2 = Nabhan | first2 = G. P. | year = 2001 | title = Directed deterrence by capsaicin in chilies | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 412 | issue = 6845| pages = 403–404 | doi = 10.1038/35086653 | pmid = 11473305 [/tpl] Products based on this substance have been sold to treat the seeds in bird feeders to deter squirrels and other mammalian vermin without also deterring birds. Capsaicin is also a defense mechanism against microbial fungi that invade through punctures made in the outer skin by various insects.

==Spelling and usage==

The three primary spellings are chili, chile and chilli, all of which are recognized by dictionaries.
The name of the plant is almost certainly unrelated to that of Chile, the country, which has an uncertain etymology perhaps relating to local place names.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chilipedia.org/chili-or-pepper |title=Chili or Pepper? |publisher=Chilipedia.org |accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl] Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are some of the Spanish-speaking countries where chilis are known as ají, a word of Taíno origin.
Though pepper originally referred to the genus Piper, not Capsicum, the latter usage is included in English dictionaries, including the Oxford English Dictionary (sense 2b of pepper) and Merriam-Webster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=pepper |title=va=pepper – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-w.com |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=23 December 2010[/tpl] The word pepper is also commonly used in the botanical and culinary fields in the names of different types of chili plants and their fruits.
