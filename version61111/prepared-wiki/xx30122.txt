Topaz  is a 1945 documentary film, shot illegally (though with the assistance of members of the camp staff), which documented life at the Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah during World War II. 
Filmed by internee Dave Tatsuno (1913–2006), it was deemed "culturally significant" by the United States Library of Congress in 1997, and was the second amateur[tpl]cite news | title = Dave Tatsuno, 92, Whose Home Movies Captured History, Dies | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/13/national/13tatsuno.html | work=The New York Times | first=Margalit | last=Fox | date=February 13, 2006[/tpl] film ever selected for preservation in the National Film Registry (behind the "Zapruder" film of the JFK assassination).
Tatsuno always credited his store supervisor, Walter Honderick, for helping him get the movie camera into the camp.  Film was smuggled out of the camp on trips that Tatsuno made to buy merchandise for the store.
