Zarka is also sometimes called tsinnor. Properly speaking, tsinnor is the name it receives when appears on the three poetic books (Job, Proverbs and Psalms, or the א״מת books, from their initials in Hebrew), and zarqa the name it gets on the remaining 21 books of the Hebrew Bible (also known as the prosaic books).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lrz.de/~hr/teamim/intro.html#b21b3|title=Hebrew Cantillation Marks And Their Encoding: The 21 books and the 3 books[/tpl] Both sets of books use a different cantillation system.
