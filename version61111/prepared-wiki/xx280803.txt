In August 2012, conservative activist and former Ron Paul aide Dennis Fusaro released emails and phone conversations that implicated Benton in being involved in an attempt to bribe Iowa state senator Kent Sorenson in order to secure Sorenson's support of Ron Paul's presidential campaign. Sorenson initially supported Michele Bachmann's candidacy, but switched his support to Paul, prompting Bachmann to accuse the Paul campaign of bribing Sorenson.[tpl]cite news|last=Robinson|first=Craig|title=In His Own Words: Sorenson Confirms Payment for Ron Paul Endorsement|url=http://theiowarepublican.com/2013/in-his-own-words-sorenson-confirms-payment-for-ron-paul-endorsement/|newspaper=The Iowa Republican|date=7 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Choma|first=Russ|title=Ron Paul Campaign Accused of Trying to Buy Iowa Endorsements|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/08/ron-paul-campaign-accused-of-trying.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|newspaper=Open Secrets|date=7 August 2013[/tpl] Fusaro then released a phone conversation regarding Benton's employment with the McConnell campaign, in which Benton said he was "“sort of holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit for Rand in 2016." The incident was referred to on Twitter as "nosegate."[tpl]cite news|last=Meador|first=Jonathan|title='Nosegate' Puts McConnell Campaign Manager Jesse Benton Under Fire|url=http://wfpl.org/post/nosegate-puts-mcconnell-campaign-manager-jesse-benton-under-fire|newspaper=WFPL News|date=8 August 2013[/tpl] In response to Fusaro's actions, Benson stated, "“It is truly sick that someone would record a private phone conversation I had out of kindness and use it to try to hurt me. I believe in Senator McConnell and am 100 percent committed to his re-election. Being selected to lead his campaign is one of the great honors of my life and I look forward to victory in November of 2014.” The McConnell campaign stated that Benton would "absolutely" keep his job with the campaign.[tpl]cite news|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|title=Top McConnell Aide ‘Holding My Nose’ to Help Rand Paul|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/top-mcconnell-aide-holding-my-nose-to-help-rand-paul/|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 August 2013[/tpl]
