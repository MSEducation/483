[[Reduplication in the Russian language]]

CATEGORIES: Russian language, Reduplication

The reduplication in the Russian language serves for various kinds of the intensification of the meaning. 
Reduplication is also observable in borrowed words, such as "[tpl]lang|ru|пинг-понг[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPA|pʲinkˈpoŋk[/tpl]; ping-pong) and "[tpl]lang|ru|зигзаг[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPA|zʲɪɡˈzak[/tpl]; zig-zag), but since the words were borrowed as is from other languages, they are not examples of reduplication as it works in the  grammar of Russian.

==Syllabic/root/stem reduplication==

There is virtually no productive syllabic or root/stem reduplication in the modern Russian language.[tpl]lang|ru|О. Ю. Крючкова, "Специфика внутрисловных удвоений в русском языке"[/tpl], in Proc. Intl. Congress Russian Language: Historical Fates and Modern Times ([tpl]lang|ru|"Русский язык: исторические судьбы и современность"[/tpl]), Moscow, MSU, March 13–16, 2001, section "Word Formation of the Modern Russian Language" [tpl]ru icon[/tpl]
An ancient lexical stratum of the Russian language provides examples such as "[tpl]lang|ru|мама[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPA|ˈmamə[/tpl]; mommy), "[tpl]lang|ru|папа[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPA|ˈpapə[/tpl]; daddy), "[tpl]lang|ru|баба[/tpl]" ([tpl]IPA|ˈbabə[/tpl]; granny)—a phenomenon common to many languages. It is argued that these words originated in the reduplicated babbling of infants.

==Word reduplication==

Word reduplications are mostly the feature of the colloquial language and in most cases do not constitute separate dictionary entries.  Word reduplication may occur in the following forms: 

==Affixal reduplication==

A peculiarity of Russian language is synonymic affixal reduplication, whereby a root may acquire two productive suffixes or prefixes, different, but of the same semantics, with the corresponding intensification of the meaning:
