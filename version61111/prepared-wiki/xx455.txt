The Cambrian ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|b|r|i|ə|n[/tpl]) is the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era, lasting from [tpl]Geologic Ages Inline|Cambrian[/tpl] to [tpl]Geologic Ages Inline|Ordovician[/tpl] million years ago (mya) and is succeeded by the Ordovician.[tpl]cite web|title=Stratigraphic Chart 2012|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf|publisher=International Stratigraphic Commission|accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl] Its subdivisions, and indeed its base, are somewhat in flux.  The period was established by Adam Sedgwick, who named it after Cambria, the Latin name for Wales, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1852.008.01-02.20|author=Sedgwick, A. |year=1852|title=On the classification and nomenclature of the Lower Paleozoic rocks of England and Wales|journal=Q.

These are sites of exceptional preservation, where 'soft' parts of organisms are preserved as well as their more resistant shells.

The Cambrian Period marked a profound change in life on Earth; prior to the Cambrian, living organisms on the whole were small, unicellular and simple.  Complex, multicellular organisms gradually became more common in the millions of years immediately preceding the Cambrian, but it was not until this period that mineralized – hence readily fossilized – organisms became common.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x[/tpl]  The rapid diversification of lifeforms in the Cambrian, known as the Cambrian explosion, produced the first representatives of many modern phyla, representing the evolutionary stems of modern groups of species, such as the molluscs and arthropods.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] While diverse life forms prospered in the oceans, the land was comparatively barren – with nothing more complex than a microbial soil crustSchieber, 2007, pp. 53–71. and a few molluscs that emerged to browse on the microbial biofilmSeilacher, A. and Hagadorn, J.W.

Shallow seas flanked the margins of several continents created during the breakup of the supercontinent Pannotia.  The seas were relatively warm, and polar ice was absent for much of the period.

==Stratigraphy==

Despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger Ordovician rocks and older Precambrian rocks, it was not until 1994 that this time  period was internationally ratified. The base of the Cambrian is defined on a complex assemblage of trace fossils known as the Treptichnus pedum assemblage.A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) "The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale." Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.
Nevertheless, the usage of Treptichnus pedum, a reference ichnofossil for the lower boundary of the Cambrian, for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky because of occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group well below the T. pedum in Namibia, Spain and Newfoundland, and possibly, in the western USA. The stratigraphic range of T. pedum overlaps the range of the Ediacaran fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.M.A. Fedonkin, B.S. Sokolov, M.A. Semikhatov, N.M.Chumakov (2007).

===Subdivisions [tpl]anchor|Subdivisions[/tpl]===

The Cambrian period follows the Ediacaran and is followed by the Ordovician period. The Cambrian is divided into four epochs or series and ten ages or stages. Currently only two series and five stages are named and have a GSSP.
Because the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete, many local subdivisions are still widely used. In some of these subdivisions the Cambrian is divided into three epochs with locally differing names – the Early Cambrian (Caerfai or Waucoban, [tpl]period span|early cambrian[/tpl] mya), Middle Cambrian (St Davids or Albertan, [tpl]period span|middle cambrian[/tpl] mya) and Furongian ([tpl]period span|late cambrian[/tpl] mya; also known as Late Cambrian, Merioneth or Croixan). Rocks of these epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle, or Upper Cambrian.
Trilobite zones allow biostratigraphic correlation in the Cambrian.
Each of the local epochs is divided into several stages. The Cambrian is divided into several regional faunal stages of which the Russian-Kazakhian system is most used in international parlance:
In Russian tradition the lower boundary of the Cambrian is suggested to be defined at the base of the Tommotian Stage which is characterized by diversification and global distribution of organisms with mineral skeletons and the appearance of the first Archaeocyath bioherms.

===Cambrian dating===

The time range for the Cambrian has classically been thought to have been from about 542 mya to about 488 mya. The lower boundary of the Cambrian was traditionally set at the earliest appearance of trilobites and also unusual forms known as archeocyathids (literally "ancient cup") that are thought to be the earliest sponges and also the first non-microbial reef builders.
The end of the period was eventually set at a fairly definite faunal change now identified as an extinction event. Fossil discoveries and radiometric dating in the last quarter of the 20th century have called these dates into question. Date inconsistencies as large as 20 million years are common between authors. Framing dates of ca. 545 to 490 mya were proposed by the International Subcommission on Global Stratigraphy as recently as 2002.
A radiometric date from New Brunswick puts the end of the Lower Cambrian around 511 mya. This leaves 21 mya for the other two series/epochs of the Cambrian.
A more precise date of 542 ± 0.3 mya for the extinction event at the beginning of the Cambrian has recently been submitted.[ref]
