"Faded Love" is a Western swing song written by Bob Wills, his father John Wills,San Antonio Rose - The Life and Music of Bob Wills. Charles R. Townsend. 1976. University of Illinois. page 11. ISBN 0-252-00470-1 and his brother, Billy Jack Wills. The tune is considered to be an exemplar of the Western swing fiddle component of American fiddle.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]The melody came from an 1856 ballad, Darling Nelly Gray, which John Wills knew as a fiddle tune.Wolff, Country Music, p. 112: "It Love' originated with western swing pioneer Bob Wills, who grew up in the 1910s and 1920s fiddling in rural Texas with his father, John Wills. They wrote the melody together when Bob was very young; it wasn't until 1950 that the song gained lyrics, courtesy of Bob's younger brother, Billy Jack."McWhorter, Cowboy Fiddler, p. 61: "And he Rogers played a tune called 'Forsaken Lover.' It's note-for-note the same as 'Faded Love.' Bob took that old tune and slowed it down and put in that long Bob Wills bow, and it became 'Faded Love'." "Faded Love" is a sentimental song about lost love. The name comes from the refrain that follows each verse:
The song was a major hit for Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys (MGM K10786) reaching No.8 on the Country charts in 1950.Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p. 393: "Rusty McDonald and The Playboy Trio (vocals)". It became one of his signature songs.
Leon McAuliffe had two Top 40 hits with "Faded Love", both reaching No.22 (Cimarron 4057, 1962, and MGM 14249, 1971). The former was an instrumental version, and the latter rendition was a collaboration with Tompall & the Glaser Brothers.Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits, p. 218. Also in 1962, it was a modest hit for Jackie DeShannon, reaching No.97 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The song had even greater success when Patsy Cline covered the song in 1963. Her version became a hit, reaching No.7 on the U.S. Country charts and No.96 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Due to the aeroplane crash that ended Cline's life, her version was never released on a studio album. Instead, it was belatedly released on Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits, a compilation album in 1967. Cline's version was originally intended to be the title cut for a planned album and was made at what turned out to be the last recording session before her death.
