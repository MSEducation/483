Adipocytes, also known as lipocytes and fat cells, are the cells that primarily compose adipose tissue, specialized in storing energy as fat.
There are two types of adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which are also known as white fat and brown fat, respectively, and comprise two types of fat cells. Most recently, the presence of beige adipocytes with a gene expression pattern distinct from either white or brown adipocytes has been described.
Also another special type of adipose tissue is being studied, pink adipose tissue, which seems to be involved in mammillary duct development in female breasts.

==White fat cells (unilocular cells)==

White fat cells or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of
cytoplasm. The nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1mm in diameter with some being twice that size and others half that size. The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester. White fat cells secrete many proteins acting as adipokines such as resistin, adiponectin, leptin and Apelin. An average adult has 30 billion fat cells with a weight of 30 lbs or 13.5 kg. If excess weight is gained as an adult, fat cells increase in size about fourfold before dividing and increasing the absolute number of fat cells present.[tpl]cite book |author=Pool, Robert |title=Fat: fighting the obesity epidemic |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford Oxfordshire |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-19-511853-7[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Brown fat cells (multilocular cells)==

Brown fat cells or plurivacuolar cells are polygonal in shape. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable cytoplasm, with lipid droplets scattered throughout. The nucleus is round, and, although eccentrically located, it is not in the periphery of the cell. The brown color comes from the large quantity of mitochondria. Brown fat, also known as "baby fat," is used to generate heat.

==Lineage==

Although the lineage of adipocytes is still unclear, pre-adipocytes are undifferentiated fibroblasts that can be stimulated to form adipocytes.
Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into adipocytes, connective tissue, muscle or bone.
Areolar connective tissue is composed of adipocytes.
The term "lipoblast" is used to describe the precursor of the adult cell. The term "lipoblastoma" is used to describe a tumor of this cell type.[tpl]cite journal |pages=508–11 |doi=10.1002/dc.20826 |title=Fine-needle aspiration cytology of a lipoblastoma: A case report |year=2008 |last1=Hong |first1=Ran |last2=Choi |first2=Dong-Youl |last3=Do |first3=Nam-Yong |last4=Lim |first4=Sung-Chul |journal=Diagnostic Cytopathology |volume=36 |issue=7 |pmid=18528880[/tpl]

==Cell turnover==

Even after marked weight loss, the body never loses adipocytes. As a rule, to facilitate changes in weight, the adipocytes in the body merely gain or lose fat content. However, if the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage.

In some reports and textbooks, the number of adipocytes can increase in childhood and adolescence, though the amount is usually constant in adults. Interestingly, individuals who become obese as adults, rather than as adolescents, have no more adipocytes than they had before.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/nature06902[/tpl]

According to research by Tchoukalova et al., 2010, body fat cells could have regional responses to the overfeeding that was studied in adult subjects. In the upper body, an increase of adipocyte size correlated with upper-body fat gain; however, the number of fat cells was not significantly changed. In contrast to the upper body fat cell response, the number of lower-body adipocytes did significantly increase during the course of experiment. Notably, there was no change in the size of the lower-body adipocytes.[tpl]cite journal |pages=18226–31 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1005259107 |title=Regional differences in cellular mechanisms of adipose tissue gain with overfeeding |year=2010 |last1=Tchoukalova |first1=YD. |last2=Votruba |first2=SB |last3=Tchkonia |first3=T. |last4=Giorgadze |first4=N. |last5=Kirkland |first5=JL. |last6=Jensen |first6=MD. |journal=PNAS |volume=107 |issue=42 |pmid=20921416 |pmc=2964201[/tpl]
Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index without a significant increase in the overall number of adipocytes in adulthood.

==Adipocyte adaptation==

Obesity is characterized by the expansion of fat mass, through adipocyte size increase (hypertrophy) and, to a lesser extent, cell proliferation (hyperplasia).[tpl]cite journal |pages=241–50 |title=Adipose Tissue Dysfunction in Obesity |year=2009 |last1=Blüher |first1=M |journal=Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes |volume=117 |issue=6 |pmid=19358089[/tpl] In the fat cells of obese individuals, there is increased production of metabolism modulators, such as glycerol, hormones, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of insulin resistance.[tpl]cite journal |pages=840–46 |title=Mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes |year=2006 |last1=Kahn |first1=SE |last2=Hull |first2=RL |last3=Utzschneider |first3=KM |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7121 |pmid=17167471[/tpl]
Fat production in adipocytes is strongly stimulated by insulin. By controlling the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes, insulin promotes unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. It also promotes glucose uptake and induces SREBF1, which activates the transcription of genes that stimulate lipogenesis.[tpl]cite journal |pages=473–81 |title=Obesity and insulin resistance. |year=2000 |last1=Kahn |first1=BB |last2=Flier |first2=JS |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=106 |issue=4 |pmid=10953022[/tpl]
SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor synthesized as an inactive precursor protein inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by two membrane-spanning helices. Also anchored in the ER membrane is SCAP (SREBF-cleavage activating protein), which binds SREBF1. The SREBF1-SCAP complex is retained in the ER membrane by Insig1 (insulin-induced gene 1). When sterol levels are depleted, Insig1 releases SCAP and the SREBF1-SCAP complex can be sorted into COPII-coated transport vesicles that are exported to the Golgi. In the Golgi, SREBF1 is cleaved and released as a transcriptionally active mature protein. It is then free to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of its target genes.thumb|Proteolytic activation of SREBF-controlled lipid biosynthesis.[tpl]cite journal |pages=631–40 |title=The SREBP pathway—insights from Insigs and insects |year=2003 |last1=Rawson |first1=RB |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=4 |issue=8 |pmid=12923525[/tpl]
Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that even though insulin resistance is usually associated with obesity, the membrane phospholipids of the adipocytes of obese patients generally still show an increased degree of fatty acid unsaturation.[tpl]cite journal |pages=3697–708 |title=Adaptive changes of the Insig1/SREBP1/SCD1 set point help adipose tissue to cope with increased storage demands of obesity |year=2013 |last1=Carobbio |first1=S |last2=Hagen |first2=RM |last3=Lelliot |first3=CJ |last4=Slawik |first4=M |last5=Medina-Gomez |first5=G |last6=Tan |first6=CY |journal=Diabetes |volume=62 |issue=11 |pmid=23919961[/tpl] This seems to point to an adaptive mechanism that allows the adipocyte to maintain its functionality, despite the increased storage demands associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
A study conducted in 2013[tpl]cite journal |pages=3697–708 |title=Adaptive changes of the Insig1/SREBP1/SCD1 set point help adipose tissue to cope with increased storage demands of obesity |year=2013 |last1=Carobbio |first1=S |last2=Hagen |first2=RM |last3=Lelliot |first3=CJ |last4=Slawik |first4=M |last5=Medina-Gomez |first5=G |last6=Tan |first6=CY |journal=Diabetes |volume=62 |issue=11 |pmid=23919961[/tpl] found that, while Insig1 and SREBF1 mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, the amount of active SREBF1 was increased in comparison with normal mice and non-obese patients. This downregulation of Insig1 expression combined with the increase of mature SREBF1 was also correlated with the maintenance of SREBF1-target gene expression. Hence, it appears that, by downregulating Insig1, there is a resetting of the Insig1/SREBF1 loop, allowing for the maintenance of active SREBF1 levels. This seems to help compensate for the anti-lipogenic effects of insulin resistance and thus preserve adipocyte fat storage abilities and availability of appropriate levels of fatty acid unsaturation in face of the nutritional pressures of obesity.

==Endocrine functions==

Adipocytes can synthesize estrogens from androgens,[tpl]cite journal |pages=S116–24 |doi=10.1067/mjd.2001.117432 |title=Estrogen production and action☆ |year=2001 |last1=Nelson |first1=Linda R. |last2=Bulun |first2=Serdar E. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pmid=11511861[/tpl] potentially being the reason why being underweight or overweight are risk factors for infertility.[tpl]Dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] FERTILITY FACT > Female Risks By the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Retrieved on Jan 4, 2009 Additionally, adipocytes are responsible for the production of the hormone leptin. Leptin is important in regulation of appetite and acts as a satiety factor.[tpl]cite journal |pages=12–34 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00270.x |title=The role of leptin and ghrelin in the regulation of food  intake and body weight in humans: a review |year=2006 |last1=Klok |first1=M.D. |last2=Jakobsdottir |first2=S. |last3=Drent |first3=M.L. |journal=The International Association for the Study of Obesity. obesity reviews |volume=8 |pmid=17212793 |issue=1[/tpl]
