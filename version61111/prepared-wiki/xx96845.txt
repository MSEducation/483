[[Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale]]

CATEGORIES: Pediatrics, Medical scales, Coma

The Paediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (BrE) (also known as Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score (AmE) or simply PGCS) is the equivalent of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) used to assess the mental state of child patients.  As many of the assessments for an adult patient would not be appropriate for infants, the Glascow Coma Scale was modified slightly to form the PGCS.  As with the GCS, the PGCS comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses.  The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible PGCS (the sum) is 3 (deep coma or death) whilst the highest is 15 (fully awake and aware person). The pediatric GCS is commonly used in emergency medical services.
