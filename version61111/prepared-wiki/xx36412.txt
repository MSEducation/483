Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released May 16, 1966, on Capitol Records. It has since been recognized as one of the most influential records in the history of popular music and one of the best albums of the 1960s. It features songs such as "Wouldn't It Be Nice" and "God Only Knows". Pet Sounds was created several months after Brian Wilson had quit touring with the band in order to focus his attention on writing and recording. In it, he wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unconventional instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, dog whistles, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars.[tpl]cite web | last =Cobley | first =Mike  | url =http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/index.asp?art_id=2369&cat_id=21&sec_id=1&sub_id=45  | title = Brighton Beach Boys: 'Getting Better' All The Time! | publisher =The Brighton Magazine | date=September 9, 2007 | accessdate = March 3, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/pet-sounds-r485904| title =Richie Unterberger review of Pet Sounds| publisher = Allmusic[/tpl]Laura Tunbridge, The Song Cycle , (Cambridge University Press, 2011), ISBN 0-521-72107-5, p.173.

==Background==

The track "Sloop John B" predated the rest of the LP by some months, but it proved to be a pivotal point in the album's development. It was a traditional Caribbean folk song that had been suggested to Wilson by group member Al Jardine. Al updated the chord progression by having the IV, D♭ major, move to its relative minor, B♭ minor before returning to the tonic, A♭. He expected to collaborate further with Wilson on the arrangement, but was pleasantly surprised by what Brian accomplished on his own.The Pet Sounds Sessions: "The Making Of Pet Sounds" booklet (1996)[tpl]cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|title=Great Moments in Folk Rock: Lists of Aunthor Favorites |publisher=richieunterberger.com|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/turnlists.html|accessdate=2011-01-26[/tpl] Wilson recorded a backing track on July 12, 1965, but after laying down a rough lead vocal, he set the song aside for some time, concentrating on the recording of what became their next LP, the "live in the studio" album, Beach Boys' Party!, in response to their record company's request for a Beach Boys album for the Christmas 1965 market. Wilson devoted the last three months of 1965 to polishing the vocals of "Sloop John B" and recording six new original compositions: "The Little Girl I Once Knew", "In My Childhood", "Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)",  "Run, James, Run", "Trombone Dixie", and "Three Blind Mice". What would become Pet Sounds could not be finished in time for Christmas 1965.

Halfway through the Pet Sounds sessions, Wilson reportedly became enthralled with the Beatles' album Rubber Soul, which was released that December. The British version of Rubber Soul was edited prior to its release in the US to emphasise a folk rock feel that critics attributed to Bob Dylan and the Byrds. Wilson found Rubber Soul to lack filler tracks, which was mostly unheard of at a time when 45 rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. Many albums up until the late-1960s lacked a cohesive artistic goal and were largely used to sell singles at a higher price point. Wilson thought that Rubber Soul broke the mold with a consistent thread of high-quality music. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, "Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!".[tpl]cite book | author=Carlin, Peter Ames | title=Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, & Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson| publisher=Rodale Books (New York)| year=2006 | isbn= 978-1-59486-320-2[/tpl]

==Composition==

===Lyrics===

In early January 1966 Wilson contacted Tony Asher, a young lyricist and copywriter who had been working on advertising jingles, and whom Wilson had met in a Hollywood recording studio earlier. Within ten days they were writing together. Wilson played him some of the music he had been recording and gave him a cassette of the backing track for a piece with the working title "In My Childhood". It had lyrics, but Wilson refused to show them to Asher. The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled "You Still Believe in Me" and the artistic success of the piece convinced Wilson that Tony Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for.
Most of the songs were written during December 1965 and January 1966. While most were composed with Tony Asher, "I Know There's an Answer" was co-written by another new associate, Terry Sachen.[tpl]cite web | last =Elliott | first =Brad  | url =http://www.beachboysfanclub.com/ps-tracks.html  | title = Pet Sounds Track Notes | publisher =beachboysfanclub.com | date=August 31, 1999 | accessdate = March 3, 2009[/tpl] Mike Love is co-credited on the album's opening track, "Wouldn't It Be Nice", and on "I Know There's an Answer" but with the exception of his co-credit on "I'm Waiting for the Day", his songwriting contributions are thought to have been minimal. The exact degree of Love's contribution to "Wouldn't It Be Nice" was never fully determined, but under oath in a court of law, Tony Asher stated it consisted of the tag "Good night my baby/Sleep tight, my baby" and possible minor vocal arrangement. Love's influence on "I Know There's an Answer" is reputed to have stemmed from his opposition to the song's original title, "Hang On to Your Ego", and his belief that it be partially rewritten and retitled. The original lyrics created a stir within the group. "I was aware that Brian was beginning to experiment with LSD and other psychedelics," explained Love. "The prevailing drug jargon at the time had it that doses of LSD would shatter your ego, as if that were a positive thing... I wasn't interested in taking acid or getting rid of my ego." Jardine recalled that the decision to change the lyrics was ultimately Wilson's. "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'"  Terry Sachen, who co-wrote the revised lyrics to this song, was the Beach Boys' road manager in 1966.Tobler, John. Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys: The Complete Guide to Their Music.

===Music===

Professors John Covach and Graeme M. Boone of Ohio State University have written that "In terms of the structure of the songs themselves, there is comparatively little advance from what Brian had already accomplished or shown himself capable of accomplishing. Most of the songs use unusual harmonic progressions and unexpected disruptions of hypermeter, both features that were met in 'Warmth of the Sun' and 'Don't Back Down.'"[tpl]cite book|last=Boone|first=edited by John Covach & Graeme M.|title=Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195100050|edition=Online-Ausg..[/tpl] Specific complexities within Pet Sounds are often cited toward "God Only Knows", which contains an ambivalent key. According to Wilson, his writing process at the time involved going to the piano and finding "feels," which he described as "brief note sequences, fragments of ideas," and that "once they're out of my head and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly. They're not 'feels' anymore."[tpl]cite journal|title=Brian Pop Genius!|journal=Melody Maker|date=May 21, 1966|url=http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg[/tpl] The album included two sophisticated instrumental tracks. One of them: the wistful "Let's Go Away for Awhile", with a working parenthetical title of "And Then We'll Have World Peace";Tobler, John.

Pet Sounds is the first rock record to incorporate the Electro-Theremin, an easier-to-play version of the theremin. Its inventor Paul Tanner performs the instrument on the song "I Just Wasn't Made For These Times".

===Concept===

The concept album form received a resurgence of popularity in the late 1960s among pop artists, when many rock releases including Pet Sounds presented a set of thematically-linked songs. Other rock music artists, such as Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, the Beatles and The Who subsequently released concept albums. Pet Sounds was a musical portrayal of Brian Wilson's private/public state of mind at the time.Michael Zager, Music Production: For Producers, Composers, Arrangers, and Students, (Scarecrow Press), ISBN 0-8108-8201-9 Although Pet Sounds has a unified theme in its emotional content, Wilson and Asher said repeatedly that it was not necessarily intended to be a narrative. However, Wilson stated that making the record a concept album is how they had thought of it. Sonically, it was structured as an interpretation of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound.[tpl]cite web|last=Harris|first=Bob|title=Rare Brian Wilson interview 1976|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awk-qcTckuw|publisher=YouTube[/tpl]
On February 15, the group traveled to the San Diego Zoo to shoot the photographs for the cover, which had already received its title. George Jerman was credited for taking the cover photo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pet-sounds-r485904/credits|title=Pet Sounds credits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=May 13, 2011[/tpl] According to the liner notes, "The photos of The Beach Boys feeding an assortment of goats was a play on the album's chosen title, Pet Sounds." Both the origin and meaning of the album title Pet Sounds are uncertain. Wilson claimed at one point that the title was "a tribute" to Spector by matching his initials.[tpl]cite book|last=Brown|first=Mick|authorlink=Mick Brown (journalist)|title=Tearing Down the Wall of Sound|date=5 June 2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-26772-6 |page=152[/tpl] Carl Wilson later spoke about the album title: "The idea he had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3," referencing the artistic disparity between Pet Sounds and their earlier works, adding "It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that."[tpl]cite web | last =Elliott | first =Brad  | url = http://www.beachboysfanclub.com/ps-liner.html| title = Pet Sounds Liner Notes | publisher =beachboysfanclub.com | date=August 31, 1999 | accessdate = May 29, 2011[/tpl] Mike Love also laid claim to the title. "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title," he recounted. "We had taken pictures at the zoo and…there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" At another time, Brian credited the album title to Carl.

===Psychedelia===

The album is psychedelic music. Brian was publicly effused with the drug LSD during the mid-1960s and was using it to further his creative process, an admitted example being the 1965 single "California Girls". Throughout the latter half of the decade, Wilson was repeatedly been shown to have become interested in Eastern philosophy and the psychedelic experience, often pointing to ego loss as the key to a better way of living.Koestler, Arthur. 1964. The Act of Creation, p38. Penguin Books, New York. During the spring of 1965, Wilson had what he considered to be "a very religious experience" after consuming a full dose of LSD. He stated, "I learned a lot of things, like patience, understanding. I can't teach you, or tell you what I learned from taking it."[tpl]cite book|last=Badman|first=Keith|title=The Beach Boys: The Definitive Diary of America's Greatest Band, on Stage and in the Studio|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sLEMdjRhDgQC&pg=PA136|accessdate=11 August 2013|year=2004|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0-87930-818-6|page=136[/tpl] In light of his intellectual pursuits and self-described "crucial" interest in metaphysics, Wilson's response when asked about LSD and "Hang On To Your Ego" was that "Yeah, I had taken a few drugs, and I had gotten into that kind of thing. it just came up naturally". Despite the change from "Hang On To Your Ego" to "I Know There's An Answer", the psychedelic lyrics "they trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night" were kept in the song. Similarly for "Sloop John B", Wilson's lyric change from "this is the worst trip since I've been born" to "this is the worst trip I've ever been on" has been suggested by some to be another subtle nod to acid culture.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-beach-boys-sloop-john-b-20110526|title=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/lsd-70th-anniversary_n_3092536.html|title=LSD's 70th Anniversary: 10 Rock Lyrics From The 1960s That Pay Homage To Acid| work=Huffington Post|first=Jacobs|last=Matthew|date=April 16, 2013[/tpl] Elsewhere within Pet Sounds lyrical content, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; Pet Sounds did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other psychedelic rock groups.J. DeRogatis, Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock, (Milwaukee, Michigan: Hal Leonard, 2003), ISBN 0-634-05548-8 Music professors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell have written:
[tpl]Quote|On Pet Sounds, singer-songwriter Brian Wilson used an eclectic mixture of instruments, echo, reverb, and innovative mixing techniques learnt from Phil Spector to create a complex soundscape in which voice and music interweave tightly.…Whereas Sgt. Pepper explores the relationship between past and present, between metaphysical and material worlds, and between fantasy and reality, in a matter that foreshadows the temporal and narrative expansion of progressive bands from the late 1960s and 1970s, the personal intimacy of Pet Sounds set it at a slight remove from the psychedelic culture that informed the San Francisco sound of 1966—7. Nevertheless, the trippy feel of Pet Sounds related directly to Brian Wilson's experimentation with LSD.|Paul Hegarty, Martin Halliwell|Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s[tpl]cite book|last1=Hegarty|first1=Paul|last2=Halliwell|first2=Martin|title=Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=taA2AqdCAJ0C&pg=PT23|accessdate=11 August 2013|date=8 May 2011|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|isbn=978-0-8264-4483-7|pages=23–[/tpl][/tpl]

==Recording==

With writing well under way, Wilson recorded six backing tracks for the new material.[tpl]refn|group=nb|Sessions begun on [tpl]Start date|1965|07|12[/tpl] with "Sloop John B". After finishing the rushed Party! album, Wilson returned to the studio sporadically throughout November and December to finish "Sloop John B", and to begin work on "You Still Believe In Me". Fervent sessions devoted to the now-entitled Pet Sounds album were kicked off in January 1966, when Wilson began work on the instrumental tracks to "Let's Go Away for Awhile", "Wouldn't It Be Nice", and "Caroline, No".[tpl]cite web|last=Doe|first=Andrew G.|title=GIGS65|url=http://esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs65.html|publisher=esquarterly.com|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|last=Doe|first=Andrew G.|title=GIGS66|url=http://esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs66.html|publisher=esquarterly.com|accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][/tpl] The backing tracks for Pet Sounds were recorded over a four-month period, using major Los Angeles studios[tpl]refn|group=nb|Gold Star Studios, United Western Recorders, Sunset Sound Recorders, and CBS Columbia Square.[/tpl] and an ensemble that included highly regarded session musicians, including jazz guitarist Barney Kessel, bassist Carol Kaye and session drummer Hal Blaine. Although the self-taught Wilson often had entire arrangements worked out in his head,[tpl]refn|group=nb|Arrangements were usually written in a shorthand form for the other players by one of his session musicians. [/tpl] surviving tapes of his recording sessions show that he was open to his musicians, often taking advice and suggestions from them and even incorporating apparent 'mistakes' if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. Wilson said of his recording process with the Wrecking Crew:
Wilson had developed his production methods over several years, reaching a peak with Pet Sounds during late 1965 and early 1966. Wilson's approach was in some respects a refined interpretation of the famous "Wall of Sound" technique created by his former mentor and now rival Phil Spector. Equipped with newest state-of-the-art Ampex 8-track recorders, Wilson produced tracks of great complexity using his regular team of 'first call' players, sometimes known collectively as "the Wrecking Crew".[tpl]cite web | last =Hartman | first =Kent  | url =http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20070212-rock-n-roll-brian-wilson-beach-boys-glen-campbell-monkees-hal-blaine-carol-kaye-leon-russell.shtml  | title = The Wrecking Crew | publisher =American Heritage.com | accessdate = March 3, 2009[/tpl] Wilson's typical production method on Pet Sounds was to record the instrumental backing tracks for each song as a live ensemble performance direct onto 4-track recorders. His engineer Larry Levine reported that Wilson also typically mixed these backing tracks live, as they were being taped, subsequently transferring the sounds onto 8-track machines.[tpl]cite book|last=Moorefield |first=Virgil |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Producer_as_Composer.html?id=PZ0R4_Oxr-4C&pg=PA18 |p=18 |title=The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music - Virgil Moorefield - Google Boeken |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |accessdate=2014-03-12 |isbn=0-262-13457-8[/tpl] Like Spector, Wilson was a pioneer of the 'studio as instrument' concept, exploiting novel combinations of sounds that sprang from the use of multiple electric instruments and voices in an ensemble and combining them with echo and reverberation. He often doubled bass, guitar and keyboard parts, blending them with reverberation and adding other unusual instruments.Booklet notes, Pet Sounds stereo/mono CD release.
When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with a substantial portion of a new album, with music that was in many ways a radical departure from their earlier attempts.[tpl]cite book|first=Mike |last=Alsford |title=Heroes and Villains |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sDvRgfvoQpsC&pg=PA149 |year=2006 |publisher=Baylor University Press |isbn=978-1-932792-92-8[/tpl] Both Asher and Wilson state that there was resistance to the project from within the group, but on this occasion, Wilson's conviction convinced the other members.

In spite of the availability of sophisticated multitrack recording, Wilson always mixed the final version of his recordings in mono, as did Phil Spector. He did this because he felt that mono mastering provided more sonic control over the final result, regardless of the vagaries of speaker placement and sound system quality. In that era radio and TV were broadcast in mono and most domestic and automotive radios and record players were monophonic. Another and more personal reason for Wilson's preference for mono was due to his almost total deafness in his right ear, rumored to be the result of childhood injury to his eardrum caused by a blow from his violent father Murry Wilson, although Wilson claimed that he was born deaf in one ear.[tpl]cite book|last=Schinder |first=Scott |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=chj91X0dWzUC |title=Icons of Rock - Google Boeken |publisher=Greenwood Books |year=2007 |accessdate=2014-03-12[/tpl]
These backing tracks were then dubbed down onto one track of an 8-track recorder,[tpl]refn|group=nb|This was done at Columbia, because it was the only facility in LA with an 8-track[/tpl] and although much of the fine detail in the arrangements was often covered by the group's rich vocal harmonies, they interacted effectively with the vocal tracks. This mono recording meant that a stereo mixdown could not be achieved. Wilson's partial deafness made him indifferent to stereo and it was not until the advent of digital recording that it was possible to combine the instrumental and vocal session-tapes to achieve a true stereo release.David Leaf, Booklet notes, Pet Sounds stereo/mono CD release. Six of the remaining seven tracks were usually dedicated to each of the Beach Boys' vocals.[tpl]refn|group=nb|The five-piece group was by then being regularly augmented by singer Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member[/tpl] The last track was usually reserved for additional vocals and/or instruments and other 'sweetening' elements. 

===Outtakes===

On October 15, 1965, Wilson went to the studio to record an instrumental piece entitled "Three Blind Mice", bearing no musical connection to the nursery rhyme of the same name. It's not known what the piece's purpose was to be, but it was inexplicably included as part of the Beach Boys' 2011 release of The Smile Sessions. By February 1966, Wilson was in the studio with his session band laying down the first takes for a new composition, "Good Vibrations". During that month, Wilson gave Capitol a provisional track listing for the new LP, which included both "Sloop John B" and "Good Vibrations." This contradicts the long held misconception that "Sloop John B" was a forced inclusion as the hit single at Capitol's insistence: in late February, the song was weeks away from release.[tpl]cite book|author=Peter Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0 |page=7[/tpl] Wilson worked through February and into March fine-tuning the backing tracks. To the group's surprise he also dropped "Good Vibrations" from the running order, telling them that he wanted to spend more time on it. Al Jardine remembered: "At the time, we all had assumed that "Good Vibrations" was going to be on the album, but Brian decided to hold it out. It was a judgment call on his part; we felt otherwise but left the ultimate decision up to him." A third instrumental, called "Trombone Dixie", had been fully recorded, but it remained in the vaults until its inclusion on the album's 1990 remastered CD release.
Wilson devoted some Pet Sounds sessions to avant-garde indulgences such as an extended a cappela run-through of the children's song "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" exploiting the song's use of rounds via tape delay and overdubbing. At least half an hour of tape reels exist which involve Brian and friends attempting to create a psychedelic comedy album, foreshadowing much of his work on Smile, which was set to have followed Pet Sounds.[tpl]cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|title=Unsurpassed Masters, Vol. 14 (1966): The Alternate "Pet Sound" Album, Vol. 2 review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/unsurpassed-masters-vol-14-1966-the-alternate-pet-sound-album-vol-2-mw0000963894[/tpl] The only product of these sessions present in Pet Sounds was an excerpt of Brian's dogs barking accompanied by a sampled recording of passing trains  taken from the 1963 sound effects LP Mister D's Machine.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] About a year later Brian had moved on to burning wood in the studio.

In Australia, the album was released under the title The Fabulous Beach Boys on the Music for Pleasure label. However, unlike Beach Boys' Party!, Pet Sounds did not enjoy major commercial success. Its initial release in the US peaked at number ten, reportedly disappointing Wilson.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Much of the blame has been placed with Capitol Records, which did not promote the album as heavily as previous releases.

Its greatest success was in the UK, where it reached number two.

===Critical reception===

Pet Sounds is frequently cited by both critics and musicians as the greatest rock album of all time. Advocates include Mojo magazine and Paul McCartney, who acknowledges that it was the primary impetus for the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Although not originally a big seller, Pet Sounds has been influential since it was released.[tpl]cite web | url =http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19796/m1/| title = The Rubberization of Soul| publisher =UNT Digital Library| accessdate =April 9, 2011[/tpl] According to music journalist Stephen Davis, it was the first rock concept album. In his 1972 Rolling Stone review, Davis called it "by far" Brian Wilson's best album and said that its "trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel".[tpl]cite web|author=By Stephen Davis |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/pet-sounds-19720622 |title=Pet Sounds |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 22, 1972 [/tpl] Yahoo!

===Live performances===

The entire Pet Sounds album has been played live by The Beach Boys and by Brian Wilson. Several of its songs have become live staples for the group, including "Wouldn't It Be Nice", "Sloop John B" and "God Only Knows".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/the-beach-boys-3d6c17b.html|title=The Beach Boys Tour Statistics |publisher=setlist.fm |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
Brian Wilson performed the entire album live on three occasions on his 2002 and 2006 Pet Sounds tours, which included fellow band member Al Jardine at several shows. He also performed it twice on his 2013 tour, which again included Al Jardine as well as original Beach Boys guitarist David Marks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brian-wilson-pulls-off-a-surprise-pet-sounds-show-in-new-york-20131016|title=Brian Wilson Pulls Off a Surprise 'Pet Sounds' Show In New York|publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
"Wouldn't It Be Nice", "Sloop John B" and "God Only Knows" have been performed at most Beach Boys shows since the album release. "Wouldn't It Be Nice" has had several lead vocalists over the years due to Brian Wilson's absence from touring, including Carl Wilson, Al Jardine and Jeff Foskett. "Sloop John B" has also been a live staple with Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston or Carl Wilson often covering Brian's part. "God Only Knows" was long considered Carl Wilson's signature song at live shows until his death in 1998. Following his death Bruce Johnston began to sing the lead at live shows. During the band's 50th Anniversary Tour all three songs were played including "God Only Knows" featuring Carl Wilson's pre-recorded vocals and a tribute video.
"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times" and "Pet Sounds" were both performed live by The Beach Boys for the first time on the band's 50th Anniversary Tour. "Here Today" has only been performed by the Mike Love-led Beach Boys with he and Bruce Johnston alternating on the lead.
"Caroline, No" and "You Still Believe in Me" have been played by the band at several times during their live history. "Caroline, No" was played infrequently throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's with Carl Wilson on lead vocals. "You Still Believe in Me" was also played infrequently during the early 70's and again in the early 90's with Al Jardine on Brian's original lead.
"That's Not Me, Let's Go Away For Awhile" and "I Know There's An Answer" have only ever been performed by Brian Wilson during his Pet Sounds tours, the Beach Boys have never performed the songs live.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/brian-wilson-bd6c16a.html|title=Brian Wilson Tour Statistics |publisher=setlist.fm |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)" and "I'm Waiting For the Day" were both performed by Brian Wilson, but also by the Beach Boys in the 70's. With Brian absent from the group, "Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)" was performed with Carl Wilson on lead vocals. "I'm Waiting For The Day" was performed with backing member Billy Hinsche on lead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-beach-boys/1974/the-spectrum-philadelphia-pa-5bd1e7c4.html|title=The Beach Boys Tour Statistics |publisher=setlist.fm |accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
Close Beach Boys friend Scott Mathews planned a "Pet Sounds Live" world tour project that he designed and began spearheading in 1983 with full participation from Brian Wilson. However the tour never took flight due to one band member having creative difficulties in adjusting to changing the tour formula, even for such a special event and the much needed credibility the band would gain. When an unacceptable offer from the 'swing voter' was finally proposed in 1991, Mathews officially passed on pursuing the Pet Sounds performance project as he preferred to protect his relationship with close friends Carl Wilson. Brian Wilson however would go on to tour the album as previously mentioned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.psychedelicjams.com/2011/07/Dūrocs-Dūrocs.html |title=The Dūrocs - Dūrocs |publisher=Psychedelic Jams |date=July 2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beach+boys/biography.html |title=Beach Boys Biography |publisher=LyricsFreak.com |accessdate=January 8, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/4823643/a/Keepin%27+The+Summer+Alive.htm |title=Beach Boys - Keepin' the Summer Alive CD Album |publisher=CD Universe |accessdate=January 8, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=David Beard |url=http://www.exam.com/article/the-beach-boys-together-again |title=The Beach Boys Together Again |publisher=Examiner.com |date=2011-04-07 |accessdate=January 8, 2013[/tpl]

==Personnel==

The majority of the groups, session musicians and engineers information has derived largely from musician union contracts, web sources and books stating information about the record. This means that some of the information isn't certain or accurate. Furthermore, while contracts contain the session date, song title and hours booked, none was required to be precisely accurate. The date on the contracts were often changed to comply with union requirements.
