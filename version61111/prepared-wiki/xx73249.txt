Sarnia Cherie is used as the anthem of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. 'Sarnia' is a traditional Latin name for the island, hence, the title translates as 'Dear Guernsey'.  George Deighton wrote Sarnia Cherie in 1911, with Domenico Santangelo subsequently composing the tune later that year. The song was first performed at St. Julian's Theatre - which is now the Gaumont Cinema - in November 1911.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/history-heritage/sarnia-cherie/ |title=Sarnia Cherie » History & Heritage |publisher=This Is Guernsey |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15[/tpl] Sarnia Cherie was G.B. Edwards's title for The Book of Ebenezer le Page on the original typescript he gave to Edward Chaney in 1974 but Hamish Hamilton decided to use his subtitle when they published it in 1981, chosing, however, to add Deighton's song as an epigraph instead.The Book of Ebenezer Le Page  In 2005, the then Chief Minister, Laurie Morgan, called for an updated version, which seems to have been abandoned after it met with near-universal opposition.
The sheet music has been republished (c)2009 Ray Lowe, Sark.
A CD of 13 renditions of the song has been released. Included on the CD is a recording from May 9, 1945, when British Troops landed in St. Peter Port to Liberate the Island after 5 years of German Occupation during WWII.
