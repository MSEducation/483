Suffolk County is a county of Massachusetts. As of the 2010 census, the population was 722,023.[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/25/25025.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 26, 2013[/tpl]  The county seat is Boston, the state capital and largest city.[tpl]GR|6[/tpl] The county government was abolished in the late 1990s and Suffolk remains only as a geographic area, still used by entities such as the National Weather Service to define a weather alert affecting its footprint without listing every single town/city that embraces.

==History==

The county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered "that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four shires". Suffolk initially contained Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, Dedham, Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham.Davis, William T. Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, p. 44. The Boston History Company, 1895. The county was named after Suffolk, England, which means "southern folk."Thomas Cox, Anthony Hall, Robert Morden, Magna Britannia Antiqua & Nova: Or, A New, Exact, and Comprehensive Survey of the Ancient and Present State of Great Britain, Volume 5, (Caesar Ward and Richard Chandler: London, 1738), pg. 171 (accessed on Google Book Search, June 22, 2008)
In 1731, the extreme western portions of Suffolk County, which included Uxbridge, were split off to become part of Worcester County. In 1793, most of the original Suffolk County except for Boston, Chelsea, Hingham, and Hull (which remained in Suffolk) split off and became Norfolk County. Hingham and Hull would leave Suffolk County and join Plymouth County in 1803.http://www.norfolkcounty.org/index.cfm?pid=10429 Revere was set off from Chelsea and incorporated in 1846 and Winthrop was set off from Revere and incorporated in 1852.  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Boston annexed several adjacent cities and towns including Hyde Park, Roxbury, West Roxbury, and Dorchester from Norfolk County and Charlestown and Brighton from Middlesex County, resulting in an enlargement of Suffolk County.

==Law and government==

Like an increasing number of Massachusetts counties, Suffolk County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government.CIS: Historical Data Relating to the Incorporation of Counties in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff, district attorney, and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, executives or commissioners. Immediately prior to the abolition of county government, the authority of the Suffolk County Commission had for many years been exercised by the Boston City Council, even though three communities in the county are not part of the city. However, communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.See also: League of Women Voters page on counties.
