[[Word-of-mouth marketing]]

CATEGORIES: Promotion and marketing communications

Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM, WOM marketing), also called word of mouth advertising, differs from naturally occurring WOM, in that it is actively influenced or encouraged by organisations (e.g. 'seeding' a message in a network, rewarding regular consumers to enage in WOM, employing WOM 'agents'). While it is difficult to truly control WOM, research [tpl]cite journal|last=Lang|first=Bodo|coauthors=Hyde, Ken|title=Word of mouth: what we know and what we have yet to learn|journal=Journal of consumer satisfaction, dissatisfaction and complaining behavior|year=2013|volume=26|pages=1-18|url=Available through ProQuest database. ProQuest document ID: 1478021321|accessdate=January 2014[/tpl] has shown that there are three generic avenues to 'manage' WOM for the purpose of WOMM: 1) Build a strong WOM foundation (e.g. sufficient levels of satisfaction, trust and commitment), 2) Indirect WOMM management which implies that managers only have a moderate amount of control (e.g. controverisal advertising, teaser campaigns, customer membership clubs), 3) Direct WOMM management, which has higher levels of control (e.g. paid WOM 'agents', "friend get friend" schemes). Proconsumer WOM has been suggested as a counterweight to commercially motivated word of mouth.

==History==

George Silverman, a  psychologist, pioneered word-of-mouth marketing when he created what he called "teleconferenced peer influence groups" in order to engage physicians in dialogue about new pharmaceutical products.  Silverman noticed an interesting phenomenon while conducting focus groups with physicians in the early 1970s.  "One or two physicians who were having good experiences with a drug would sway an entire group of skeptics. They would even sway a dissatisfied group of ex-prescribers who had had negative experiences!"http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+history+of+word+of+mouth+marketing.-a0134908667
With the emergence of Web 2.0, many web start-ups like Facebook, YouTube, MySpace, and Digg have used buzz marketing by merging it with the social networks that they have developed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl][tpl]Clarify|date=July 2011[/tpl] With the increasing use of the Internet as a research and communications platform, word of mouth has become an even more powerful and useful resource for consumers and marketers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Schivinski|first=Bruno|coauthors=Dąbrowski, D.|title=The Impact of Brand Communication on Brand Equity Dimensions and Brand Purchase Intention Through Facebook|journal=Working Paper Series A, Gdansk University of Technology, Faculty of Management and Economics|year=2013|volume=4|issue=4|pages=2–23|url=http://www.zie.pg.gda.pl/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=a09080de-92f4-42d5-a1d1-a54d93de3221&groupId=10236[/tpl][tpl]Elucidate|date=April 2012[/tpl]
In October 2005, the advertising watchdog group Commercial Alert petitioned the United States FTC to issue guidelines requiring paid word-of-mouth marketers[tpl]contradiction-inline |reason=According to the lead, word-of-mouth marketing is unpaid|date=September 2012[/tpl] to disclose their relationship and related compensation with the company whose product they are marketing. The United States FTC stated that it would investigate situations in which the relationship between the word-of-mouth marketer of a product and the seller is not revealed and could influence the endorsement.  The FTC stated that it would pursue violators on a case-by-case basis. Consequences for violators may include cease-and-desist orders, fines or civil penalties.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101389.html?nav=rss_technology|title=FTC Moves to Unmask Word-of-Mouth Marketing|last=Shin|first=Annys|date=December 12, 2006|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-01-10[/tpl]
Research firm PQ Media estimated that in 2008, companies spent $1.54 billion on word-of-mouth marketing. While spending on traditional advertising channels was slowing, spending on word-of-mouth marketing grew 14.2 percent in 2008, 30 percent of that for food and drink brands.http://www.brandweek.com/bw/content_display/news-and-features/direct/e3ida92fc8ee6e8266300bfc3a21f882935
Despite the belief that most word of mouth is now online (or on mobile) the truth is the very opposite. The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science has shown that to achieve growth, brands must create word of mouth beyond core fan groups - meaning marketers should not focus solely on communities such as Facebook.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] According to Deloite further research has shown that 'most advocacy takes place offline' - instead it happens in person. According to the Journal of Advertising Research, 75% of all consumer conversations about brands happen face-to-face, 15% happen over the phone and just 10% online. This is backed up by research by WOM specialists, Keller Fay, who also claim that TV advertising creates the majority of brand related word of mouth, followed by PR.http://www.kellerfay.com[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]

==Concepts==

===Buzz===

Marketing buzz or simply "buzz" is a term used in word-of-mouth marketing—the interaction of consumers and users of a product or service serve to amplify the original marketing message.[tpl]cite journal|last=Thomas Jr|first=Greg|date=2006-07-11|journal=Journal of Consumer Behaviour|volume=4|issue=1|pages=64–72|title=Building the buzz in the hive mind|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112587927/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|accessdate=2009-06-08|doi=10.1002/cb.158[/tpl]  Some describe buzz as a form of hype among consumers,[tpl]cite news|title=the Buzz on Buzz|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1956.html|publisher=Harvard Business Review|author=Renée Dye|date=2001-01-29[/tpl] a vague but positive association, excitement, or anticipation about a product or service.  Positive "buzz" is often a goal of viral marketing, public relations, and of advertising on Web 2.0 media. The term refers both to the execution of the marketing technique, and the resulting goodwill that is created.  Examples of products with strong marketing buzz upon introduction were Harry Potter, the Volkswagen New Beetle, Pokémon, Beanie Babies, and the Blair Witch Project.

===Viral effects===

Viral marketing and viral advertising are buzzwords referring to marketing techniques that use pre-existing social networks to produce increases in brand awareness or to achieve other marketing objectives (such as product sales) through self-replicating viral processes, analogous to the spread of virus or computer viruses. It can be word-of-mouth delivered or enhanced by the network effects of the Internet.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2005-06-22-viral-usat_x.htm | title=USAToday: Viral advertising spreads through marketing plans | work=USA Today | first1=Theresa | last1=Howard | date=2005-06-23 | accessdate=2010-05-27[/tpl] June 23, 2005, 2005 Viral promotions may take the form of video clips, interactive Flash games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, or even text messages.  The goal of marketers interested in creating successful viral marketing programs is to identify individuals with high Social Networking Potential (SNP) — and have a high probability of being taken by another competitor — and create viral messages that appeal to this segment of the population.  The term "viral marketing" has also been used pejoratively to refer to stealth marketing campaigns—the unscrupulous use of astroturfing on-line combined with undermarket advertising in shopping centers to create the impression of spontaneous word-of-mouth enthusiasm.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/commentary/imomus/2007/05/imomus_0508 | title=Wired: Commentary: Sock Puppets Keep It Shill on YouTube | date=2007-05-08[/tpl] May 8, 2007

===Analyzing WOM===

Consumers may promote brands by word-of-mouth due to social, functional, and emotional factors. 
Research has identified thirteen brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, namely:

This research also found that while social and functional drivers are the most important for promotion via WOM online, the emotional driver predominates offline.
