==Critical reception==

Under the Gun said "Like most of the group’s catalog the song offers numerous tongue-in-cheek lyrics thrown together against a melody that’s too catchy for its own good. It’s the kind of well-structured song that gets stuck in your mind".http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/05/21/single-review-falling-in-reverse-fashionably-land/ Metalholic: "'Fashionably Late' is at the opposite end of the spectrum compared to 'Alone'. Where 'Alone' has rapping and is intense and angry 'Fashionably Late' is upbeat, completely easy-going and has a more pop rock vibe to it".http://metalholic.com/falling-in-reverse-fashionably-late-single-arrives/
