A rooster also known as a cockerel or cock, is a male gallinaceous bird. The term usually refers to a male chicken (Gallus gallus).
Immature male chickens less than one year old are called cockerels. The term "rooster" originates in the United States,Hugh Rawson "Why Do We Say...? Rooster", American Heritage, Aug./Sept. 2006. and the term is widely used throughout North America, as well as Australia and New Zealand.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rooster/search/results.cfm?kw1=rooster&kw2=&op=all&searchorder=2&display=10&start=0&thepage=1&st=gsa&mediatype=Any&dates=Any|title=Search results: Rooster|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]; [tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/cockerel/search/results.cfm?kw1=cockerel&kw2=&op=all&searchorder=2&display=10&start=0&thepage=1&st=gsa&mediatype=Any&dates=Any|title=Search results: Cockerel|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl], though the results for "Rooster" are heavily affected by a rugby team of that name. The older terms "cock" or "cockerel", the latter denoting a young cock, are used in the United Kingdom and Ireland.poultry.ie
"Roosting" is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night, which is done by both sexes. The rooster is polygamous, but cannot guard several nests of eggs at once. He guards the general area where his hens are nesting, and will attack other roosters that enter his territory. During the daytime, a rooster will often sit on a high perch, usually [tpl]convert|3|to|5|ft|1|m|abbr=in|disp=flip[/tpl] off the ground, to serve as a lookout for his flock. He will sound a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby.
(The term "cock" is also used generally to refer to a male of other species of bird, for example "Cock sparrow".)

==Crowing==

The rooster is often portrayed as crowing at the break of dawn ("cock-a-doodle-doo") and will almost always start crowing before 4 months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.[tpl]cite web|last=Read|first=Gina|title=Sexing Chickens|url=http://successwithpoultry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/sexing-chickens.html|work=Keeping Chickens Newsletter|publisher=http://www.keepingchickensnewsletter.com|accessdate=5 July 2008[/tpl] He can often be seen sitting on fence posts or other objects, where he crows to proclaim his territory. However, this idea is more romantic than real, as a rooster can and will crow at any time of the day. Some roosters are especially vociferous, crowing almost constantly, while others only crow a few times a day. These differences are dependent both upon the rooster's breed and individual personality. He has several other calls as well, and can cluck, similar to the hen. Roosters will occasionally make a patterned series of clucks to attract hens to a source of food, the same way a mother hen does for her chicks.

==Capons==

A capon is a castrated rooster. In the caponization procedure, the bird's testes are completely removed; a surgical procedure is required for this as the rooster's sexual organs are internal. As a result of this procedure, certain male physical characteristics will experience stunted development:
Caponization also affects the disposition of the bird. Removal of the bird's testes eliminates the male sex hormones, lessening the male sex instincts and changing their behaviour: the birds become more docile, less active, and tend not to fight.
This procedure produces a unique type of poultry meat which is favoured by a specialized market. The meat of normal uncastrated roosters has a tendency to become coarse, stringy and tough as the birds age. This process does not occur in the capon. As caponized roosters grow more slowly than intact males, they accumulate more body fat. The concentration of fat in both the light and dark areas of the capon meat is greater than in that of the uncastrated males. Overall, it is often thought that capon meat is more tender, juicy, and flavorful than regular chicken.

==Cockfight==

A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two gamecocks or cocks, with the first use of the word gamecock (denoting use of the cock in game, sport, pastime or entertainment) appearing in 1646.gamecock - Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary - first use of word - 1646 after the term “cock of the game” used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the secular sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607. Gamecocks are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match. This process is called dubbing. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their blood, which increases their chances of winning.  Cockfighting or more accurately secular cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.[tpl]cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/26/cf.opinion.cockfighting/index.html |title= Should cockfighting be outlawed in Oklahoma? |date= 26 November 2002|accessdate=2009-08-17 | work=CNN[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  Usually wagers are made on the outcome of the match, with the surviving or last-bird-standing being declared the winner. There are religious significance and aspects of the rooster and the cockfight which are exampled by the religious belief of Tabuh Rah, a religious and spiritual cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in the Balinese Hinduism spiritual appeasement exercise of Tabuh Rah, a form of animal sacrifice, where ritual fights usually take place outside the temple and follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred lontar manuscripts.Handbook,  3rd, Joshua Eliot, Liz Capaldi, & Jane Bickersteth, (Footprint - Travel Guides) 2001 Similarly within the religious schema of Christianity and the cockfight within a religious, spiritual and sacred context, there are numerous representations of the rooster or the cock and the cockfight as a religious vessel found in the Catacombs from the earliest period[tpl]cite book|title=Cyclopaedia of biblical, theological and ecclesiastical literature, Volume 12|author=Rev.

==The cockerel "waltz"==

The cockerel "waltz", when the cockerel struts in a half circle with one wing extended down, is an aggressive approach signifying to females his dominance, and usually, the female will submit by running or moving away from the cockerel in acknowledgement. On rare occasions, the hen will attempt to fight the cockerel for dominance. Once dominance is established, the cockerel will rarely waltz again. When other cockerels are in the hen yard, this waltz is used significantly more and most cockerels will waltz together if dominance has not been established; either one will back off, or the two cockerels will fight. Note also that the cockerel will waltz again if he is taken out of the pen for a period, usually 24 hours, and put back.
Some more aggressive cockerels will drop and extend both wings and puff out all their body feathers to give the hens and/or other cocks the impression of a larger size, and charge through the hen yard like a bull.

==Religion and spiritual belief systems==

===Animism, shamanism and tribal religions===

In Southeast Asia, as in Mexico, understandings and interpretations of indigenous beliefs of the veneration of spirits and deities remain strong and for many who are practicing Christians there is still the veneration of the traditional spirits (anito) as in northern Philippines.  Animist beliefs extend to the rooster and the cockfight, ”a popular form of fertility worship among almost all Southeast Asians”Using Spirit Worship to Infuse Southeast Asia into the K-16 Classroom - Marc Jason Gilbert, Department of History and Sociology, North Georgia College and State University http://tuninst.net/Myanmar/Nat-worship/nat-in-classroom/nat-in-classroom.htm[tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  further considered by some within the Judeo-Christian ethic as a form of Baal or Baalim.

The Samaritans or 'Cutheans' were a very early ethnic group, widely distributed and powerful. From Assyria they extended to India, China, Arabia Petraea and Abyssinia. They were also introduced by the Assyrian Empire into Samaria, in a policy of mass deportations. They had their Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim, opposite the Temple in Jerusalem, and they worshipped the Mesopotamian deity Nergal: his emblem was a cock (rooster).(2 Kings, 17:30).

The Zohar (iii. 22b, 23a, 49b), the book of Jewish mysticism and collection of writings on the Torah written by first century tannaic sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai (Rashbi), tells of a celestial manifestation, which causes the crowing of the roosters; known also in the Talmud, is "blessed be He who has given the cock intelligence,"(Ber. 60b).[tpl]Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |title=BARUCH, APOCALYPSE OF (Greek) |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2563-baruch-apocalypse-of-greek|first= |last= |volume= |page=[/tpl] and as well as Job 38:36 in the Douay-Rheims Bible.
Not only “In the rabbinic literature, the cockcrow is used as general marking of time”,The Chronology of the Crucifixion – A Comparison of the Gospel Accounts – Tim Hegg TorahResource  - 2009 but also some of the Sages interpreted the "cockcrow" to mean the voice of the Temple officer who summoned all priests, Levites, and Israelites to their duties and used as such because the Hebrew gever was used also to mean a "rooster" in addition to the meaning of "man, strong man".[tpl]cite book|title=The Chronology of the Crucifixion - A comparison of the Gospel Accounts|author=Tim Hegg|publisher=TorahResource|year=2009[/tpl]
The Talmud likewise provides the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks"A Treasury of Jewish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron - 1985 - (Jonathan ben Nappaha. Talmud: Erubin 100b), which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins"(Young's Literal Translation) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" within the Book of Proverbs 30:29-31. Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon(Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of "a cock girded about the loins" within Proverbs 30:31(Douay–Rheims Bible) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18 - Michael V.

The Hebrew term zarzir, which literally means “girt”; “that which is girt in the loins” (BDB 267 s.v.) is recognized in the Targum as well as the Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic, LXX and Vulgate with all referencing the fighting rooster of fighting cock as the religious vessel.  The ancient Hebrew versions identified the Hebrew "a girt one of the loins" of Proverbs 30:31 as a rooster, "which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a fighting cock",Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament HALOT 1:281 s.v. zarzir with also the Arabic sarsar or sirsir being an onomatopoeticon or onomatopoeia for rooster(alektor) as the Hebrew zarzir of Proverbs 30:31.

In the Jewish religious practice of Kapparos, a rooster as a religious vessel is swung around the head and then sacrificed on the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the  Day of Atonement. The purpose of the sacrifice is the expiation of sins of the man as the animal symbolically receives all the man's sins, which is based on the reconciliation of Isaiah 1:18.  The religious practice is mentioned for the first time by Natronai ben Hilai, Gaon of the Academy of Sura in Babylonia, in 853 C.E., who describes it as a custom of the Babylonian Jews and further explained by Jewish scholars in the ninth century by that since the Hebrew word geber(Gever)Complete Jewish Bible by David H. Stern -1998 means both "man" and "rooster" the rooster may act or serve as a palpable substitute as a religious vessel in place of the man with the practice also having been as a custom of the Persian Jews.
