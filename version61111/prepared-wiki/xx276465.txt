Hidden algebra provides a formal semantics for use in the field of software engineering, especially for concurrent distributed object systems.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/projs/halg.html | title=Hidden Algebra Homepage | publisher=University of California, San Diego, USA |accessdate=September 26, 2011 | authorlink=Joseph Goguen | first=Joseph | last=Goguen [/tpl] It supports correctness proofs.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~grant/Research/Alg/HA/index.html | title=Hidden Algebra: Behavioural specification and proof for systems with state | publisher=University of London, UK | date=July 31, 2006 | accessdate=September 26, 2011 | author=Malcolm, Grant[/tpl]
Hidden algebra was studied by Joseph Goguen.[tpl]cite paper | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=340889 | title=Hidden algebra and concurrent distributed software | publisher=ACM, USA | work=ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes | volume=25 | number=1 | date=January 2000 | doi=10.1145/340855.340889 | accessdate=September 26, 2011 | authorlink=Joseph Goguen | first=Joseph | last=Goguen [/tpl] It handles features of large software-based systems, including concurrency, distribution, nondeterminism, and local states. It also handled object-oriented features like classes, subclasses (inheritance), attributes, and methods. Hidden algebra generalizes process algebra and transition system approaches.
