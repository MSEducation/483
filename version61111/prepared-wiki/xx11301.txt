Scandium is a chemical element with symbol Sc and atomic number 21. A silvery-white metallic d-block element, it has historically been sometimes classified as a rare earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanoids. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.
Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, it took until the 1970s before applications for scandium were developed. The positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of the pure metal is around a hundred pounds a year on average.Gray, Theodore (2012) The Elements, Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, p. 57, ISBN 1579128955.
The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements shown as group 3, above, the predominant oxidation state is +3.

==Properties==

===Chemical characteristics of the element===

Scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance. It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide."Scandium." Los Alamos National Laboratory. Retrieved 2013-07-17.

===Isotopes===

Scandium exists naturally exclusively as the isotope 45Sc, which has a nuclear spin of 7/2. Thirteen radioisotopes have been characterized with the most stable being 46Sc with a half-life of 83.8 days, 47Sc with a half-life of 3.35 days, and 48Sc with a half-life of 43.7 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 4 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 2 minutes. This element also has five meta states with the most stable being 44mSc (t½ = 58.6 h).[tpl]cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128|publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O.|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J.|last4 = Wapstra|first4 = A.H.[/tpl]
The isotopes of scandium range from 36Sc to 60Sc. The primary decay mode at masses lower than the only stable isotope, 45Sc, is electron capture, and the primary mode at masses above it is beta emission. The primary decay products at atomic weights below 45Sc are calcium isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are titanium isotopes.

===Occurrence===

In terms of earth's crust, scandium is not particularly rare. Estimates vary from 18 to 25 ppm, which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt (20–30 ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun.[tpl]cite book|title =CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|first = David R.|last = Lide|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-8493-0485-9|pages = 4–28|publisher =CRC Press|location =Boca Raton[/tpl] However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals.[tpl]cite book| first = F.|last = Bernhard|chapter = Scandium mineralization associated with hydrothermal lazurite-quartz veins in the Lower Austroalpie Grobgneis complex, East Alps, Austria|title = Mineral Deposits in the Beginning of the 21st Century|year = 2001|isbn = 90-265-1846-3| publisher = Balkema| location = Lisse[/tpl] Rare minerals from Scandinavia[tpl]cite journal|title = Scandium – Mineraler I Norge|first = Roy|last = Kristiansen|journal = Stein|year = 2003|pages = 14–23|language = Norwegian|url = http://www.nags.net/Stein/2003/Sc-mineraler.pdf[/tpl] and Madagascar[tpl]cite journal|journal=Geological Journal|volume = 22|page= 253|year =1987|title = Mineralized pegmatites in Africa|first = O.|last = von Knorring|coauthors = Condliffe, E.|doi = 10.1002/gj.3350220619[/tpl] such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.
The stable form of scandium is created in supernovas via the r-process.[tpl]cite journal|author= Cameron, A.G.W.|title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis| journal=CRL-41|date=June 1957|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf[/tpl]

==Production==

World production of scandium is in the order of 2 tonnes per year in the form of scandium oxide. The primary production is 400 kg while the rest is from stockpiles of Russia generated during the Cold War. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare earth mines in Bayan Obo, China and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula, Russia. In each case, scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.
The production of metallic scandium is in the order of 10 kg per year.[tpl]cite web|first =Y.|last = Deschamps|accessdate = 2008-10-21| url = http://www.mineralinfo.org/Substance/Scandium/Sc.pdf|publisher = mineralinfo.com|title = Scandium[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/scandium/mcs-2008-scand.pdf|publisher = United States Geological Survey| accessdate =2008-10-20|title = Mineral Commodity Summaries 2008: Scandium[/tpl] The oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and reduced with metallic calcium.
Madagascar and Iveland-Evje region in Norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content, thortveitite (Sc,Y)2(Si2O7) and kolbeckite ScPO4·2H2O, but these are not being exploited.
The absence of reliable, secure, stable and long term production has limited commercial applications of scandium. Despite this low level of use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells. 

==Compounds==

The chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion, Sc3+. The radii of M3+ ions in the table below indicate that in terms of chemical properties, scandium ions are more similar to those of yttrium than to those of aluminium. In part for this similarity, scandium is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.

===Oxides and hydroxides===

The oxide Sc2O3 and the hydroxide Sc(OH)3 are amphoteric:[tpl]cite book|author=Cotton, Simon |title=Lanthanide and actinide chemistry|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lvQpiVHrb78C&pg=PA108|accessdate=23 June 2011|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-01006-8|pages=108–[/tpl]
The α- and γ- forms of scandium oxide hydroxide (ScO(OH)), are isostructural with their aluminium oxide hydroxide counterparts.[tpl]cite journal|last=Christensen|first= A. Nørlund|coauthors=Stig Jorgo Jensen|year=1967|title=Hydrothermal Preparation of alpha-ScOOH and of gamma-ScOOH. Crystal Structure of alpha-ScOOH|journal= Acta Chemica Scandinavica|volume=21|pages=1121–126.|doi= 10.3891/acta.chem.scand.21-0121[/tpl] Solutions of Sc3+ in water are acidic because of hydrolysis.

===Halides and pseudohalides===

The halides ScX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) are very soluble in water, but ScF3 is insoluble. In all four halides the scandium is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, ScF3 dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form ScF63−. The coordination number 6 is typical of Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium(III) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.

===Organic derivatives===

Scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp), similar to the behavior of the lanthanides. One example is the chlorine-bridged dimer, ScCp2Cl2 and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands.[tpl]cite journal|title=Model Ziegler-Natta a-Olefin Polymerization Catalysts Derived from {(η5-C5Me4)SiMe2(η1-NCMe3)}(PMe3)Sc(μ2-H)2 and {(η5-C5Me4)SiMe2(η1-NCMe3)}Sc(μ2-CH2CH2CH3)2.

Soc.|volume=116|page=4623 |year=1994|doi=10.1021/ja00090a011[/tpl]

===Uncommon oxidation states===

Compounds that feature scandium in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 is one of the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Corbett|first=J.D.|year=1981|title=Extended metal-metal bonding in halides of the early transition metals |journal=Acc. Chem. Res.|volume=14|pages=239–246|doi= 10.1021/ar00068a003|issue=8[/tpl] Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.

==History==

Dmitri Mendeleev, creator of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element ekaboron, with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite. Nilson prepared 2 grams of scandium oxide of high purity.[tpl]cite journal|title = Sur l'ytterbine, terre nouvelle de M. Marignac|url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30457/f639.table| journal = Comptes Rendus|author = Nilson, Lars Fredrik|volume = 88| year =1879|pages = 642–647|language=French[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber Scandium, ein neues Erdmetall|journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft|volume = 12|issue =1|year = 1879|pages = 554–557|author = Nilson, Lars Fredrik|doi = 10.1002/cber.187901201157|language=German[/tpl] He named the element scandium, from the Latin Scandia meaning "Scandinavia". Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.[tpl]cite journal|title = Sur le scandium| url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f432.table|journal = Comptes Rendus|author = Cleve, Per Teodor |volume = 89| year =1879|pages=419–422|language=French[/tpl]
Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture, at 700–800 °C, of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides.[tpl]cite journal|title = Über das metallische Scandium| journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|volume = 231| issue = 1–2| year =1937| pages = 54–62| first= Werner|last = Fischer| coauthors = Brünger, Karl; Grieneisen, Hans|doi = 10.1002/zaac.19372310107|language=German[/tpl] The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. The use for aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent.Burrell, A. Willey Lower "Aluminum scandium alloy" [tpl]US patent|3,619,181[/tpl] issued on November 9, 1971. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.[tpl]cite journal|title = Effect of Scandium on the Structure and Properties of Aluminum Alloys|journal =Metal Science and Heat Treatment|volume = 45|year = 2003|page= 246|doi =10.1023/A:1027368032062|first = V.

==Applications==

The addition of scandium to aluminium limits the excessive grain growth that occurs in the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other aluminium alloys and the volume of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of age-hardening aluminium alloys is reduced. Both of these effects increase the usefulness of the alloy.[tpl]why|date=May 2013[/tpl] However, titanium alloys, which are similar in lightness and strength, are cheaper and much more widely used.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aveTxwZm40UC&pg=PA2274|page=2274|author=Schwarz, James A.; Contescu, Cristian I.; Putyera, Karol |publisher=CRC Press|year= 2004|isbn=0-8247-5049-7|title=Dekker encyclopédia of nanoscience and nanotechnology, Volume 3[/tpl]
The main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. They were used in the Russian military aircraft, specifically the MiG-21 and MiG-29.
