His other sister, Lizzy Calcioli, has said, "Most of our social activities were involved with Scientology or our Jewish family. It would get very confusing when people would ask my religion as a kid. I’d say, 'I’m a Jewish Scientologist.[tpl]' "[/tpl] Gaiman says that he is not a Scientologist, and that like Judaism, Scientology is his family's religion.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/25/100125fa_fact_goodyear|title= Kid Goth Neil Gaiman’s fantasies|first= Dana|last= Goodyear|date= 25 January 2010|publisher= The New Yorker|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130427005709/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/25/100125fa_fact_goodyear|archivedate= 27 April 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl] About his personal views, Gaiman has stated, "I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe. I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe. I don't know, I think there's probably a 50/50 chance. It doesn't really matter to me."[tpl]cite journal|last = Whitaker|first = Steve|authorlink = Steve Whitaker|title = Neil Gaiman interview|magazine = FA|issue = 109|pages = 24–29|date = January 1989[/tpl]
Gaiman was able to read at the age of four. He said, "I was a reader. I loved reading. Reading things gave me pleasure. I was very good at most subjects in school, not because I had any particular aptitude in them, but because normally on the first day of school they'd hand out schoolbooks, and I'd read them—which would mean that I'd know what was coming up, because I'd read it."[tpl]cite book|last= Abbey|first= Cherie D. (ed.)|title= Biography Today General Series|year=2010|pages= 66|publisher= Omnigraphics Inc.|isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7[/tpl] When he was about ten years old, he read his way through the works of Dennis Wheatley, where especially The Ka of Gifford Hillary and The Haunting of Toby Jugg made an impact on him.Before there was Ian Fleming, there was Dennis Wheatley One work that made a particular impression on him was J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings from his school library, although it only had the first two books in the trilogy. He consistently took them out and read them. He would later win the school English prize and the school reading prize, enabling him finally to acquire the third book in the trilogy.
For his seventh birthday, Gaiman received C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series. He later recalled that "I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader, where he would just talk to you ... I'd think, 'Oh, my gosh, that is so cool! I want to do that! When I become an author, I want to be able to do things in parentheses.' I liked the power of putting things in brackets." Narnia also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956 Carnegie Medal won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, "... it had to be the most important literary award there ever was" and observing, "if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you're really doing well – it's like writing a letter to yourself aged seven."
Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was another childhood favourite, and "a favourite forever. Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart." He also enjoyed Batman comics as a child.
Gaiman was educated at several Church of England schools, including Fonthill School in East Grinstead, Ardingly College (1970–74), and Whitgift School in Croydon (1974–77).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.exclusivebooks.com/features/authors/ngaiman.php|title=Neil Gaiman|publisher=Exclusive Books|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081204103401/http://www.exclusivebooks.com/features/authors/ngaiman.php|archivedate=4 December 2008|accessdate=2 February 2012[/tpl] His father's position as a public relations official of the Church of Scientology was the cause of the seven-year-old Gaiman being blocked from entering a boys' school, forcing him to remain at the school that he had previously been attending.[tpl]cite news|title=Head Bars Son of Cult Man|work=The Times|date=13 August 1968|page=2|url=http://cosmedia.freewinds.be/media/articles/tim130868.html|quote=A headmaster has refused the son of a scientologist entry to a preparatory school until, he says, the cult "clears its name".

==Career==

===Journalism, early writings, and literary influences===

As a child and a teenager, Gaiman read the works of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Lewis Carroll, James Branch Cabell, Edgar Allan Poe, Michael Moorcock, Ursula K. Le Guin, Harlan Ellison, Rudyard Kipling, Lord Dunsany and G. K. Chesterton.Abbey p. 68 He later became a fan of science fiction, reading the works of authors as diverse as Alan Moore, Samuel R. Delany, Roger Zelazny, Robert A. Heinlein, H. P. Lovecraft, Thorne Smith, and Gene Wolfe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
In the early 1980s, Gaiman pursued journalism, conducting interviews and writing book reviews, as a means to learn about the world and to make connections that he hoped would later assist him in getting published. He wrote and reviewed extensively for the British Fantasy Society.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|title= Works by Gaiman - Book Reviews|date= no date|publisher= NeilGaimanBibliography.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017032546/http://neilgaimanbibliography.com/bookreviews.html|archivedate= 17 October 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl] His first professional short story publication was "Featherquest", a fantasy story, in Imagine Magazine in May 1984.
When waiting for a train at London's Victoria Station in 1984, Gaiman noticed a copy of Swamp Thing written by Alan Moore, and carefully read it. Moore's fresh and vigorous approach to comics had such an impact on Gaiman that he would later write; "that was the final straw, what was left of my resistance crumbled. I proceeded to make regular and frequent visits to London's Forbidden Planet shop to buy comics".
In 1984, he wrote his first book, a biography of the band Duran Duran, as well as Ghastly Beyond Belief, a book of quotations, with Kim Newman. Even though Gaiman thought he did a terrible job, the book's first edition sold out very quickly. When he went to relinquish his rights to the book, he discovered the publisher had gone bankrupt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmfCGy_ZLg |title=Authors at Google – Neil Gaiman interview |publisher=Youtube.com |date=3 October 2006 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] After this, he was offered a job by Penthouse. He refused the offer.
He also wrote interviews and articles for many British magazines, including Knave. During this he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms, including Gerry Musgrave, Richard Grey, and "a couple of house names".[tpl]cite web|url= http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/01/rumour-control.html|title= Rumour control?|first= Neil|last= Gaiman |publisher= Neil Gaiman's Journal|date=2 January 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120215045349/http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/01/rumour-control.html|archivedate= 15 February 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] Gaiman has said he ended his journalism career in 1987 because British newspapers regularly publish untruths as fact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://twitter.com/neilhimself/statuses/8379971068 |title=Neil Gaiman – Journalism |publisher= Twitter.com |date=29 January 2010|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Kanazawa |first=Satoshi |url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201001/british-newspapers-make-things|title=Psychology Today – British Newspapers Make Things Up |publisher=Psychologytoday.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130819193027/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201001/british-newspapers-make-things|archivedate= 19 August 2013|deadurl= no|date= 24 January 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
In the late 1980s, he wrote Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion in what he calls a "classic English humour" style.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue345/interview.html|title= Neil Gaiman hitchhikes through Douglas Adams' hilarious galaxy|first= Kathie|last= Huddleston|date= no date|publisher= Science Fiction Weekly|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612042852/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue345/interview.html|archivedate= 12 June 2008|deadurl= yes[/tpl] Following on from that he wrote the opening of what would become his collaboration with Terry Pratchett on the comic novel Good Omens'', about the impending apocalypse.

===Comics and graphic novels===

After forming a friendship with comic-book writer Alan Moore,[tpl]cite book|last = Olsen|first = Steven P.|title = Neil Gaiman (Library of Graphic Novelists)|publisher = Rosen Publishing|year = 2005|pages = 16–18|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Jc9MaZrG3j8C&pg=PA18&dq=gaiman%20-%20moore%20-%20friendship&hl=en&ei=g-cuTfG1DsexhQeA7tHmCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn = 978-1404202856[/tpl] Gaiman started writing comic-books, picking up Marvelman after Moore finished his run on the series. Gaiman and artist Mark Buckingham collaborated on several issues of the series before its publisher, Eclipse Comics, collapsed, leaving the series unfinished. His first published comic strips were four short Future Shocks for 2000 AD in 1986–7. He wrote three graphic novels with his favourite collaborator and long-time friend Dave McKean: Violent Cases, Signal to Noise, and The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Mr. Punch. Impressed with his work, DC Comics hired him in February 1987,[tpl]cite book|last = Bender|first = Hy|title = The Sandman Companion|publisher = DC Comics|year = 1999|pages = 20–22|isbn = 978-1563894657[/tpl] and he wrote the limited series Black Orchid.[tpl]Cite book|last = Irvine|first = Alex|author-link = Alexander C.

The Sandman tells the tale of the ageless, anthropomorphic personification of Dream that is known by many names, including Morpheus. The series began in January 1989 and concluded in March 1996.Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 238: "In arguably one of the greatest achievements in serialized modern comic books, writer Neil Gaiman crafted the seventy-five-issue ongoing series The Sandman, introducing its readers to a complex world of horror and fantasy." In the eighth issue of The Sandman, Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, who would become as popular as the series' title character.Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 240: "Neil Gaiman, aided by penciller Mike Dringenberg, introduced the character Death to a fascinated readership...Death was an instant hit and arguably became more popular than the Sandman himself." The Death: The High Cost of Living limited series launched DC's Vertigo line in 1993.Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 262: "In March 1993, DC Comics debuted a three-issue limited series entitled Death: The High Cost of Living...Written by Neil Gaiman and drawn by future comics superstar Chris Bachalo, The High Cost of Living had one notable trait besides a brilliant story: its cover bore a new logo. With this debut, DC's provocative new mature-reader imprint, Vertigo, was born." The 75 issues of the regular series, along with an illustrated prose text and a special containing seven short stories, have been collected into 12 volumes that remain in print, 14 if the Death: The High Cost of Living and Death: The Time of Your Life spin-offs are included. Artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel and Michael Zulli, lettering by Todd Klein, colours by Daniel Vozzo, and covers by Dave McKean. The series became one of DC's top selling titles, eclipsing even Batman and Superman.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/22/how-we-made-sandman-gaiman?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title= Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean: how we made The Sandman|first= Phil|last= Hoad|date= 21 October 2013|publisher= The Guardian|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131025183948/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/22/how-we-made-sandman-gaiman?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|archivedate= 25 October 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl] Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work "astonishing" and noted that The Sandman was "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before."[tpl]cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|chapter= The Sandman's Coming: A New Approach to Making Myths|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|publisher = Bulfinch Press|year = 1995|page = 206|isbn = 0821220764[/tpl] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success as a series of graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure."[tpl]cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Dark Age 1984-1998|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= Taschen America|year=2010|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 567[/tpl]
Gaiman and Jamie Delano were to become co-writers of the Swamp Thing series following Rick Veitch. An editorial decision by DC to censor Veitch's final storyline caused both Gaiman and Delano to withdraw from the title.[tpl]cite book|last1 = Duncan|first1 = Randy|last2 = Smith|first2 = Matthew J.|title = Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman, Volume 1|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2013|pages = 741–742|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=2GNaoeiY51EC&pg=PA741&lpg=PA741&dq=Neil+Gaiman+Jamie+Delano+Swamp+Thing&source=bl&ots=MSdLlzHQES&sig=91GCtO5vivRiJLoKW939oSOU0NA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NZFqUoKbF5G6yAHX-4GADg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Neil%20Gaiman%20Jamie%20Delano%20Swamp%20Thing&f=false|isbn = 978-0313399237|quote= DC's censorship of Veitch's Swamp Thing #88 (1989) had a lasting negative impact on the series...With Veitch's immediate departure, the team that had been groomed to follow Veitch (writers Neil Gaiman and Jamie Delano) also left the title in solidarity with Veitch.[/tpl]
In 1990, Gaiman wrote The Books of Magic, a four-part mini-series that provided a tour of the mythological and magical parts of the DC Universe through a frame story about an English teenager who discovers that he is destined to be the world's greatest wizard.Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 247: "Neil Gaiman chronicled the adventures of magic pupil Timothy Hunter in this miniseries. each issue explored  the realms of magic as portrayed by a different painter." The miniseries was popular, and sired an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber.

In the mid-1990s, he also created a number of new characters and a setting that was to be featured in a title published by Tekno Comix. The concepts were then altered and split between three titles set in the same continuity:  Lady Justice, Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man, and Teknophage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.neilgaiman.info/Teknophage |title=Teknophage |publisher=Neilgaiman.info |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] They were later featured in Phage: Shadow Death and Wheel of Worlds. Although Gaiman's name appeared prominently on all titles, he was not involved in writing of any of the above-mentioned books.
Gaiman wrote a semi-autobiographical story about a boy's fascination with Michael Moorcock's anti-hero Elric of Melniboné for Ed Kramer's anthology Tales of the White Wolf. In 1996, Gaiman and Ed Kramer co-edited The Sandman: Book of Dreams. Nominated for the British Fantasy Award, the original fiction anthology featured stories and contributions by Tori Amos, Clive Barker, Gene Wolfe, Tad Williams, and others.
Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling, Gaiman said: "One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was, in many ways, untouched ground. It was virgin territory. When I was working on Sandman, I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle. I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before. When I’m writing novels I’m painfully aware that I’m working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw-droppingly brilliant things for, you know, three-four thousand years now. You know, you can go back. We have things like The Golden Ass. And you go, well, I don’t know that I’m as good as that and that's two and a half thousand years old. But with comics I felt like – I can do stuff nobody has ever done. I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of. And I could and it was enormously fun."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.wildriverreview.com/4/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php|title= Myth, Magic and the Mind of Neil Gaiman|first= Tim E.|last= Ogline|date= 20 November 2007|publisher= Wild River Review|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120915045414/http://www.wildriverreview.com/4/worldvoices-neilgaiman.php|archivedate= 15 September 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Novels===

In a collaboration with author Terry Pratchett best known for his series of Discworld novels, Gaiman's first novel Good Omens was published in 1990. In recent years Pratchett has said that while the entire novel was a collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them, Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman's scheduled involvement with Sandman.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|first= Terry|last= Pratchett|title= Words from the Master|publisher= Lspace.org|date= no date|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130929041235/http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|archivedate= 29 September 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
The 1996 novelisation of Gaiman's teleplay for the BBC mini-series Neverwhere was his first solo novel. The novel was released in tandem with the television series though it presents some notable differences from the television series. Gaiman has since revised the novel twice, the first time for an American audience unfamiliar with the London Underground, the second time because he felt unsatisfied with the original.
In 1999 first printings of his fantasy novel Stardust were released. The novel has been released both as a standard novel and in an illustrated text edition.
American Gods became one of Gaiman's best-selling and multi-award winning novels upon its release in 2001.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/About_Neil/Press_Releases/American_Gods_wins_a_Hugo!|title= American Gods wins a Hugo! |publisher= Neilgaiman.com|date= 17 September 2002|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130920150246/http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/About_Neil/Press_Releases/American_Gods_wins_a_Hugo!|archivedate= 20 September 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 26 July 2011[/tpl] A special 10th Anniversary edition was released, with the "author's preferred text" 12,000 words longer than the original mass-market editions.
Gaiman has not written a direct sequel to American Gods but he has revisited the characters. A glimpse at Shadow's travels in Europe is found in a short story which finds him in England, applying the same concepts developed in American Gods to the story of Beowulf. The 2005 novel Anansi Boys  deals with Anansi ('Mr. Nancy'), tracing the relationship of his two sons, one semi-divine and the other an unassuming Englishman, as they explore their common heritage. It debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/books/bestseller/1009besthardfiction.html|title= Best-Seller Lists: Hardcover Fiction|date=9 October 2005|work= The New York Times|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131027003946/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/books/bestseller/1009besthardfiction.html?_r=0|archivedate= 26 October 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 6 March 2010[/tpl]
In late 2008, Gaiman released a new children's book, The Graveyard Book. It follows the adventures of a boy named Bod after his family is murdered and he is left to be brought up by a graveyard. It is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. [tpl]As of|2009|01|alt=As of late January 2009[/tpl], it had been on The New York Times Bestseller children's list for fifteen weeks.[tpl]cite web |url= http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/11/beyond-tea.html|title= Beyone Tea|first= Neil|last= Gaiman|date= 19 November 2008|publisher= Neil Gaiman's Journal|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120215045029/http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/11/beyond-tea.html|archivedate= 15 February 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl]
As of 2008, Gaiman has several books planned. After a tour of China, he decided to write a non-fiction book about his travels and the general mythos of China. Following that, will be a new 'adult' novel (his first since 2005's Anansi Boys). After that, another 'all-ages' book (in the same vein as Coraline and The Graveyard Book). Following that, Gaiman says that he will release another non-fiction book called The Dream Catchers.[tpl]cite web |url= http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/11/from-las-vegas.html|title= From Las vegas|first= Neil|last= Gaiman|date= 6 November 2008|publisher= Neil Gaiman's Journal|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120215045033/http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/11/from-las-vegas.html|archivedate= 15 February 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl] In December 2011, Gaiman announced that in January 2012 he would begin work on what is essentially, American Gods 2.[tpl]cite web|url= http://wheelercentre.com/videos/video/neil-gaiman/?t=17m11s#|title= Neil Gaiman – The Wheeler Centre: Books, Writing, Ideas|publisher= The Wheeler Centre|date= 22 December 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120611060207/http://wheelercentre.com/videos/video/neil-gaiman/?t=17m11s|archivedate= 11 June 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate=2 January 2012[/tpl]

===Film and screenwriting===

Gaiman wrote the 1996 BBC dark fantasy television series Neverwhere. He cowrote the screenplay for the movie MirrorMask with his old friend Dave McKean for McKean to direct. In addition, he wrote the localised English language script to the anime movie Princess Mononoke, based on a translation of the Japanese script.
He cowrote the script for Robert Zemeckis's Beowulf with Roger Avary, a collaboration that has proved productive for both writers.[tpl]cite web |url= http://video.stv.tv/bc/info-outFilmsVideo_interviews-20071120-neil-gaiman-and-roger-avary-shaping-beowulfs-story/?redirect=no|title= Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary: Shaping Beowulf's story|year= 2007|publisher= Stv.tv|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120625235711/http://video.stv.tv/bc/info-outFilmsVideo_interviews-20071120-neil-gaiman-and-roger-avary-shaping-beowulfs-story/?redirect=no|archivedate= 25 June 2012|deadurl= no[/tpl] Gaiman has expressed interest in collaborating on a film adaptation of the Epic of Gilgamesh.[tpl]cite news |first = Tom |last= Ambrose|title = He Is Legend|publisher = Empire|date = December 2007|page= 142[/tpl]
He was the only person other than J. Michael Straczynski to write a Babylon 5 script in the last three seasons, contributing the season five episode "Day of the Dead".
Gaiman has also written at least three drafts of a screenplay adaptation of Nicholson Baker's novel The Fermata for director Robert Zemeckis,[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_About_Neil/Neil_Gaiman's_Film_Work|title= Neil Gaiman's Film Work|publisher= Neil Gaiman.com|date= 13 August 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130920140546/http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_About_Neil/Neil_Gaiman's_Film_Work|archivedate= 20 September 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=2 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17624|title= Neil Gaiman Takes Hollywood|first= Tom|last= Burns|date= no date|publisher= UGO.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513203340/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17624|archivedate= 13 May 2011|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 2 August 2010[/tpl] although the project was stalled while Zemeckis made The Polar Express and the Gaiman-Roger Avary written Beowulf film.
Neil Gaiman was featured in the History Channel documentary Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked.
Several of Gaiman's original works have been optioned or greenlighted for film adaptation, most notably Stardust, which premiered in August 2007 and stars Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Claire Danes, directed by Matthew Vaughn. A stop-motion version of Coraline was released on 6 February 2009, with Henry Selick directing and Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher in the leading voice-actor roles.
In 2007, Gaiman announced that after ten years in development, the feature film of Death: The High Cost of Living would finally begin production with a screenplay by Gaiman that he would direct for Warner Independent.

===Blog and Twitter===

In February 2001, when Gaiman had completed writing American Gods, his publishers set up a promotional web site featuring a weblog in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of revising, publishing, and promoting the novel.

Gaiman generally posts to the blog describing the day-to-day process of being Neil Gaiman and writing, revising, publishing, or promoting whatever the current project is. He also posts reader emails and answers questions, which gives him unusually direct and immediate interaction with fans. One of his answers on why he writes the blog is "because writing is, like death, a lonely business."[tpl]cite web|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/m-is-for-mirrors-youll-stare-in-forever.html |title=Neil Gaiman's journal, 2/11/2008 |publisher=Journal.neilgaiman.com |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
