New World Syndrome is a set of non-communicable diseases brought on by consumption of junk food and a  sedentary lifestyle. Native Americans, the indigenous people of Oceania and perhaps other people of Asiatic origin are susceptible.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gracey|first=Michael|year=1995|title=New World syndrome in Western Australian aborigines|journal=Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=220–225|issn=0305-1870|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.1995.tb01985.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119247811/abstract[/tpl] It is characterized by obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and shortened life span.

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a traditional diet and exercise to a modern diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.[tpl]cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

The amount of carbohydrates in diets increases.[tpl]cite book|last1=Lambert |first1= Lorelei|last2=|first2=|title=Keepers of the Central Fire: Issues in Ecology for Indigenous Peoples|url=|year=1999|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=9780763709235|oclc= 44955349 |page=46|chapter=The Kerr Dam: Collisions of Cultures|quote=With the expansion of the dominant culture, the people of the Flathead Nation grew increasingly dependent on a cash economy, and the dietary and health changes that resulted from an increase of carbohydrates in the diet. Today, diabetes, cardiac problems, hypertension, and the plethora of disease caused by obesity plague many members of the Flathead Nation (Personal conversation with Roy Big Crane).[/tpl] The convenience and cheapness of these foods adds to their appeal.
Evidence found[tpl]Who|date=October 2007[/tpl] through the study of mitochondrial DNA suggests that there are several factors at play. Subjects of maternal descent from the above named indigenous populations have several genetic factors that provide more efficient conversion of some classes of carbohydrates into ATP. There is also indication[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=March 2009[/tpl] that cellular responses to injury, muscular efficiency, and other metabolic differences may set the stage for other factors to cause the symptoms of the syndrome.
Increased rates of depression are known[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=March 2009[/tpl] to produce higher rates of obesity through decreased physical activity. Coupled with a more efficient metabolism this could be[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=March 2009[/tpl] a major cause of NWS symptoms within population groups such as Native Americans in the United States. As with all studies of the genetic underpinnings of anthropologically diverse groups, the individual circumstances may differ from case to case.
