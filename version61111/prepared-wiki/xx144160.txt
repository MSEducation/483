The zebra top snail, scientific name Austrocochlea porcata, is a medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Trochidae, the top snails, also known as top shells.Bouchet, P. (2013). Austrocochlea porcata (A. Adams, 1853). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=546941 on 2014-03-16

==Shell description==

The size of the shell varies between 20 mm and 43 mm. The shell has a  black-and-white banded pattern overlying a light grey to white shell. It is very similar to that of the southern ribbed top snail, Austrocochlea constricta, and until recently the two species were considered to be identical. The aperture is less dilated, than in Austrocochlea constricta. The columellar tubercle is obsolete.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia
