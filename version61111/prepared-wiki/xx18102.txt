===World War II service===

In 1944, Heston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He served for two years as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 Mitchell stationed in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands with the Eleventh Air Force. He reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke in the same year he joined the military. After his rise to fame, Heston narrated for highly classified military and Department of Energy instructional films, particularly relating to nuclear weapons, and "for six years Heston held the nation's highest security clearance" or Q clearance." The Q clearance is similar to a DoD or Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) clearance of Top Secret.[tpl]cite news|title=Top Secret|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/security-clearance|accessdate=August 18, 2011|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=11/10/1989[/tpl]

===Theater and television===

After the war, Heston and Clarke lived in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, where they worked as artists' models. Seeking a way to make it in theater, Heston and his wife Lydia decided to manage a playhouse in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1947. They made $100 a week. In 1948, they returned to New York where Heston was offered a supporting role in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, starring Katharine Cornell. In television, Heston played a number of roles in CBS's Studio One, one of the most popular anthology dramas of the 1950s. Film producer Hal B. Wallis of Casablanca spotted Heston in a 1950 television production of Wuthering Heights and offered him a contract. When his wife reminded Heston they had decided to pursue theater and television, he replied, "Well, maybe just for one film to see what it's like."
Heston turned down the lead opposite Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love to appear in Benn W. Levy's play The Tumbler, directed by Sir Laurence Olivier.[tpl]cite book|last=Rovin|first=Jeff|title=The Films of Charlton Heston|year=1977|publisher=Lyle Stuart|location=New York|isbn=978-0806505619|page=224[/tpl]  Called a "harrowingly pretentious verse drama' by Time Magazine,[tpl]cite news|title=The Theater: New Plays on Broadway, Mar. 7, 1960|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894730,00.html#ixzz2bV2R26xx|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=March 7, 1960[/tpl] the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960.[tpl]cite web|title=The Tumbler|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=2099|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=August 9, 2013[/tpl] Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play to work with him as a director.
After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor."[tpl]cite news|last=Hyams|first=Joe|title=Heston Not Hurt By Flop Play|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19600303&id=xggwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_gAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7322,6153850|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=Toldeo Blade|date=March 3, 1960[/tpl]
Heston enjoyed acting on stage, believing it revivified him as an actor. He never returned to Broadway, but acted in regional theaters. His most frequent stage roles included the title role in Macbeth, Sir Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons, and Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra. [tpl]citation needed||reason=when, where, for whom?|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Heston played More in several regional productions in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in London's West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favorite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it. The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a bald cap over his hairpiece, rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=Hoffman quote needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Hollywood===

Heston's first professional movie appearance was in Dark City, a 1950 film noir. His breakthrough came when Cecil B. DeMille cast him as a circus manager in The Greatest Show on Earth, which was named by the Motion Picture Academy as the best picture of 1952. In 1953, Heston was Billy Wilder's first choice to play Sefton in Stalag 17. However, the role was given to William Holden, who won an Oscar for it. Heston became an icon for portraying Moses in the hugely successful film The Ten Commandments (1956), reportedly being chosen by director Cecil B. DeMille because he thought the muscular, 6 ft 3 in, square-jawed Heston bore an uncanny resemblance to Michelangelo's statue of Moses. In 1955, Heston appeared with Jane Wyman in the film, Lucy Gallant, the story of a woman determined to hold on to her dress shop in a small Texas oil-boom community. In 1958, Heston played a Mexican police officer, Ramon Miguel Vargas, in Orson Welles's widely acclaimed film noir Touch of Evil.
After Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, and Rock Hudson turned down the title role in Ben-Hur (1959), Heston accepted the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor, one of the unprecedented eleven Oscars the film earned. After Moses and Ben-Hur, Heston became more identified with Biblical epics than any other actor. He voiced the role of Ben-Hur in a cartoon version of the Lew Wallace novel in 2003.
Heston played leading roles in a number of fictional and historical epics: El Cid (1961), 55 Days at Peking (1963), as Michelangelo in The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), and Khartoum (1966). Heston also played the eponymous role in the western movie Will Penny (1968).
In 1965–71, Heston was the elected president of the Screen Actors Guild. The Guild had been created in 1933 for the benefit of actors, who had different interests than the producers and directors who controlled the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Heston was more conservative than most actors, and publicly clashed with the outspoken liberal actor Ed Asner.Emilie Raymond, "The Agony and the Ecstasy: Charlton Heston and the Screen Actors Guild," Journal of Policy History, (2005) 17#2 pp 217–239.

In 1971, he starred in the science fiction film, The Omega Man. Although critically panned, the film is now considered a classic of post-apocalyptic horror. In 1972, Heston made his directorial debut and starred as Mark Antony in an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play he had performed earlier in his theater career, Antony and Cleopatra. Hildegarde Neil was Cleopatra and English actor Eric Porter was Enobarbus. After receiving scathing reviews, the film was never released to theaters, and is rarely seen on television. It was finally released on DVD in March 2011.Antony & Cleopatra: Movies & TV. Amazon.com. Retrieved on November 14, 2011. He subsequently starred in more successful films such as Soylent Green (1973) and Earthquake (1974).
Beginning with playing Cardinal Richelieu in 1973's The Three Musketeers, Heston was seen in an increasing number of supporting roles, cameos and live theater. From 1985 to 1987, he starred in his only prime time stint on a television series in the soap, The Colbys. With his son Fraser, he produced and also starred in several TV movies, including remakes of Treasure Island and A Man For All Seasons.

After the scene is reshot with Heston, Campbell weeps in awe. That same year, Heston hosted Saturday Night Live. He had cameos in the films Hamlet, Tombstone and True Lies. He starred in many theatre productions at the Los Angeles Music Center, where he appeared in Detective Story and The Caine Mutiny Court Martial, and as Sherlock Holmes in The Crucifer of Blood opposite Richard Johnson as  Dr. Watson.

Heston's distinctive voice had also landed him roles as a film narrator, including Armageddon and Disney's Hercules.
Heston played the title role in Mister Roberts three times and cited it as one of his favorite roles. In the early 1990s, he tried unsuccessfully to revive and direct the show with Tom Selleck in the title role.Heston, Charlton: In The Arena, Simon & Schuster, 1995, p. 479. ISBN 0-684-80394-1.

===Political activism===

Heston's political activism had four stages.Raymond, From My Cold, Dead Hands, pp 5–7 In the first stage, 1955 to 1961, he endorsed Democratic candidates for President, and signed on to petitions and liberal political causes. From 1961 to 1972, the second stage, he continued to endorse Democratic candidates for President. From 1965 to 1971, he served as the elected president of the Screen Actors Guild, and clashed with his liberal rival Ed Asner. Moving beyond Hollywood, he became nationally visible in 1963 in support of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and in 1968 used his "cowboy" persona to publicize gun control measures.  The third stage began in 1972. Like many neoconservatives of the same era who moved from liberal Democrat to conservative Republican, he rejected the liberalism of George McGovern and supported Richard Nixon in 1972 for President. In the 1980s, he gave strong support to his friend Ronald Reagan during his conservative presidency. In 1995, Heston entered his fourth stage by establishing his own political action fund-raising committee, and jumped into the internal politics of the National Rifle Association. He gave numerous culture wars speeches and interviews upholding the conservative position, blaming media and academia for imposing affirmative action, which he saw as unfair reverse discrimination.Steven J. Ross, Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics (2011) ch 7
Heston campaigned for Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson in 1956 and John F. Kennedy in 1960.[ref]
