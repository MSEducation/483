==Release==

Kuchibiru Tameiki Sakurairo is a collection of one-shot manga chapters written and illustrated by Milk Morinaga. The first five chapters were originally serialized in Sun Magazine's now-defunct yuri manga magazine Yuri Shimai between June 28, 2003 and November 17, 2004. When Yuri Shimai was discontinued, the last two chapters were serialized in the magazine's successor Comic Yuri Hime between July 18 and October 18, 2005, published by Ichijinsha. These seven chapters were later collected into a single tankōbon volume released on January 18, 2006 by Ichijinsha. Morinaga restarted the series in the October 2011 issue of Futabasha's Comic High! magazine and it ran until the February 2012 issue.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-21/milk-morinaga-ends-kuchibiru-tameiki-sakurairo-plans-new-manga|title=Milk Morinaga Ends Kuchibiru Tameiki Sakurairo, Plans New Manga Futabasha|publisher=Anime News Network|date=January 21, 2012|accessdate=September 28, 2012[/tpl] Futabasha republished the entire series in two volumes on April 12, 2012.

==Reception==

Kuchibiru Tameiki Sakurairo was featured as Anime News Network's Import of the Month in October 2007 where it was praised for being "heart-meltingly cute—and not in the brainless moe-moe way, but because the feelings expressed are so honest." However it was noted that "it may be an emotionally moving work, but that doesn't stop it from often plunging into cheesy melodrama territory."[tpl]cite web|author=Santos, Carlo|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/right-turn-only/2007-10-30|title=Girls On Parade - Right Turn Only!!|publisher=Anime News Network|date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=December 21, 2009[/tpl]
