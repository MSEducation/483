The thermodynamic analysis of the actual four-stroke or two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptionsBest Place for Engineering and Technology, Air Standard Assumptions. are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle.
During the normal operation of the engine as the fuel mixture is being compressed an electric arc is created to ignite the fuel.  At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre).  As engine rpm rises the spark point is moved earlier in the cycle so that the fuel charge can be ignited while it is still being compressed. We can see this advantage reflected in the various Otto engines designs. The atmospheric (non-compression) engine operated at 12% efficiency.  The compressed charge engine had an operating efficiency of 30%.

==Fuel Considerations==

The problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self-ignite).   This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design.
The tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature.  There are several ways to do this.  As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre-ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition.  The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine.  Higher Compression ratios also mean that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the Expansion ratio).
The octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition.  A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive.
Diesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition.  They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started.  The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating.  Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold.  Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a glow plug.
