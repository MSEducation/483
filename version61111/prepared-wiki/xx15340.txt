Taco Bell is an American chain of fast-food restaurants based in Irvine, California. A subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc., they serve a variety of Tex-Mex foods including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, other specialty items, and a variety of "Value menu" items. Taco Bell serves more than 2 billion customers each year in more than 6,500 restaurants mostly in the U.S., more than 80 percent of which are owned and operated by independent franchisees.

==History==

===Founding and growth===

Taco Bell was founded by Glen Bell, who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell’s Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1946 when he was 23 years old. Six years later, he sold the stand and opened a new one two years later, this time selling tacos under the name of Taco-Tia.  Over the next few years Bell owned and operated a number of restaurants in southern California including four called El Taco. Bell sold the El Tacos to his partner and built the first Taco Bell in Downey in 1962. In 1962, he sold Taco-Tia. Kermit Becky, a former Los Angeles police officer, bought the first Taco Bell franchise from Glen Bell in 1964, and located it in Torrance. The company grew rapidly, and by 1967, the 100th restaurant opened at 400 South Brookhurst in Anaheim. In 1970, Taco Bell went public with 325 restaurants. In 1978, PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell from Glen Bell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tacobell.com/company/ |title=Company Information |publisher=Taco Bell |date=2011-08-09 |accessdate=2011-08-16[/tpl]
In the late 1970s, Taco Bell introduced the Bell Beefer, sloppy joe like with taco-seasoned ground beef on a hamburger bun with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The Beefer was removed from the menu in the late-1980s to keep a strictly Tex Mex-inspired line up.[tpl]cite news|last=Velasco|first=Schuyler|title=10 fast foods that have disappeared: 3.

Several locations in the Midwestern United States were converted from Zantigo, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Mexican chain which PepsiCo acquired in 1986."PepsiCo to merge Zantigo's, Taco Bell," San Jose Mercury News, October 2, 1986, p. 10C.

===Concepts===

In 1991, Taco Bell opened the first Taco Bell Express in San Francisco. This concept is a reduced-size restaurant with a limited menu (primarily items priced under $1), meant to emphasize volume.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zH4UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QwMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2092,5565453&dq=taco-bell-express|title=Taco Bell Express makes fast food look slow|date=November 21, 1991|work=Toledo Blade|accessdate=July 11, 2009[/tpl] Taco Bell Express locations operate primarily inside convenience stores, truck stops, shopping malls, and airports.
Taco Bell began co-branding with KFC in 1995, when the first such co-brand opened in Clayton, North Carolina.[tpl]cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_33_39/ai_n14922679/ | title=Co-branding trend has U.S. franchisees seeing double: veteran KFC-Taco Bell franchisee Al Luihn helped pioneer the Yum system's multibranding trend, showing dos and don'ts of ...[/tpl] The chain has since co-branded with Pizza Hut[tpl]cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-cobranding-among-franchises-23846.html |title=Advantages & Disadvantages of Co-Branding Among Franchises | Chron.com |publisher=Smallbusiness.chron.com |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-18[/tpl] and Long John Silver's as well.
In 1997, PepsiCo experimented with a new "fresh grill" concept, opening at least one Border Bell restaurant in Mountain View, California on El Camino Real (SR 82). In addition to a subset of the regular Taco Bell menu, Border Bell offered Mexican-inspired items like those available from Chevys Fresh Mex restaurants (then owned by PepsiCo), such as Chevys signature sweet corn tamalito pudding and a fresh salsa bar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/imipolex/557747612/ |title=Image of promotional Border Bell menu |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02[/tpl] Close to the time that PepsiCo spun off its restaurant business in 1997, the Border Bell in Mountain View was closed and converted to a Taco Bell restaurant, which was still open in 2012.

===GMO Recall===

In September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets. The shells contained genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption.  It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/23/news/mn-25314 |title=Taco Bell Recalls Shells That Used Bioengineered Corn |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2014-01-30 |first=Melinda |last=Fulmer[/tpl]
In 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2001/06/taco-bell-rings-up-60-million-for-starlink-contam.aspx |title=Taco Bell Rings up $60 Million for StarLink-Contaminated Shells |publisher=Naturalproductsinsider.com |date=2001-06-12 |accessdate=2014-01-30[/tpl]

===Dispute with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers===

In March 2005, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) won a landmark victory in its national boycott of Taco Bell for human rights. Taco Bell agreed to meet all of the coalition's demands to improve wages and working conditions for Florida tomato pickers in its supply chain.[tpl]cite news | title = Taco Bell Boycott Victory – A Model of Strategic Organizing | url = http://www.witherspoonsociety.org/taco_bell_boycott.htm | date = August 24, 2005 | publisher = witherspoonsociety.org | accessdate = March 23, 2009 [/tpl]
After four years of a tenacious and growing boycott, Taco Bell and Yum! Brands agreed to make an agreement called the CIW-Yum agreement with representatives of CIW at Yum! Brands headquarters.[tpl]cite news | title = A Side Order of Human Rights | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/opinion/06schlosser.html?_r=1 | date = April 6, 2005 | publisher = "The New York Times" | accessdate = March 23, 2009 | first=Eric | last=Schlosser[/tpl] The CIW-Yum agreement set several precedents, establishing:

A large advertising push by Taco Bell was begun in late February 2011 in response to a consumer protection lawsuit filed against the company by an Alabama law firm. The promotion sought to counter allegations that the company falsely advertised the ratio of ingredients in its beef filling for its tacos. The spots featured employees and franchisees stating that the filling has always been a mixture of 88% beef and various spices and binders and nothing else. The ad followed several full page print ads in the New York Times and other newspapers that featured the headline "Thank you for suing us."[tpl]cite news |title=Taco Bell launches saucy ad campaigns against meat allegations |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/taco-bell-launches-saucy-ad-campaigns-against-meat-allegations-2230712.html |accessdate=6 March 2011 |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 March 2011 |location=London[/tpl] Additionally, the chain added a new social campaign using Twitter and Facebook. The company invested heavily in the campaign, spending more than $3 million (USD) putting out its message — about 20 percent more than the company usually spends on an advertising program. The various campaigns came shortly before the company began its official response to the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and were designed to bring public opinion into their camp. Various analysts stated that the company would have been better off using a grass-root campaign that involved in store advertising and other non-broadcast media.[tpl]cite news |last=Chapman |first=Michelle |title=Taco Bell to fight meat filling claims via TV ads |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/ci_17504527 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |work=The Daily Breeze |date=28 February 2011 |agency=Associated Press[/tpl] The suit was eventually withdrawn,[tpl]cite news |last=Schreiner |first=Bruce |title=Taco Bell beef lawsuit dropped|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2011/04/18/1631463/lawsuit-questioning-taco-bells.html |accessdate=22 April 2011 |newspaper=News Tribune |date=18 April 2011 |agency=Associated Press |location=Tacoma, Washington[/tpl] and the company continued its advertising response by publicly requesting an apology from the suing firm of Beasley Allen.

===Slogans===

Taco Bell has used the following advertising slogans:

==Outside the United States==

===Australia===

Taco Bell first opened in Australia in September 1981, but Taco Bell was ordered to change its name after the owner of a local restaurant successfully sued Taco Bell for misleading conduct.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FCA/1981/219.html?query=^taco%20bell |title=Re Taco Bell Pty Limited v Taco Company of Australia Inc 1981 FCA 219; (1981) 60 FLR 60 (22 December 1981) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=February 9, 2010[/tpl] The local restaurant was called "Taco Bell's Casa" and had been operating in Australia since the 1970s. The owner successfully argued that Sydneysiders would confuse the takeaway chain with his restaurant, and this would damage his reputation.
Taco Bell later opened in 1997 in Australia with a store in the cinema district on George St in Sydney and a year later in 1998 within a few KFC stores in the state of New South Wales, but by 2005, the Taco Bell brand was pulled out of the country.

===Russia===

In the early 90's, Pepsico opened several Taco Bell locations inside the Moscow metro system, including Metro Park Kulturi and Metro Komsomolskaya.  This experiment lasted only a few years but these locations live on under different ownership and a different name.  Notably, they still sell burritos, although they bear little resemblance to Taco Bell burritos.

===South Korea===

There are currently two locations in Seoul, in the Itaewon and Hongdae districts, which attract the most foreigners and college students. The two branches opened in the summer of 2010, Itaewon's branch coming first. A Taco Bell had long been a presence at the U.S. Army's Yongsan Garrison, which is off-limits to non-military people, and for a time there was a tongue-in-cheek grassroots campaign by non-Korean, non-military foreigners in Seoul to get another Taco Bell location.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCTfttE0w_E |title=We Want Taco Bell- EV Boyz |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2011-08-16[/tpl]

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom was the first European country with a Taco Bell. In 1986, a location was opened in London on Coventry Street (between Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus) followed by a second location in Earls Court near the Earl's Court tube station. One other store opened in Uxbridge but all closed in the mid-1990s.Marc Jacobs, Peter Scholliers, "Eating out in Europe: picnics, gourmet dining, and snacks since the late eighteenth century", Berg Publishers, 2003, ISBN 1-85973-658-0, pp.306-307 In 1994, the university food provider Compass announced plans to open stores in its university and college sites.

Yum! Brands announced that it is considering reopening Taco Bell locations in the United Kingdom as part of a large planned expansion into Europe, with trial outlets opening first in Spain in early 2009. Yum! is taking advantage of the recent recession which led to increasing sales at other fast food outlets; it also said that there is now a greater awareness of Mexican food in the UK and that it can be successful with improved menu offerings and marketing. The first new store opened at the Lakeside Shopping Centre on June 28, 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thurrockgazette.co.uk/news/8189126.Food_chain_to_premiere_at_Lakeside/|title=Food chain to premiere at Lakeside|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=Thurrock Gazette|accessdate=May 28, 2010[/tpl] Taco Bell opened a second store in Basildon on November 29, 2010 and the third in the Manchester Arndale Food Court on November 7, 2011.
