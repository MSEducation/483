[[Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme]]

CATEGORIES: Pensions in the United Kingdom

A Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme, or QROPS, is an overseas pension scheme that meets certain requirements set by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). A QROPS can receive the transfer of UK Pension Benefits without incurring an unauthorised payment and scheme sanction charge. The QROPS program was launched on 6 April 2006 as a part of new legislation with the objective of simplifying pensions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qrops.net/what-is-qrops/|title=What is QROPS|publisher=QROPS.net|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]
Typically this occurs when a UK resident leaves the UK to emigrate permanently (or to retire abroad) having built up a pension fund within a scheme approved by HMRC or when a person born abroad who has built up benefits in a HMRC approved UK Pension Scheme decides to return to their home country with an expectation of retiring there. The QROPS does not have to be established in the new country of residence, thus providing greater flexibility and stability, along with choice of scheme provider.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iexpats.com/qrops/|title=QROPS â€“ Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes|last=Smith|first=Lisa|publisher=iExpats.com|accessdate=6 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expatpensions.info/qrops|title=Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS)|publisher=Expat Pensions|accessdate=29 April 2012[/tpl]

 Under section 150(8) a recognised overseas pension scheme is an overseas pension scheme that meets the following requirements prescribed under The Pension Schemes (Categories of Country and Requirements for Overseas Pension Schemes and Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/206). It must:
Pension rule 1 in section 165 provides that no payment of pension may be made before the day on which the member reaches normal minimum pension age, unless the ill-health condition was met immediately before the member became entitled to a pension under the scheme.

To become a QROPS, a pension scheme must apply to and be approved by HMRC.  A list of QROPS that have consented to have their names published is available on the HMRC website and is regularly updated.Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS) List
In April and May 2012 HMRC introduced a new host of regulations that had the effect of shifting the jurisdictions in which QROPS could be established.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/retirement/guernsey-unveils-strategy-to-revive-qrops|title=Guernsey Unveils Strategy to Revive QROPS|publisher=International-advisor.com[/tpl] Guernsey had previously been the premier jurisdiction for QROPS but due to a conflict in between local legislation and HMRC regulations over 300 schemes were de-listed, but rather than close them permanently this had the effect of migrating the schemes to Malta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-guernsey-qrops-migrate-to-malta-242.html|title=Guernsey QROPS MIgrate to Malta|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl] Since the new regulations came into force QROPS were also closed in Cyprus[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-cyprus-qrops-removed-by-hmrc-261.html|title=Cyprus QROPS removed by HMRC|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl] and are now principally available in Malta,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/retirement/malta-publishes-tax-guidelines-for-burgeoning|title=Malta publishes tax guidelines for burgeoning qrops industry|publisher=international-advisor.com[/tpl] the Isle of Man,[tpl]cite web|url=http://citywire.co.uk/new-model-adviser/skandia-looks-to-malta-and-isle-of-man-for-new-qrops-offering/a597057|title=Skandia looks to Malta and Isle of Man for new QROPS offering|publisher=Citywire[/tpl] and Gibraltar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prycewarner.com/news-gibraltar-introduce-qrops-241.html|title=Gibraltar to Introduce QROPS|publisher=Pryce Warner International Group[/tpl]
A QROPS should operate broadly in line with UK pension rules. A UK pension holder who has transferred their pension to a QROPS should be in a similar position as they would have been if the transfer had not taken place. What differentiates a QROPS from a UK held pension is that it must be recognised as a pension scheme under the country's legislation where it resides[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberty-wealth.com/news/qualified-recognised-overseas-pension-scheme-qrops-defined-991.html|title=QROPS Definition|publisher=Liberty Wealth[/tpl] whilst still complying with the rules set out by HMRC. As the jurisdiction's rules, where the pension resides, differ to UK rules this leads to benefits available to the holder in comparison to a UK pension scheme. These benefits include having a greater choice of how much income can be drawn and the ability to avoid death taxes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liberty-wealth.com/services/pension-transfers/qrops-pension|title=QROPS pension transfers|publisher=Liberty Wealth[/tpl] On returning to the UK a QROPS will be treated the same as any other UK pension scheme which may necessitate changes to the underlying holdings. A key requirement prior to returning to the UK is to ensure all investments held within the account are UK compliant. This may involve selling some or all of the current investment holdings. The policy can then be fully endorsed.
QROPS schemes are required to report to HMRC any payments made to the member for at least ten years from the date that the transfer took place. However if the pension holder has been non-UK resident for five complete tax years they can benefit from more attractive options than those allowed under UK pension schemes.
QROPS are increasingly popular under British Expats due to the tax advantages on the pension draw downs and death benefits. Pension funds left in the UK are heavily taxed, in some cases up to 55%. Transferring a UK pension fund into a QROPS can avoid UK taxation.
