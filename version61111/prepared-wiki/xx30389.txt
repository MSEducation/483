Nicotiana [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ɵ|ʃ|i|ˈ|eɪ|n|ə[/tpl]Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606–607 is a genus of herbaceous plants and shrubs of the family (Solanaceae) indigenous to the Americas, Australia, south west Africa and the South Pacific. Various Nicotiana species, commonly referred to as tobacco plants, are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. N. tabacum is grown worldwide for production of tobacco leaf for cigarettes and other tobacco products.

==Etymology==

The word nicotiana (as well as nicotine) was named in honor of Jean Nicot, French ambassador to Portugal, who in 1559 sent it as a medicine to the court of Catherine de' Medici.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/centers/cifas/drugsandsociety/background/chronologydruguse.html |title=Chronology of Psychoactive Substance Use |first=Gregory |last=Austin |website=Teachers College Columbia University |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110809165620/http://www.tc.columbia.edu/centers/cifas/drugsandsociety/background/chronologydruguse.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |accessdate=2014-02-08[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Several species of Nicotiana are grown as ornamental plants. They are popular vespertines, their sweet-smelling flowers opening in the evening to be visited by hawkmoths and other pollinators. 

==Ecology==

Despite containing enough nicotine and/or other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores,[tpl]cite book |last=Panter |first=KE |last2=Keeler |first2=RF |last3=Bunch |first3=TD |last4=Callan |first4=RJ |year=1990 |title=Congenital skeletal malformations and cleft palate induced in goats by ingestion of Lupinus, Conium and Nicotiana species |website=PubMed |pages=1377-1385 |volume=28 |issue=12 |pmid=2089736[/tpl] a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on Nicotiana species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (chiefly Tree Tobacco, N. glauca) have become established as invasive species in some places.
In the nineteenth century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from flea beetles (Epitrix cucumeris and/or Epitrix pubescens), causing destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that replacing the branches with a frame covered by thin fabric would effectively protect plants from the beetle. This practice spread until it became ubiquitous in the 1890s.
Lepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on Nicotiana include:
These are mainly Noctuidae and some Sphingidae.
