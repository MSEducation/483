==Stand in presenters==

Evans' stand in presenters have included Graham Norton, Richard Allinson, Miranda Hart and Jon Holmes, Richard Madeley, Zoë Ball,Ryan Tubridy and Patrick Kielty.
In October 2011 the show attracted criticism after Hart and Holmes co-hosted it for a week while Chris Evans was on holiday. The website Digital Spy reported that some listeners were unhappy with the quality of the programme. The BBC issued a statement in response saying, "Miranda Hart is one of the UK's best-loved comedians and BBC Radio 2 felt it appropriate to bring her warmth to its audience for a week. Jon Holmes is a highly experienced presenter from BBC Radio 6 Music ... BBC Radio 2 appreciates if their presentation wasn't to everyone's liking, but feels it's important to be able to bring new talent to its output and hopes its audience understands the importance of maintaining a breadth of content on the network."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a344503/bbc-responds-to-miranda-hart-complaints.html|title= BBC responds to Miranda Hart complaint|publisher= |work= Digital Spy|first= Colin|last= Daniels|date= 8 October 2011|accessdate= 16 October 2011[/tpl]
