Undrafted, Durno spent four years playing collegiate hockey with Michigan Tech. After turning pro, Durno spent time in the ECHL with the Gwinnett Gladiators and the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL). After being invited to the Chicago Blackhawks training camp for the start of the 2006–07 season, Durno was signed on September 25, 2006, and assigned to the affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.
On December 28, 2006, Durno was traded along with Sébastien Caron and Matt Keith to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Bruno St. Jacques and P. A.

Moving back and forth between the Avs and the Monsters for much of the first half of the 2009–10 campaign, Durno finally scored his first NHL goal on December 26, 2009, against Alex Auld of the Dallas Stars in front of a sold out crowd at the Pepsi Center, a game the Avalanche won 4–1.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/gamecenter/recap/NHL_20091226_DAL@COL?tag=pageRow;pageContainer|title=Durno gets 1st in 4-1 Avalanche win | publisher=CBS Sports | date = 2009-12-26 | accessdate = 2010-03-11[/tpl]
On July 25, 2010, Durno signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Lightning.[tpl]cite web | url =http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=328474 |title =Lightning sign free agent Left-winger Durno |publisher=The Sports Network |date =2010-07-25 |accessdate =2010-07-25 [/tpl] He failed to debut with the Lightning during the 2010–11 season, playing as captain in his return to the AHL affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals.
Durno signed a one-year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 15, 2011, and was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers.[tpl]cite web | url =http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=569344 |title =Hurricanes sign Chris Durno to one-year contract |publisher=Carolina Hurricanes |date =2011-07-15 |accessdate = 2011-07-25[/tpl] On October 6, 2011, he was named as an alternate captain for the team. With injury limiting Durno's effectiveness, he suffered a downturn in scoring to post just 5 goals in 53 games during the 2011–12 season with the Checkers.
Once again a free agent in the off-season, Durno's effort for a new contract was hampered by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. Midway into the 2012–13 season, Durno was signed to his first European contract with Italian club, Sport Ritten-Renon, on November 20, 2012.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.rittensport.it/de/eishockey/news-detail.asp?lProductID=559238 | title = Ritten find replacement for Coassin in Durno | publisher = Sportverein Ritten-Renon | date = 2012-11-20 | accessdate = 2012-11-20 | language = Italian[/tpl]
Prior to pursuing a career as a professional hockey player, Durno played lacrosse for the Toronto Beaches, where he earned enough recognition for his services that he was drafted by the Toronto Rock in the 5th round (64th overall) 2001 NLL Entry Draft.
