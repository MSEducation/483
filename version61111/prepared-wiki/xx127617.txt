In the second half of the 2008–09 season, when Tony Parkes took over as caretaker manager, "Reggie", as he is known by Blackpool supporters, was moved to his usual centre-back role and cemented his place in that position. His performances led to his being linked with a move to Derby County, which Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston angrily dismissed, saying that "we've not had an offer from Derby... so unless anything changes drastically between now and August then he Barker will be starting here next season".[tpl]cite news | title = Barker speculation angers Oyston | publisher=BBC Sport | date=12 May 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackpool/8046388.stm | accessdate=2009-05-18[/tpl] It was later revealed that Derby had submitted a formal bid for Barker, believed to be in the region of £400,000,[tpl]cite news | title = Rams in bid for Seasider Barker | publisher=Derby Telegraph | date=16 May 2009 | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/RAMS-BID-SEASIDER-BARKER/story-11595631-detail/story.html | accessdate=2013-11-06[/tpl] which was rejected.[tpl]cite news | title = Blackpool reject Barker bid | publisher=Sky Sports | date=17 May 2009 | url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12876_5331194,00.html | accessdate=2009-05-18[/tpl]

===Derby County===

Barker joined Derby County on 15 July 2009, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £900,000, signing a three-year contract.[tpl]cite news | title =Barker signs for Rams | publisher=Derby Telegraph' | date=15 July 2009 | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Derby-County-Defender-Barker-signs-Rams/story-11574054-detail/story.html | accessdate=2013-11-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1722986,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120229161238/http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10432~1722986,00.html |archivedate=29 February 2012 |title=Rams win race for Barker |publisher= Blackpool F.C.|date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2013[/tpl] Barker made his Derby début as an 89th minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 15 August, his start to the season being delayed by a slight hamstring strain.[tpl]cite news | title =Dean and Shaun to get run in reserves | publisher=Derby Telegraph | date=26 August 2009 | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Dean-Shaun-run-reserves/story-11592185-detail/story.html | accessdate=2013-11-08[/tpl] He made his first start for Derby in a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United on 12 September, going on to make thirteen consecutive appearances[tpl]cite news | title =Shaky start but Derby County defender Shaun now showing his strengths | publisher=Derby Telegraph | date=4 December 2009 | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Shaky-start-Derby-County-defender-Shaun-showing-strengths/story-11649950-detail/story.html | accessdate=2013-11-08[/tpl] and scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–2 defeat to Barnsley on 15 September. However, having been playing through a thigh injury, a scan after Derby's 2–1 win over Reading on 28 November revealed that the tear in his thigh muscle had gotten worse, ruling him out for several weeks.[tpl]cite news | title =Injured Barker facing lay-off | publisher=Derby Telegraph'' | date=7 December 2009 | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Injured-Barker-facing-lay/story-11610312-detail/story.html | accessdate=2010-01-17[/tpl] Barker made his return from injury with a substitute appearance in Derby's FA Cup win over Millwall on 12 January 2010 and started the next game, a 3–0 win over Peterborough on 16 January.[tpl]cite news | title =Barker looking to leave injury behind | publisher=Burton Mail | date=16 January 2010 | url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/Sport/Derby-County-FC/Barker-looking-to-leave-injury-behind.htm | accessdate=2013-11-08[/tpl] From this point Barker shrugged off the injury problems that had curtailed the earlier part of his season and finished the season with a run of 23 consecutive appearances, scoring twice (the third in a 3–0 win over Newcastle United and the equaliser in a 1–1 draw away to Q.P.R.) to take his tally for the season to five. Barker enjoyed a successful first season with Derby and, although the side struggled in the league, only achieving safety in the 44th fixture, he was awarded The Jack Stamps Trophy  before the final game of the season against Cardiff City,[tpl]cite news| url = http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~2040161,00.html| publisher =dcfc.co.uk| title = Top Award for Barker| date = 1 May 2010[/tpl] his second successive Player of the Year award after winning Blackpool's 2008/09 award. Whilst Derby finished midtable in 2009/10, Barker's former club Blackpool earned promotion to the Premier League leading some observers to suggest he might regret the decision to move to a supposed bigger club. Of this Barker said, 
Barker was named Derby's Vice Captain ahead of the 2010/11 campaign[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/8835571.stm| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Robbie Savage retains Derby County captaincy| date = 19 July 2010[/tpl] and started the season as first choice centrehalf alongside Dean Leacock. His first goal of the season came in the ninth match, as he netted a crucial equaliser against Middlesbrough in first half stoppage time that spurred The Rams onto a 3–1 win. On 14 December 2010,  it was also announced he had signed a new 3[tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl] deal with the club, taking him through until July 2014.[tpl]cite news| url =http://www.derbycounty-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/barker_to_stay_with_the_rams_for_another_three_and_a_half_years_608727/index.shtml| title =Barker to stay with the Rams for another three and a half years| date = 14 December 2010 | work =DerbyCountyMad[/tpl] Although Derby once again struggled, Barker featured in every game bar one - which he missed due to suspension - throughout the campaign up until safety was assured on Easter Monday 2011. With safety assured, he had surgery on a knee problem which had been an issue throughout most of his two years at Derby and had prevented him from training for the majority of the end of the 2010-11 season.[tpl]cite news| url =http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Barker-Fans-best-form-Rams/story-11565443-detail/story.html| title =Barker: Fans yet to see my best form for Rams| date =27 April 2011 | work =Derby Telegraph[/tpl] 
As a result, Barker missed the first 16 games of the following season, returning to action in a reserve fixture against Sheffield United on 15 November 2011.[tpl]cite web | title=Awesome Foursome Set For Rams Return!!| publisher=RamZone| url=http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/derbycounty/news/14780/awesome-foursome-set-for-rams-return!!|date = 15 November 2011[/tpl] He made his first team return as a late substitute in a 2–0 defeat against Hull City on 19 November 2011,[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15704774| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Derby 0 – 2 Hull| date = 19 November 2011[/tpl] making his first start in a 3–1 defeat at West Ham United on 26 November.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15704774| publisher =BBC Sport| title = West Ham 3 – 1 Derby| date = 26 November 2011[/tpl] Barker retained his place in the side where he partned Jason Shackell in central defence, starting 21 games together, with Derby winning 8, drawing 4, losing 9 games and conceding 23 goals. On 13 March, in a game against Nottingham Forest Barker was involved in a collision with Forest striker Marcus Tudgay and Derby goalkeeper Frank Fielding and after a 6 minute break in the game was substituted and rushed off to hospital with a suspected broken leg.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4193054/Derby-County-1-Nottingham-Forest-0.html| publisher =The Sun| title = Derby County 1 Nottingham Forest 0| date = 13 March 2012[/tpl] A day after the game, Barker was ruled out for the remainder of the season with a dislocated kneecap.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17368735| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Derby County's Shaun Barker ruled out for the season| date = 14 March 2012[/tpl] However, on 22 March 2012 after further scans in hospital, Barker was facing a 16 month recovery from his injury, (ruling him out of the entire 2012–13 season) after rupturing his medial, anterior cruciate and posterior cruciate ligaments. Barker also had a 3[tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl] hour operation to remove damage to the patellar ligament, Barker will also wear a brace to the first 8 weeks to help protect the dislocated knee.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17625425| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Derby captain Shaun Barker facing 16 month recovery| date = 22 March 2012[/tpl] Barker remains optimistic for a full recovery.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17550516| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Derby County's Shaun Barker certain of full recovery| date = 30 March 2012[/tpl] Surgeon Dr Andrew Williams said in April 2012 that he was happy with the progress Barker had made in his injury recovery after his first check-up, with Barker expected to be in a leg brace and crutches for at least 12 weeks. Barker has also spent 6 hours a day in a Kneehab XP, which Barker calls a "machine of death" the machine helps rebuild quadriceps muscles through set spells of contraction and relaxation. Barker has also spent time in an ice machine.[tpl]cite news| url =http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/story-15862501-detail/story.html| title =Skipper gets the thumbs up from surgeon| date =19 April 2012 | work =Derby Telegraph[/tpl]
Because he would miss the 2012–13 season due to his injury, Barker was not given a squad number, with Nigel Clough allocating his no.5 shirt to Jake Buxton. Despite this, Clough stated that Barker will play an "important part" in the season as club captain despite being on the sidelines all season.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/article/shauns-big-role-330058.aspx| publisher =dcfc.co.uk| title = Shaun’s Big Role| date = 23 August 2012[/tpl] Clough said; "Shaun is going to be as important as ever; he is a great leader. He will be around the place and it will be a case of us supporting him, then him supporting us as well. We will help get Shaun through the next 12 months or so, but we feel as though he can be a major positive on the first team squad. He won't be moping around, he won't be sulking, he will be his usual positive self around the place and he is good to have around." Clough also said he saw similarities between Barker and club capatin Richard Keogh, who joined the club as a replacement for the sold Jason Shackell. Despite this injury, Barker signed a one year extension to his contract in September 2012, which extended his stay at the club until the summer of 2015.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19478160| publisher =BBC Sport| title = Shaun Barker extends Derby County contract by 12 months| date = 5 September 2012[/tpl] In February 2013. eleven months after his injury, it was reported that Barker had undergone three further operations and his rehab was stepped up by taking part in swimming sessions, Barker stated his relief at being able to exercise and step his recovery outside of Derby's training facility at Moor Farm and was again hopeful for a return to the Derby County team.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21459897| publisher =BBC Sport| title =Shaun Barker: Derby County skipper steps up rehab| date = 14 February 2013[/tpl]
