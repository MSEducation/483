Following the outbreak of World War I he served in France, Belgium and Egypt for the duration of the war, after which he returned to India to serve in the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919.  He was twice Mentioned in Despatches and was promoted to Major. In June 1921, while serving with the Supplies and Transport Corps of the Indian Army, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division).[tpl]London Gazette|issue=32353|supp=yes|date=10 June 1921|startpage=4694|accessdate=26 October 2009[/tpl] In 1926 he retired from the Indian Army and emigrated to Australia.

==Ornithology==

Whittell settled with his family at Bridgetown, Western Australia, 270 km south of Perth, where he bought an orchard and a dairy farm which he managed successfully, becoming a prosperous member of the local farming community.  By 1929 he had revived a lifelong interest in birds and was ornithologically active, joining the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) that year.  He started building up a bird egg and skin collection, as well as establishing an ornithological library.  He also made several collecting trips in the south-west and south-east of Western Australia.
In 1939 Whittell became Convener of the RAOU’s Checklist Committee, serving also as President of the Union 1941-1943.  A keen conservationist, from 1946 he served on the State Fauna Protection Advisory Committee.  In 1943 he began a collaboration with Dominic Serventy on a regional handbook, the Birds of Western Australia, the first edition of which was published in 1948.  From the mid-1930s he had been working on a comprehensive history and bibliography of Australian ornithology, The Literature of Australian Birds, a monumental 900-page volume published in 1954 not long after his death.
Whittell was described by his friend and collaborator Dom Serventy as follows:
 ”Physically he was a slight man, of restless disposition, and his physiognomy, with the keen face and the alert prominent blue-grey eyes, reminded one strikingly of some of the profile portraits of Frederick the Great.  Personally he was of the highest integrity and he despised any adventitious aid to advancement, such as joining the ‘right’ social organizations or currying favour with persons supposed to have influence.  He found it difficult to suffer fools gladly and this, combined with a somewhat choleric temperament at times, alienated some of his acquaintances.  Others were never quite at their ease in his presence, never knowing whether to take his quips, uttered in a clipped English accent, as real reproaches or humorous chaffing.  However, when acquaintance passed to friendship his ripe observations from an intelligent and well-stocked mind, on people, places and things, combined with his essential good nature and fair dealing, made him an agreeable and congenial companion.”
 
Whittell was awarded Life Memberships of the St John Ambulance Association, the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia, and the Western Australian Naturalists' Club.  He died in 1954 following long and painful complications from surgery carried out more than a year previously in December 1952.  He was survived by his wife, a daughter, two sons and three grandchildren.
