==History==

Modern-day Pingtung County and Kaohsiung City were part of Wan-nien Province (萬年州) during the Kingdom of Tungning and Fengshan Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty. Pingtung County is a recently developed county. Its largest city is Pingtung City. The name Pingtung refers to a former nearby mountain known as Half-Screen Mountain (半屏山). Pingtung means "East of Half-Screen Mountain."
Until the seventeenth century this area of Taiwan was a place of exile for Chinese criminals and occasional landing point for international mariners. Only the settlements near present-day Checheng Township existed. In 1664 Han, Cantonese and Hakka settlers arrived from China and farmed under a homesteading system introduced by Zheng Jing.
Pingtung City, the biggest city in Pingtung County, also known as "A-Kau" (阿猴 [tpl]zh|poj=A-kâu[/tpl]), was the home of Pingpu Aboriginals. In their language, "A-kau" means "the forest".
The first settlements by Han people were not established until 1684 (the 23rd year of Kangxi) with the creation of villages near Pingtung by people from China's southern Fujian region. By 1734 most of the Pingtung Plain was cultivated and in 1764 Pingtung was expanded. In 1836 the government and locals worked together to build the four walls of the city (the North gate, the East gate, the West gate and the South gate), and the roads were also properly finished.
Under Japanese rule (1895–1945) the Pingtung area became a favorite spot for relaxation. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China, Pingtung becomes a provincial city of Taiwan Province on 25 December 1945. On 16 August 1950, Pintung Provincial City was changed to Pingtung County and Pingtung City was changed to county-controlled city on 1 December 1951.
Pingtung was the site of an 7.1 magnitude earthquake on 26 December 2006. In 2009, Pingtung received rainfall in excess of [tpl]convert|2500|mm|in[/tpl]; breaking all rainfall records of any single place in Taiwan induced by a single typhoon.

==Geography==

With a land area of over 2775 km², Pingtung is the 5th largest county in Taiwan, the 2nd largest of Southern Taiwan after Kaohsiung City. Geographically it borders Kaohsiung City to the north, Taitung County to the east, the Taiwan Strait to the west and the Bashi Channel to the south. 

===Climate===

Due to being located at the southernmost part of Taiwan, Pingtung County is well known of having one of the warmest climate within the country. The whole county experiences a tropical wet and dry climate, but due to being such a large county with various geographical differences, climate differs in different areas of the county. Northern Pingtung, such as the Pingtung City, is characterized by having a high daytime temperature year round, averaging from 29-33 degrees Celsius during the warmer season of April-November to 24-28 degrees Celsius during the cooler season of December-March, while also having the lowest nighttime temperatures within the county with temperatures usually dropping below 16 degrees Celsius at night in January due to being located more further away from the sea than any other flatland settlements within the county. Central Pingtung, such as the Fangliao Township, compared to northern Pingtung, has a relatively lower daytime temperature but has warmer nights due to the temperating affect of the ocean especially noticeable during winter. The southern tip of Pingtung, the Hengchun Peninsula, has the mildest climate within the county due to being nearly completely surrounded by the Pacific Ocean with the exception of the mountains on the north. Daily highs during the warmer season reaches around 28-31 while daily highs during the cooler season varies around 22-25 degrees C, but on the other hand night time temperatures maintains pretty warm throughout the year from around 25 degrees Celsius during summer to around 19 degrees Celsius during the winter.
