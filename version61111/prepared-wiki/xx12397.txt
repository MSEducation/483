</ref> Since O<sub>2</sub> and xenon have almost the same first [[ionization potential]], Bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon. On March 23, 1962, he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas, [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]].<ref name="bartlettxe">
