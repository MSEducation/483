Samuel Dashiell Hammett ([tpl]IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|l[/tpl]; May 27, 1894 – January 10, 1961) was an American author of hard-boiled detective novels and short stories, a screenplay writer, and political activist. Among the enduring characters he created are Sam Spade (The Maltese Falcon), Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man), and the Continental Op (Red Harvest and The Dain Curse).
In addition to the significant influence his novels and stories had on film, Hammett "is now widely regarded as one of the finest mystery writers of all time"[tpl]cite book|last = Layman|first = Richard|authorlink =|title = Shadow Man: The Life of Dashiell Hammett|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1981|page = 239|isbn = 0-15-181459-7[/tpl] and was called, in his obituary in The New York Times, "the dean of the... 'hard-boiled' school of detective fiction."[tpl]cite book|last = Layman, Richard & Bruccoli, Matthew J.|title = Hardboiled Mystery Writers: A Literary Reference|publisher = Carroll & Graf|year = 2002|page = 225|isbn = 0-7867-1029-2[/tpl] Time magazine included Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest on a list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.[tpl]cite news | title = TIME's Critics pick the 100 Best Novels 1923 to the Present | author = Lev Grossman | coauthors = Richard Lacayo | url = http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/ | publisher = Time | date = 2005-10-31 | accessdate = 2008-10-19[/tpl]

==Early life==

Hammett was born on a farm called Hopewell and Aim in  St. Mary's County, in southern Maryland.[tpl]Cite journal | url=http://www.somd.lib.md.us/tobacco_to_tomcats/ | title=Tobacco to Tomcats: St. Mary's County since the Revolution | first=Sandy | last=Shoemaker | page=160 | publisher=StreamLine Enterprises, Leonardtown, Maryland | accessdate=2008-01-01[/tpl] His parents were Richard Thomas Hammett and Anne Bond Dashiell. His mother belonged to an old Maryland family whose name was Anglicized from the French De Chiel. Hammett was baptized a CatholicGores, Joe in Emery, Vince, editor, Dashiell Hammett: Lost Stories. San Francisco: Vince Emery Productions, 2005, p. 197. and grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. "Sam", as he was known before he began writing, left school when he was 13 years old and held several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for the Pinkertons from 1915 to February 1922, with time off to serve in World War I. However, the agency's role in union strike-breaking eventually disillusioned him.Heise, Thomas, "'Going blood-simple like the natives': Contagious Urban Spaces and Modern Power in Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest" (paid access only), Modern Fiction Studies 51, no. 3 (Fall 2005) 506.

Hammett enlisted in the Army in 1918 and served in the Motor Ambulance Corps. However, he became ill with the Spanish flu and later contracted tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient in Cushman Hospital, Tacoma, Washington. While there he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he later married.

==Marriage and family==

Hammett and Dolan were married, and they had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 15 October 1921) and Josephine (born in 1926).Layman, Richard with Rivett, Julie M. (2001). "Review" of Selected Letters of Dashiell Hammett 1921-1960, Retrieved on 2009-06-02 Shortly after the birth of their second child, Health Services nurses informed Josephine that due to Hammett's TB, she and the children should not live with him full-time. Josephine rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon fell apart, but he continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.Gores in Emery, editor, p. 240 and 336.

==Career and personal life==

Hammett became an alcoholic before working in advertising and, eventually, writing. His previous work at the detective agency provided him the inspiration for his writings.Gores in Emery, editor, pp. 18-24.  Hammett wrote most of his detective fiction during the period that he was living in San Francisco (the 1920s), and specific streets and locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories. He was first published in 1922 in the magazine The Smart Set.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/dashiell-hammett/about-dashiell-hammett/625/ |title=Dashiell Hammett - About Dashiell Hammett | American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=2003-12-30 |accessdate=2013-06-11[/tpl] Known for his authenticity and realism in his writing, Hammett drew on his experiences as a Pinkerton operative.  As Hammett said: "All my characters were based on people I've known personally, or known about."Chandler, Nightmare Town, p. iii, ISBN 0-375-70102-8, ISBN 978-0-375-70102-3 Raymond Chandler, often considered Hammett's successor, summarized his accomplishments:
 Hammett was the ace performer... He is said to have lacked heart; yet the story he himself thought the most of The Glass Key is the record of a man's devotion to a friend. He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before. - Chandler, The Simple Art of Murder 
From 1929 to 1930 Dashiell was romantically involved with Nell Martin, an author of short stories and several novels. He dedicated The Glass Key to her, and in turn, she dedicated her novel Lovers Should Marry to Hammett. In 1931, Hammett embarked on a 30-year affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. He wrote his final novel in 1934, and devoted much of the rest of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong anti-fascist throughout the 1930s and in 1937 he joined the American Communist Party.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cpusa.org/article/static/511/#question12 |title=FAQ at the CPUSA site |publisher=Cpusa.org |accessdate=2012-07-19[/tpl] As a member (and in 1941 president) of the League of American Writers, he served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.Franklin Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope, University Press of Colorado, 1994, ISBN 0-87081-332-3 The League again abruptly shifted its political position, ending its anti-war stance, with the German invasion of the USSR in the summer of 1941.

==Service in World War II and post-war politics==

In early 1942, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. He was a disabled veteran of World War I, a victim of tuberculosis, and a Communist, but he pulled strings in order to be admitted. He served as a sergeant in the Aleutian Islands, where he edited an Army newspaper.  In 1943, while a member of the military, he had co-authored The Battle of the Aleutians with Cpl. Robert Colodny, under the direction of an Infantry intelligence officer, Major Henry W. Hall. While located in the Aleutians he fell victim to emphysema.
After the war, Hammett returned to political activism, "but he played that role with less fervor than before."[tpl]cite book|last = Layman|first = Richard|authorlink =|title = Shadow Man: The Life of Dashiell Hammett|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1981|page = 206|isbn = 0-15-181459-7[/tpl] He was elected President of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946 at a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City, and "devoted the largest portion of his working time to CRC activities." In 1946, a bail fund was created by the CRC "to be used at the discretion of three trustees to gain the release of defendants arrested for political reasons."Shadow Man: The Life of Dashiell Hammett, pp. 219-223 Those three trustees were Hammett, who was chairman, Robert W. Dunn, and Frederick Vanderbilt Field, "millionaire Communist supporter." On April 3, 1947, the CRC was designated a Communist front group on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations, as directed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9835.[tpl]cite news|url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0D9163EF934A35751C0A9669C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/N/Nemy,%20Enid|title=Frederick Vanderbilt Field, Wealthy Leftist, Dies at 94|author=Enid Nemy|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate= 2007-11-27 | date=February 7, 2000[/tpl]

==Imprisonment and the blacklist==

The CRC's bail fund gained national attention on November 4, 1949, when bail in the amount of "$260,000 in negotiable government bonds" was posted "to free eleven men appealing their convictions under the Smith Act for criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence." On July 2, 1951, their appeals exhausted, four of the convicted men fled rather than surrender themselves to Federal agents and begin serving their sentences. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued subpoenas to the trustees of the CRC bail fund in an attempt to learn the whereabouts of the fugitives. Hammett testified on July 9, 1951 in front of United States District Court Judge Sylvester Ryan, facing questioning by Irving Saypol, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, described by Time as "the nation's number one legal hunter of top Communists". During the hearing Hammett refused to provide the information the government wanted, specifically, the list of contributors to the bail fund, "people who might be sympathetic enough to harbor the fugitives." Instead, on every question regarding the CRC or the bail fund, Hammett took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to even identify his signature or initials on CRC documents the government had subpoenaed. As soon as his testimony concluded, Hammett was found guilty of contempt of court.[tpl]cite book|last = Metress|first = Christopher|authorlink =|title = The Critical Response to Dashiell Hammett|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1994|pages =|isbn =[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Johnson|first = Diane|authorlink =|title = Dashiell Hammett, a Life|publisher = Random House|year = 1983|pages =|isbn =[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/dhammett.htm|title=Dashiell Hammett|author=Petri Liukkonen|publisher=Books and Writers|accessdate=2007-11-27[/tpl] Hammett served time in a West Virginia federal penitentiary where, according to Lillian Hellman,Hellman, Lilian, Introduction to Hammett, Dashiell, The Big Knockover: Selected Stories and Short Novels (Houghton Mifflin: 1962) (published posthumously--Hammett had turned down offers to republish his stories and Hellman did so only after his death, as a tribute.), pp. vii-viii he was assigned to cleaning toilets.Hellman's Introduction to The Big Knockover pp. xi-xii Hellman says there began an "irritating farce" that Dashiell told her he was cleaning bathrooms "better than she had ever done" and "learned to take pride in the work" which she called his form of boasting, or humor, "to make fun of trouble or pain."

==Later years and death==

During the 1950s he was investigated by Congress. He testified on March 26, 1953 before the House Committee on Un-American Activities about his own activities, but refused to cooperate with the committee and was blacklisted.
A lifetime of heavy drinking and smoking worsened Hammett's tuberculosis contracted in World War I, and then according to Hellman "jail had made a thin man thinner, a sick man sicker . . . I knew he would now always be sick."Hellman's Introduction to The Big Knockover pp. xi & xii He may have meant to start a new literary life with the novel Tulip, but left it unfinished perhaps because he was "just too ill to care, too worn out to listen to plans or read contracts.  The fact of breathing, just breathing, took up all the days and nights."Hellman's Introduction to The Big Knockover p. viii (Hellman speculates Hammett turned down republishing offers because he might have hoped for a fresh start and "didn't want the old work to get in the way.")
As the years of the 1950s wore on, Hellman says Hammett became "a hermit", his decline evident in the clutter of his rented "ugly little country cottage" where "the signs of sickness were all around: now the phonograph was unplayed, the typewriter untouched, the beloved foolish gadgets unopened in their packages."Hellman's Introduction to The Big Knockover p. xx  Hammett no longer could live alone and they both knew it, so the last four years of his life he spent with Hellman. "Not all of that time was easy, and some of it very bad", she wrote but, "guessing death was not too far away, I would try for something to have afterwards."Hellman's Introduction to The Big Knockover p. xxvi  On January 10, 1961, Hammett died in New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital, of lung cancer, diagnosed just two months before. As a veteran of two World Wars, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
