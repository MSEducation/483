Richard Dorian "Dickie" Goodman  (April 19, 1934 – November 6, 1989)[tpl]cite news |title= LOCAL, AREA DEATHS |publisher=Fayetteville Observer, The (NC) |date= November 8, 1989  |accessdate=July 19, 2009[/tpl] was an American music and record producer born in Brooklyn, New York.  He is best known for inventing and using the technique of the "break-in", an early precursor to sampling, that used brief clips of popular records and songs to "answer" comedic questions posed by voice actors on his novelty records.  He also wrote and produced some original material, most often heard on the "b-side" of his break-in records.

==Career==

In June 1956 Goodman created his first record, "The Flying Saucer Parts 1 & II", which he co-wrote with his partner Bill Buchanan, and featured a four-minute rewriting of Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds radio show.[tpl]cite news |first=Willard |last=Jim  |title= Zany recording artists took humor to the skies |publisher=Daily Reporter-Herald |page=B2 |date= April 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2009 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Osborne |last=Jerry |title= The Flying Saucer' was first novelty break-in hit |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |page=13 |date=May 12, 1995 |accessdate=July 19, 2009 |quote= [/tpl] This recording was the subject of a copyright infringement case against Goodman.  The lawsuit was settled out of court. [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] "The Flying Saucer" was officially released under the artist name "Buchanan and Goodman" and was Goodman's highest-charting single on Billboard, peaking at #3.  Buchanan and Goodman followed up with four other records:  "Buchanan and Goodman on Trial" (#80 in 1956), "Flying Saucer The 2nd" (#18 in 1957), "The Creature (From A Science Fiction Movie)" (as by Buchanan and Ancell) (#85 in 1957), and "Santa and the Satellite (Parts I & II)" (#32 in 1957).
Starting in 1961, all of Goodman's hits carried the "Dickie Goodman" label credit.  Goodman scored three Billboard Hot 100 hits based on the hit TV series "The Untouchables":  "The Touchables" (#60), "The Touchables In Brooklyn" (#42), and "Santa and the Touchables" (#99).
In 1962 Goodman spoofed "Ben Casey" with "Ben Crazy" (#44).  In 1966 his spoof of "Batman" resulted in "Batman & His Grandmother" (#70).
In 1969 Goodman parodied the political unrest on college campuses with "On Campus" (#45) and the first moon landing with "Luna Trip" (#95).  Goodman's records also inspired KQV morning disc jockey Bob DeCarlo to cut his own sample-spliced top 10 hit "Convention '72" as by The Delegates.  Goodman himself spoofed political issues such as the Watergate Scandal with "Watergrate" (#42 in 1973), the 1973 energy crisis with "Energy Crisis '74" (#33 in 1974), and Richard Nixon with "Mr. President" (#73 in 1974).  Goodman failed to chart with a different version of "Mr. President" in 1981 after Ronald Reagan became President.
In 1975, Goodman parodied the movie Jaws with "Mr. Jaws" (#4 in 1975), becoming Goodman's biggest-selling record by achieving R.I.A.A. gold disc status in September 1975.[tpl]cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= 358| isbn= 0-214-20512-6[/tpl]  WLS played a customized version instead, with the line "This is Dickie Goodman at WLS" at the beginning.
Goodman's final chart record was "Kong" (#48 in 1977), spoofing the 1976 "King Kong" film remake, followed by others that failed to chart.  Altogether Goodman charted 17 hits, with five of them reaching the Top 40.   Goodman produced several other break-in records which garnered air-play and "charted" only in regional areas, usually Los Angeles and New York City, but in a few other areas as well.
Luniverse, Goodman's record label, featured works by other artists including the Del-Vikings.[tpl]cite book |author=Warner, Jay |chapter= |editor= |title=American Singing Groups: A History, From 1940 to Today |publisher=Hal Leonard |year=2006 |isbn=0-634-09978-7 |pages=149 [/tpl]
