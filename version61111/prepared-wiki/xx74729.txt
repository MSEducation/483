 In 1835, the historical record was muddled a bit when the first edition of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] altered pre-1831 revelations to make a distinction between the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods, and to classify the offices of elder and apostle as part of the latter.

===Restoration of other Priesthood keys===

In addition to the restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood (and the keys of the Holy Apostleship), additional Priesthood keys were conferred on Joseph Smith and others. In The Doctrine and Covenants, [tpl]Sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 110|verse=11|range=-16[/tpl] Joseph dictated the following passage as a revelation following the dedication of the first Latter-day Saint temple, the Kirtland Temple:

==Priesthood in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is recognized only in men and boys, who are ordained to offices in the priesthood as a matter of course once they reach the age of 12, so long as they meet requirements of "worthiness". There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Blacks and Mormonism).[ref]Tequitia Andrews (Oct. 4, 2008). Racism, testimony are barriers for black LDS Mormon Timesarticle
[/ref] This doctrine has been reversed since then and now allows all men, no matter of race or any other factor, to hold the Priesthood as long as they stay worthy to obtain it as is outlined by scriptures and church revelation.
Priesthood is structured as a vertical hierarchy with a clear chain of command. At each level in the hierarchy, the priesthood is organized by quorums, led by a presidency which usually consists of a president and two counselors. The church recognizes the two major "orders" of priesthood, Aaronic and Melchizedek, the latter being limited to men over the age of about 18 who hold the Aaronic priesthood and have been found worthy by both their bishop and stake president.

==Priesthood in the Community of Christ==

The Community of Christ teaches that all Christians are called by their gifts and talents to the ministry, priesthood is seen as a particular expression of universal ministry to which all are called. Since 1984, the church has ordained both women and men to the priesthood. All offices are deemed equal in importance, but the duties and responsibilities of each differ.
For a person to be called to the priesthood for the first time, his or her calling is typically discerned by the pastor of the local congregation. These priesthood calls are approved after review by a Mission Center President and vote of a congregational conference. For certain calls, especially to higher offices of the priesthood, the discernment will come through other church officials and approval will be voted upon at a Mission Center Conference or World Conference. Once the call has been administratively processed it is presented to the individual called. If that individual accepts the call and is sustained by a conference vote, he or she will be ordained to that office.
