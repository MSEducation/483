==Research==

Thalbourne extensively researched the psychology of belief in the paranormal, as well as attempted to elicit the paranormal itself under laboratory conditions. In the 1990s he wrote on the concept of transliminality; his early work suggesting that this could be a trait linking such personality variables as belief in the paranormal, creative personality, mystical experience and psychopathology led him to describe this as a "common thread" linking these variables.Thalbourne, M.A., & Delin, P.S. (1994). A common thread underlying belief in the paranormal, creative personality, mystical experience and psychopathology. Journal of Parapsychology, 58, 3-38. His later work looked at the relationship between religiosity, dream-interpretation and transliminalityThalbourne, M.A. & Delin, P.S. (1999). Transliminality: Its relation to dream life, religiosity and mystical experience. The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 9, 45-61. and also how transliminality may relate to traits such as psychoticism.Thalbourne, M.A., Bartemucci, L.,Delin, P.S., Fox, B., & Nofi, O. (1997). Transliminality: Its nature and correlates. Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 91, 305-331.
Thalbourne constructed a questionnaire which, as with Hood's M-Scale, assesses mystical experienceThalbourne, M.A. (1991). The psychology of mystical experience. Exceptional Human Experience, 9, 68-86.Lange, R., & Thalbourne, M.A. (2007). The Rasch scaling of mystical experiences: Construct validity and correlates of the Mystical Experience Scale (MES). The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 17, 121-140. called the Mystical Experience Scale. Thalbourne also collaborated on empirical research projects with Erlendur Haraldsson.Thalbourne, M.A., & Haraldsson, E. (1980). Personality characteristics of sheep and goats. Personality and Individual Differences, 1, 180-185.
Thalbourne also conducted research into kundalini. He published a scale to assess the kundalini experience with the world-renowned expert on panic attacks, Bronwyn Fox.Thalbourne, M.A., & Fox, B. (1999). Paranormal and mystical experience: The role of panic attacks and Kundalini. Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, 93, 99-115. More recently, he used a random number generator in connection with kundalini.Thalbourne, M.A. (2006). Kundalini and the output of a Random Number Generator. Journal of Parapsychology, 70, 302-33. In his paper of 2006, he stated that he understands the term "Kundalini" to mean "the coiled one", and he refers to research into the near-death experience in connection with kundalini, and also refers to the Physio-Kundalini Scale, the 19-item scale devised by Bruce Greyson to assess kundalini experience.
