==Background==

According to lead guitarist Steve Lynch, the album took 30 days to record and master; "We were seasoned musicians in the studio so worked very fast and were always well prepared." He also noted that its major hit, "Turn Up the Radio," was recorded at the tail end of the Sign in Please sessions and that RCA didn't find it suitable enough for inclusion. However, after stern insistence, the band was able to get it on the album. Neither party, however, expected it to gain such critical success that led to the album's gold status in 1985.Autograph Guitarist / Guitar Teacher Steve Lynch FullinBloom.com. Retrieved on 7-01-11.
