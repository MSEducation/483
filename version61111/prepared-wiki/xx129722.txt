[tpl]nihongo|Lullaby for the Soul|心守歌|Kokoromoriuta[/tpl] is the 29th studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Miyuki Nakajima, released in September 2001.
As a follow-up to a double A-Side single "Earthly Stars (Unsung Heroes)"/"Headlight, Taillight" that became a enduring seller, Lullaby for the Soul was greeted with relatively high anticipation. It debuted at #3 on the Oricon chart in first week (highest position since her 1996 compilation Daiginjyō which became last #1 hit), although it quickly fell off the top 100 with physical sales of less than 100,000 copies in total.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/search/result.php?kbn=ja&types=rnk&sw=+&search_type=album&year=2001&month=10&week=1&web.x=43&web.y=6&web=Oricon+Search 2001年10月第1週の邦楽アルバムランキング情報|title= Search results of the Japanese Oricon Weekly　Albums Chart - 1st week of October 2001|work=oricon.co.jp|language=Japanese|publisher=Oricon|accessdate=December 23, 2010[/tpl]Music video of the opening track was produced to promote the album, and it was later issued on compilation DVD Utahime: Live in L.A. in 2004.
