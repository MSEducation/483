It is their first release with permanent member Frank Watkins on bass, and also their first and only album with guitarist James Murphy, previously of the group Death.
The cover art of this album was used in an H.P. Lovecraft collection, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre, and part of it was used in The Tomb and The Doom That Came to Sarnath paperbacks. It was supposed to be the cover of Sepultura's album Beneath the Remains,Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces  from Decibel Magazine. but Roadrunner Records let Obituary use it first, even though Cause of Death was released in 1990, a year after Beneath the Remains. Sepultura chose another Michael Whelan illustration for Beneath The Remains's cover.
