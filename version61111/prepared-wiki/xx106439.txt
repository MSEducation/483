The Estadio Nemesio Díez, nicknamed La Bombonera, is one of the oldest football stadiums in Mexico. Opened on August 18, 1954, with a capacity of 27,000 seats, it is located in the city of Toluca, Mexico, near Mexico City. It is the home of Deportivo Toluca Fútbol Club. Because of its location this stadium has hosted two World Cups (1970 and 1986). One former nuance about this stadium is that it did not have a lighting system which forced the local team, as a tradition to play with sunlight. However, this has changed with Toluca's entry into the Copa Sudamericana because CONMEBOL has a policy stating that all teams participating in the cup must have a lighting system available in their stadiums.
