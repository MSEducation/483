==History==

Dagon ([tpl]lang-mnw|လဂုင်[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-mnw|ləɡòʊɴ|[/tpl]) was a small fishing village founded by the Mon in the 6th century, CE, around the Shwedagon Pagoda. Throughout much of the history, the village was just in the periphery of Thanlyin (Syriam), the commercial city located across the Yangon river. Still, because of the pagoda, Dagon's cultural significance was far greater than its size. In 1755, King Alaungpaya captured the village, renamed it Yangon (most commonly translated as "End of Strife"), and founded a larger city by adding settlements such as Ahlon, Pabedan, Kyauktada, and Botataung.
During the British colonial period, Dagon was mostly a prosperous neighborhood, though the areas closer to downtown were full of squatters. Dagon boasted both the Methodist English High School, one of the top English-language medium schools and the nationalist Burmese language medium high school, Myoma High School.
In the 1950s, the Burmese government cleared the squatters in the southern part of the township, and built the Minmanaing Housing Project for senior civil servants. Dagon gained another prominent pagoda in the 1980s, when Gen. Ne Win commissioned the Maha Wiziya Pagoda.
