The machines are currently located in major Coca-Cola partners and retail locations as a part of a gradual and ongoing deployment.  The machines have faced some consumer complaints due to long lines as a result of extra time it takes for consumers to decide on a product to dispense.http://www.practicallyefficient.com/home/2011/12/14/freestyle

==Design==

The cabinetry was designed by the Italian automotive design firm Pininfarina, via their Pininfarina Extra industrial and product design subsidiary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/18642|title=Pininfarina Partners With The Coca-Cola Company on Coca-Cola Freestyle|date=2009-09-11|first=Levent|last=Ozler|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=2011-12-22[/tpl] Technologies involved include microdispensing technology and proprietary PurePour technology. Both technologies were originally developed to deliver precise doses of drugs. One Freestyle unit with a similar footprint to a current vending machine can dispense 126 kinds of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages from one freestanding unit.  Microdosing blends one or more concentrated ingredients in [tpl]convert|46|USfloz|L|2|abbr=on[/tpl] packets with water and sweetener at the point where the beverage is dispensed,[tpl]cite web|url=http://fastfood.freedomblogging.com/2009/07/21/video-coca-cola-freestyle-demo-how-it-works/29053/|title=Video: Coca-Cola Freestyle demo & how it works|date=2009-07-21|first=Nancy|last=Luna|publisher=Orange County Register|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] thus avoiding the use of traditional [tpl]convert|5|usgal|L|1|abbr=on[/tpl] boxes of syrup (also known as a bag-in-a-box).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSN2915883820090929|title=Coca-Cola to expand testing of new drink fountain|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-10-18|date=2009-09-30|first=Matthew|last=Bigg[/tpl] Cartridges store concentrated ingredients in the dispenser cabinet and are RFID enabled. The machine uses RFID chips to detect its supplies and to radio resupplying needs to other units. The machines transmit supply and demand data to both Coca-Cola and the owner including brands sold, times of the day of sales, troubleshooting information, and service data.[tpl]cite news|url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/othercities/seattle/stories/2009/07/20/daily8.html?s=industry|title=Bsquare-Coca-Cola team up on high-tech soda machine|publisher=Puget Sound Business Journal|date=2009-07-20|accessdate=2009-08-25|location=Seattle, Washington[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] The traditional ice cube dispenser remains.

Contractors for its development include:
Testing began in Utah, Southern California, and Georgia in July 2009 with 60+ locations around America planned by the end of that summer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/bizarre&id=6927931|title=New soda machines customizes flavors|date=2009-07-22|publisher=KGO-TV|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] Test locations around Coca-Cola's home city of Atlanta included the World of Coca-Cola, AMC Theatres Southlake Pavilion 24 and Parkway Point 15,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=126176&id=106593592062&ref=mf|title=Event @ AMC|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|date=2009-10-02|accessdate=2009-10-18|format=photo[/tpl] and area food chains, including Willy's Mexicana Grill.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.11alive.com/rss/rss_story.aspx?storyid=135920|title=More Flavors of Coke Coming to a Restaurant Near You|first=Christ|last=Sweigart|date=2009-10-02|location=Atlanta, Georgia|publisher=WXIA-TV|format=video|accessdate=2010-05-13[/tpl] Three machines are available in the Universal Studios Florida and Universal's Islands of Adventure theme parks as well as the AMC movie theater at Downtown Disney  shopping complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. One of the largest movie theater chains in the US, Carmike Cinemas, installed the machines in several markets including the Carmike 13 in Champaign, IL.
Coca-Cola deployed the machines to 500 more locations in the United States in June 2010,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1642790/coke-freestyle-choice-drinks-beverages-inkjet-restaurants-touchscreen-redesign| title=Coke's Freestyle Machines Ready to Rock Tongues With 104 Flavors |date=2010-05-10|accessdate=2010-06-10[/tpl] followed by deployment to some universities in the United States.

Coca-Cola has installed Freestyle machines in Canada in select Wendy's, Burger King, and Hero Certified Burgers restaurants, as well as entertainment venues, such as Cineplex Entertainment cinemas and Canada's Wonderland.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
In late June 2012 Coca-Cola started a limited trial in the UK (in association with Burger King UK), with the machine initially deployed in 16 locations around Greater London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peach-report.com/Operations/1450544/cocacola_to_go_selfserve_with_bk.html| title=Coca-Cola to go self-serve with BK|accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl] They are also now in Five Guys UK branches.https://www.fiveguys.co.uk/ourmenu The selection of brands available from a UK coke freestyle machine is different from the USA, as only brands that are usually sold in the UK are available. Schweppes Lemonade and still versions of Fanta are brands that are available.http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/freestyle/

==Price==

The machines are leased for $300 per month ($3,600 per year), approximately 60%[tpl]Citation needed|reason=No sources given for this fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] more than a standard Coca Cola fountain.
