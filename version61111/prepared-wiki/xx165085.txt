The Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant is located in Philippsburg in Karlsruhe (district). It is operated by EnBW Kernkraft GmbH.
It houses two units, the first a  BWR (boiling water reactor) and the second a  PWR (pressurized water reactor).  
For the first unit, parts made for the cancelled Wyhl plant were used. The second unit was originally planned to be a BWR as well but plans later changed.  Final disconnection for both units was scheduled for 2011 for unit 1 and 2017 for unit 2, but as of 2010 had been changed to 2026 and 2032 respectively.World Nuclear Association

The outcome of this moratorium was announced on the morning of 30th May,2011 and Philippsburg-1 was named as a plant that would not be returning to generation at the end of the moratorium.
