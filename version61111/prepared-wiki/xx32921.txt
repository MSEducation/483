Sven-Göran Eriksson ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˈsvɛn ˈjœː.ˈran ˈeːrɪk.ˈsɔn|-|sv-Sven-Göran_Eriksson.ogg[/tpl]; born 5 February 1948), commonly referred to just by his nickname Svennis in Sweden,[tpl]cite web| title = The Tord Way | url = http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/3093/29/ | publisher = When Saturday Comes| accessdate =29 June 2009[/tpl] is a Swedish football manager and former player.
Eriksson won 17 major trophies as a manager, with a variety of league clubs in Sweden, Portugal and Italy, between 1979 and 2000, and became the first manager to win league-and-cup doubles in three different countries. He later managed the national teams of England, Mexico and Côte d'Ivoire, and three clubs in England. He is currently the manager of Chinese Super League club Guangzhou R&F.
He has worked in nine different countries; Sweden, Portugal, Italy, England, Mexico, Ivory Coast, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and China.

==Playing career==

Born in Sunne and raised in Torsby, in Värmland, Eriksson had an unremarkable playing career playing as a right-back in the lower divisions of Swedish football.[tpl]cite news | title = Sven Goran Eriksson factfile | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2000/10/31/eriksson_factfile/ | publisher = CNN| accessdate =5 August 2007[/tpl] The highest level he played at was Division 2 with KB Karlskoga FF, where he also worked as a PE teacher in Örebro.[tpl]cite book |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan |date=2009 |title=Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics |publisher=Orion Books |isbn=978-1-4091-0204-5 |pages=299-301[/tpl] He was heavily influenced by his player-manager, Tord Grip, who favoured the English style of play that Bob Houghton and Roy Hodgson had brought to the country. Eriksson was forced into an early retirement owing to a knee injury in 1975 aged 27.[tpl]cite web | title = Sven Goran Eriksson | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=35 | publisher = ESPN| accessdate =5 August 2007[/tpl]

==Management career==

===Degerfors IF===

Having retired as a player, Eriksson received an offer to become Tord Grip's assistant at Degerfors.[tpl]cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Joe |title=Sven: The Final Reckoning |year=2004 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-00-714069-X[/tpl]p78 A year later, Grip was appointed assistant manager of the Swedish national team, and Eriksson became Degerfors' manager. His stint as manager lasted from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1978.[tpl]cite web|title=Degerfors IF .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/degerfors-if/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] He led the team to the playoffs in 1977 and 1978, winning the latter and promotion to Swedish Football Division 2.

===IFK Göteborg===

His success with assistant manager Tom Chadney by his side attracted the attention of much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of IFK Göteborg on 1 January 1979.[tpl]cite web|title=IFK Göteborg .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/ifk-goeteborg/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] The move was such a surprise that many of the players had never even heard of him. Göteborg lost their first three games and Eriksson offered to resign but the players convinced him to stay and the team's form improved. They finished second in the Allsvenskan and won the Svenska Cupen for the first time in the club's history, defeating Åtvidabergs FF 6–1 in the final. Although results had improved, the team's style did not make him popular. He put results ahead of style, emphasised tactical awareness, work-rate and reigned in the team's old cavalier style. As a consequence, the average attendance fell by 3,000 to 13,320. Like Grip, he was influenced by Houghton and Hodgson and played a 4–4–2 with zonal marking and heavy pressing.
Göteborg finished third in the 1980 season and second again in 1981. The following season, they won the "treble". The team won the League and subsequent playoff, the Svenska Cupen, defeating Östers IF 3–2 in the final.
Eriksson's international breakthrough came during the spring of 1982, when he led IFK Göteborg to the first ever UEFA Cup for a Swedish club, defeating FC Valencia in the quarterfinals and 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the semifinals. Awaiting them in the finals were Hamburger SV. At Nya Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, Göteborg managed to score a late deciding goal, and took a 1–0 score with them to the away fixture, which they won 3–0, and with it, the 1981–82 UEFA Cup by an aggregate score of 4–0.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1981/matches/all/index.html |title=1981/82 Matches |publisher=UEFA[/tpl] His club's success sparked interested his skills from other clubs, leading him to leave IFK Göteborg in August 1982.

===Benfica===

Eriksson's European success led to him being head-hunted by Portuguese club Benfica. Eriksson joined Benfica on 1 September 1982.[tpl]cite web|title=SL Benfica .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/sl-benfica/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] Eriksson had a similarly quick impact there, winning the Primeira Liga, the Taça de Portugal, and finishing runners-up in the UEFA Cup to Anderlecht. After a second Championship the following year, Eriksson moved on to Italy, becoming manager of A.S. Roma.[tpl]cite web|title=AS Roma .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/as-roma/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl]

===Roma===

Eriksson joined Roma on 1 July 1984. He was not as immediately successful at the Giallorossi as he had been before, but he still won a Coppa Italia in 1986. Eriksson left the club on 6 May 1987.

===Fiorentina and return to Benfica===

Eriksson was manager of Fiorentina from 1 July 1987.[tpl]cite web|title=ACF Fiorentina .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/acf-fiorentina/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] Eriksson stint with the club was trophyless. Eriksson moved back to Benfica for a second stint in 1989. Eriksson led the Portuguese side to the final of the European Cup (losing to Milan 1–0) in 1990, and another League title in 1991. Eriksson left the club in June 1992.

===Sampdoria===

In 1992, Eriksson returned to Italy with Sampdoria.[tpl]cite web|title=Sampdoria .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/sampdoria/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] where he managed to win another Coppa Italia in 1994. Eriksson left in June 1997.

===Lazio===

In 1997, Eriksson agreed to leave Sampdoria at the end of the season to manage Blackburn Rovers. Later on that year, however, he went back on his word and opted to stay in Italy and become the new manager at Lazio. Eriksson took over Lazio on 1 July 1997.[tpl]cite web|title=Lazio Roma .:. Coaches from A-Z|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/lazio-roma/9/|publisher=World Football|accessdate=13 February 2013[/tpl] Eriksson stated family reasons for wanting to stay in Italy. Rovers eventually appointed Roy Hodgson. Eriksson employed fellow Swede Tord Grip as his assistant. Eriksson finally found major success in Italy with Lazio when he won the Coppa Italia and the Italian Supercup in 1998 and 2000, the European Cup Winners' Cup (1999, the very last tournament), and the Serie A title (the Scudetto) in 2000 — only the second time that the Roman club had won the Italian championship in their history. That season had begun with glory in the UEFA Super Cup, winning 1–0 against Manchester United. Bankrolled by Sergio Cragnotti's investment in the team — some £274 million in more than four seasons — Eriksson amassed trophies on a remarkable scale and because of this, many fans consider him to be Lazio's most successful manager ever.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]

===England manager===

====2002 FIFA World Cup====

Following the resignation of England manager Kevin Keegan after a home loss to Germany in October 2000, The Football Association specifically pursued Eriksson as his replacement. Eriksson had initially agreed to take over after the expiration of his contract in summer 2001, but decided to resign his post at Lazio early and he officially began his England duties in January of that year.[tpl]cite news|title=Eriksson sagt Ciao, Zoff tritt Nachfolge an|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/intligen/startseite/239670/artikel_eriksson-sagt-ciao-zoff-tritt-nachfolge-an.html|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=kicker|date=9 January 2001|language=German[/tpl] Eriksson was the first foreign manager to be appointed coach of the England national team.
Eriksson turned around England's bid for qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup with several crucial wins over lesser opposition before his first real test — England's rematch with Germany in Munich on 1 September 2001. England crushed their long-time rivals 5–1. Despite this, England still needed a late equaliser at home to Greece to qualify automatically. At the Finals, England drew with Sweden, defeated their other longtime rivals Argentina 1–0, and drew with Nigeria to qualify in second place from the four-team group. They went on to defeat Denmark 3–0 in the Round of 16 before losing 2–1 to 10-man Brazil, who went on to win the tournament.

====UEFA Euro 2004====

After winning their first qualifying match in Slovakia, England drew at home with Macedonia and were then booed off by their fans after losing a friendly to Australia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article188233.ece |title=Drown 'n out|work=The Sun|publisher=News International|accessdate=18 February 2008|date=27 July 2007|first=Steven|last=Howard[/tpl] England, however, won their next five qualifiers and, needing a point from the last game to qualify, drew 0–0 in Turkey to top the group.
In their first match in the finals, England were winning 1–0 against France after 90 minutes but lost after Zinedine Zidane scored twice in injury time. A 3–0 victory over Switzerland and a 4–2 victory over Croatia, however, meant England still qualified for a quarter-final against the hosts Portugal. There, Michael Owen gave England an early lead but Hélder Postiga equalised. England had a Sol Campbell goal disallowed before losing on penalties.

====2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying====

Regardless of the antipathy to Eriksson expressed by some in the English media, the England team professed total confidence in him and threatened to strike during one media driven campaign to oust him. He was also backed by the official England Fan organisations. It may be due to that unprecedented support that the FA renewed and extended Eriksson's contract by two further years to include UEFA Euro 2008. On 7 September 2005, Eriksson's England team lost a World Cup qualifying match against Northern Ireland 1–0, the first time that England had lost to that team since 1972 and one of only five competitive games lost during Eriksson's tenure. Although it was England's first ever defeat in a World Cup or European Championship qualifying match under Eriksson, it brought his position under unprecedented pressure and he was criticized, both by some fans and by BBC commentators, for his alleged lack of charisma and tactical awareness. Criticism continued as England scraped a 1–0 victory over Austria in a game which saw David Beckham controversially sent off. Some of the criticism from within the media was answered however, as England put in a much improved performance, despite the absence of Beckham through suspension and Sol Campbell and Steven Gerrard through injury, in a 2–1 win against Poland. When the FA declared that Eriksson was to be "released" at the end of the 2006 World Cup tournament, the official England Fan organisation undertook an unprecedented "Save Our Sven" campaign that was also engaged in by several British newspapers. The decision was made, however, and Eriksson's tenure was terminated, costing the FA a year of penalty payment damages that saw Eriksson unemployed for 12 months at the FA's considerable expense.

====Successor announced====

In 2006, Eriksson was recorded saying he would be willing to leave England to manage Aston Villa if England won the World Cup, after being duped into believing that a wealthy Arab would buy the club and wanted him as manager. The wealthy "Arab" was in fact the "Fake Sheikh" Mazher Mahmood, an undercover News of the World reporter.
On 23 January, The Football Association announced that Eriksson would leave his job after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and it was thought that the News of the World allegations played a part in this decision.[tpl]cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4641682.stm| title = Eriksson to quit after World Cup| work = BBC Sport| accessdate =7 July 2007| date=23 January 2006[/tpl] This was later denied by both parties, with Eriksson explaining that there was a prior arrangement to terminate his contract immediately after the World Cup. The announcement that Eriksson was to depart from the job as England team coach was met with extensive protests and a "Save Our Sven" campaign from the Official England Fan organisation backed by several British national newspapers.
Following a lengthy period of public and media speculation as to his successor the FA announced on 4 May 2006 that Steve McClaren, Eriksson's assistant, would take over the reins after the World Cup.

====2006 FIFA World Cup finals====

England finished top of Group B at the finals, beating Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago, before a 2–2 draw with Sweden, although the English press considered their performances far from satisfactory.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5084934.stm|title=England stumble on|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 July 2007|date=15 June 2006|first=Phil|last=McNulty[/tpl]
In the second round, a David Beckham trademark free kick was enough to see Eriksson's England past Ecuador in a lacklustre 1–0 encounter. Eriksson, however, once again fell to nemesis Luiz Felipe Scolari's Portugal. They defeated England 3–1 on penalties with the score 0–0 after extra time, with Beckham lost to injury and Wayne Rooney sent off for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho. The result was Eriksson's third successive exit in a major tournament quarter-final. In his farewell speech, Eriksson wished England well and singled out Rooney for special praise, advising the press not to blame the youngster's dismissal for England's exit.

====England manager summary====

Eriksson improved England's FIFA World Ranking from 17th place in January 2001 to 5th place in July 2006, reaching 4th during the 2006 World Cup, and was rated by the FA as England's second most successful manager after Alf Ramsey. He is the only England manager — other than the short-lived Terry Venables and current head coach Roy Hodgson — who has never failed to guide England to the last eight in a major tournament.Walter Winterbottom's England was eliminated in the first group stage at the 1950 and 1958 World Cups. Alf Ramsey's men failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup. Don Revie failed to guide England to qualification at either the 1976 European Championships or the 1978 World Cup.  Ron Greenwood's England side was eliminated in the 12-team second group stage of the 1982 World Cup. Bobby Robson's team failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championships. Graham Taylor's men failed to reach the finals of the 1994 World Cup. Glenn Hoddle's team was eliminated in the Round of 16 at the 1998 World Cup. Kevin Keegan's team was eliminated in the group stage of Euro 2000. Steve McClaren failed to qualify for Euro 2008. Fabio Capello's team was eliminated in the round of 16 at the 2010 World Cup.
Under Eriksson, England achieved the highest point percentage in major tournament matches of all time for an England manager,[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamMgr/MgrPtsComp.html| title = England's Coaches/Managers by Points Percentage in Major Tournament Matches| work = England Football Online| accessdate =24 June 2007[/tpl] losing only three competitive games (excluding extra-time) and achieved top qualifying place in all three International tournaments. Only Brazil matched England's record of reaching the quarter-final in tournaments in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Coincidentally, the same manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, knocked England out of all three of these tournaments, first with Brazil and then twice with Portugal.
Eriksson is the only England manager never to have led an England team out at their permanent home venue of the old Wembley Stadium or the new Wembley Stadium. Wembley was closed for redevelopment the same month that the FA asked him to take over, October 2000, and he resigned before the new Wembley Stadium was opened.

===Manchester City===

In July 2007, virtually a year to the day that he left the England job, Eriksson was confirmed as the new manager of Manchester City after signing a three-year contract worth £2 million a year plus bonuses.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007290402,00.html|title=Football: Svenmania at the City (The Sun Online) | location=London | first=Neil|last=Custis|date=29 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] He was Manchester City's first manager from outside of the UK[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/6241052.stm|title=Eriksson named Man City manager|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 June 2008 | date=6 July 2007[/tpl]
Before the season started, he signed striker Rolando Bianchi for £8.8 million, along with midfielders Gelson Fernandes, Geovanni, Martin Petrov, and Elano; and defenders Vedran Ćorluka and Javier Garrido.
On 19 August, Manchester City beat league champions Manchester United to go top of the Premier League after three games without conceding a goal. Eriksson received the Premier League's Manager of the Month award for August. The club stayed in the top six throughout the rest of 2007, and were third throughout October and November, but fell to seventh on 12 January 2008 after winning only one of their previous five games.
In Spring 2008, Shinawatra claimed that he would replace Eriksson after only one full season, because of an "avalanche of very poor results which is unacceptable at this level." This resulted in an outcry from Manchester City fans who coordinated an SOS ("Save Our Sven") campaign — similar to the Official England Fan's campaign in the spring of 2006 — including a well attended march from the City centre to Eastlands Stadium and a flood of letters to the club and the Manchester Evening News. The failure to react to public and fan demands resulted in high volume of fans cancelling or not renewing their season tickets. Also, the team announced that they would go on strike. Eriksson rejected any interference and also persuaded his players against potentially damaging their careers by an all out strike. In the last game of the season, Manchester City suffered an 8–1 loss to Middlesbrough, the biggest defeat of Eriksson's career. Many concluded that the team had "gone on strike" as a symbolic protest during the game, although a red card for Richard Dunne after 15 minutes made the game difficult for City.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7381794.stm|title=Middlesbrough 8–1 Man City|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 June 2008 | date=11 May 2008|first=Chris|last=Bevan[/tpl]
Manchester City ended in ninth place in the league, one place away from the UEFA Cup 2008–09 qualifying positions. Manchester City subsequently qualified through the extra place awarded to the Premier League for finishing as the highest placed team who hadn't already qualified for a European competition in the UEFA Fair Play League for 2007–08.
Eriksson became the first Manchester City manager since 1969–70 to win both league derby games against Manchester United and also achieved the club's joint highest Premier League point total, 55.
On 2 June 2008, Manchester City confirmed by club statement that they had parted company with Eriksson by "mutual consent", with Eriksson still having two years left on his contract. Following news of his departure, the City supporters' groups organised a petition with around 14,000 signatures which was handed to the club.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7430827.stm|title=Eriksson's reign at Man City ends|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 June 2008 | date=2 June 2008[/tpl]

===Mexico national football team===

On 3 June 2008, he was officially signed to become the manager of the Mexican national team.[tpl]cite news| title = Sven takes on Mexico post| url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3646188,00.html|work = Sky Sports|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting| date = 3 June 2008| accessdate =3 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] He formally started the role after Mexico's World Cup qualifier against Belize on 21 June).[tpl]cite news|first=Grahame L.| last=Jones |title = Sven-Goran Eriksson named Mexico's coach| url = http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/galaxy/la-sp-mexico4-2008jun04,0,4816546.story| work = LA Times| date = 4 June 2008| accessdate =6 June 2008[/tpl]
On 20 August 2008, he debuted as manager of the Mexican National team in a CONCACAF World Cup qualifier versus Honduras. Mexico went on to win 2–1. On the next matches some results were poor, as Mexico tied with Canada and lost to Jamaica and Honduras.
Also during August 2008, a British actor and comedian Derek Williams aka "Svenalike" was flown into Mexico City for a series of media stunts and the filming of a special feature for Mexico's Azteca TV broadcast corporation. The first stunt was mis-reported by a journalist employed by a rival media group and the news that a Sven-double had used "fake passes and forged documents" to gain entry to Mexico's Olympic stadium was on TV and in most newspapers around the world. The story was revealed to be false when all the Mexican soccer officials reported being completely fooled by the look-alike/sound-alike double but that the whole stunt had been revealed to them immediately after filming and that the incident had been "amazing" and "great fun". The absence of all and any fake documents was confirmed within the televised special feature of the reported incident and many other filmed fake-Sven stunts a few days later.
On 11 February 2009, Eriksson was put under further pressure as his side lost 2–0 to the United States. Calls for him to quit or be sacked were heard from the fans while the English club Portsmouth were rumoured to be interested in making him their new manager. This link was strengthened by reports of members from the Portsmouth board flying to Mexico City to discuss contract offers with Eriksson and a possible compensation settlement with the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación. In early March, Eriksson continued to deny that he would leave Mexico and return to manage Portsmouth, insisting that he would remain and help Mexico qualify for the World Cup.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_5001673,00.html | publisher=British Sky Broadcasting | work=Sky Sports | first=Jamie | last=Casey | title=Eriksson quashes Pompey talk|date=3 March 2009[/tpl] After a 3–1 World Cup Qualifying loss at Honduras, Eriksson was removed as national team coach.

===Notts County===

On 22 July 2009, Eriksson was appointed as Director of Football at English League Two team Notts County following that club's takeover by Middle East consortium Munto Finance with Eriksson getting a reported, but unconfirmed, £2m a year deal. It is believed his contract was based on the future success of the club with a large percentage share holding making up his contract. Eriksson later said that he was attracted by the consortium's plans to take the world's oldest league club to the top of the Premiership, and believed that they had the finance and commitment to do that. Large-scale investment in new facilities were promised, and Sol Campbell and Kasper Schmeichel joined the club from Premier League teams. Campbell, however, played only one game before departing and Schmeichel was released at the end of the season.
The consortium attempted to involve Eriksson in the running of the North Korean team, taking him to Pyongyang in October 2009.  This came to nothing, however, with Eriksson later saying that his efforts were wasted as he was unable to contact anyone on the North Korean side.
County's large debts, including an unpaid tax bill, emerged in November 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/feb/12/sven-goran-eriksson-notts-county-interview|title=Sven-Goran Eriksson: How I was conned at Notts County|date=12 February 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 February 2010 | location=London | first=Matt | last=Scott[/tpl] On 11 February 2010, Eriksson resigned as Director of Football following the club's takeover by former Lincoln City chairman Ray Trew.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/8511198.stm|title=Sven-Goran Eriksson leaves after Notts County takeover |date=11 February 2010|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 February 2010[/tpl] Eriksson waived a multi-million payoff in order to assist the takeover therefore chairman Trew described him as an "absolute gentleman". Notts County went up as League 2 Champions at the end of the season.

===Côte d'Ivoire national team===

On 28 March 2010, he became the manager of Côte d'Ivoire.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8587871.stm|title=Sven-Goran Eriksson raring to go as Ivory Coast coach|date=29 March 2010|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2010[/tpl] Disclosure of the amount of money Eriksson’s contract was worth has never been confirmed, but it has been reported that he got £270,000 for the job.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2912843/Sven-Goran-Erikssons-2m-deal-with-Ivory-Coast.html|title=Sven's £2m deal with cup nation in poverty|work=The Sun|publisher=News International|first1=Nick|last1=Parker|first2=Chris|last2=Pollard|date=30 March 2010[/tpl] On 15 June, Côte d'Ivoire played a 0–0 draw against Portugal in their opening game in Group G of the 2010 World Cup Finals, followed by a 3–1 loss against Brazil on 20 June. Despite defeating North Korea in the final group game 3–0, Côte d'Ivoire failed to qualify for the knock-out stages. Prior to the match against Brazil, the Brazilian coach, Dunga commented "With Eriksson, Ivory Coast has great balance. We used to see them play and they didn't have this type of organisation that they have now".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/news/7819177/Ivory-Coast-0-Portugal-0-report.html|title=Ivory Coast 0 Portugal 0: report|date=15 June 2010|work=Telegraph|accessdate=15 June 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Ogden[/tpl]
