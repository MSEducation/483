Slappy is the second extended play by the American punk rock band Green Day. It was released in the Summer of 1990 through Lookout! Records. Upon its release, several different colors of vinyl were available in limited quantities. Billie Joe Armstrong cited the extended play as the one on which Green Day began to find its sound.

==Album information==

"Paper Lanterns" was a popular Green Day song and a live staple for many years and was brought back for the 2010 leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. "Why Do You Want Him?" was the first song Armstrong wrote, back when he was fourteen. He expressed in a 2010 interview that contrary to the common belief, the song is not about his stepfather.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4X3IQCM4xM&feature=feedu |title=Green Day - Billie Joe and Mike Mayer [Interview |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2012-03-09[/tpl] The title "409 in Your Coffeemaker" is taken from a prank Armstrong pulled on his teacher. It was later re-recorded during the Dookie sessions. Although it was omitted from the album, it was released on the "Basket Case" CD single in the United Kingdom. "Knowledge" was originally performed by Operation Ivy. Green Day still performs the song live, often inviting fans onstage to play the band members' instruments for them during the performance of the song.
All four tracks from Slappy were included on the compilation album 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours in 1991. Slappy remained in print until August 2005, when Green Day removed its catalog from Lookout! Records.
Since March 24, 2009, Slappy (along with 1,000 Hours) has been back in print as a bonus to the vinyl reissue of the 39/Smooth album. However, a possible error may have been made as Slappys artwork is now tinted pink instead of dark red.
