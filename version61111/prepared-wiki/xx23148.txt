Trilobites ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|l|ɵ|b|aɪ|t[/tpl], [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|l|ɵ|b|aɪ|t[/tpl]; meaning "three lobes") are a well-known fossil group of extinct marine arthropods that form the class Trilobita. Trilobites form one of the earliest known groups of arthropods. The first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record defines the base of the Atdabanian stage of the Early Cambrian period ([tpl]ma|Atdabanian[/tpl]), and they flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when, during the Devonian, all trilobite orders except Proetida died out. Trilobites finally disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about [tpl]ma|250[/tpl]. The trilobites were among the most successful of all early animals, roaming the oceans for over 270 million years.http://firstlifeseries.com/learn-more/
When trilobites first appear in the fossil record they are already highly diverse and geographically dispersed. Because trilobites had wide diversity and an easily fossilized exoskeleton an extensive fossil record was left behind, with some 17,000 known species spanning Paleozoic time. The study of these fossils has facilitated important contributions to biostratigraphy, paleontology, evolutionary biology and plate tectonics. Trilobites are often placed within the arthropod subphylum Schizoramia within the superclass Arachnomorpha (equivalent to the Arachnata),[tpl]citation|last1=Cotton|first1=T. J.|first2=S.

Trilobites had many life styles; some moved over the sea-bed as predators, scavengers or filter feeders and some swam, feeding on plankton. Most life styles expected of modern marine arthropods are seen in trilobites, with the possible exception of parasitism (where there are still scientific debates).[tpl]citation |last1=Fortey |first1=Richard |author-link=Richard Fortey |year=2004 |title=The Lifestyles of the Trilobites |journal=American Scientist |volume=92 |pages=446–453 |url=http://www.cornellcollege.edu/geology/courses/Greenstein/paleo/trilobites.pdf |format=PDF |doi=[/tpl] Some trilobites (particularly the family Olenidae) are even thought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food.[tpl]Citation|last1=Fortey |first1=Richard |author-link=Richard Fortey |title=Olenid trilobites: The oldest known chemoautotrophic symbionts? |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=97 |issue=12 |pages=6574–6548 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10841557 |pmc=18664 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10841557|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.12.6574|bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.6574F [/tpl]

==Fossil record==

The earliest trilobites known from the fossil record are fallotaspids, and redlichiids (both order Redlichiida) and bigotinids (order Ptychopariida, superfamily Ellipsocephaloidea) dated to some [tpl]ma|540|520[/tpl].[tpl]citation|title=Trilobite!: Eyewitness to Evolution|first=Richard|last=Fortey|author-link=Richard Fortey |year=2000|isbn=0-00-257012-2|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London[/tpl] Contenders for the earliest trilobites include Profallotaspis jakutensis (Siberia), Fritzaspis spp. (western USA), Hupetina antiqua (Morocco)[tpl]Citation |last=Hollingsworth |first=J.

All Olenellina lack facial sutures (see below), and this is thought to represent the original state. The earliest sutured trilobite found so far (Lemdadella), occurs almost at the same time as the earliest Olenellina however, implying that trilobite origin lies before the start of the Atdabanian, but without leaving fossils. Other groups show secondary lost facial sutures, such as all Agnostina and some Phacopina. Another common feature of the Olenellina also suggests this suborder to be the ancestral trilobite stock:  early protaspid stages have not been found, supposedly because these were not calcified, and this also is supposed to represent the original state.[tpl]Citation |last=Clowes |first=Chris |title=Trilobite Origins |url=http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/Taxa/Arthropoda/Trilobita/TriOri.html |accessdate=April 12, 2009[/tpl] Earlier trilobites may be found and could shed more light on the origin of trilobites.[tpl]Citation |last1=Jell |first1=P. |contribution=Phylogeny of Early Cambrian trilobites |editor=Lane, P.

===Origins===

Early trilobites show all the features of the trilobite group as a whole; there do not seem to be any transitional or ancestral forms showing or combining the features of trilobites with other groups (e.g. early arthropods). Morphological similarities between trilobites and early arthropod-like creatures such as Spriggina, Parvancorina, and other "trilobitomorphs" of the Ediacaran period of the Precambrian are ambiguous enough to make detailed analysis of their ancestry far from compelling.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trilobites.info/origins.htm |title=Origins of Trilobites |author=Sam Gon III[/tpl] Morphological similarities between early trilobites and other Cambrian arthropods (e.g. the Burgess Shale fauna and the Maotianshan shales fauna) make analysis of ancestral relationships difficult.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trilobites.info/triloclass.htm#trilobites |title=Trilobite Classification |author=Sam Gon III[/tpl] However, it is still reasonable to assume that the trilobites share a common ancestor with other arthropods before the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. Evidence suggests that significant diversification had already occurred before trilobites were preserved in the fossil record, easily allowing for the "sudden" appearance of diverse trilobite groups with complex derived characteristics (e.g. eyes).

===Divergence and extinction===

For such a long-lasting group of animals, it is no surprise that trilobite evolutionary history is marked by a number of extinction events where some groups perished while surviving groups diversified to fill ecological niches with comparable or novel adaptations. Generally, trilobites maintained high diversity levels throughout the Cambrian and Ordovician periods before entering a drawn-out decline in the Devonian culminating in final extinction of the last few survivors at the end of the Permian period.

====Evolutionary trends====

Principal evolutionary trends from primitive morphologies (e.g. eoredlichids) include the origin of new types of eyes, improvement of enrollment and articulation mechanisms, increased size of pygidium (micropygy to isopygy) and development of extreme spinosity in certain groups. Changes also included narrowing of the thorax and increasing or decreasing numbers of thoracic segments.[tpl]Citation |last1=Fortey |first1=R. A. |last2=Owens |first2=R. M. |contribution=Evolutionary History |editor-last=Kaesler |editor-first=R. L. |title=Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part O, Arthropoda 1, Trilobita, revised. Volume 1: Introduction, Order Agnostida, Order Redlichiida |pages=249–287 |publisher=The Geological Society of America, Inc. & The University of Kansas |place=Boulder, CO & Lawrence, KA |year=1997 | isbn=0-8137-3115-1[/tpl] Specific changes to the cephalon are also noted; variable glabella size and shape, position of eyes and facial sutures & hypostome specialization. Several morphologies appeared independently within different major taxa (e.g. eye reduction or miniaturization).
Effacement is also a common evolutionary trend. It is the loss of surface detail in the cephalon, pygidium, or the thoracic furrows. Notable examples of this were the orders Agnostida, Asaphida, and the suborder Illaenina of Corynexochida. It is believed that effacement is an indication of either a burrowing lifestyle or a pelagic one. Effacement poses a problem for taxonomists since the loss of details (particularly of the Glabella) can make the determination of phylogenetic relationships difficult.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trilobites.info/trends.htm|title=Evolutionary Trends in Trilobites |author=Samuel M. Gon III|date=July 20, 2008|publisher=A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites |accessdate=April 14, 2011[/tpl]

====Pre-Cambrian====

Phylogenetic biogeographic analysis of Early Cambrian Olenellidae and Redlichidae suggests that a uniform trilobite fauna existed over Laurentia, Gondwana and Siberia before the tectonic breakup of the super-continent Pannotia between [tpl]Ma|600[/tpl] and [tpl]Ma|550[/tpl]. Tectonic breakup of Pannotia then allowed for the diversification and radiation expressed later in the Cambrian as the distinctive olenellid province (Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica) and the separate Redlichid province (Australia, Antarctica and China).[tpl]Citation |last1=Fortey |first1=R. A. |last2=Briggs |first2=D. E. G. |last3=Wills |first3=M. A. |title=The Cambrian evolutionary "explosion": decoupling cladogenesis from morphological disparity |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=57 |pages=13–33 |year=1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1996.tb01693.x[/tpl]
Breakup of Pannotia significantly predates the first appearance of trilobites in the fossil record, supporting a long and cryptic development of trilobites extending perhaps as far back as [tpl]ma|700[/tpl] or possibly further.

====Cambrian====

Very shortly after trilobite fossils appeared in the lower Cambrian, they rapidly diversified into the major orders that typified the Cambrian—Redlichiida, Ptychopariida, Agnostida and Corynexochida. The first major crisis in the trilobite fossil record occurred in the Middle Cambrian; surviving orders developed isopygus or macropygius bodies and developed thicker cuticles, allowing better defense against predators (see Thorax below). The end Cambrian mass extinction event marked a major change in trilobite fauna; almost all Redlichiida (including the Olenelloidea) and most Late Cambrian stocks went extinct. A continuing decrease in Laurentian continental shelf area is recorded at the same time as the extinctions, suggesting major environmental upheaval.
Major types of trilobites appearing in the Cambrian include:[tpl]cite book|title=Prehistoric Life: The Definitive Visual History of Life On Earth|year=2009|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London|isbn=9780756655730|page=76,88,89,90,91,104,105,127,161,180,181[/tpl]

====Ordovician====

The Early Ordovician is marked by vigorous radiations of articulate brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and graptolites with many groups appearing in the fossil record for the first time. Although intra-species trilobite diversity seems to have peaked during the Cambrian,[tpl]Citation |first=Mark |last=Webster |title=A Cambrian peak in morphological variation within trilobite species |journal=Science |volume=317 |pages=499–502 |year=2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1142964 |pmid=17656721 |issue=5837|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..499W [/tpl] trilobites were still active participants in the Ordovician radiation event with a new fauna taking over from the old Cambrian one. Phacopida and Trinucleioidea are characteristic forms, highly differentiated and diverse, most with uncertain ancestors. The Phacopida and other "new" clades almost certainly had Cambrian forebears, but the fact that they have avoided detection is a strong indication that novel morphologies were developing very rapidly. Changes within the trilobite fauna during the Ordovician foreshadowed the mass extinction at the end of the Ordovician allowing many families to continue into the Silurian with little disturbance.[tpl]Citation |last1=Adrain |first1=Jonathan M. |last2=Fortey |first2=Richard A. |authorlink2=Richard Fortey |last3=Westrop |first3=Stephen R. |title=Post-Cambrian trilobite diversity and evolutionary faunas |journal=Science |volume=280 |year=1998 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1922 |pmid=9632387 |issue=5371 |pages=1922–5|bibcode = 1998Sci...280.1922A [/tpl]
Ordovician trilobites were successful at exploiting new environments, notably reefs. However, the end Ordovician mass extinction did not leave the trilobites unscathed; some distinctive and previously successful forms such as the Trinucleioidea and Agnostida became extinct. The Ordovician marks the last great diversification period amongst the trilobites, very few entirely new patterns of organisation arose post-Ordovician; later evolution in trilobites was largely a matter of variations upon the Ordovician themes. By the Ordovician mass extinction vigorous trilobite radiation has stopped and gradual decline beckons.
Some of the important groups of Trilobites appearing in the Ordovician include:

====Silurian and Devonian====

Most Early Silurian families constitute a subgroup of the Late Ordovocian fauna. Few, if any, of the dominant Early Ordovician fauna survived to the end of the Ordovician, yet 74% of the dominant Late Ordovician trilobite fauna survived the Ordovician. Late Ordovician survivors account for all post-Ordovician trilobite groups except the Harpetida.
Silurian and Devonian trilobite assemblages are superficially similar to Ordovician assemblages, dominated by Lichida and Phacopida (including the well-known Calymenina). However, a number of characteristic forms do not extend far into the Devonian and almost all the remainder were wiped out by a series of drastic Middle and Late Devonian extinctions. Three orders and all but five families were exterminated by the combination of sea level changes and a break in the redox equilibrium (a meteorite impact has also been suggested as a cause). Only a single order, the Proetida, survived into the Carboniferous.
Some of the important groups of trilobites during the Silurian and Devonian periods include:

====Carboniferous and Permian====

The Proetida survived for millions of years, continued through the Carboniferous period and lasted until the end of the Permian (when the vast majority of species on Earth were wiped out). It is unknown why order Proetida alone survived the Devonian. The Proetida maintained relatively diverse faunas in deep water and shallow water, shelf environments throughout the Carboniferous. For many millions of years the Proetida existed untroubled in their ecological niche. An analogy would be today's crinoids, which mostly exist as deep water species; in the Paleozoic era, vast 'forests' of crinoids lived in shallow near-shore environments.
Some of the important groups of trilobites during the Carboniferous and Permian periods include:

====Final extinction====

Exactly why the trilobites became extinct is not clear; with repeated extinction events (often followed by apparent recovery) throughout the trilobite fossil record, a combination of causes is likely. After the extinction event at the end of the Devonian period, what trilobite diversity remained was bottlenecked into the order Proetida. Decreasing diversity[ref]

With so many marine species involved in the Permian extinction, the end of nearly 300 million successful years for the trilobite is hardly surprising.
The closest extant relatives of trilobites may be the horseshoe crabs, or the cephalocarids.[tpl]citation|first=David|last=Lambert|publisher=the Diagram Group|title=The Field Guide to Prehistoric Life|publication-place=New York|series=Facts on File Publications|year=1985|isbn=0-8160-1125-7[/tpl]

==Fossil distribution==

Trilobites appear to have been exclusively marine organisms, since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods, crinoids, and corals. Within the marine paleoenvironment, trilobites were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. Trilobites, like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected. The remnants of trilobites can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which it sheds in the process known as ecdysis. In addition, the tracks left behind by trilobites living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils.
There are three main forms of trace fossils associated with trilobites: Rusophycus; Cruziana & Diplichnites – such trace fossils represent the preserved life activity of trilobites active upon the sea floor. Rusophycus, the resting trace, are trilobite excavations involving little or no forward movement and ethological interpretations suggest resting, protection and hunting.[tpl]citation | last=Baldwin | first=C.

Trilobite fossils are found worldwide, with many thousands of known species. Because they appeared quickly in geological time, and moulted like other arthropods, trilobites serve as excellent index fossils, enabling geologists to date the age of the rocks in which they are found. They were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention, and new species are being discovered every year.
A famous location for trilobite fossils in the United Kingdom is Wren's Nest, Dudley in the West Midlands, where Calymene blumenbachi is found in the Silurian Wenlock Group. This trilobite is featured on the town's coat of arms and was named the Dudley Bug or Dudley Locust by quarrymen who once worked the now abandoned limestone quarries. Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, is another famous trilobite location. The well-known  Elrathia kingi trilobite is found in abundance in the Cambrian age Wheeler Shale of Utah.[tpl]Citation |journal=Geology |title=Paleoecology of the familiar trilobite Elrathia kingii: an early exaerobic zone inhabitant |author1=Robert R.

Spectacularly preserved trilobite fossils, often showing soft body parts (legs, gills, antennae, etc.) have been found in British Columbia, Canada (the Cambrian Burgess Shale and similar localities); New York State, U.S.A. (Ordovician Walcott-Rust quarry, near Russia, and Beecher's Trilobite Bed, near Rome); China (Lower Cambrian Maotianshan Shales near Chengjiang); Germany (the Devonian Hunsrück Slates near Bundenbach) and, much more rarely, in trilobite-bearing strata in Utah (Wheeler Shale and other formations), Ontario, and Manuels River, Newfoundland and Labrador.
The French palaeontologist Joachim Barrande (1799–1883) carried out his landmark study of trilobites in the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian of Bohemia, publishing the first volume of Système silurien du centre de la Bohême in 1852.

==Phylogeny==

Despite their rich fossil record with thousands of described genera found throughout the world, the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites have many uncertainties.[tpl]citation|last=Fortey|first=R.

Most scientists believe that order Redlichiida, more specifically its suborder Redlichiina, contains a common ancestor of all other orders, with the possible exception of the Agnostina. While many potential phylogenies are found in the literature, most have suborder Redlichiina giving rise to orders Corynexochida and Ptychopariida during the Lower Cambrian, and the Lichida descending from either the Redlichiida or Corynexochida in the Middle Cambrian. Order Ptychopariida is the most problematic order for trilobite classification. In the 1959 Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology,[tpl]Citation |editor-last=Moore |editor-first=R.

==Relationship to other taxa==

Once soft-part anatomy had been recovered, the trilobites were originally allied to the Crustacea; however, this suggestion has since fallen out of favour. A relationship with the Chelicerata, in a clade termed Arachnomorpha (Arachnata), was in vogue for some time; a position in the Mandibulata (=Myriapoda + Crustacea + Hexapoda) stem-group may be a more parsimonious alternative.[tpl]Citation | first1 = Gerhard | last1 = Scholtz | first2 = Gregory D. | last2 = Edgecombe |year=2005 |chapter=Heads, Hox and the phylogenetic position of trilobites |pages=139–165 |title=Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0-8493-3498-5 |editor=Stefan Koenemann & Ronald A. Jenner |id = [tpl]citeseerx|10.1.1.130.2585[/tpl] | series=Volume 16 of Crustacean issues[/tpl]

==Morphology==

When trilobites are found, only the exoskeleton is preserved (often in an incomplete state) in all but a handful of locations. A few locations ([tpl]lang|de|Lagerstätten[/tpl]) preserve identifiable soft body parts (legs, gills, musculature & digestive tract) and enigmatic traces of other structures (e.g. fine details of eye structure) as well as the exoskeleton.
Trilobites range in length from [tpl]convert|1|mm|2[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|72|cm[/tpl], with a typical size range of [tpl]convert|3|-|10|cm|abbr=on[/tpl]. The world's largest trilobite, Isotelus rex, was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of Hudson Bay.[tpl]citation|last1=Rudkin|first1=D.A.|last2=Young|first2=G. A.|last3=Elias|first3=R. J.|last4=Dobrzanske|first4=E. P.|year=2003|title=The world's biggest trilobite: Isotelus rex new species from the Upper Ordovician of northern Manitoba, Canada |journal=Palaeontology |volume=70 |issue=1 | pages=99–112 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1666%2F0022-3360(2003)077%3C0099%3ATWBTIR%3E2.0.CO%3B2&ct=1 |doi=10.1666/0022-3360(2003)0772.0.CO;2[/tpl]
The exoskeleton is composed of calcite and calcium phosphate minerals in a protein lattice of chitin that covers the upper surface (dorsal) of the trilobite and curled round the lower edge to produce a small fringe called the "doublure". Three distinctive tagmata (sections) are present: cephalon (head); thorax (body) and pygidium (tail).

===Terminology===

As might be expected for a group of animals comprising [tpl]circa|5,000[/tpl] genera, the morphology and description of trilobites can be complex. However, despite morphological complexity and an unclear position within higher classifications, there are a number of characteristics that distinguish the trilobites from other arthropods: a generally sub-elliptical, dorsal, chitinous exoskeleton divided longitudinally into three distinct lobes (from which the group gets its name); having a distinct, relatively large head shield (cephalon) articulating axially with a thorax comprising articulated transverse segments, the hindmost of which are almost invariably fused to form a tail shield (pygidium). When describing differences between trilobite taxa, the presence, size, and shape of the cephalic features are often mentioned.
During moulting, the exoskeleton generally split between the head and thorax, which is why so many trilobite fossils are missing one or the other. In most groups facial sutures on the cephalon helped facilitate moulting. Similar to lobsters and crabs, trilobites would have physically "grown" between the moult stage and the hardening of the new exoskeleton.

===Cephalon===

A trilobite's cephalon, or head section, is highly variable with a lot of morphological complexity. The glabella forms a dome underneath which sat the "crop" or "stomach". Generally the exoskeleton has few distinguishing ventral features, but the cephalon often preserves muscle attachment scars and occasionally the hypostome, a small rigid plate comparable to the ventral plate in other arthropods. A toothless mouth and stomach sat upon the hypostome with the mouth facing backwards at the rear edge of the hypostome.
Hypostome morphology is highly variable; sometimes supported by an un-mineralised membrane (natant), sometimes fused onto the anterior doublure with an outline very similar to the glabella above (conterminant) or fused to the anterior doublure with an outline significantly different from the glabella (impendent). Many variations in shape and placement of the hypostome have been described. The size of the glabella and the lateral fringe of the cephalon, together with hypostome variation, have been linked to different lifestyles, diets and specific ecological niches.Fortey, 2004
The anterior and lateral fringe of the cephalon is greatly enlarged in the Harpetida, in other species a bulge in the pre-glabellar area is preserved that suggests a brood pouch. Highly complex compound eyes are another obvious feature of the cephalon.

====Facial sutures====

Facial or Cephalic sutures are the natural fracture lines in the cephalon of trilobites. Their function was to assist the trilobite in shedding its old exoskeleton during ecdysis (or molting).[tpl]Citation|author=Riccardo Levi-Setti|title =Trilobites|publisher =University of Chicago Press|year =1995|isbn =978-0-226-47452-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rRyHMz-FkJUC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl]
All species assigned to the suborder Olenellina, that went extinct at the very end of the Early Cambrian (like Fallotaspis, Nevadia, Judomia, and Olenellus) lacked facial sutures. They are believed to have never developed facial sutures, having pre-dated their evolution. Because of this (along with other primitive characteristics), they are thought to be the earliest ancestors of later trilobites.[tpl]Citation |last=B. S. |first=Lieberman |title=Phylogenetic analysis of some basal early Cambrian trilobites, the biogeographic origins of the eutrilobita, and the timing of the Cambrian radiation |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=76 |edition=4 |pages=692–708 |year=2002 |doi=10.1666/0022-3360(2002)0762.0.CO;2 |issue=4[/tpl]
Some other later trilobites also lost facial sutures secondarily.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peripatus.gen.nz/taxa/arthropoda/trilobita/TriOri.html|title=Trilobite Origins|author=Chris Clowes|date=April 15, 2006|publisher=Peripatus|accessdate=April 13, 2011[/tpl] The type of sutures found in different species are used extensively in the taxonomy and phylogeny of trilobites.

=====Dorsal sutures=====

The dorsal surface of the trilobite cephalon (the frontmost tagma, or the 'head') can be divided into two regions - the cranidium and the librigena ("free cheeks"). The cranidium can be further divided into the glabella (the central lobe in the cephalon) and the fixigena ("fixed cheeks").[tpl]Citation|author=Rhona M. Black|title =The elements of palaeontology|publisher =Cambridge University Press|edition=2|year =1988|pages= 151–152|isbn =978-0-521-34836-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cEh5Yn0neiUC&printsec=frontcover[/tpl] The facial sutures lie along the anterior edge, at the division between the cranidium and the librigena.
Trilobite facial sutures on the dorsal side can be roughly divided into five main types according to where the sutures end relative to the genal angle (the edges where the side and rear margins of the cephalon converge).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trilobita.de/english/molting.htm|title=Change of suit|author=Michael Kipping|publisher=www.trilobita.de|accessdate=April 13, 2011[/tpl]
The primitive state of the dorsal sutures is proparian. Opisthoparian sutures have developed several times independently. There are no examples of proparian sutures developing in taxa with opisthoparian ancestry. Trilobites that exhibit opisthoparian sutures as adults commonly have proparian sutures as instars (known exceptions being Yunnanocephalus and Duyunaspis).[tpl]cite journal|last1= Dai|first1= T.|last2= Zhang|first2= X.|year= 2008|title= Ontogeny of the trilobite Yunnanocephalus yunnanensis from the Chengjiang lagerstätte, lower Cambrian, southwest China|journal= Alcheringa|volume= 32|pages= 465–468|issn= 0311-5518|doi=10.1080/03115510802418057[/tpl] Hypoparian sutures have also arisen independently in several groups of trilobites.
There are also two types of sutures in the dorsal surface connected to the compound eyes of trilobites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trilobites.info/sutures.htm|title=Trilobite Facial Sutures|author=Samuel M. Gon III|date=February 3, 2009|publisher=A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites|accessdate=April 13, 2011[/tpl] They are:

=====Ventral sutures=====

Dorsal facial sutures continue downward to the ventral side of the cephalon where they become the Connective sutures that divide the doublure. The following are the types of ventral sutures.[tpl]Citation|author=Euan Neilson Kerr Clarkson|title =Invertebrate palaeontology and evolution|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell|year =1998|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g1P2VaPQWfUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn =978-0-632-05238-7[/tpl]

====Rostrum====

The rostrum (or the rostral plate) is a distinct part of the doublure located at the front of the cephalon. It is separated from the rest of the doublure by the rostral suture.
During molting in trilobites like Paradoxides, the rostrum is used to anchor the front part of the trilobite as the cranidium separates from the librigena. The opening created by the arching of the body provides an exit for the molting trilobite.
It is absent in some trilobites like Lachnostoma.

====Hypostome====

thumb|right|Asaphus expansus ventral side prepared, showing the attachment of the hypostomeThe hypostome is the hard mouthpart of the trilobite found on the ventral side of the cephalon typically below the glabella. The hypostome can be classified into three types based on whether they are permanently attached to the rostrum or not and whether they are aligned to the anterior dorsal tip of the glabella.
Below is an illustration of the three types. The doublure is shown in light gray, the inside surface of the cephalon in dark gray, and the hypostome in light blue. The glabella is outlined in red broken lines.

===Thorax===

The thorax is a series of articulated segments that lie between the cephalon and pygidium. The number of segments varies between 2 and 103[tpl]cite journal|last1=Paterson|first1=J.R.|last2=Edgecombe|first2=G.D.|year=2006|title=The Early Cambrian trilobite Family Emuellidae Popock, 1970: Systematic position and revision of Australian Species|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=85|pages=496–513|url= [/tpl] with most species in the 2 to 16 range.[tpl]Citation |last=Whittington |first=H.

Each segment consists of the central axial ring and the outer pleurae, which protected the limbs and gills. The pleurae are sometimes abbreviated or extended to form long spines. Apodemes are bulbous projections on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton to which most leg muscles attached, although some leg muscles attached directly to the exoskeleton.[tpl]Citation |last1=Bruton |first1=D.

Trilobite fossils are often found "enrolled" (curled up) like modern pill bugs for protection; evidence suggests enrollment helped protect against the inherent weakness of the arthropod cuticle that was exploited by anomalocarid predators.[tpl]citation |author=Nedin, C. |year=1999 |title=Anomalocaris predation on nonmineralized and mineralized trilobites |journal=Geology |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=987–990 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1999)0272.3.CO;2 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/11/987 |bibcode=1999Geo....27..987N[/tpl]
Some trilobites achieved a fully closed capsule (e.g. Phacops), while others with long pleural spines (e.g. Selenopeltis) left a gap at the sides or those with a small pygidium (e.g. Paradoxides) left a gap between the cephalon and pygidium. In Phacops, the pleurae overlap a smooth bevel (facet) allowing a close seal with the doublure. The doublure carries a Panderian notch or protuberance on each segment to prevent over rotation and achieve a good seal. Even in an agnostid, with only 2 articulating thoracic segments, the process of enrollment required a complex musculature to contract the exoskeleton and return to the flat condition.[tpl]citation |last1=Bruton |first1=D. L. |last2=Nakrem |first2=H. A. |year=2005 |title=Enrollment in a Middle Ordovician agnostoid trilobite |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=50| edition=3 |pages=441–448 |url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-441.pdf| accessdate=June 22, 2009[/tpl]

===Pygidium===

The pygidium is formed from a number of segments and the telson fused together. Segments in the pygidium are similar to the thoracic segments (bearing biramous limbs) but are not articulated. Trilobites can be described based on the pygidium being micropygous (pygidium smaller than cephalon), subisopygous (pygidium sub equal to cephalon), isopygous (pygidium equal in size to cephalon), or macropygous (pygidium larger than cephalon).

===Prosopon (surface sculpture)===

Trilobite exoskeletons show a variety of small-scale structures collectively called prosopon. Prosopon does not include large scale extensions of the cuticle (e.g. hollow pleural spines) but to finer scale features, such as ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging and perforations. The exact purpose of the prosopon is not resolved but suggestions include structural strengthening, sensory pits or hairs, preventing predator attacks and maintaining aeration while enrolled. In one example, alimentary ridge networks (easily visible in Cambrian trilobites) might have been either digestive or respiratory tubes in the cephalon and other regions.[tpl]Citation | last=Clarkson | first=E. N. K. |author-link=Euan Clarkson| year=1998 | title=Invertebrate Paleontology and Evolution | edition=4th | publisher=Wiley/Blackwell Science | publication-place=Oxford | isbn=0-632-05238-4 | page=452 | url=http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=g1P2VaPQWfUC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1[/tpl]

===Spines===

Some trilobites such as those of the order Lichida evolved elaborate spiny forms, from the Ordovician until the end of the Devonian period. Examples of these specimens have been found in the Hamar Laghdad Formation of Alnif in Morocco. There is, however, a serious counterfeiting and fakery problem with much of the Moroccan material that is offered commercially. Spectacular spined trilobites have also been found in western Russia; Oklahoma, USA; and Ontario, Canada.
Some trilobites had horns on their heads similar to those of modern beetles. Based on the size, location, and shape of the horns the most likely use of the horns was combat for mates, making the Asaphida family Raphiophoridae the earliest exemplars of this behavior.[tpl]citation |last1=Knell |first1=R. J. |last2=Fortey |first2=R. A. |year=2005 |title=Trilobite spines and beetle horns: sexual selection in the Palaeozoic? |journal=Biology Letters |volume=1 |pages=196–199 |pmc=1626209 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0304 |pmid=17148165 |issue=2[/tpl]
Another use for these spines was protection from predators. When enrolled, trilobite spines offered additional protection.
This conclusion is likely to be applicable to other trilobites as well, such as in the Phacopid trilobite genus Walliserops, that developed spectacular tridents.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg18625015.100/|title=Earliest combatants in sexual contests revealed|author=New Scientist magazine|authorlink=New Scientist|year=2005|publication-date=May 28, 2005[/tpl]

==Soft body parts==

Only 21 or so species are described from which soft body parts are preserved, so some features (e.g. the posterior antenniform cerci preserved only in Olenoides serratus)[tpl]citation |last1=Whittington |first1=H. B. |author-link=Harry B. Whittington |year=1980 |title=Exoskeleton, moult stage, appendage morphology, and habits of the Middle Cambrian trilobite Olenoides serratus |journal=Palaeontology |volume=23 |pages=171–204[/tpl] remain difficult to assess in the wider picture.

===Appendages===

Trilobites had a single pair of preoral antennae and otherwise undifferentiated biramous limbs (2, 3 or 4 cephalic pairs, followed by one pair per thoracic segment and some pygidium pairs).[tpl]citation |last1=Hughes |first1=Nigel |year=2003 |title=Trilobite tagmosis and body patterning from morphological and developmental perspectives |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=43|edition=1 |pages=185–205 | doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.185 | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/43/1/185 |issue=1[/tpl] Each endopodite(walking leg) had 6 or 7 segments, homologous to other early arthropods. Endopodites are attached to the coxa, which also bore a feather-like exopodite, or gill branch, which was used for respiration and, in some species, swimming. The inside of the coxa (or gnathobase) carries spins, probably to process prey items.[tpl]citation |last1=Ramskold |first1=L. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=G. D. |year=1996 |title=Trilobite appendage structure – Eoredlichia reconsidered |journal=Alcheringa|volume=20 |pages=269–276 |doi=10.1080/03115519608619471 |issue=4[/tpl] The last exopodite segment usually had claws or spines. Many examples of hairs on the legs suggest adaptations for feeding (as for the gnathobases) or sensory organs to help with walking.[tpl]Citation |last=Whittington |first=H. B. |author-link=Harry B.

===Digestive tract===

The toothless mouth of trilobites was situated on the rear edge of the hypostome (facing backwards), in front of the legs attached to the cephalon. The mouth is linked by a small esophagus to the stomach that lay forward of the mouth, below the glabella. The "intestine" led backwards from there to the pygidium. The "feeding limbs" attached to the cephalon are thought to have fed food into the mouth, possibly "slicing" the food on the hypostome and/or gnathobases first. Alternative lifestyles are suggested, with the cephalic legs used to disturb the sediment to make food available. A large glabella, (implying a large stomach), coupled with an impendent hypostome has been used as evidence of more complex food sources, i.e. possibly a carnivorous lifestyle.

===Internal organs===

While there is direct and implied evidence for the presence and location of the mouth, stomach and digestive tract (see above) the presence of heart, brain and liver are only implied (although "present" in many reconstructions) with little direct geological evidence.

===Musculature===

Although rarely preserved, long lateral muscles extended from the cephalon to mid way down the pygidium, attaching to the axial rings allowing enrollment while separate muscles on the legs tucked them out of the way.

==Sensory organs==

Many trilobites had complex eyes; they also had a pair of antennae. Some trilobites were blind, probably living too deep in the sea for light to reach them. As such, they became secondarily blind in this branch of trilobite evolution. Other trilobites (e.g. Phacops rana and Erbenochile erbeni) had large eyes that were for use in more well lit, predator-filled waters.

===Antennae===

The pair of antennae suspected in most trilobites (and preserved in a few examples) were highly flexible to allow them to be retracted when the trilobite was enrolled. Also, one species (Olenoides serratus) preserves antennae-like cerci that project from the rear of the trilobite.

===Eyes===

Even the earliest trilobites had complex, compound eyes with lenses made of calcite (a characteristic of all trilobite eyes), confirming that the eyes of arthropods and probably other animals could have developed before the Cambrian.[tpl]Citation | author=McCall, G.

Trilobite eyes were typically compound, with each lens being an elongated prism. The number of lenses in such an eye varied: some trilobites had only one, while some had thousands of lenses in a single eye. In compound eyes, the lenses were typically arranged hexagonally. The fossil record of trilobite eyes is complete enough that their evolution can be studied through time, which compensates to some extent the lack of preservation of soft internal parts.
Lenses of trilobites' eyes were made of calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO3). Pure forms of calcite are transparent, and some trilobites used crystallographically oriented, clear calcite crystals to form each lens of each of their eyes.[tpl]Citation | last=Clarkson | first=E.

In other trilobites, with a Huygens interface apparently missing, a gradient index lens is invoked with the refractive index of the lens changing towards the center.[tpl]Citation | last1=Bruton | first1=D.

Secondary blindness is not uncommon, particularly in long lived groups such as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida and Phacopina from western Europe and particularly Tropidocoryphinae from France (where there is good stratigraphic control), there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness.
Several other structures on trilobites have been explained as photo-receptors. Of particular interest are "macula", the small areas of thinned cuticle on the underside of the hypostome. In some trilobites macula are suggested to function as simple "ventral eyes" that could have detected night and day or allowed a trilobite to navigate while swimming (or turned) upside down.

===Sensory pits===

There are several types of prosopon that have been suggested as sensory apparatus collecting chemical or vibrational signals. The connection between large pitted fringes on the cephalon of Harpetida and Trinucleoidea with corresponding small or absent eyes makes for an interesting possibility of the fringe as a "compound ear".

==Development==

Trilobites grew through successive moult stages called instars, in which existing segments increased in size and new trunk segments appeared at a sub-terminal generative zone during the anamorphic phase of development. This was followed by the epimorphic developmental phase, in which the animal continued to grow and moult, but no new trunk segments were expressed in the exoskeleton. The combination of anamorphic and epimorphic growth constitutes the hemianamorphic developmental mode that is common among many living arthropods.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.trilobites.info/ontogeny.htm |title=Trilobite Development |author=Sam Gon III[/tpl]
Trilobite development was unusual in the way in which articulations developed between segments, and changes in the development of articulation gave rise to the conventionally recognized developmental phases of the trilobite life cycle (divided into 3 stages), which are not readily compared with those of other arthropods. Actual growth and change in external form of the trilobite would have occurred when the trilobite was soft shelled, following moulting and before the next exoskeleton hardened.

Despite the absence of supporting fossil evidence, their similarity to living arthropods has led to the belief that trilobites multiplied sexually and produced eggs.[tpl]citation |last1=Zhang |first1=X. |last2=Pratt |first2=B. |year=1994 |title=Middle Cambrian arthropod embryos with blastomeres |journal=Science |volume=266 |pmid=17793458 |issue=5185 |pages=637–9 |url=|doi=10.1126/science.266.5185.637|bibcode = 1994Sci...266..637Z [/tpl]
Some species may have kept eggs or larvae in a brood pouch forward of the glabella,[tpl]Citation |last1=Fortey |first1=R. A. |last2=Hughs |first2=N. C. |year=1998 |title=Brood pouches in trilobites |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=72 |pages=639–649 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3790/is_199807/ai_n8785182 |postscript=.[/tpl] particularly when the ecological niche was challenging to larvae. Size and morphology of the first calcified stage are highly variable between (but not within) trilobite taxa, suggesting some trilobites passed through more growth within the egg than others. Early developmental stages prior to calcification of the exoskeleton are a possibility (suggested for fallotaspids), but so is calcification and hatching coinciding.
The earliest post-embryonic trilobite growth stage known with certainty are the "protaspid" stages (anamorphic phase). Starting with an indistinguishable proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (anaprotaspid) a number of changes occur ending with a transverse furrow separating the proto-cephalon and proto-pygidium (metaprotaspid) that can continue to add segments. Segments are added at the posterior part of the pygidium but, all segments remain fused together.
The "meraspid" stages (anamorphic phase) are marked by the appearance of an articulation between the head and the fused trunk. Prior to the onset of the first meraspid stage the animal had a two-part structure — the head and the plate of fused trunk segments, the pygidium. During the meraspid stages, new segments appeared near the rear of the pygidium as well as additional articulations developing at the front of the pygidium, releasing freely articulating segments into the thorax. Segments are generally added one per moult (although two per moult and one every alternate moult are also recorded), with number of stages equal to the number of thoracic segments. A substantial amount of growth, from less than 25% up to 30%–40%, probably took place in the meraspid stages.
The "holaspid" stages (epimorphic phase) commence when a stable, mature number of segments has been released into the thorax. Moulting continued during the holaspid stages, with no changes in thoracic segment number. Some trilobites are suggested to have continued moulting and growing throughout the life of the individual, albeit at a slower rate on reaching maturity.
Some trilobites showed a marked transition in morphology at one particular instar, which has been called "trilobite metamorphosis". Radical change in morphology is linked to the loss or gain of distinctive features that mark a change in mode of life.[tpl]Citation | last1=Chatterton | first1=B. D. E. | last2=Speyer | first2=S. E. | title=Larval ecology, life history strategies, and patterns of extinction and survivorship among Ordovician trilobites | pages=118–132 | year=1989 | journal=Paleobiology | volume=15 [/tpl] A change in lifestyle during development has significance in terms of evolutionary pressure, as the trilobite could pass through several ecological niches on the way to adult development and changes would strongly affect survivorship and dispersal of trilobite taxa. It is worth noting that trilobites with all protaspid stages solely planktonic
and later meraspid stages benthic (e.g. asaphids) failed to last through the Ordovician extinctions, while trilobites that were planktonic for only the first protaspid stage before metamorphosing into benthic forms survived (e.g. lichids, phacopids). Pelagic larval life-style proved ill-adapted to the rapid onset of global climatic cooling and loss of tropical shelf habitats during the Ordovician.

The discovery of Calymene blumenbachi (the Dudley locust) in 1749 by Charles Lyttleton, could be identified as the beginning of trilobite research. Lyttleton submitted a letter to the Royal Society of London in 1750 concerning a “petrified insect” he found in the “limestone pits at Dudley”. In 1754, Manuel Mendez da Costa proclaimed that the Dudley locust was not an insect, but instead belonged to “the crustaceous tribe of animals.” He proposed to call the Dudley specimens Pediculus marinus major trilobos (large trilobed marine louse), a name which lasted well into the 1800s. German naturalist Johann Walch, who executed the first inclusive study of this group, proposed the use of the name “trilobite”. He considered it appropriate to derive the name from the unique three-lobed character of the central axis and a pleural zone to each side.[tpl]cite web|author=Alex J.

Written descriptions of trilobites date possibly from the third century BC and definitely from the fourth century AD. The Spanish geologists Eladio Liñán and Rodolfo Gozalo argue that some of the fossils described in Greek and Latin lapidaries as scorpion stone, beetle stone, and ant stone, refer to trilobite fossils. Less ambiguous references to trilobite fossils can be found in Chinese sources. Fossils from the Kushan formation of northeastern China were prized as inkstones and decorative pieces.
In the New World, American fossil hunters found plentiful deposits of Elrathia kingi in western Utah in the 1860s. Until the early 1900s, the Ute Native Americans of Utah wore these trilobites, which they called pachavee (little water bug), as amulets. A hole was bored in the head and the fossil was worn on a string.[tpl]Citation |author=Joleen Robinson |title=Tracking the Trilobites |journal=Desert magazine |date=October 1970[/tpl] According to the Ute themselves, trilobite necklaces protect against disease and bullets. In 1931, Frank Beckwith uncovered evidence of the Ute use of trilobites. Travelling through the badlands, he photographed two petroglyphs that most likely represent trilobites. On the same trip he examined a burial, of unknown age, with a drilled trilobite fossil lying in the chest cavity of the interred. Since then, trilobite amulets have been found all over the Great Basin, as well as in British Columbia and Australia. 
In the 1880s, archaeologists discovered a much handled trilobite fossil that had been drilled as if to be worn as a pendant, in the Grotte du Trilobite near Yonne, France. The occupation stratum, in which the trilobite was found, has been dated as fifteen thousand years old. Because the pendant was handled so much, the species of trilobite cannot be determined. This type of trilobite is not found around Yonne, so it may have been highly prized and traded from elsewhere.
