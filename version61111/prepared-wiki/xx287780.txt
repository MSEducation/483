==Mission==

Attitudes towards gay and lesbian believers in mainstream congregations varies;  while some seek to be welcoming,  the official Eastern Orthodox view is that active same-sexual relationships are sinful. In contrast, Axios believes that members' "sexuality and love are God given and healthy."
Axios states that the organization was created:
Meetings of Axios begin with an Orthodox Vespers service.
The group is officially condemned by the Eastern Orthodox Church.
