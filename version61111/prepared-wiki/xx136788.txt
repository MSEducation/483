[[Dogs (Nina Nastasia album)]]

CATEGORIES: 2000 albums, Albums produced by Steve Albini, Nina Nastasia albums

Dogs is the first album by American singer-songwriter Nina Nastasia. It was originally released in 2000 by Socialist Records and re-released in 2004 by Touch and Go Records.
John Peel has described the album as "astonishing".

Engineer Steve Albini has described it as one of the albums he is the most proud of, as well as one of his personal favorites:   "In the process of making a record, you hear it so many times that the charms of even the best of them can wear off through over-exposure. On rare occasions, records I've worked on have withstood this scrutiny and ended up being personal favorites. Nina Nastasia's 'Dogs' is a record so simultaneously unassuming and grandiose that I can't really describe it, except in terms that would make it (and me) sound silly. Of the couple thousand records I've been involved with, this is one of my favourites, and one that I'm proud to be associated with."
