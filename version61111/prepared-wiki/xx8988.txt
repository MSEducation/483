Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ([tpl]lang-ps| خیبر پښتونخوا[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ps|pəxtunˈxwɑ|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ur|[tpl]Nastaliq|خیبر پختونخوا [/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]IPA-ur|ˈpəxˈtuːnxwaː|[/tpl]),  (KPK) formerly called North-West Frontier Province and several other names, is one of the four provinces of Pakistan, located in the north-west of the country. It borders the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the west and south, Gilgit–Baltistan to the north-east, Azad Kashmir to the east, Punjab and the Islamabad Capital Territory to the south-east, and Afghanistan to the north-west. The province of Balochistan is located southwards. The provincial capital and largest city is Peshawar.

==History==

Before independence, the North-West Frontier Province voted to join Pakistan in a referendum on July 2, 1947; 50.1% of the registered voters(only 15% less than that in 1946 elections)http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/history/PDF-FILES/chawala.pdf exercised their vote and majority (99.02%) of them voted for Pakistan.http://prr.hec.gov.pk/Chapters/1159S-3.pdf There was no option in the polls to vote to become a sovereign state independent of India and Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|last=Harrison|first=Selig S.|title=Pakistan: The State of the Union |url=http://www.ciponline.org/images/uploads/publications/pakistan_the_state_of_the_union.pdf |publisher=Center for International Policy|accessdate=24 January 2014 |page=13-14[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Singh|first=Vipul|title=The Pearson Indian History Manual for the UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination|year=2008|publisher=Pearson|page=65|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wsiXwh_tIGkC&q=north-west+frontier+province+referendum#v=snippet[/tpl] Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the polls with other nationalistic or pro-India Pashtuns.

Afghanistan claims Pashtun-dominated western areas of the territory as its own. After Pakistan's independence, Afghanistan was the only country to vote against Pakistan’s accession to the United Nations because of Kabul’s claim on the Pashtun territories on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/cp72_grare_final.pdf |title=PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN RELATIONS IN THE POST-9/11 ERA, October 2006, Frédéric Grare |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20[/tpl] The population of this region as per the 1901 Census of the North West Frontier Province was 2,125,480, out of which Muslims were 1,957,777, Hindus were 134,252 and Sikhs were 28,091.Census of India 1901 Vol 17, The Punjab, its feudatories and the North-west Frontier Province Part 2, Table XIII Caste, Tribe, Race and Nationality Part 1B Showing the distribution of the Castes in the North West Frontier Province

===Partition and Afghan War===

Afghanistan's loya jirga of 1949 declared the Durand Line invalid, which led to border tensions with Pakistan. Afghanistan's governments have periodically refused to recognize Pakistan's inheritance of British treaties regarding the region.http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/cp72_grare_final.pdf During the 1950s, Afghanistan supported the Pushtunistan Movement, a secessionist movement that failed to gain substantial support amongst the tribes of the North-West Frontier Province. Afghanistan's refusal to recognize the Durrand Line and its subsequent support for the Pashtunistan Movement has been cited as the main cause of tensions between the two countries that have existed since Pakistan's independence.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] After Ayub Khan eliminated Pakistan's provinces, Yahya Khan, in 1969, abolished this "one unit" scheme and added Amb, Swat, Dir, Chitral and Kohistan to the new North-West Frontier Province as the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas.
During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979–1989) the North-West Frontier Province served as a major base for supplying the Mujahideen who fought the Soviets during the 1980s. Following the arrival of Soviet forces, over five million Afghan refugees poured into Pakistan, most residing in the North-West Frontier Province ([tpl]as of | 2007 | lc = on[/tpl], nearly 3 million remained). The province remained heavily influenced by events in Afghanistan. Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992) led to the rise of the Taliban, which had emerged in the border region between Afghanistan, Baluchistan, PATA and FATA as a formidable political force. 
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FATA and bordering North-West Frontier Province became a front-line region again, as part of the global "War on Terror". In 2010 the name of the province changed to "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa". Protests arose among the local ethnic Hazara population due to this name change, as they began to demand their own province. Seven people were killed and 100 injured in protests on 11 April 2011.[tpl]cite news |title=Anti-Pakhtunkhwa protest claims 7 lives in Abbottabad |first= |last= |url=http://www.thestatesmen.net/news/anti-pakhtunkhwa-protest-claims-seven-lives-in-abbottabad |newspaper=The Statesmen |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2011[/tpl]

==Geography==

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sits primarily on the Iranian plateau and comprises the junction where the slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains on the Eurasian plate give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching South Asia. This situation has led to seismic activity in the past.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/419493/Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/249136/Geography |title=Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (province, Pakistan) :: Geography – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-05-25[/tpl] The famous Khyber Pass links the province to Afghanistan, while the Kohalla Bridge in Circle Bakote Abbottabad is a major crossing point over the Jhelum River in the east.
The province has an area of 28,773 mi² or (74,521 km²).[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
The province's main districts are Peshawar, Mardan,SWABI Charsadda Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Kohistan, Kohat, Abbottabad, Haripur and Mansehra, Swat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir,  Chitral, Buner D, Bannu and Karak. Peshawar, Mardan, Kohat, Abbottabad, Dera Ismail Khan and Hangu are the main cities.
According to the 1998 census, the population of the province was approximately 17 million,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nwfpbos.sdnpk.org/nwfpds/2000/5.htm|title= District wise area and population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa[/tpl] of whom 52% are males and 48% are females. The density of population is 187 per km² and the intercensal change of population is of about 30%.
Geographically the province could be divided into two zones: the northern one extending from the ranges of the Hindu Kush to the borders of Peshawar basin and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin.
The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. It has moderate rainfall. The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scanty rainfall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2012/11/29/its-wintertime-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/ |title=It’s wintertime in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa | Newspaper |publisher=Dawn.Com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl]
The major rivers that criss-cross the province are the Kabul, Swat, Chitral, Kunar, Siran, Panjkora, Bara, Kurram, Dor, Haroo, Gomal and Zhob.
Its snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty have enormous potential for tourism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.paperpkads.com/news/index.php/cold-dry-weather-observed-in-upper-areas-of-country/ |title=Cold weather in upper areas & dry weather observed in almost all parts of the country | PaperPK News about Pakistan |publisher=Paperpkads.com |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl]

==Climate==

The climate of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa varies immensely for a region of its size, encompassing most of the many climate types found in Pakistan. The province stretching southwards from the Baroghil Pass in the Hindu Kush covers almost six degrees of latitude; it is mainly a mountainous region. Dera Ismail Khan is one of the hottest places in South Asia while in the mountains to the north the weather is temperate in the summer and intensely cold in the winter. The air is generally very dry; consequently, the daily and annual range of temperature is quite large.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V19_153.gif |title=North-West Frontier Province – Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 147 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-05-25[/tpl]
Rainfall also varies widely. Although large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are typically dry, the province also contains the wettest parts of Pakistan in its eastern fringe.

===Chitral District===

Chitral District lies completely sheltered from the monsoon that controls the weather in eastern Pakistan, owing to its relatively westerly location and the shielding effect of the Nanga Parbat massif. In many ways Chitral District has more in common regarding climate with Central Asia than South Asia.Mock, John and O'Neil, Kimberley; Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush; p. 15 ISBN 0-86442-360-8 The winters are generally cold even in the valleys, and heavy snow during the winter blocks passes and isolates the region. In the valleys, however, summers can be hotter than on the windward side of the mountains due to lower cloud cover: Chitral can reach [tpl]convert|40|C|F[/tpl] frequently during this period.Mock and O'Neil; Trekking in the Karakoram and Hindukush; pp. 18–19 However, the humidity is extremely low during these hot spells and, as a result the summer climate is less torrid than in the rest of the Indian subcontinent.
Most precipitation falls as thunderstorms or snow during winter and spring, so that the climate at the lowest elevations is classed as Mediterranean (Csa), continental Mediterranean (Dsa) or semi-arid (BSk). Summers are extremely dry in the north of Chitral district and receive only a little rain in the south around Drosh.
At elevations above [tpl]convert|5000|m|ft|-2[/tpl], as much as a third of the snow which feeds the large Karakoram and Hindukush glaciers comes from the monsoon since these elevations are too high to be shielded from its moisture.

===Central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa===

On the southern flanks of Nanga Parbat and in Upper and Lower Dir Districts, rainfall is much heavier than further north because moist winds from the Arabian Sea are able to penetrate the region. When they collide with the mountain slopes, winter depressions provide heavy precipitation. The monsoon, although short, is generally powerful. As a result, the southern slopes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are the wettest part of Pakistan. Annual rainfall ranges from around [tpl]convert|500|mm|in[/tpl] in the most sheltered areas to as much as [tpl]convert|1750|mm|in[/tpl] in parts of Abbottabad and Mansehra Districts.
This region’s climate is classed at lower elevations as humid subtropical (Cfa in the west; Cwa in the east); whilst at higher elevations with a southerly aspect it becomes classed as humid continental (Dfb). However, accurate data for altitudes above [tpl]convert|2000|m|ft|-1[/tpl] are practically nonexistent here, in Chitral, or in the south of the province.
The seasonality of rainfall in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shows very marked gradients from east to west. At Dir, March remains the wettest month due to frequent frontal cloud-bands, whereas in Hazara more than half the rainfall comes from the monsoon.See Wernsted, Frederick L.; World Climatic Data; published 1972 by Climatic Data Press; 522 pp. 31 cm. This creates a unique situation characterized by a bimodal rainfall regime, which extends into the southern part of the province described below.
Since cold air from the Siberian High loses its chilling capacity upon crossing the vast Karakoram and Himalaya ranges, winters in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are somewhat milder than in Chitral. Snow remains very frequent at high altitudes but rarely lasts long on the ground in the major towns and agricultural valleys. Outside of winter, temperatures in central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are not so hot as in Chitral. Significantly higher humidity when the monsoon is active means that heat discomfort can be greater. However, even during the most humid periods the high altitudes typically allow for some relief from the heat overnight.

===Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa===

As one moves further away from the foothills of the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges, the climate changes from the humid subtropical climate of the foothills to the typically arid climate of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab. As in central Pakhtunkhwa, the seasonality of precipitation shows a very sharp gradient from west to east, but the whole region very rarely receives significant monsoon rainfall. Even at high elevations annual rainfall is less than [tpl]convert|400|mm|in|0[/tpl] and in some places as little as [tpl]convert|200|mm|in|0[/tpl].
Temperatures in southern Pakhtunkhwa are extremely hot: Dera Ismail Khan in the southernmost district of the province is known as one of the hottest places in the world with temperatures known to have reached [tpl]convert|50|C|F[/tpl]. In the cooler months, nights can be cold and frosts remain frequent; snow is very rare, and daytime temperatures remain comfortably warm with abundant sunshine.

==Language==

Other languages include, Kashmiri, Shina, Romani, Burushaski, Wakhi, Balti, Balochi, Brahui, Sindhi and English (official and used in tourism).
Only Urdu and English are found as written languages in the city, with Pashto and Persian to a much smaller extent.The provincial language is Pashto, spoken by the majority as first language; Urdu, the national language, is widely spoken as a second language. English, the official language of Pakistan,  is mainly used for official and literary purposes. The provincial capital and largest city is Peshawar.
The main ethnic group in the province are the Pashtun people; other major ethnic groups include most notably the Hindkowans, Dards, Chitralis (who include the Kalasha) and Gujjars.

==Demographics==

The province has an estimated population of about 21 million. The largest ethnic group is the Pashtun, who historically have been living in the areas for centuries.People and culture – Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa[tpl]Dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl] Around 1.5 million Afghan refugees also remain in the province,[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/481856844.html |title=Pakistani TV delves into lives of Afghan refugees |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2010-05-25[/tpl] the majority of whom are Pashtuns followed by Tajiks, Hazaras, and other smaller groups. Despite having lived in the province for over two decades, they are registered as citizens of Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e487016 |title=UNHCR country operations profile – Pakistan |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|date= |accessdate=2012-12-12[/tpl]
In most rural areas of the centre and south, Pashtun tribes can be found including the Yusufzai, Bangash, Bhittani, Daavi, Khattak, Qazi khail also known as Qaziye Babar, Gandapur, Gharghasht, Marwat, Afridi, Shinwari, Orakzai, Mahsud, Mohmand,  Wazir and  Bannuchi as well as other tribes of Hazara division•, Swati, Kakar, Tareen, Jadoon, Tanoli,  Gujar, and Mashwani.
There are non-Pashtun tribes including Jat, Mughal, Turks, Karlal, Rajpoot, Dhund Abbasi, Syed, Awan, Kashmiri, Qureshi and Sarrara. The mountainous extreme north includes the Chitral and Kohistan districts that are home to diverse Dardic ethnic groups such as the Khowar, Kohistani, Shina, Torwali, Kalasha and Kalami.
However in the southernmost district such as Dera Ismail Khan live some of the Baloch tribe: Kori, Buzdar, Kanera, Leghari, Rind and some other sub tribes of Lashari tribe. These Baloch tribes speak Saraiki as their first language. In this southern district, most of its population speaks Saraiki.

Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, tobacco (in Swabi), rice, sugar beets, as well as fruits are grown in the province.
Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product. The bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.
Workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons. The province accounts for at least 78% of the marble production in Pakistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf |title=World Bank Pakistan Growth and Export Competitiveness|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-25[/tpl]

==Social issues==

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has the second-lowest Human Development Index out of all of Pakistan's provinces, at 0.607.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] Furthermore, it also continues to have an image problem.
The Awami National Party sought[tpl]When|date=March 2011[/tpl] to rename the province "Pakhtunkhwa", which translates to "Land of Pakhtuns" in the Pashto language. This was opposed by some of the non-Pashtuns, and especially by parties such as the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) and Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA). The PML-N derives its support in the province from primarily non-Pashtun Hazara regions.
In 2010 the announcement that the province would have a new name led to a wave of protests in the Hazara region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=99951&Itemid=2 |title=Protest in Hazara continues over renaming of NWFP to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa |publisher=App.com.pk |accessdate=2010-05-25[/tpl] On April 15, 2010 Pakistan's senate officially named the province "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" with 80 senators in favor and 12 opposed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/07-senate-begins-voting-on-18th-amendment-ha-02|title=NWFP officially renamed as Pakhtun HAZARA|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Dawn.com|accessdate=15 April 2010[/tpl] The MMA, who until the elections of 2008 had a majority in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, had proposed "Afghania" as a compromise name.[tpl]cite web|title=MMA govt proposes new name for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (then NWFP) |publisher=Dawn|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/08/01/top11.htm[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
