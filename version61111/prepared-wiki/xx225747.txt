Fernbank is a small country town on the Perry River in Victoria, Australia, approximately 310 km east of Melbourne. As of the 2001 census, the small town of Fernbank had a population of 630. With the main highway, Princes Highway close by, the small community not only services itself, but travellers along the main highway that stop for a break.

==History==

The origin of the town's name is somewhat of a mystery. It is commonly believed that the town was named after the plants that grow by the banks of the Perry River, the fern, giving rise to the name, Fern-bank.
Fernbank Post Office opened on 1 January 1868 and closed in 1977.[ref]
