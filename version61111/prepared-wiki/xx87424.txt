Miller appeared shocked by Uru Lives ultimate failure, as reflected in his letter to the Uru Live community,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyanworlds.com/letter.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070328203654/http://www.cyanworlds.com/letter.php |archivedate=2007-03-28 |title=Cyan Worlds, Inc |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2013-03-04[/tpl] which he wrote to explain why the game had to be shut down for an indefinite amount of time. In a previous interview, Miller had stated that finance from outside investment, not technology, was the reason for the failed project, "I think the biggest failure was running out of money, and thus running out of time, and thus losing control of our own destiny. No matter what promises are made or common goals are agreed upon, whoever pays the bills has the final say."
