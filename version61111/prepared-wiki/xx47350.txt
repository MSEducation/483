[[Miles per hour]]

CATEGORIES: Units of velocity, Imperial units, Customary units of measurement in the United States

Miles per hour (abbreviated mph or MPH) is an imperial and United States customary unit of speed expressing the number of statute miles covered in one hour. While kilometres per hour is more commonly used worldwide, miles per hour remains the standard unit used for speed limits in some countries, and to express speeds generally, in many countries throughout the world.

Miles per hour are also used in the Canadian rail system.[ref]

Road traffic speeds in other countries are quoted in kilometres per hour. Occasionally, however, both systems are used: for example, in Ireland, a judge considered a speeding case by examining speeds in both kilometres per hour and miles per hour. The judge was quoted as saying the speed seemed "very excessive" at 180 km/h but did not look "as bad" at 112 mph; a reduced fine was still imposed on the speeding driver.[ref]

Nautical and aeronautical applications, however, favour the knot as a common unit of speed: one knot is one nautical mile per hour.

1 Mph = 0.000277778 Mps (Miles Per Second)
Example: Apollo 11 attained speeds of 25,000 Mph, which converts to about 7 Mps. If Apollo 11 were to travel at 25,000 Mph from New York to Los Angeles it would reach Los Angeles in under 6 minutes.
