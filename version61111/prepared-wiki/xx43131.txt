Goodie Mob is a hip-hop group based in Atlanta, Georgia that formed in 1991 and currently consists of members Cee-Lo Green, Khujo, T-Mo, and Big Gipp.

==History==

The group's name acts as a double backronym. As explained on the track "Fighting" on Soul Food, Goodie Mob means "the GOOD DIE Mostly Over Bullshit".
All four members were born in Atlanta, and the group is based there with the rest of the Dungeon Family, a collective that includes OutKast and P.A. (Parental Advisory). Goodie was first heard featured on several songs from OutKast's first album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. 
All four members had a feature cameo in the 1999 film, "Mystery Men" as a criminal gang known as The Not-So-Goodie-Mob.
Cee-Lo was the most visible member of the group prior to his departure in 2000 (among other projects, he is now recording in collaboration with DJ Danger Mouse as Gnarls Barkley), while Big Gipp has made several rounds on other Dungeon Family members' albums, and T-Mo and Khujo form a duo within the group called The Lumberjacks.

==Albums==

===Soul Food (1995)===

Goodie Mob's debut in 1995 was the gold-certified album Soul Food, which was produced by Organized Noize and was critically acclaimed. The phrase "Dirty South", meaning Southern hip hop, was coined on this album, appearing as a song title. The album aired social and political issues such as racism, discrimination, geo-politics, and gentrification. Some songs were lighter in tone, such as "Soul Food," about the band's love of home cooked meals. Along with the album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik by Outkast, this one publicised Atlanta's rap scene.  It featured three Billboard Hot 100 singles called "Cell Therapy", "Soul Food", and "Dirty South", the former being the group's highest-charting hit to date when it reached #39.
In 1996, Goodie Mob appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD America is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Coolio, and Fat Joe, and other hip hop artists. The CD publicised the AIDS epidemic among African American men and was described as a masterpiece by The Source magazine.[tpl]fact|date=March 2013[/tpl]

===Still Standing (1998)===

The Mob's second album was Still Standing in 1998, on which they continued their tendency towards social commentary, and Cee-Lo's penchant for singing began to show through more. The album was also produced by Organized Noize, except for contributions by DJ Muggs (which would lead to Goodie Mob's contribution on Soul Assassins I) and Mr. DJ. During this period the group made a cameo appearance in the film Mystery Men as the "Not So Goodie Mob", with Cee-Lo crediting himself by his birth name, Thomas Callaway (though he refers to himself as "Carlito Green" in the liner notes). Still Standing was the group's second gold-selling effort. On the front and back covers, the letter "O" in "Mob" contained a silhouette of a hanged man in the center.

===World Party (1999)===

Goodie Mob was feeling pressure from the increasing popularity and sales of their fellow Dungeon Family group Outkast. Goodie Mob was signed to LaFace Records's parent label Arista Records for their third album. The record veered away from their gritty style that permeated their successful previous releases, instead incorporating lighter beats and party related subject matter, which many fans perceived as selling out in an attempt for mainstream popularity. The social tone which had pervaded their earlier releases was less present; one track on the album, "All A's," was criticized for reportedly containing homophobic lyrics; "Everytime son, rhymes too pretty'll get your mascara smeared. When they did, my buddy Spanky I bust out in tears. The world would be a better place to live, if there was less queers. I still see, punk ass bitches.. bitches.." During production, unhappy with the project's direction, Cee-Lo abruptly left to pursue a solo career. Arista dropped the group following poor sales of the album.

===One Monkey Don't Stop No Show (2004)===

The fourth album from Goodie, not featuring Cee-Lo, was something of a return to their earlier style.The song Play Your Flute closed the album with a laid back flute driven track Produced by J. Wells. Fans were unhappy with the lack of Cee-Lo's presence. Many thought the "monkey" referenced in the title and shown on the cover was a reference to their former groupmate, though the group claims it actually represents the music industry.

===Livin' Life as Lumberjacks (2005)===

One Monkey's poor reception led Big Gipp to briefly leave the group as well, and T-Mo and Khujo released an album under the name The Lumberjacks called Livin' Life as Lumberjacks. The Lumberjacks was actually the original name of the group before the addition of Big Gipp and Cee-Lo, who eventually joined to form Goodie Mob. This is mentioned in several of the cryptic lyrics of Goodie Mob's debut album Soul Food. The album somewhat continued the trend of incorporating deep social commentary within the lyrics of some songs. In addition the Lumberjacks also incorporated the crunk style that by then had pervaded Atlanta's music scene. Though Cee-Lo was still absent, Big Gipp appeared twice on the album to form the trio once again on the tracks Superfriends and 24/7/365.

==Reunion==

It was reported that all four Goodie Mob members were back on good terms and have re-entered the studio to release a brand-new album. Cee-Lo and Big Gipp both referenced this in multiple interviews. The four members appeared on stage together on October 1, 2006, following a Gnarls Barkley show, stating that they were back together and on good terms. They are working on an album. Goodie Mob officially announced the group's reunion November 19, 2007, on Atlanta's V-103 radio station.
