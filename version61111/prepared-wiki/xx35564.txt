==Mount Augustus==

Mount Augustus is an inselberg or monocline, not a monolith as often stated in tourist literature.
There is a caravan park at nearby Mount Augustus Station homestead, which also has "Donga" style accommodation and a restaurant which is open in peak tourist season.

==Geology==

Mount Augustus is composed of sandstone and conglomerate, a formation known to geologists as the Mount Augustus Sandstone, which overlies older granite near its northern end.Muhling P.C. & Brakel A.T. 1985. Geology of the Bangemall Group — The evolution of an intracratonic Proterozoic basin. Western Australia Geological Survey, Bulletin 128, 266 p. GSWA download search The Mount Augustus Sandstone was deposited by ancient river systems and is somewhat younger than the 1.64 billion year old granite beneath. The originally horizontal sediments have been folded into an asymmetric anticline by later tectonic movements.

==European history==

Francis Thomas Gregory reached the summit on 3 June 1858 during his 107-day journey through the Gascoyne region, becoming the first recorded European to climb the mountain. Some weeks later he named the peak after his brother, Sir Augustus Charles Gregory (1819–1905). At the time Augustus was on his last expedition, an unsuccessful foray into western Queensland in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of Ludwig Leichhardt.
