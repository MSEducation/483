Audenshaw is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, in Greater Manchester, England.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazza.htm |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer|publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office|accessdate=4 September 2009|postscript=|at=Places names - A|archivedate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718144214/http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazza.htm[/tpl] It is located on the east side of the River Tame, along the course of both the M60 motorway and the Ashton Canal, [tpl]convert|1.8|mi|km|1[/tpl] southwest of Ashton-under-Lyne and [tpl]convert|4.9|mi|km|1[/tpl] east of the city of Manchester. As at the United Kingdom Census 2001, Audenshaw had a population of 13,000.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-211152|title=Census 2001 Key Statistics - Urban area results by population size of urban area|work=ons.gov.uk|date=22 July 2004|accessdate=7 December 2008|publisher=Office for National Statistics|at=KS01 Usual resident population [tpl]XLSlink[/tpl][/tpl]
The name Audenshaw is a corruption of its earlier name Aldwinshagh which derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, combined with the Old English suffix shagh meaning woodland. Nico Ditch, an early-medieval linear earthwork possibly built as a defensive barrier against Vikings, runs through the area. During the Middle Ages, Audenshaw was a division of the township of Ashton, in the county of Lancashire. Audenshaw's urbanisation and expansion largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. In the 1870s, many of Audenshaw's inhabitants were employed in hat-making, cotton-spinning, calico-printing, and silk-weaving.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=879460&word=NULL|work=A vision of Britain through time|accessdate=4 September 2009|title=Descriptive Gazetteer Entry for Audenshaw|postscript=|author=Great Britain Historical GIS Project|year=2004|publisher=University of Portsmouth[/tpl] In 1894 this area became Audenshaw Urban District and in the poor law union of Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1974 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside.

==History==

The name Audenshaw is a corruption of its earlier name Aldwinshagh which derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, combined with the Old English suffix shagh meaning woodland.[tpl]harvnb|Lewis|1848|pp=112–116[/tpl].
Nico Ditch, a medieval linear earthwork, runs through the area. Stretching [tpl]convert|6|mi[/tpl] from Ashton Moss in the east to just east of Stretford in the west, the origin of the ditch is unclear.[tpl]harvnb|Nevell|1998|p=40[/tpl]. According to legend, it was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869–870,[tpl]harvnb|Hylton|2003|p=8[/tpl]. and that it was the site of a bloody battle between Saxons and Danes and that Gorton and Reddish got their name from the battle, "Gore Town" and"Red-Ditch".[tpl]harvnb|Booker|1857|p=197[/tpl].[tpl]harvnb|Harland|Wilkinson|1993|pp=26–29[/tpl]. Despite the legend, the U-shape of the ditch – as opposed to the usual V-shape of military earthworks – and the absence of an associated bank indicates that Nico Ditch was probably a boundary marker.[tpl]harvnb|Nevell|1998|pp=40–41[/tpl]. Although it is thought to be earlier, the earliest documented reference to Nico Ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in Audenshaw to the monks of the Kersal Cell. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as "Mykelldiche", and a magnum fossatum, Latin for "large ditch".[tpl]harvnb|Nevell|1992|p=78[/tpl].
In 1877, part of the original village of Audenshaw was demolished to make way for the three Audenshaw Reservoirs. Also destroyed to allow the construction of the reservoirs was a section of Nico Ditch.[tpl]harvnb|Nevell|1992|p=81[/tpl].

==Governance==

During the Early Middle Ages Audenshaw is supposed to have been a 
thanage held by Saxons, but following the Norman conquest of England fell within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, and noted as a division of Ashton, an ancient township and parish within the hundred of Salford. The division of Audenshaw spanned the village of Audenshaw, and the outlying settlements of Danehead, Hooleyhill, Littlemoss, North-street, Walkmill, Waterhouses and Woodhouses. This arrangement persisted until the creation of Audenshaw's first local authority, a local board of health in 1870. Audenshaw Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the locality. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board became the Audenshaw Urban District, a local government district in the Ashton-under-Lyne Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Audenshaw Urban District was abolished, and Audenshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.
Audenshaw is represented in Parliament by the Denton and Reddish constituency. Since its creation in 1983, the constituency has been held by the Labour Party, and the current Member of Parliament is Andrew Gwynne who gained 57.4% of the vote at the United Kingdom general election, 2005.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/869/denton-and-reddish |title=Denton and Reddish |work=The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=3 September 2009 |postscript=[/tpl]
