The Sawtooth Grin is a band from Montrose, New York formed in 1999. The group's first and only official release, Cuddlemonster, was put out on the now defunct label Dead by 1918 in 2001. Pervavor, a three track EP, was later recorded but never officially released due to the disbandment in late 2004. In late 2009, the band got back together and began work on new material, recruiting Jon Karel of The Number Twelve Looks Like You fame as the new drummer and Kevin Lowney as the new bassist."The Apparatus Interview w/ Rich Lombardi""Sawtooth Grin recruits The Number 12 drummer""You're Dead Interview w/ Rich Lombardi & Jay Springman"
