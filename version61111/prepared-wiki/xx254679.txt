Hema is a pampered girl brought up in a small town by her father. Timma and Mooga are her servants, but she treats them just like her friends. Hema is playful and acts like a kid in all matters even though she has reached marriageable age. She meets Prabhakara, her cousin who is visiting her village after many years. Hema's father doesn't like Hema mingling with Prabhakar and tells her about a family fight he had with Prabhakara's father years ago. Hema begins to hate Prabhakara from then on. After her father passes away, Hema & her servants are forced to live with Prabhakara. The story is about the growth of Hema from a pampered girl into a self-reliant woman who earns a living, not wanting to depend on others.
