==History==

===Historical Roots===

The location has been the site of several schools since shortly after World War II when Dartford County Technical School for Girls used Wilmington Manor, across the street, for first-year classes.  In 1950 Wilmington Hall (built in 1734, demolished in 1970) became Dartford Technical School for Boys.Goerge Whitehead, "The History of Wilmington Hall (Formerly known as 'Common House')", www.odwa.co.uk/archives/WilmingtonHallHistory.doc (MS Word document), accessed 23 March 2009  Wilmington Technical School, formed in the early 1960s, was renamed Wilmington High School in 1975 when new buildings were built.  In the mid-1980s two schools were created on the site: Wilmington Hall School and Wilmington Grammar School for Boys.
In 2006 Wilmington Hall School achieved the status of a Business and Enterprise Specialist College, and following a decision by students, parents, staff and governors was officially renamed Wilmington Enterprise College in September that year.Wilmington Enterprise College http://web.archive.org/web/20080607102004/http://www.wec.kent.sch.uk/index.htm
In April 2009 Jane Wheatley (Headteacher of Dartford Grammar School for Girls) became Executive Headteacher after the school was put onto special measures.School Put into special measures http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/8035547.stm After that, the school saw a massive turn around and huge improvements were seen.
On 1 September 2010, Wilmington Enterprise College became part of the The Leigh Academies Trust to become Wilmington Academy, and is planned to have a major reconstruction which is due to be completed in 2013.
