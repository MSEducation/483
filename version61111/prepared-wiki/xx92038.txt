===EU membership===

Serbia earned EU candidate status under Tadić's government, and Dačić has said that the new government will implement everything the previous government had accepted in the EU talks.
His supporters point that his pro-EU stance is evident in the handover of Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić under his tenure as Interior Minister, and his role in the visa-free travel for Serbians in the EU. Following the European Council’s confirmation on 28 June 2013 that formal negotiations for the accession of Serbia to the EU could begin, Dačić announced that the Serbian government would remain continuously in session with the aim of completing the talks as quickly as possible.[tpl]cite news|url=http://inserbia.info/news/2013/06/eu-talks-could-be-completed-in-four-to-five-years-ivica-dacic/|title=EU Talks Could Be Completed In Four To Five Years – Ivica Dačić|last=|first=|date=28 June 2013|work=InSerbia|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl] He emphasized that harmonisation with European laws is an integral part of the government’s plan for boosting investment and employment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://inserbia.info/news/2013/07/governments-next-goal-unemployment-pm-dacic/|title=Government’s Next Goal – Unemployment – PM Dačić|last=|first=|date=9 July 2013|work=InSerbia|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]

===Economy===

The Socialists controlled gas monopoly Srbijagas which entered partnership with Russian oil giant Gazprom in the coalition with the Democratic Party.
Dačić has pledged to promote greater social justice and tackle the rise of unemployment and decline in industry, which he blamed on unrestrained capitalism. With the euro zone crisis, Serbia, as other Balkan countries, sees high debt, creeping inflation and falling exports.

Nenad Sebek, executive director of the Centre for Reconciliation and Democracy think-tank said "Dačić is one of the most intelligent and cunning politicians in Serbia ... Without ever saying sorry for what his party did during the
1990s under Milošević, Dačić single-handedly returned the Socialists to the political mainstream in Serbia." Sebek continued: "He is extremely smart and likely to be very cooperative when negotiating with the international community, but he's still an eyesore for anyone who doesn't have the memory of a goldfish."
The EU had earlier listed Dačić among persons in Slobodan Milošević's circle prohibited from entering the EU.[tpl]when|date=August 2012[/tpl]
