==Production==

"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man" was written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn.[tpl]sfn|Rolling Stone 2010, 500 Songs, p. 112[/tpl] It was produced by Jerry Wexler.[tpl]sfn|Rolling Stone 2010, 500 Songs, p. 112[/tpl]
Franklin began recording the song in 1967 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, after completing "I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)". While taking a break for the night at the motel, Franklin's then-husband and manager Ted White got into a fight with FAME Studios owner Rick Hall[tpl]sfn|Mitchell 2003 Aretha: How the Queen[/tpl] or Wexler,[tpl]sfn|Rivera|2003|p=46[/tpl] whom White blamed for getting "rednecks" to work with her. 
The following morning, it was found that Franklin and White had left[tpl]sfn|Rivera|2003|p=46[/tpl] with the song still unfinished. Franklin disappeared for several weeks,[tpl]sfn|Mitchell 2003 Aretha: How the Queen[/tpl] later reappearing in New York.  She then finished the song with the help of her sisters Carolyn and Erma.[tpl]sfn|Rolling Stone 2010, 500 Songs, p. 112[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rivera|2003|p=46[/tpl]

==Song==

At the beginning of the song, Franklin sings with a gospel-inspired tone, which continues through the bridge. Through overdubbing, Franklin plays both the piano and the organ.[tpl]sfn|Rivera|2003|p=48[/tpl] Eventually the song equal to  Franklin's hit cover of Otis Redding's "Respect" which Redding said she "stole".[tpl]sfn|Janovitz, Do Right Woman[/tpl] 
According to Bill Janovitz of Allmusic, "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man" contrasts the power of temptation and rewards of fidelity. He notes that its melody is "soothing".[tpl]sfn|Janovitz, Do Right Woman[/tpl] Patricia Hill Collins writes that it has a feminist message, urging African-American men to respect women as their equals and not follow the then-common belief that it is "a man's world" by using or abusing them; she also writes that the song urges men to be loyal, responsible, and "sexually expressive".[tpl]sfn|Collins|2000|p=154[/tpl]
Although the song is originally heavily inspired by soul, covers have different styles. For example, the The Flying Burrito Brothers cover in 1969 was a "country-soul waltz".[tpl]sfn|Janovitz, Do Right Woman[/tpl]
