==History==

The site was first surveyed in 1823.[tpl]cite book|title=Then and now in old Westbury; with notes on Exton, Hagley and Carrick|last=von Stieglitz|first=K R|publisher=Telegraph Printery|location=Launceston|year=1946|page=5[/tpl] The town was laid out in 1828 by the Van Diemen's Land Company.  In the 1830s Westbury developed as a garrison village. A detachment of troops commanded by Lieutenant Ball were stationed in Westbury in 1832. They were barracked around a village green in the centre of the town. The village green is still in use today and is reputed[tpl]by whom|date=July 2012[/tpl] to be the only traditional village green in Australia. Westbury Post Office opened on 21 June 1832.[tpl]Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=Tas&country= | accessdate = 16 June 2012[/tpl]
From early in the 19th century the village green has been the site for the Westbury St Patrick’s Festival celebrating the town’s Celtic links. Though Westbury is often described as a very “English village”, the first European settlers were predominantly Irish; ex Irish convicts, retired soldiers and free settlers, many fleeing the Great Irish Famine in the 1840s. Gaelic was the local language in Westbury for many generations and a strong Irish brogue is reputed to have lasted throughout the 19th Century.
Military pensioners were each granted a [tpl]convert|5|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] block of land complete with a well and pear tree. By the mid-1800s Westbury had become the largest military community in Tasmania. The town had a population of some 3,000 and an extensive grid street plan was surveyed preparing Westbury to become the predominant town in the north of Tasmania and the gateway to the north-west, but Deloraine has filled that role instead.  Westbury remains a small town servicing the local agriculture industry.
Westbury current has a Primary School 'Westbury Primary School' which services the local community, students finishing primary school travel to Launceston or Deloraine to attend secondary education.
Westbury is named after Westbury, Wiltshire in England.
