==Show synopsis==

The show stars Peter Krause as Nathaniel Samuel "Nate" Fisher, Jr., whose funeral director father (Richard Jenkins) dies and bequeaths to him and his brother David (Michael C. Hall) co-ownership of the family funeral business. The Fisher clan also includes widow Ruth (Frances Conroy) and daughter Claire (Lauren Ambrose). Other regulars include mortician and family friend Federico Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), Nate's on-again/off-again girlfriend Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), and David's long-term boyfriend Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick).
On one level, the show is a conventional family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, the show is distinguished by its unblinking focus on the topic of death, which it explores on multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each episode begins with a death – anything from drowning or heart attack to sudden infant death syndrome – and that death usually sets the tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes in a way that is illuminated by the death and its aftermath. The show also has a strong dosage of dark humor and surrealism running throughout.
A recurring plot device consists of a character having an imaginary conversation with the deceased; for example, Nate, David, and Federico sometimes "converse" with the person who died at the beginning of the episode, while they are being embalmed or planning or during the funeral. Sometimes, the conversation is with other recurring deceased characters, most notably Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. Alan Ball, the show's creator, avers that this represents the living character's internal dialogue expressed in the form of an external conversation.[tpl]cite video |title=Six Feet Under — DVD audio commentaries |people=Ball, Alan (writer) |publisher=HBO Home Video |medium=DVD[/tpl]

==Concept==

Although overall plots and characters were created by Alan Ball, there are conflicting reports on how the series was conceived. In one instance, Ball stated that he came up with the premise of the show after the deaths of his sister and father. However, in an interview,[tpl]cite video |title=Six Feet Under: The Complete Series – "In Memoriam" featurette |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video |people=Ball, Alan[/tpl] he intimates that HBO entertainment president Carolyn Strauss proposed the idea to him. In a copyright-infringement lawsuit,[tpl]cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/462/f3d/1072/funky-films-inc-v-time-warner-entertainment-company-lp-lp|title=462 F3d 1072 Funky Films Inc v. Time Warner Entertainment Company Lp Lp|work=Open Jurist|accessdate=March 28, 2010[/tpl] screenwriter Gwen O’Donnell asserted that she was the original source of the idea which later passed through Strauss to Ball; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, proceeding on the assumption that this assertion was true, rejected her claim. Ball stated in an interview, "When I went to HBO and they had read my first draft and Carolyn Strauss said, 'You know, this is really, really good. I love these characters, I love these situations, but it feels a little safe. Could you just make it just a little more fucked up?' which is not a note that you get in Hollywood very often. And I thought, 'Wow!' And that gave me free range to go a little deeper, go a little darker, go a little more complicated".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/six-feet-under-creator-alan-ball-talks-about-the-end-of-the-hbo-series |title=Six Feet Under creator Alan Ball talks about the end of the HBO series |work=MovieWeb |date=May 25, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2012[/tpl]

==Major themes==

The show focuses on human mortality and the lives of those who deal with it on a daily basis. When discussing the concept of the show, creator Alan Ball elaborates on the foremost questions the show’s pilot targeted:
Six Feet Under introduces the Fisher family as the basis on which to explore these questions. Throughout its five-season, 63-episode run, major characters experience crises which are in direct relation to their environment and the grief they have experienced. Alan Ball again relates these experiences as well as the choice of the series' title, to the persistent subtext of the program:[tpl]cite video |title=Six Feet Under: The Complete Fifth Season – "Everyone's Waiting" audio commentary |people=Ball, Alan (writer/director) |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video[/tpl]
