==History==

The sounds [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] (spelled [tpl]angle bracket|V[/tpl]) and [tpl]IPA|/b/[/tpl] (spelled [tpl]angle bracket|B[/tpl]) of Classical Latin developed into a bilabial fricative [tpl]IPA|/β/[/tpl] between vowels  in Early Medieval Latin. Therefore, [tpl]angle bracket|V[/tpl] no longer represented adequately the labial-velar approximant sound [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] of Germanic phonology.
The Germanic [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] phoneme was therefore written as [tpl]angbr|VV[/tpl] or [tpl]angle bracket|uu[/tpl] ([tpl]angle bracket|u[/tpl] and [tpl]angle bracket|v[/tpl] becoming distinct only by the Early Modern period) by the 7th or 8th century by the earliest writers of Old English and Old High German.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/pronunciationofw |title=Why is 'w' pronounced 'double u' rather than 'double v'? : Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] Gothic (not Latin-based), by contrast, simply used a letter based on the Greek Υ for the same sound. The digraph [tpl]angle bracket|VV[/tpl]/[tpl]angle bracket|uu[/tpl] was also used in Medieval Latin to represent Germanic names, including Gothic ones like Wamba.
It is from this [tpl]angle bracket|uu[/tpl] digraph that the modern name "double U" derives.
The digraph was commonly used in the spelling of Old High German, but only sporadically in Old English, where the [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] sound was usually represented by the runic [tpl]angle bracket|[tpl]Unicode|Ƿ[/tpl][/tpl] wynn.
In early Middle English, following the 11th-century Norman Conquest, [tpl]angle bracket|uu[/tpl] gained popularity and by 1300 it had taken wynn's place in common use.
Scribal realization of the digraph could look like a pair of  Vs whose branches crossed in the middle. An obsolete, cursive form found in the nineteenth century in both English and German was in the form of an en whose rightmost branch curved around as in a cursive vee.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The shift from the digraph [tpl]angle bracket|VV[/tpl] to the distinct ligature [tpl]angle bracket|W[/tpl] is thus gradual, and is only apparent in abecedaria, explicit listings of all individual letters. It was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in both Middle English and Middle German orthography, although it remained an outsider not really considered part of the Latin alphabet proper, as expressed by Valentin Ickelshamer in the 16th century,
who complained that
 
 Poor w is so infamous and unknown that many barely know either its name or its shape, not those who aspire to being Latinists, as they have no need of it, nor do the Germans, not even the schoolmasters, know what to do with it or how to call it; some call it we, others call it uu, ... the Swabians call it auwawau"Arm w ist so unmer und unbekannt, dasz man schier weder seinen namen noch sein gestalt waiszt, die Lateiner wöllen sein nit, wie sy dann auch sein nit bedürffen, so wissen die Teütschen sonderlich die schülmaister noch nitt was sy mit im machen oder wie sy in nennen sollen, an ettlichen enden nennet man in we, die aber ein wenig latein haben gesehen, die nennen in mit zwaien unterschidlichen lauten u auff ainander, also uu ... die Schwaben nennen in auwawau, wiewol ich disen kauderwelschen namen also versteh, das es drey u sein, auff grob schwäbisch au genennet." cited after Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch.

In  Middle High German (and possibly already in late Old High German), the West Germanic  phoneme [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] became realized as [tpl]IPA|v[/tpl]; this is why the German [tpl]angle bracket|w[/tpl] today represents that sound. There is no phonological distinction between  [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|v[/tpl] in contemporary German. Modern German dialects generally have only [tpl]IPA|v[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|ʋ[/tpl] for West Germanic [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl], but [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|β̞[/tpl] remains heard allophonically for [tpl]Unicode|w[/tpl], especially in the clusters [tpl]angle bracket|schw[/tpl], [tpl]angle bracket|zw[/tpl], and [tpl]angle bracket|qu[/tpl]. Some Bavarian dialects preserve a "light" initial [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] in words like wuoz (Standard German weiß [tpl]IPA|vaɪs[/tpl] 'I know'). The Classical Latin [tpl]IPA|β[/tpl] is heard in the Southern German greeting Servus ('hello' or 'goodbye').
In Dutch, it became a labiodental approximant [tpl]IPA|/ʋ/[/tpl] (with the exception of words with -[tpl]angle bracket|eeuw[/tpl], which have [tpl]IPA|/eːβ/[/tpl], or other diphthongs containing -[tpl]angle bracket|uw[/tpl]). In many Dutch speaking areas, such as Flanders and Suriname, the [tpl]IPA|/β/[/tpl] pronunciation is used at all times.

==Usage==

In Europe, there are only a few languages that use W in native words and all are located in a central-western European zone between Cornwall and Poland. English, German, Low German, Dutch, Frisian, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Walloon, Polish, Kashubian, Sorbian and Resian use W in native words. English uses W to represent [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl], German, Polish and Kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative [tpl]IPA|/v/[/tpl] (with Polish and related Kashubian using Ł for [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl]), and Dutch uses it for [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/ʋ/[/tpl]. Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used in Welsh and Cornish to represent the vowel [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl] as well as the related approximant consonant [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl]. English also contains a number of words beginning with a W that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) R, remaining from usage in Anglo-Saxon in which the W was pronounced: wreak, wrap, wreck, wrench, wroth, wrinkle, etc.  (Certain dialects of Scottish English still distinguish this digraph.)
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] is used for the voiced labial-velar approximant, probably based on English.
In Finnish, [tpl]angbr|W[/tpl] is seen as a variant of [tpl]angbr|V[/tpl] and not a separate letter. It is however recognised and maintained in the spelling of some old names, reflecting an earlier German spelling standard, and in some modern loan words. In all cases it is pronounced /v/.
In Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, [tpl]angbr|W[/tpl] is named double-v and not double-u. In these languages, the letter only exists in old names, loanwords and foreign words. (Foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) It is usually pronounced /v/, but in some words of English origin it may be pronounced /w/.W, w | Gyldendal - Den Store Danskehttp://www.svenskaakademien.se/svenska_spraket/svenska_akademiens_ordlista/saol_pa_natet/ordlista, page 1098 The letter was officially introduced in the Danish and Swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006, respectively, despite having been in use for much longer. It was recognized since the conception of modern Norwegian, with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907.[tpl]cite book |last1=Aars |first1=Jonathan |last2=Hofgaard |first2=Simon Wright |title=Norske retskrivnings-regler med alfabetiske ordlister |publisher=W.

In the alphabets of most modern Romance languages (excepting far northern French and Walloon), W is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed (le week-end, il watt, el kiwi). The digraph 'ou' is used for [tpl]IPA|/w/[/tpl] in native French words; 'oi' is [tpl]IPA|/wa/[/tpl] or  [tpl]IPA|/wɑ/[/tpl], 'oin' is  [tpl]IPA|/wɛ̃/[/tpl]. In Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, [tpl]IPA|w[/tpl] is a non-syllabic variant of [tpl]IPA|/u/[/tpl], spelled U (with a diaeresis in the Spanish combinations 'güe' and 'güi').
In the Cyrillic alphabet used for the Belarusian language, [tpl]angbr|Ў[/tpl] is pronounced like English /w/.
The Japanese language uses "W", pronounced /daburu/, as an ideogram meaning "double".[tpl]cite web|url=http://no-sword.jp/blog/2006/06/let-pretending-to-be-injured-begin.html |title=Let the pretending to be injured begin|publisher=No-sword.jp |date=June 10, 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]
In Arabic, "W" is transliterated using the penultimate letter of the alphabet, و (waw).
In Italian, while the letter "W" is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet, the character is often used in place of Viva (hooray for...), while the same symbol written upside down indicates abbasso (down with...).
In Vietnamese, W is called [tpl]lang|vi|vê đúp[/tpl], from the French [tpl]lang|fr|double vé[/tpl]. It is not included in the standard Vietnamese alphabet, but it is often used as a substitute for qu- in literary dialect and very informal writing.[tpl]cite news|title=Ngôn ngữ thời @ của teen|trans_title=Language in the teens' age of @|author=Nhật My|work=VnExpress|publisher=FPT Group|date=May 19, 2009|accessdate=April 15, 2014|url=http://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/thoi-su/ngon-ngu-thoi-cua-teen-2131526.html|language=vi[/tpl][tpl]cite magazine|title=Viết tắt chữ Việt trong ngôn ngữ @|trans_title=Vietnamese abbreviations in @ language|author=Trần Tư Bình|work=Chim Việt Cành Nam|issue=53|date=November 30, 2013|url=http://vietpali.sourceforge.net/binh/VietTatChuVietTrongNgonNgu-ACong.htm|language=vi[/tpl]
W is also the symbol for the chemical element tungsten, after its German name, Wolfram.

==Name==

"Double U" is the only English letter name with more than one syllable, except for the occasionally used, though somewhat archaic, œ (its name is pronounced similar to ethel), the formerly common in print &, ampersand, and the archaic pronunciation of Z, izzard. The initialism "www" for the World Wide Web thus, perhaps ironically, has three times as many syllables as the full name.
Some speakers therefore shorten the name "double u" into "dub" only; for example, University of Wisconsin, University of Washington, University of Wyoming, and University of Western Australia are all known colloquially as "U Dub", and the automobile company Volkswagen, abbreviated "VW", is sometimes pronounced "V-Dub".[tpl]cite web|last=Volkswagen|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgEvy60bZYI|title=VW Unpimp – Drop it like its hot|accessdate=November 3, 2011[/tpl] The fact that many website URLs still require a "www." prefix has likewise given rise to a shortened version of the original, three-syllable pronunciation. W is currently the only English letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes. Many others, however, pronounce the "w" as dub-u, reducing it to two syllables. For example, "www" would be six syllables rather than nine, being pronounced, dub-u dub-u dub-u.
In other Germanic languages, including German, its name is similar to that of English V.W: German on Wiktionary In many languages, its name literally means "double v": Spanish doble ve (though it can be spelled uve doble),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taringa.net/posts/noticias/7792488/Real-Academia-Espanola-elimina-la-Ch-y-ll-del-alfabeto.html |title=Real Academia Española elimina la Ch y ll del alfabeto |publisher=Taringa! |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl]In American Spanish, it is doble ve, similar regional variations exist in other Spanish-speaking countries French double vé, Icelandic tvöfalt vaff, Czech dvojité vé, Finnish kaksois-vee, etc.
George W. Bush has been given the nickname "Dubya", after the colloquial pronunciation of the name of "W" in Texas.
