Cherry Beach Sound has two control rooms, one of which houses a large Solid State Logic console, and the other of which uses a Digidesign D CONTROL Icon console.  Both control rooms are wired to the studio's live floor, and were designed and acoustically treated by Martin Pilchner. Control Room A is a one of a kind studio as it is the only studio in Canada with soffit-mounted Genelec monitors and 5.1 surround sound capability.Cherry Beach Sound-Toronto recording studio-HOME The website of Pilchner-Schoustal International states: "A notable feature of the design is the extremely large front window which engages the control room to the studio. Four separate layers of laminated glass take up over 6 feet of depth and run over 21 feet long including two 30 degree miters per layer. The window also splays upward toward the studio space, and as such incorporated an enormous amount of glass." http://pilchner-schoustal.com/ Cherry Beach Sound utilizes the latest modern technologies such as Source-Connect, an array of Genelec monitors, a 56-channel SSL console, Neve and Manley pre-amps and compressors, a Yamaha C7 Grand piano, and a large lot of mics including the Neumann U 87, Neumann U 89, AKG C 414 EB, Sennheiser MD 421, and many more.http://www.cherrybeachsound.com/contents/studios/mics.html

==The Munitions Factory==

The building that contains Cherry Beach Sound, The Munitions Factory, houses several other companies such as Zero Fractal and Pro Rehearsal and Backline, offering services such as rental of rehearsal spaces. The warehouse section of The Munitions Factory is used for storage, filming/photoshoots and construction of sets. The facility presently offers three video suites, eleven rehearsal rooms, a repair shop and a rental service for film and television production. The warehouse, originally built in 1911 has high ceilings that date back to its history as a munitions factory.  The high ceilings were designed to allow explosions to rise high before hitting the ceiling and being forced to expand horizontally.  This reduced the risk of injury in the event of munitions-related accidents. Today, the high ceilings make the warehouse a popular space for film shoots, large band rehearsals, and other events.
