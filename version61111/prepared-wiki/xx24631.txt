Lisa Marie Simpson[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding |episodelink=Lisa's Wedding |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-19 |season=06 |number=19[/tpl] is a cartoon character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is the middle child of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family were moved to their own series on Fox, which debuted on December 17, 1989.
At eight years old, Lisa is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart and older sister of Maggie. She is highly intelligent and plays the baritone saxophone. She has been a vegetarian since season 7, converted to Buddhism in season 13. Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes, including the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and inspired a line of merchandise.
Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while Nancy Cartwright (who was later cast as the voice for Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith's voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart" who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as the series progressed she became a more sophisticated and intellectual character. Because of her unusual pointed hair style, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw.
Lisa is one of the most enduring characters on the series. TV Guide ranked her 11th (tied with Bart) on their list of the "Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time". Her environmentalism has been especially well received; several episodes featuring her have won Genesis and Environmental Media Awards, including a special "Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award" in 2001. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals included Lisa on their list of the "Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time". Yeardley Smith won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, and in 2000 Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Role in The Simpsons==

The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age;[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=78[/tpl] as such, Lisa is always depicted as eight years old.[tpl]cite episode |title=Stark Raving Dad |episodelink=Stark Raving Dad |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Moore, Rich |network=Fox |airdate=1991-09-19 |season=03 |number=01[/tpl] The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78-79[/tpl] Lisa's year of birth is given in "Lisa's First Word" (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10[/tpl] The episode "That '90s Show" (season 19, 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s.[tpl]Cite web |title=The Simpsons: That '90s Show Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/847/847940p1.html |publisher=IGN |date=2008-01-28 |author=Canning, Robert |accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episodelink=That '90s Show |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Selman, Matt; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19 |number=11[/tpl] Lisa is a lover of music, especially jazz.

==Character==

===Creation===

Matt Groening first conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction,[tpl]cite video |people=BBC |year=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] hurriedly sketching his version of a dysfunctional family, named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening's younger sister, but little else was based on her.[tpl]cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family |author=Rose, Joseph |date=2007-08-03 |work=The Oregonian[/tpl] In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa displayed little of the intelligence for which she later became known. She was more of a "female Bart" and was originally described as simply the "middle child", without much personality.
Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night".[tpl]sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14[/tpl] In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Lisa and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.

===Design===

The entire Simpson family was designed to be easily recognized in silhouette.Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "Fear of Flying", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Lisa's physical features are generally unique. In some early episodes, minor background characters occasionally had a similar hairline. However, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline.Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "Principal Charming", in The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. While designing Lisa, Groening "couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white; when designing Lisa and Maggie, he "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".Groening, Matt. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
To draw Lisa's head and hair, most of the show's animators use what they call the "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the back of her head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it.Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "Summer of 4 Ft. 2", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Several Simpsons animators, including Pete Michels and David Silverman, consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw.Michels, Pete. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "All Singing, All Dancing", in The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Silverman explains that "her head is so abstract" due to her hairstyle.Silverman, David; Reardon, Jim; Groening, Matt. (2005). Illustrated commentary for "Treehouse of Horror V", in The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.

===Voice===

While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of the Tracey Ullman Show cast,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |title=D'oh, you're the voice |accessdate=2007-08-18 |date=2003-02-27 |author=Lee, Luaine |work=The Age |location=Melbourne[/tpl] the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character's bland description—Lisa was described simply as the "middle child"—and read for the role of Bart instead.[tpl]harvnb|Cartwright|2000 |pp=35–40[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm |title=Bart's voice tells all |accessdate=2007-05-16 |date=2000-11-10 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her to give it a try. Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'"[tpl]cite news |title=She who laughs last |date=2007-12-08 |page=8E |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Charles |last=Miranda[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To "Burns-Sexual" Smithers |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date=2008-10-26 |author=Larry Carroll |publisher=MTV[/tpl] Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead.[tpl]cite news |title=She’s happy as Lisa Simpson, although she’d like more d’oh |date=2004-04-04 |work=The Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |author=Heidi Vogt[/tpl]
Smith and the show's writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality, and she has developed greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Cartwright wrote: "with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your-eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be, but also the kind of child we want all children to be. But, at the time, on The Tracey Ullman Show, she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality."
Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, who raises the pitch of her voice slightly for the role.[tpl]cite news |title=She who laughs last |date=2007-12-08 |page=8E |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |author=Charles Miranda[/tpl] In some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts, and has voiced other characters on very rare occasions.[tpl]cite video |people=Smith, Yeardley |year=2007 |title=Audio commentary for The Simpsons Movie |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl] Usually they are derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in "Last Tap Dance in Springfield" (season 11, 2000) and Lisa, Jr. in "Missionary: Impossible".

Despite the fame of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely recognized in public, as it is Lisa who appears on screen. But she does not mind. She said, "it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice."[tpl]cite news |title=Meet the Simpsons |date=2004-05-06 |publisher=Daily Express |author=Peter Sheridan[/tpl] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/16/lisa-simpson-yeardley-smith-film |title=From Springfield to Tinseltown |date=2009-01-16 |author=Lisa Marks |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-02-16 |location=London[/tpl] Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying "there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. "If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," she said, "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'"[tpl]cite news |title=Yeardley Smith Confesses: "I Love Lisa" |work=Simpsons Illustrated Magazine, Volume 1, Number 5 |date=Spring 1992 |author=L.W. Michion |pages=20–23[/tpl] Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode "Lisa's Substitute", as able "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic."
Until 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. A pay dispute erupted in 1998, during which Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing for casting of new voices. The dispute was soon resolved, and Smith received $125,000 per episode until 2004 when the voice actors sought an increase to $360,000 per episode.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544690429.html |title=Simpsons actors demand bigger share |accessdate=2008-10-26 |date=2004-04-03 |author=Glaister, Dan |work=The Age |location=Melbourne[/tpl] The issue was resolved a month later,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/01/entertainment/main615066.shtml |title='Simpsons' Cast Goes Back To Work |accessdate=2008-09-21 |date=2004-05-01 |publisher=CBS News[/tpl] and Smith earned $250,000 per episode.

===Development===

In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart": equally mischievous but lacking unique traits.Mirkin, David. (2004). Commentary for "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. As the series progressed, Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character. She demonstrates her intellect in the 1990 episode "Krusty Gets Busted" (season one), by helping Bart reveal Sideshow Bob's plot to frame Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.Reiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for "Krusty Gets Busted", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, such as "Moaning Lisa" (season one, 1990). The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks, who wanted to do an emotional episode involving Lisa's sadness, to complement the many "jokey episodes" in the first season.Reiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for "Moaning Lisa", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.
In the seventh-season episode "Lisa the Vegetarian" (1995), Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian, distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice. The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit) who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer David Mirkin, who had recently become a vegetarian, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney, a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.Cohen, David S.; Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "Lisa the Vegetarian", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season DVD. 20th Century Fox.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/08/26/paul-mccartney-insisted-lisa-simpson-stay-veg/ |title=Paul McCartney Insisted Lisa Simpson Stay VEG |date=2009-08-26 |publisher=ecorazzi |accessdate=2009-11-15[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sideswipe/news/article.cfm?c_id=702&objectid=10593582 |title=Sideswipe: McCartney keeps Lisa vegetarian |date=August 28, 2009 |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=2009-08-27[/tpl] In the season 13 episode "She of Little Faith" (2001), Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism.[tpl]harvnb|Pinsky|2007 |p=171[/tpl]
Lisa plays the baritone saxophone, and some episodes use that as a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second grade level and instead "think of Lisa as a really good player."[tpl]Cite web |title=Sax and the Single Simpson |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=1991-07-26 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314958,00.html |accessdate=2010-03-08[/tpl]

Although she is intellectually gifted, Lisa experiences typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=203[/tpl] For example, in "Lost Our Lisa" (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lost Our Lisa |episodelink=Lost Our Lisa |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Scully, Briann; Michels, Pete |network=Fox |airdate=1998-05-10 |season=09 |number=24[/tpl] Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a kid's body."[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=203[/tpl] In The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer, Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey, and watches The Itchy and Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes, "One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for Itchy and Scratchy and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better the rest of us'."[tpl]harvnb|Skoble|1999 |pp=31–32[/tpl]
Lisa occasionally worries that her family's dull habits will rub off on her, such as in "Lisa the Simpson" (season nine, 1998) she worries that the "Simpson gene" will make her less intelligent later finding out the gene only goes through the male side.[tpl]cite news |title=Men on TV: Dumb as Posts And Proud of It |date=2000-04-09 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/arts/men-on-tv-dumb-as-posts-and-proud-of-it.html?pagewanted=3 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2010-03-08 |author=Gates, Anita[/tpl][tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson |episodelink=Lisa the Simpson |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Goldreyer, Ned; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-08 |season=09 |number=17[/tpl] She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit ... but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment."[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=233[/tpl] Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward "Lisa's Wedding" (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé.[tpl]cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding |episodelink=Lisa's Wedding |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-19 |season=06 |number=19[/tpl] In the episode "Mother Simpson" (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time.[tpl]cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episodelink=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Rich; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1995-11-19 |season=07 |number=08[/tpl] Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.Appel, Rich.

===Cultural influence===

Jonathan Gray, author of the book Watching The Simpsons, feels that Lisa "is probably the best and certainly longest-running feminist character that television has had. She's the heart of the show and she quite often questions the gender politics" but only her own.[tpl]harvnb|Ortved|2009 |p=86[/tpl] Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade wrote, "Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note – a know-it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world."[tpl]Cite news |title=She's not even real and she's a feminist role model liberated Lisa |work=The Toledo Blade |author=Borrelli, Christopher |date=2001-03-11[/tpl]
According to PETA, Lisa was one of the first vegetarian characters on primetime television. In 2004 the organization included Lisa on its list of the "Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=4375 |title=Friends' Phoebe tops PETA's list of most animal-friendly TV characters of all time |accessdate=2008-10-27 |date=2004-05-04 |publisher=PETA[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link |date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In 2008, environmentalist website The Daily Green honored Lisa's role in The Simpsons Movie with one of its inaugural "Heart of Green" awards, which "recognize those who have helped green go mainstream." They wrote "young Lisa Simpson has inspired a generation to wear their hearts on their sleeves and get educated, and involved, about global issues, from justice to feminism and the environment."[tpl]Cite web |title=The Daily Green's Heart of Green Awards 2008 |url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/heart-of-green-47032710 |publisher=The Daily Green |accessdate=2010-03-13 |year=2008[/tpl] Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences.[tpl]sfn|Turner|2004|p=327[/tpl] Mario D'Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at Rollins College in Florida, described Lisa as "open-minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a child-like sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions."[tpl]harvnb|Pinsky|2007 |p=180[/tpl]
Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons have had a significant influence on English-language idioms.
