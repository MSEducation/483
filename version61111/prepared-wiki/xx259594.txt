[[Magnetoelectrochemistry]]

CATEGORIES: Electrochemistry

Magnetoelectrochemistry is a branch of electrochemistry dealing with magnetic effects in electrochemistry.

==History==

These effects have been supposed to exist since the time of Michael Faraday.
There have been observations on the existence of Hall effect in electrolytes. Until these observations the magnetoelectrochemistry was an esoteric curiosity.
This field has had a rapid development in the past years and is an active area of research. Other scientific fields which contributed to the development of magnetoelectrochemistry are magnetohydrodynamics and convective diffusion theory. [tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
