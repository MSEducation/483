In June, Rogers was expected to compete and the Canadian Championships in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada but was forced to withdraw due to a rib injury. "I popped my rib out a few times in warm up, which caused all the muscles to spasm around that area," Rogers told International Gymnast Magazine. "Expected recovery time for now is unknown, but it's already feeling better, which hopefully means I won't be off for much longer and get right back on track for Worlds."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=975:mackie-rogers-refocus-on-worlds&catid=2:news&Itemid=53 |title=International Gymnast Magazine Online - Canada's Mackie, Rogers Refocus on Worlds |publisher=Intlgymnast.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]

"I was put in a fiberglass cast for one month and then transferred into a walking air cast which I'm still in," she said. "Unfortunately it's not healing as well as we would all like. It's still fractured due to the way the bone is broken off. The bone is too small to pin surgically, and would be a difficult reconstructive surgery."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.intlgymnast.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1793:rehabbing-rogers-puts-best-foot-forward-&catid=2:news&Itemid=53 |title=International Gymnast Magazine Online - Rehabbing Rogers Puts Best Foot Forward |publisher=Intlgymnast.com |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2012-06-06[/tpl]

===2011===

In February, Rogers was able to resume training. "After seeing the surgeon again recently, he gave me the go-ahead to start increasing my training load with no restrictions, which was pretty exciting news after hearing doctors telling me to hold back and take it easy for nine months. There's no set time or date that I'll be training full-force. I'm just taking it day by day, but I'll be back at it very soon! I have a great physio(therapist) and orthopod (orthopedist) who are working with me with rehab."

As soon as I saw we were sixth I knew we were in. I was sitting with my parents. Then I jumped out of my seat and ran over to hug my teammates. I mean, we’re making history. That is so cool. There are twenty thousand people in here. That’s a lot of people. That can be intimidating. I just looked around and took it all in. I had shivers. I think everyone handled it tremendously. It could’ve gone a lot worse. We all have strengths and weaknesses and I think we put those aside and did it for the team. We have nothing to lose now. The worst we can be is eighth and that’s still an accomplishment in itself. I know we can only go up from here because we had our struggles on beam so now we know what we need to improve on. We’re just going to come out and rock (on Tuesday). This is just so amazing. I really don’t have words to describe the feeling."[tpl]cite web|last=Johnson |first=George |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Canadian+gymnasts+make+history+qualifying+team+final/7008671/story.html |title=Olympics: Canadian gymnasts qualify for team final, make history |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-01[/tpl]  In the team final, she contributed scores of 14.866 on vault and 14.466 on uneven bars toward the Canadian team's fifth place finish.http://www.fig-docs.com/microsites/london12/results/files/res/wag/wag_team_f.pdf  In the vault final, Rogers placed seventh with a score of 14.483.http://www.fig-docs.com/microsites/london12/results/files/res/wag/wag_vault_f.pdf  She said, "I didn’t get a gold medal, but it was so much fun out there."http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/05/canadian-gymnast-elsabeth-blacks-olympic-vault-debut-ends-in-injury/
