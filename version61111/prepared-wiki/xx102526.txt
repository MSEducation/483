[[UEFA Euro 2004 Group C]]

CATEGORIES: UEFA Euro 2004, 2004 in Swedish football

Group C of UEFA Euro 2004 was one of four groups in the final tournament's initial group stage. It began on 14 June and was completed on 22 June. The group consisted of Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Bulgaria.
Sweden won the group and advanced to the quarter-finals, along with Denmark. Italy and Bulgaria failed to advance.
Three teams – Italy, Denmark and Sweden – all finished on an equal amount of points, with each team having defeated Bulgaria but drawn their two other games between one another. As all results between the three teams in question were draws, both the points won in these games and the goal difference accrued in these games still left the teams undivided. The decisive tiebreaker was therefore the goals scored during the games between one another: Italy having scored the least goals of the three teams were therefore eliminated.
