==History==

Commercial aviation began in the Norfolk area about 1926, when Norfolk citizens flew commercially for the first time on the Mitten Line, operated by Philadelphia Rapid Transit Air Service, Inc.  Norfolk International Airport was established in 1938 when the city-owned Truxton Manor Golf Course was converted to Norfolk Municipal Airport, complete with a [tpl]convert|3500|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] runway. The first permanent terminal was complete by 1940.
With World War II, Norfolk Municipal Airport became a vital resource to the war effort. The United States Army Air Corps assumed control of airport operations between 1942–1947, extending the runway and adding two more to handle the vastly increased number of flights with larger and larger aircraft. The Norfolk Fighter Wing was established by the AAF in August 1942, providing an air defense umbrella for the Norfolk area's numerous defense facilities. The 52d Fighter Group was stationed at the airport however immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941. Various squadrons were assigned to Norfolk Airport during the early years of the war for the air defense mission, the last being the 373d Fighter Group. The air defense mission ended at the end of July 1944.
As the troops returned from the war, the Army Air Corps returned the airport to the city's domain at the end of 1945, and commercial travel took off with two new airlines providing regular flights. In 1948, Piedmont Airlines initiated flights. That same year, ground was broken for a larger, more modern terminal building.
In 1950, responsibility for the airport was turned over to the newly established Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority (NPIA) which could proudly call Norfolk Municipal Airport one of the finest in the nation and one of the busiest. In 1951, the new terminal was officially dedicated.
In the 1960s, the transition from propeller driven aircraft to jets gathered full steam. Norfolk Municipal Airport took on the new demands for longer and stronger runway and taxiway facilities easily, and jetliners here became the rule, not the exception. As a result, in 1968, the airport was officially recognized as the air transportation center for the entire Hampton Roads region, and became known as Norfolk Regional Airport. To prepare for exponential growth over the next three decades, NPIA developed a comprehensive master plan that would move the airport into the 21st century in full stride.
In 1974, the airport dedicated its new, state-of-the-art terminal and additional land was secured for further expansion. In 1976, the airport's name was changed to Norfolk International Airport with the addition of federal customs facilities. New outbuildings housing the fire station, maintenance depot, ATC tower and more were also planned and came on line as needed. However, one of the challenges in expanding was capitalizing on the location of the airport's neighboring Botanical Garden, creating a beautiful buffer zone between the airport and the outside world. Norfolk International Airport, surrounded by year-round beauty, has become a national role model for reconciling expanding air facilities and a delicate ecological sanctuary.
In the 1980s, many changes were taking place. A new general aviation facility opened and a new air cargo terminal was completed for all operations. Parking facilities were also expanded. Even the name of the supervising body changed in 1988 - from Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority to Norfolk Airport Authority.
Changes continued throughout the 1990s as Norfolk International prepared for growth. The air cargo terminal and parking facilities expanded and public areas of the passenger terminal were renovated. In 1991, Norfolk International completed a new concourse extension providing 10 additional gates, for a total of 24 gates. A new state-of-the-art fire station and new FAA air traffic control tower facility also began operation.
The airport's largest capital improvement project, Arrival 2002, was completed in June 2002. The $133 million project included a new [tpl]convert|243000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] arrivals building with an automated baggage handling system; a 2,850-space covered parking garage; runway and taxiway rehabilitation and upgrades; main terminal lobby refurbishment; and a new food/beverage and retail concession program.
The terminal building, the 1991 concourse expansion, and the Arrival 2002 project were all designed by Shriver & Holland AssociatesProjects - Shriver and Holland Associates
In 2013, Norfolk International Airport will recognize and celebrate its 75th anniversary of offering air travel services to passengers.

==Facilities and aircraft==

Norfolk International Airport covers an area of 1,300 acres (526 ha) at an elevation of 27 feet (8 m) above mean sea level. Airfield facilities consist of a main runway designated 5-23 which is 9,001 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m) and a crosswind runway designated 14-32 which is 4,875 by 150 feet (1,486 x 46 m). These facilities allow operations to nearly all commercial aircraft types.
The crosswind runway's (14-32) was closed for renovations on December 19, 2009 and reopened in Spring 2011. Eventually however, the airport's long-term plan calls for this runway to be destroyed to make way for a new parallel runway (5R-23L) east of existing runway 5-23.
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 91,906 aircraft operations, an average of 251 per day: 36% air taxi, 35% scheduled commercial, 28% general aviation, and 1% military. At that time there were 95 aircraft based at this airport: 54% single-engine, 28% multi-engine, 16% jet, and 2% helicopter.
General aviation services, or fixed based operations, are provided by Landmark Aviation with full-service facilities for maintaining and housing private and corporate aircraft. The modern [tpl]convert|54000|sqft|m2|sing=on[/tpl] terminal facility offers everything from aircraft rental to sightseeing flights and aircraft repair.
