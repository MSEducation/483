S'Archittu (Translation: "the little arch," in the Sardinian language) is a small coastal tourist resort near Oristano (Sardinia, Italy), part of the municipality of Cuglieri.

==Toponym==

The locality takes its name from the rock arch (S'Archittu) which encloses the beach, easily reachable by walk via a footway; during summer nights the arch is illuminated.
From the top of the Arch people usually dives and the back side of it was the location of an event of the 2001 High Dive World Championship.http://edicola.unionesarda.it/print.aspx?Id=560548&ty=a
The arch, circa 15 metres tall, is a result of marine erosion of an ancient cave formed by limestone, marl and fossils.http://www.sardegnaambiente.it/j/v/152?s=24955&v=2&c=1557&t=1

Approximately 1Â km to the south of S'Archittu is Torre del Pozzo ("The Well's Tower), itself within the municipal territory of Cuglieri too, with its Is Arenas beach, which is more than seven km long, and flanked by the largest marine pine forest in Europe engulfing a world-renowned golf-club.  The marine pine trees were planted back in the Sixties, but the forest developed into a truly amazing natural spectacle beyond anybody's expectations. Centuries ago, the tower served as a watch tower to safe-guard the island from marauding invaders from the sea, and the well is a natural vertical tunnel not far from the tower, dug through limestone and sandstone by the sea.  It gushes sea water when the Mistral blows with gale force, from the north-west all the way down from the Massif Central in France.
Noteworthy of the area is also its lush Mediterranean vegetation.  The roads are also lined with local cactus trees (Opuntia ficus-indica) bearing very flavoury Indian figs; these are best eaten when ripe after the rain.  They can be picked using a cane which has been cut with deep slits at one end and provided with a small stone fitted at the centre of the three resulting wooden tongues that are thus spread apart to form a claw-like tip.
Travellers can reach it from Oristano and Bosa by bus, and accommodation is provided by a number of B&Bs and three camping sites.  Victuals are galore at the many restaurants punctuating that stretch of coastline.
