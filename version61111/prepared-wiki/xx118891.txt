==Background==

Work on the design of the VP-1, was completed between 1966 and 1968, the intention being that the design would be simple to build for a novice working at home.  The design was successful and following a first flight in September 1968 a large number of aircraft have been constructed by homebuilders.  The aircraft are powered by converted Volkswagen air cooled engines. 
The VP-1 is a single seat open cockpit low-wing monoplane manufactured from Spruce and plywood with fabric covered wings. Performance is typically a cruise speed of [tpl]convert|75|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and a stall speed of [tpl]convert|40|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Following the success of the VP-1 a two seat variant, the VP-2 was designed and the first example flew in 1971. The VP-2 is externally similar in appearance to the VP-1 but with a [tpl]convert|1|ft|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] wider fuselage to accommodate two side-by-side configuration seats. The aircraft is [tpl]convert|1|ft|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] longer and has a [tpl]convert|3|ft|m|1|abbr=on[/tpl] addition to wingspan. The VP-2 can use any Volkswagen air-cooled engine model from 1834 to 2100 cc.
