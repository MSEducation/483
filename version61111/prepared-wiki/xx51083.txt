Kobe Bean Bryant (born August 23, 1978) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He entered the NBA directly from high school, and has played for the Lakers his entire career, winning five NBA championships. Bryant is a 16-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, and 12-time member of the All-Defensive team. [tpl]As of|March 2013[/tpl], he ranks third and fourth[tpl]cite web|author=Kelly Dwyer|title=Kobe Bryant passes Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/kobe-bryant-passes-wilt-chamberlain-become-fourth-leading-033539487--nba.html|work=Yahoo! Sports|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=March 31, 2013[/tpl] on the league's all-time postseason scoring and all-time regular season scoring lists, respectively.
Bryant enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at Lower Merion High School, where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country. He declared his eligibility for the NBA Draft upon graduation, and was selected with the 13th overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft by the Charlotte Hornets, then traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest.
Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002. A heated feud between the duo and a loss in the 2004 NBA Finals was followed by O'Neal's trade from the Lakers after the 2003–04 season. Following O'Neal's departure Bryant became the cornerstone of the Los Angeles Lakers franchise. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons, setting numerous scoring records in the process. In 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, the second most points scored in a single game in NBA history, second only to Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. He was awarded the regular season's Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the 2008 NBA Finals, Bryant led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, earning the NBA Finals MVP Award on both occasions.
At 34 years and 104 days of age, Bryant became the youngest player in league history to reach 30,000 career points. He is also the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. Since his second year in the league, Bryant has been selected to start every All-Star Game. He has won the All-Star MVP Award four times (2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011), tying him for the most All Star MVP Awards in NBA history. At the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won gold medals as a member of the USA national team. Sporting News and TNT named Bryant the top NBA player of the 2000s.
In 2003, Bryant was accused of sexual assault after having sex with a hotel employee in Edwards, Colorado. In September 2004, prosecutors dropped the case after his accuser refused to testify. A civil suit was later filed and settled out of court.

==Early life and education==

Bryant was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the youngest of three children and the only son of former Philadelphia 76ers player and former Los Angeles Sparks head coach Joe "Jellybean" Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He is also the maternal nephew of John "Chubby" Cox.

==NBA career==

===1996 NBA draft===

The first guard to ever be taken out of high school, Bryant was chosen as the 13th overall draft pick by the Charlotte Hornets in 1996.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espndb.go.com/nba/finals/profile/_/id/110/type/player/kobe-bryant |title=Kobe Bryant Bio – NBA Finals – ESPNDB |publisher=Espndb.go.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010[/tpl] According to Arn Tellem, Bryant's agent at the time, Bryant playing for the Charlotte Hornets was "an impossibility".[tpl]cite news |last=Robert |first=Selena |url=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/sports/29roberts.html |title=Destination Portland: A Big Man, a Small Place |work=New York Times |work=Sports |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=December 6, 2008[/tpl] However, Bill Branch, the Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft selection to the Lakers before picking Bryant.

During his rookie season, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel.[tpl]cite journal |last=Edited by Ashyia Henderson. |title=Kobe Bryant. |journal=Contemporary Black Biography |year=2008 |publisher=Gale Group, 2001; Reproduced in Biography Resource Center.

The Lakers however, only won 56 games, an 11-game drop off from last year. The Lakers would respond by going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, and San Antonio Spurs, before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in OT. They would go on to win the next 4 games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyfR2pDOt3k |title=Kobe Bryant greatest games (2001 playoffs): 36pts 9rbds 8asts in game 3 vs Spurs |publisher=YouTube |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2010[/tpl] Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the 3rd year in a row (no game in 1999).
In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. He also had a career high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. While making the All-Star team and All-NBA Defensive team again, he was also promoted to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second place in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings.

The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had the previous year. While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1, the Lakers did not have home court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to 7 games, the first time this happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals, Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the teams points.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/02playoffs/2002-06-14-kobe.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bryant's heroics, deference pay off for Lakers | date=June 14, 2002 | accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl] At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.

===Coming up short (2002–04)===

In the 2002–03 season, Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career highs to that point. Bryant was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive 1st teams, and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers foundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs in six games.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2003/series?series=lalsas |title=NBA Playoffs 2003 – Los Angeles Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs |publisher=ESPN.com |accessdate=June 23, 2008[/tpl]

===Setting records and playoffs disappointments (2004–07)===

Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Phil Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has a number of criticisms of Bryant.

===Sexual assault allegation===

In the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of Eagle, Colorado, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser, but denied her sexual assault allegation.[tpl]cite news |last=SI Staff |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/basketball/nba/12/26/kobe.interview.ap/index.html?cnn-yes |date=December 23, 2003 |title=Bryant distracted, scared amid sex assault case |agency=Associated Press |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 25, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2004-02-12-shaq-kobe_x.htm |title=Shaq, Kobe still main keys to Lakers' fortunes |first=David Leon |last=Moore |date=February 12, 2004 |work=USA Today |accessdate=February 25, 2007 [/tpl]
The accusation tarnished Bryant's reputation, as the public's perception of Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with McDonald's and Nutella were terminated.

Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa: "Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/02/MNG6E8IB861.DTL |title=Bryant rape case ends in dismissal |first=T.R. |last=Reid |date=September 2, 2004 |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Prosecutors Drop Kobe Bryant Rape Case |author=Kirk Johnson |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/02/national/02kobe.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 2, 2004 |accessdate=July 2, 2011[/tpl] The accuser filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public.

===Music===

In high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film Kid with the Golden Arm. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant's youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway & King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight's "Hold Me". Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O'Neal's Respect, starting the track "3 X's Dope", though Bryant's name was not listed on the credits.[tpl]cite news|last=Golianopoulos|first=Thomas|title=The Secret History of Kobe Bryant's Rap Career|date=April 12, 2013|work=grantland.com|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9161188/the-secret-history-kobe-bryant-failed-attempt-rap-career|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FpZJ4Iqh|archivedate=April 12, 2013|deadurl=no[/tpl]
Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of underground hip hop into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, Visions, was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, "K.O.B.E'", featured supermodel Tyra Banks singing the hook. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month; the song was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant's other backers had mostly abandoned him. Afterwards, Bryant co-founded an independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded within a year.
