==History==

Tijuana zebras have been a popular tourist attraction in Tijuana, Mexico, a city that borders the United States, since the 1940s.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
The Tijuana painted donkey, or Tijuana Zebra, came about some time in the middle of the twentieth century. The reason for painting the donkeys was to ensure that the animal be seen in photographs. Since the donkeys were mostly white, on sunny days with the old black and white cameras the donkey would be seen as a ghostly figure.  A long-time tourist staple, the donkeys live on a hillside below the Casa de la Cultura in Tijuana.
