==Description==

The cell diameter is of 0.8-1.0 micrometres. The bacterium is red to reddish-brown in colour and formed a distinct red bacterial mat in the natural environment. It is able to grow photoheterotrophically under anaerobic light conditions and also chemoheterotrophically under aerobic dark conditions. Optimal growth conditions for this organism are 50 degrees C and pH 7.5-8.0. Its type strain is HLO8T (= DSM 13941T = JCM 11240T).
