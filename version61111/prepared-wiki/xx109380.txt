==Controversy==

===Media skepticism===

On January 8, 2006, The Smoking Gun website published an article called "A Million Little Lies: Exposing James Frey's Fiction Addiction", alleging that Frey fabricated large parts of his memoirs, including details about his criminal record.[tpl]cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0104061jamesfrey1.html |title=A Million Little Lies – January 8, 2006 |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12[/tpl] One incident in the book that came under particular scrutiny was a 1986 train-automobile collision in St. Joseph Township, Michigan.A Million Little Lies – January 8, 2006
The website alleged that Frey had never been incarcerated and that he greatly exaggerated the circumstances of a key arrest detailed in the memoir: hitting a police officer with his car, while high on crack, which led to a violent melee with multiple officers and an 87-day jail sentence. In the police report that TSG uncovered, Frey was held at a police station for no more than five hours before posting a bond of a few hundred dollars for some minor offenses. The arresting officer, according to TSG, recalled Frey as having been polite and cooperative.
The book's hardcover (Doubleday) and paperback (Anchor Books) publishers initially stood by Frey, but examination of the evidence caused the publishers to alter their stances. They released a statement noting, "When the Smoking Gun report appeared, our first response, given that we were still learning the facts of the matter, was to support our author. Since then, we have questioned him about the allegations and have sadly come to the realization that a number of facts have been altered and incidents embellished."[tpl]cite web|last=Burroughs |first=Augusten |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385507755 |title=A Million Little Pieces (9780385507752): James Frey: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011[/tpl] As a consequence, the publishers decided to include a publisher's note and an author's note from Frey as disclaimers to be included in future publications.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl]
The Minneapolis Star Tribune had questioned Frey's claims as early as 2003. Frey responded by saying, "I've never denied I've altered small details."[tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] In a May 2003 interview, Frey claimed that his publisher had fact-checked his first book. He stated, "The only things I changed were aspects of people that might reveal their identity. Otherwise, it's all true."
On January 11, 2006, Frey appeared with his mother on Larry King Live on CNN. He defended his work while claiming that all memoirs alter minor details for literary effect. Frey consistently referred to the reality of his addiction, which he said was the principal point of his work. Oprah Winfrey called in at the end of the show defending the essence of Frey's book and the inspiration it provided to her viewers, but said she relied on the publisher to assess the book's authenticity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200510/tows_past_20051026.jhtml |title=Oprah Winfrey's Official Website – Live Your Best Life |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011[/tpl]

===Live confrontation with Oprah===

As more accusations against the book continued to surface, Winfrey invited Frey on her show. She wanted to hear from him directly whether he had lied to her (and her viewers) or "simply" embellished minor details, as he had told Larry King. Frey admitted to several of the allegations against him. He acknowledged that The Smoking Gun had been accurate when the website reported that Frey had only spent a few hours in jail rather than the 87 days Frey claimed in his memoirs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200601/20060126/slide_20060126_350_102.jhtml |title=Oprah Winfrey's Official Website – Live Your Best Life |publisher=Oprah.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011[/tpl]
Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher Nan Talese to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir. Talese admitted that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as "brutally honest" in a press release.
David Carr of the New York Times wrote, "Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs".[tpl]cite news | last =Carr | first =David | title =How Oprahness trumped truthiness |work=The New York Times | date =January 30, 2006 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | accessdate =October 5, 2007 [/tpl] "Oprah annihilated Frey", proclaimed Larry King.[tpl]cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/01/lkl.01.html |publisher=CNN | accessdate=May 5, 2010 | title=CNN.com[/tpl] New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote, "It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into Swift boating and swift bucks, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying",[tpl]cite news | last =Dowd | first =Maureen | title =Oprah's Bunk Club |work=The New York Times | date =January 8, 2006 | url =http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | accessdate =October 5, 2007 [/tpl] and the Washington Post's Richard Cohen was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey "Mensch of the Year".[tpl]cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.

===Aftermath===

On January 31, 2006, it was announced that Frey had been dropped by his literary manager, Kassie Evashevski of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, over matters of trust. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Evashevski said that she had "never personally seen a media frenzy like this regarding a book before". Though she will no longer be representing him, when asked to reflect on Frey's future as a writer, she stated, "I still believe he's a very talented writer and suspect we haven't heard the last of James Frey."
On February 1, 2006, Random House published Frey's note to the reader which was subsequently included in later editions of the book. In the note, Frey apologized for fabricating portions of his book and for having made himself seem "tougher and more daring and more aggressive than in reality I was, or I am." He added, "People cope with adversity in many different ways, ways that are deeply personal...My mistake...is writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience". Frey admitted that he had literary reasons for his fabrications as well: "I wanted the stories in the book to ebb and flow, to have dramatic arcs, to have the tension that all great stories require". He also said memoirists had a right to draw upon their memories, in addition to documents, in creating their written works.James Frey Admits Memoir's Alterations[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]
On February 24, 2006, Frey's publicist revealed that Penguin imprint Riverhead had dropped out of a two-book, seven-figure deal with Frey. Riverhead had previously published Frey's bestselling 2005 book, My Friend Leonard.
On September 12, 2006, Frey and publisher Random House, Inc. reached a tentative legal settlement, whereby readers who felt that they had been defrauded by Frey's A Million Little Pieces would be offered a refund. In order to receive the refund, customers had to submit a proof of purchase, pieces of the book itself (page 163 from the hardcover or the front cover from the paperback), and complete a sworn statement indicating that they had purchased the book under the assumption that it was a memoir.[tpl]cite news |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14715706/ |title=Frey, Publisher Settle Suits Over 'Pieces' |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=September 14, 2006[/tpl]
On July 28, 2007, at a literary convention in Texas, Nan Talese blasted Oprah Winfrey for being "mean and self-serving", having a "holier-than-thou" attitude as well as having "fiercely bad manners" during Winfrey's debate against Talese and James Frey on January 26, 2006. Talese said she and Frey had been led to believe the show was going to be a panel discussion on "Truth in America". Just before air time, both Talese and Frey were told the topic of the show had been changed to "The James Frey Controversy". According to Talese, at the end of the show, Oprah pulled Frey aside and said "I know it was rough, but it's just business". Talese stated that Oprah needed to apologize for her behavior on the show. However, Joyce Carol Oates said, "This is an ethical issue which can be debated passionately and with convincing arguments on both sides. In the end, Oprah Winfrey had to defend her own ethical standards of truth on her television program, which was courageous of her". Talese was unapologetic about publishing Frey's A Million Little Pieces and commented that the book had great value for anyone who must deal with a loved one who is an addict.[tpl]cite news |work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648140,00.html?cnn=yes |title=Oprah vs. James Frey: The Sequel |accessdate=July 30, 2007 | date=July 30, 2007[/tpl]

Following the events of Frey's Oprah appearance, South Park created a parody of the events with their character Towelie, entitled "A Million Little Fibers".

===Full Fathom Five===

In 2009, Frey formed Full Fathom Five, a young adult novel publishing company that aimed to create highly commercial novels like Twilight. In November 2010, controversy arose when an MFA student who had been in talks to create content for the company released her extremely limiting contract online. The contract allows Frey license to remove an author from a project at any time, does not require him to give the author credit for their work, and only pays a standard advance of $250. A New York magazine article entitled "James Frey's Fiction Factory" gave more details about the company, including information about the highly successful "Lorien Legacies" series, a collaboration between MFA student Jobie Hughes and Frey. The article details how Frey removed Hughes from the project, allegedly during a screaming match between the two authors. In the article, Frey is accused of abusing and using MFA students as cheap labor to churn out commercial young adult books.[tpl]cite web|last=Mozes |first=Suzanne |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/69474/ |title=Inside Full Fathom Five, James Frey's Young-Adult-Novel Assembly Line – New York Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=June 18, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/11/read_the_brutal_contract_from.html |title=Read the Brutal Contract from James Frey’s Fiction Factory – Daily Intel |publisher=Nymag.com |accessdate=June 18, 2011[/tpl]

==Lawsuit settlement==

On November 2, 2007, the Associated Press published a story about a judgment in favor of readers who felt deceived by Frey's claims of A Million Little Pieces being a memoir. Although the publisher, Random House, had set aside $2.35 million for lawsuits, only 1,729 readers came forward to receive a refund for the book. The refund offer was extended to anyone who had purchased the book prior to Frey's disclosing the falsehoods therein. The total claimants' refunds issued only came to $27,348. Chicago lawyer, Larry D. Drury, defending the plaintiff received approximately $1.3 million will be spent in legal fees, distribution of the legal notice, and charitable donations to three charities, while readers received $27,348. The publisher also agreed to provide a disclosure at the beginning of the book, citing the somewhat fictitious nature of the text.[tpl]cite news |publisher=Fox News |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307837,00.html |title=Judge Approves 'A Million Little Pieces' Refund Settlement for Disgruntled Readers |accessdate=November 3, 2007 | date=November 2, 2007[/tpl]
