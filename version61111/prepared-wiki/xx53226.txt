[[Proinsulin]]

CATEGORIES: Peptides, Diabetes

Proinsulin is the prohormone precursor to insulin made in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, specialized regions of the pancreas. In humans, proinsulin is encoded by the INS gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: INS insulin| url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3630| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author = Bell GI, Pictet RL, Rutter WJ, Cordell B, Tischer E, Goodman HM | title = Sequence of the human insulin gene | journal = Nature |volume = 284 | issue = 5751 | pages = 26–32 |date=March 1980 | pmid = 6243748 | doi = 10.1038/284026a0 | url = | issn = [/tpl]

==Synthesis and post-translational modification==

Proinsulin is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is folded and its disulfide bonds are oxidized. It is then transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is packaged into secretory vesicles, and where it is processed by a series of proteases to form mature insulin. Mature insulin has 35 fewer amino acids; 4 are removed altogether, and the remaining 31 form the C-peptide. The C-peptide is abstracted from the center of the proinsulin sequence; the two other ends (the B chain and A chain) remain connected by disulfide bonds.

==Immunogenicity==

When insulin was originally purified from bovine or porcine pancreata, all the proinsulin was not fully removed.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wilson RM, Douglas CA, Tattersall RB, Reeves WG | title = Immunogenicity of highly purified bovine insulin: a comparison with conventional bovine and highly purified human insulins | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 667–70 |date=September 1985 | pmid = 3905477 | doi = 10.1007/BF00291973[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.endotext.org/diabetes/diabetes17/diabetes17.htm | title = Insulin Pharmacology, Type of Regimens and Adjustments  | author = Tanyolac S, Goldfine ID, Kroon L | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = Endotext.com | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2011-03-18 [/tpl] When some people used these insulins, the proinsulin may have caused the body to react with a rash, to resist the insulin, or even to make dents or lumps in the skin at the place where the insulin was injected.  This can be described as an iatrogenic injury due to slight differences between the proinsulin of different species.  Since the late 1970s, when highly-purified porcine insulin was introduced, and the level of insulin purity reached 99%, this ceased to be a significant clinical issue.[tpl]cite journal | author = Home PD, Alberti KG | title = The new insulins.
