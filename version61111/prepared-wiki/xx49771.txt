Middlesex University (abbr. MU or MDX) is a university in Hendon, North London, England. It is located within the historic county boundaries of Middlesex from which it takes its name. It is one of the new universities and is a member of Million+ working group. As is the case with many former polytechnics, Middlesex was formally organised as a teaching institution in 1973, yet can trace its history back to 19th century.
Since 2000, the university has been reducing the number of campuses dotted around London’s North Circular Road in an effort to cut costs and provide a better student experience by consolidating most of the university at the flagship campus in Hendon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/Strategy/estate_strategy/campus/index.aspx|title=Campus development|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] As of the 2013 academic year, its estate strategy which has cost £150 million has now concentrated the university on one site in north London.
In 2012 the university re-structured its academic schools in order to align them more closely with the needs of industry. Courses at Middlesex are now delivered by the schools of Business, Law, Art and Design, Health and Education, Media and Performing Arts and Science and Technology, alongside the university’s Institute for Work Based Learning.

==History==

The university grew out of merger between different schools and colleges in North London. Perhaps the most prominent and one of the oldest of its constituent establishments is the Hornsey College of Art, founded in 1882. Other institutions include Ponders End Technical Institute (founded in 1901) and Hendon Technical Institute (founded in 1939). All three institutions were successfully amalgamated to form Middlesex Polytechnic in January 1973. 
Before becoming a university in 1992, Middlesex expanded further by joining three more colleges in north London. While continuing to grow through mergers with other educational institutions in the 1990s, the university has also begun developing its international presence, by opening its regional offices in continental Europe. As of July 2011, it has been operating 21 such offices across the globe.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Middlesex on your doorstep: No matter where you are|journal=More Middlesex|issue=1|page=12|publisher=Middlesex University|date=July 2011|url=http://alumni.mdx.ac.uk/document.doc?id=20[/tpl]
Since 2000, the university launched a major restructuring programme, which, specifically, translated into a total image rebrand in 2003, the closure of a number of campuses over 2005–2012, the expansion of other campuses and generally the consolidation of the university's activities on fewer, bigger campuses in north London.

===Restructuring===

In May 2001 the university appointed C Eye, a branding consultancy, to design a new logo for the University.[tpl]cite news|last=Cheevers|first=Brandon|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/middlesex-university-to-consider-total-rebrand/1128075.article|title=Middlesex University to consider total rebrand|work=Design Week|date=7 June 2001|accessdate=26 July 2009[/tpl] In 2003 the previous "M" logo was replaced with a new red-coloured wavy line that is supposed to express a flexible and responsive approach to the needs of students.[tpl]cite news|last=Lipsett|first=Anthea|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=191548&sectioncode=26|title='Dull' Birmingham recruits troops for market battle|work=Times Higher Education|date=1 October 2004|accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/WWW/STUDY/GLOFIG.HTM|archiveurl=http://archive.is/WLbwl|archivedate=29 July 2007|title=Pictures, shape and design|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] [tpl]Verify credibility|date=July 2009[/tpl]
Following the review of the sustainability of its academic programmes, the university implemented a string of cost-containment adjustments over 2005–2006. Specifically, in late 2005 it decided to stop offering history courses in an attempt to reduce £10 million deficit that had built up.[tpl]cite news|last=Ford|first=Liz|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/13/highereducation.cutsandclosures|title=History is history at the university|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2006|accessdate=22 January 2014|location=London[/tpl] The decision, however, was met with considerable hostility from Middlesex's student union as well as from The National Union of Students. In other moves to save costs, the university made 175 voluntary redundancies, including 33 academic staff, a measure that was supposed to save £5 million.[tpl]cite news|last=Demopoulos|first=Katherine|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/dec/15/highereducation.cutsandclosures|title=Ailing Middlesex University makes 175 staff redundant|work=The Guardian|date=15 December 2005|accessdate=22 January 2014|location=London[/tpl]
Since 2000 Middlesex embarked on a new strategy to achieve ‘fewer, better campuses’ in order to reduce costs and improve the long-term sustainability of the university.[tpl]cite web|url=http://alumni.mdx.ac.uk/Page.aspx?pid=227|title=Special Projects|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=14 August 2009[/tpl] The strategy translated into the disposal of several small uneconomic arts campuses in Bedford, Hampstead and Wood Green and larger, but still uneconomic and unattractive campuses at Bounds Green, Enfield and Tottenham.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/Assets/corp_plan_09_14.pdf|title=Corporate Plan 2009–2014|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] The university has also closed the Corporate Services building at the North London Business Park and consolidated most of the functions carried out on these sites at Hendon, where it aims to accommodate nearly all its London based teaching.
In 2010, Middlesex announced the closure of its Philosophy department. The move was taken because the department was judged by the university to be not financially sustainable. This was despite the fact that Philosophy had been the highest ranking department in the university's latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) in 2008,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-middlesexuniversity/|title=RAE 2008 Middlesex University|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=22 January 2014 | work=The Guardian | location=London[/tpl] building on its grade of 5 in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise.[tpl]cite web|author=Bruce Nelson |url=http://www.planning.ed.ac.uk/research/rae2001/RAE2001UOA62.htm |title=RAE 2001 – results for unit of assessment 62 Philosophy |publisher=Planning.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=6 June 2010[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]  An international campaign of support was quickly organised, with figures such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Jean-Luc Nancy, Slavoj Žižek, Étienne Balibar, David Harvey, Isabelle Stengers and many others expressing their strong disapproval. Articles condemning the decision appeared in the national press[tpl]cite news|last=Power|first=Nina|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/29/philosophy-minorities-middleqsex-university-logic|title=A blow to philosophy, and minorities|work=The Guardian|date=29 April 2010|accessdate=22 January 2014|location=London[/tpl] and students protested actively on campus and elsewhere for the restitution of the department.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10185329|title=Rally over Middlesex University protesters' suspension|publisher=BBC News|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] In early June 2010 it was announced that the department's postgraduate component, the CRMEP, was to be transferred to Kingston University but the undergraduate programme still to be phased out.

==Campuses==

Over the past five years the university has consolidated most of its activities onto the Hendon campus in London with all teaching is located at Hendon from Autumn 2013. All older campuses were closed – Bounds Green (2003), Tottenham (2005), Enfield (2008), Cat Hill (2011), Trent Park (2012), and Archway and Hospitals (2013) - while Hendon received substantial investment in facilities and infrastructure to accommodate new students and programmes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/future/hendon/works/works.asp|archiveurl=http://archive.is/mwsPi|archivedate=6 March 2007|title=Hendon Development|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl]
Since 2004, the university has also been operating an overseas campus in Dubai and opened another one in Mauritius in October 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/news-events/news/mauritiuscampus.aspx|title=Mauritius Campus |publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl] In September 2013, Middlesex opened its third international campus in Malta.http://www.mdx.ac.uk/international/campuses/malta/index.aspx

===Current campuses===

====London: Hendon====

Hendon is set in a prime location of North West London, a short walk from Hendon Central tube station. Today's main (or college) building was built in the neo-Georgian style by H.W. Burchett and opened in 1939 as part of Hendon Technical Institute (aka Hendon College of Technology). The college was extended in 1955 and in 1969 when a new refectory and engineering block (the Williams Building) were added. The main building has been refurbished in a £40 million project, which included the addition of a glass-covered central courtyard forming Ricketts Quadrangle. In 2004 The new Learning Resource Centre, The Sheppard Library opened on the site. Hendon also has a sports club, known as The Fitness Pod for students and staff which has one of the few real tennis courts in the UK. Middlesex University Business School, Engineering & Information Sciences School and the bulk of the School of Health and Social Science are located in Hendon.
The campus in Hendon is expanding dramatically using a number of London Borough of Barnet office buildings including the current Town Hall in The Burroughs as well as the construction of new buildings including a new state of the art Science Building which opened in September 2008. The research centres for biomedical science, crime and conflict, and risk and environmental sciences are based here.
The university aims to achieve the consolidation of nearly all its London based teaching at Hendon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/strategy/docs/Corporate_Plan_2008_.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090207092605/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/strategy/docs/Corporate_Plan_2008_.pdf|archivedate=7 February 2009|title=Corporate Plan 2008–2013|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl]

===Former campuses===

====Archway and Hospitals====

This campus was closed in 2013, to help provide students with better facilities than those allowed by the old building at the Archway Campus.
Archway and Hospitals campus was primarily the domain of the School of Health and Social Sciences. It operated from four sites (hospitals): Royal Free Hospital, Whittington Hospital (jointly owned with UCL), Chase Farm and North Middlesex.
On 24 January 2007 the university inaugurated a new Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) Mental Health and Social Work based at Archway campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/hssc/cetl/opening.asp|title=CETL – Official opening, 24 Jan 2007|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] CETL status was bestowed on the Mental Health and Social Work Academic Group at the university in partnership with the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health in 2005.[tpl]cite press release|title=Archway Campus Newsletter|publisher=University College London|date=April 2006|url=http://www.archway.ac.uk/campus-newsletter/newsletter-april-06.pdf#page=13|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] Consequently the Centre was awarded a capital grant of £1.4 million along with an annual revenue of £350,000 for five years, representing one of the largest ever funding initiatives by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2005/05_17/05_17.doc|title=Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning: Outcomes and funding allocations|publisher=Higher Education Funding Council for England|accessdate=3 August 2009[/tpl] This funding enabled the university to establish new teaching facilities at its Archway campus with the aim of creating an academic community of mental health and social work practitioners, students and faculty in one location.

====Trent Park====

Trent Park campus was closed in 2012 and all departments were moved to the main campus in Hendon. This campus was set within a [tpl]convert|413|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] country park, which was originally a fourteenth-century hunting ground of Henry IV. The focus of the campus was a palatial mansion, designed by Sir William Chambers in the 18th century. After the Second World War, the Ministry of Education used the house as an emergency teacher training centre, which became a residential teacher training college, called Trent Park College of Education in 1951.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.enfield.gov.uk/info/1000000439/enfield_parks/986/trent_country_park/5|title=Trent Park|publisher=Enfield Council|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] In 1974 the college was incorporated into Middlesex Polytechnic.
In 2012 around 16% of Middlesex students were based at Trent Park campus. The university’s Summer School, which accounts for 0.2% of Middlesex students, also took place here.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/newsevents/factsandfigures.asp#campus|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090915181149/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/newsevents/factsandfigures.asp|archivedate=15 September 2009|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Middlesex University|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] The university had ambitious plans to redevelop the site, but they were twice rejected by Enfield Council on environmental concerns.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/4082904.Students_under_one_roof|title=Students under one roof|first=Kevin|last=Bradford|publisher=Enfield Independent|date=28 January 2009|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/9509631.Greek_free_school_bids_to_use_Trent_Park_university_buildings/|title=Greek free school bids to use Trent Park Middlesex University buildings|first=David|last=Hardiman|publisher=Enfield Independent|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=22 January 2014[/tpl]

The Flood Hazard Research Centre is still part of Middlesex University but is now based at North London Business Park in New Southgate.

====Tottenham====

The campus was closed in summer 2005, its programmes of study having moved to the university's other campuses. What was the Tottenham campus started life as St Katharine's College, one of the first British teacher training colleges in 1878, later to become the College of All Saints, a Church of England college of higher education and a constituent college of the Institute of Education, University of London, for whose degrees it taught. The name change was a result of the 1964 union of St Katharine's with Berridge House, Hampstead, on the Tottenham site. The college expanded in the 1960s, although much of the campus retained its Victorian architecture. After the closer of the college and the union with Middlesex Polytechnic, the 'All Saints' campus was home to humanities and cultural studies, business studies, law, sociology and women's studies, all of which have been moved to other campuses. The buildings, previously occupied by the university, were eventually demolished and the site is now the home of the newly built Haringey Sixth Form Centre.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.haringey6.ac.uk/|title=Haringey Six Form Centre home page|publisher=Haringey Six From Centre|accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl] The College of All Saints Foundation continues as the All Saints Educational Trust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aset.org.uk/|title=All Saints Educational Trust home page|publisher=All Saints Educational Trust|accessdate=23 July 2009[/tpl]

====Bounds Green====

Bounds Green campus, home to the Engineering and Information Technology schools was sold to a residential developer in December 2003. It was used extensively for location shooting for the 1989 film, Wilt.

====Enfield====

The history of Enfield Campus began with the history of electric light. In 1901, Joseph Wilson Swan bought a house in Ponders End High Street that became the Ediswan Institute.Pam, D. (1977),The New Enfield: Stories of Enfield Edmonton and Southgate, a Jubilee History, London Borough of Enfield Libraries, Arts & Entertainment Dept Four years later Ediswan Institute was bought by Middlesex County Council and became the Ponders End Technical Institute. By 1937 The Ponders End Technical Institute was growing so rapidly that it was decided to build a new college across the road, in Queensway. Due to the Second World War, it was not completed until 1953, but the unfinished buildings were in use throughout the war. By now it was called Enfield Technical College, but in 1962 it was renamed Enfield College of Technology by the Ministry of Education. In 1973 the college formed part of Middlesex Polytechnic.
There are four major buildings on campus: Broadbent, Roberts building (or Tower Block), McCrae and Pascal. They are named after people who helped to create it.
The campus was closed in July 2008, and the majority of departments located here moved to the extended Hendon campus and some to the Archway Campus shared with UCL.

====Cat Hill====

In March 2011 Cat Hill campus was sold to the L&Q housing association as part of the university's plans to centralise its courses in Hendon.[tpl]cite news|last=Hardiman|first=David|url=http://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/8936296.New_homes_planned_for_Cat_Hill_campus/|title=New Homes Planned for Cat Hill Campus|work=Enfield Independent|date=28 March 2011|accessdate=30 March 2011|location=London, United Kingdom[/tpl] The campus closed in September 2011 and students moved to a new £80 million building on the university's Hendon campus.
Cat Hill Campus was located in Cockfosters. It was originally the illustrious Hornsey College of Art, founded in 1880. In the late 1970s the campus was extended to become the Faculty of Art & Design of the then Middlesex Polytechnic. Today, art and design, cinematics and electronic arts are located at Cat Hill. The campus also houses the university's Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture (MoDA) and formerly housed the national Lesbian and Gay Newsmedia Archive until it relocated to the Bishopsgate Institute in central London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/01/12/gay-and-lesbian-news-archive-moves-to-london/|title=Gay and lesbian news archive moves to London|publisher=Pink News|date=12 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] Cat Hill campus is also home to the Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts (named after John Lansdown), which runs a variety of graduate and undergraduate degrees in interactive media and electronic arts.

===Institute for Work Based Learning===

The Institute for Work Based Learning (or IWBL) pioneered the development of Work Based Learning at higher education level during the early 1990s. It grew out of Work Based Learning Research and Development Project, which was initially funded by the Department for Education and Employment over 1992–1994. This established Work Based Learning as a transdisciplinary field of study in which higher education qualifications could be awarded. Later, in 1993, The National Centre for Work Based Learning Partnerships (or NCWBLP) was founded and two years later – in 1995 – the first Work Based Learning Studies programmes were validated. In 1998 the University launched it's highly successful transdisciplinary Doctorate in Professional Studies (DProf), which now represents over a third of all the University's doctoral level programmes with around 300 candidates. 2005 Middlesex University was recognised as a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning for Work Based Learning by the Higher Education Academy and HEFCE awarded the University a grant of £3.5 million to share this excellent practice with the wider higher education sector.  In 2008 HEFCE awarded Middlesex University with a major grant of almost £8 million to support employer engagement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/econsoc/employer/projects/show.asp?id=40 |title=Workforce development projects |publisher=HEFCE |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] The funding allowed the University to establish Middlesex University Organisational Development Network (or MODNet), a centre of a national network of expertise in work-based learning.[tpl]cite press release|title=HEFCE funding will help Middlesex University expand support and career development opportunities for business sector personnel|publisher=Middlesex University|date=20 January 2009|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/40317391/HEFCE-funding-will-help-Middlesex-University-expand-support-and|accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl] Essentially, MODNet offers learning and development programmes co-designed with employers and acts as a ‘one-stop shop’, able to respond to all employer training needs, drawing on partner expertise where appropriate.
In December 2011 the Government's Higher Apprenticeships Fund awarded the Institute with nearly £1.5m to develop Higher Level Apprenticeships in the construction industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/news-events/news/construction-apprenticeships.aspx |title=Construction apprenticeships |publisher=Mdx.ac.uk |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] As one of only two Universities to lead Higher Apprenticeship projects, Middlesex has to date developed work-based higher education programmes for four Higher Apprenticeship frameworks and has worked in construction, care management, retail management and aviation sectors.
Today the university runs Work Based Learning Centres in Athens, Ireland, Hong Kong and Malaysia and has received Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education for its role in integrating formal education and employment.
