HD 125612 is a yellow main sequence star located approximately 180 light years away in the constellation Virgo. It is rich in heavy elements and has three known planets in orbit around it. A red dwarf companion star was detected in 2009 at a projected separation of 4750 AU. The possibility of a much closer companion to the primary star was also suggested, though this will need more observation to better define.
