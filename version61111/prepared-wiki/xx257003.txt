St. Anthony of Padua Church is a Roman Catholic parish church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, located at 822 East 166th Street, Bronx, New York City in the neighborhood of Morrisania, near Prospect Avenue. The present church was built through the concerted efforts of pastor, the Rt. Rev. Joseph Francis Rummel (1876-1964), who was elevated as the bishop of the Diocese of Omaha, Nebraska (1928-1935) and in that capacity consecrated the church, before being elevated to archbishop of the Archdiocese of New Orleans (1935-1964).

Nevertheless, the German-Americans wanted their own church. Interestingly, a parish of the same dedication in Manhattan, St. Anthony of Padua's Church (Manhattan), (established in 1866) was declared the national parish of the Italian-American community in Manhattan.
