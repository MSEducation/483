The Quebec general election of 1875 was held on July 7, 1875 to elect members of the 3rd Legislative Assembly for the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Conservative Party, led by Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville, defeated the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière.
However, Boucher de Boucherville was deposed in 1878 by Lieutenant Governor Luc Letellier de Saint-Just over a conflict about railway legislation that the Lieutenant Governor refused to approve.  Letellier then called on leader of the Opposition Joly de Lotbinière to form a government.
