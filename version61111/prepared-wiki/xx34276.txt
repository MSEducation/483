</ref> Off-screen photographs, known as [[tele-snaps]], were taken of many first and second series stories including some of the missing episodes. These were published in Mark Ward's ''Out of the Unknown: A guide to the legendary BBC series'' in 2004. The fourth series episodes “The Last Witness” and “The Uninvited”, both of which are missing, were remade as episodes of ''[[Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense]]'' - respectively as “A Distant Scream” and “In Possession” - and broadcast in the UK in 1986. A new adaptation of John Wyndham's ''Random Quest'', which had been dramatised for series three and had also been adapted as the film ''Quest for Love'', was made for [[BBC Four]] and broadcast on 27 November 2006 as part of that channel's ''Science Fiction Britannia'' season.<ref>

Out of the Unknown has as of 2007 never been released on VHS or DVD. The episode Level 7 was shown at the British Film Institute South Bank in August 2009, while the episode “Thirteen to Centaurus” was repeated by BBC Four in 2003 as part of a J.G. Ballard retrospective.[ref]

The BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, a public appeal campaign, continues to search for lost episodes.
