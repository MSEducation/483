Since its construction, Tamarack has generated over $70 million in revenue.Porterfield, Mannix. "Manager, artisans defend Tamarack." Register-Herald Beckley 8 Jan. 2007. 12 Jan. 2007 http://www.register-herald.com/cnhi/registerherald/homepage/local_story_008230400.html?keyword=leadpicturestory

==Audit==

On January 8, 2007, a report from the West Virginia Performance Evaluation and Review Division (PERD) stated that Tamarack has been running a deficit for several years. According to the report, Tamarack costs the West Virginia Parkways, Economic Development and Tourism Authority, which operates the West Virginia Turnpike and Tamarack, $2 million to $2.5 million annually.

==Economic impact and contribution to the state==

Tamarack generates over $7.5 million per year from retail and food sales. It also provides about 150 jobs though direct employment at the facility. The $1.2 million payment for Tamarack's construction bonds were defeased (escrowed for payoff) in August 2009, significantly reducing the operating deficit.Suka, Alicia. "Money in the Bank to Pay Tamarack Bonds" State Journal, 18 Aug. 2009. http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=64906 In February 2009, the Tamarack Foundation released findings from a study conducted by Marshall University's Center for Business and Economic Research which showed that Tamarack contributed $18.6 million to the state’s economy during the 2008 fiscal year.Stanton, Audrey. "Tamarack’s economic impact huge, study shows" Register-Herald Beckley 24 Feb. 2009. http://www.register-herald.com/local/x519110530/Tamarack-s-economic-impact-huge-study-shows The study also points out that Tamarack supports 236 FTE jobs and is responsible for generating more than $750,000 per year in state and local taxes, not including over $400,000 per year in sales tax which is returned to the state.Marshall University Center for Business and Economic Research. "The Economic Impact of Tamarack" 31 Dec. 2008, pp. 9-10. http://206.212.0.81/cber/research/Tamarack01072009.pdf  The report can be read in its entirety here.
Many supporters criticized the PERD report as being biased, stating that Tamarack cannot be judged solely based on profit from Turnpike motorists.Byrd, Bill. "More than a storefront." Times West Virginian 11 Jan. 2007. 12 Jan. 2007  http://www.timeswv.com/local/local_story_009001544.html The report ignored sales to wholesalers and to other businesses, and also ignored derived economic benefits. Visitors to Tamarack increase tourism in the region, especially to attractions like New River Gorge and Winterplace Ski Resort, and utilize hotels, restaurants and gasoline stations in the Beckley region. The Tamarack Foundation, a private 501(c)(3) non-profit, operating as an adjunct to Tamarack, offers a wide range of programs for artists and craftspeople across the state.  These programs include business training, mentoring, education, professional development and enhanced business and marketing opportunities.".
Said Greg Barr, General Manager of the West Virginia Parkways Authority, which oversees Tamarack,[tpl]cquote2|"Tamarack is not just a business. That’s where they’re missing the mark. It’s there to support and nurture the artisan industry... It’s a benefit that should not be solely determined by what the bottom line of that bricks and mortar facility is." [/tpl]
Lawmakers do not intend to make any changes to Tamarack's operation, as it is an "incomparable showcase of mountain crafts and arts, it serves an important function for West Virginia"."Tamarack Center Important to W.Va.."
