==Plot==

The film takes place in Stockholm in 1982. It portrays the lives of three girls between twelve and thirteen years of age: Bobo, Klara and Hedvig. Ignored by their parents and considered strange by other people, the trio decide to start a punk band (something that only boys were doing at the time) despite agreeing that punk is dead.
Bobo and Klara, with short hair and looking like boys, start the band, and later ask Christian girl Hedvig, with long hair, to join. They convince her to have her hair cut too. Her mother is upset and threatens Bobo and Klara that she'll report this to the police. On the condition that from now on they go to church every week, she will let the matter rest. When they refuse she explains this is meant as a comparison; she claims that they demanded Hedvig to have her hair cut as a condition to be friends and to be allowed in the band. At school Hedvig avoids Bobo and Klara. They think that this is because she regrets having her hair cut and is angry at them, but in fact she is embarrassed by her mother's behaviour and assumes that Bobo and Klara are angry at her. This is quickly sorted out.
Bobo and Klara get into a quarrel about a boy from another band, who they both fancy. Hedvig convinces them to reconcile.
