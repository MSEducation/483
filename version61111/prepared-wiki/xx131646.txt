An orthography reform of the Armenian alphabet was conducted between 1922 and 1924 in Soviet Armenia. It was rejected by Armenian diaspora communities, which for the most part speak Western Armenian and continue to use the Classical Armenian orthography. Although it is barely practiced outside of Armenia and the Post-Soviet states (namely Georgia and Russia), it is the official orthography used in the Republic of Armenia. 

==History==

One of the most significant and successfully achieved policies of the former Soviet Union was the rise in the overall population's literacy which began in the early 1920s and, most probably, this urgent need was one of the reasons for reforming Armenian spelling. This and a variety of other educational reforms resulted in almost 90% literacy throughout the country by the early 1950s. Although the orthography of the Armenian language was changed by this reform, it is hardly plausible to assess this change as a simplification. In fact, some other nations of the former USSR changed their entire scripts from Arabic (Central Asian nations) and Latin (Moldova) to Cyrillic. However, it was a rather progressive step in the spirit of these historical developments in that it did not hinder the ability of all of the former Soviet nations to develop literature, education, research and science. These changes in the official Armenian language have helped Armenia to develop a progressive system of education and to flourish in literature and sciences as well. The original orthography is known today as the classical orthography ([tpl]lang-hy|դասական ուղղագրութիւն[/tpl] dasakan uġġagrut'yun), and sometimes referred to as Mashtotsian orthography ([tpl]lang|hy|մաշտոցյան ուղղագրություն[/tpl]), named after Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet in the AD 405.

==Social and political issues==

Since the establishment of the third Republic of Armenia in 1991, there has been a fringe movement in some Armenian academic circles to reinstate the Classical spelling as official policy in Armenia.[ref]

</ref>  However, neither the official circles nor general population or pedagogical and scientific communities in Armenia see either the expediency or the rationale of turning back an almost hundred year old reform and restituting the old orthographic rules <ref>[http://groong.usc.edu/ADconf/200205/ad-20020521.html ORTHOGRAPHY, STATE & DIASPORA: A Political Analyst's View on Unified Spelling Problem] by Haroutiun Khachatrian</ref>

==Regulations of Reformed Spelling==

In the cases where pronunciation has changed in the course of time, one should, today, write as one would speak. This issue concerns the letter pairs յ/հ, ու/վ and diphthongs ոյ/ույ, եա/յա, եօ/յո, իւ/յու.
The following, more complex changes are also made:
