==History==

The village was completely destroyed in World War I during what became the Battle of Pozières (23 July–7 August 1916), which was part of the Battle of the Somme. The village was subsequently rebuilt, and is now the site of several war memorials. The Australian flag flies over Pozières in recognition of the sacrifice of the ANZACs in the Battle of Pozières. Amongst the British and other Commonwealth forces who fought at Pozières, the Australians suffered over 5,000 killed, wounded or taken prisoner.
One of those killed, on 5 August, was the English composer George Butterworth, and in 2008[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl] the road between the town and Martinpuich was renamed [tpl]Lang|fr|Chemin George Butterworth[/tpl] (George Butterworth Lane; [tpl]Coord|50.041172|2.733112|type:landmark[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.images-en-somme.fr/chemin-george-sainton-kaye-butterworth-lane.html |title=Le chemin George Sainton Kaye Butterworth Lane |publisher=Images-en-somme.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl]
