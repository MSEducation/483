Suckdog or "Suckdog Circus" was an American underground band.   The core members were the married couple Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costes. The troupe toured every state in the continental United States for several years, performing a mix of wrestling, musical performances, film-screenings and general audience agitation. The heart of the Suckdog Circus were the noise music "operas" written by Costes and Carver which involved strange experimental fantasy stories with lots of blood, sex and audience agitation.
Other performers in the Suckdog Circus included Dame Darcy, Davey "OHIO" Highben, Coz the Shroom, Nick Zedd and Helen Suckpuppy.
Suckdog also recorded four albums: Rape GG (1988), Drugs are Nice (1989), Little Flowers Dying (1990) and Onward Suckdog Soldiers (1998). A DVD was released in 2005 by Nut Music entitled Drugs Are Nice: A Suckumentary 1988-2005 containing excerpts of various performances, music videos, short films, and commentary from Lisa Crystal Carver and friends.
