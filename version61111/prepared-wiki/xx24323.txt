The lifetime risk for developing a peptic ulcer is approximately 10%.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Snowden FM |title=Emerging and reemerging diseases: a historical perspective |journal=Immunol.

In Western countries the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infections roughly matches age (i.e., 20% at age 20, 30% at age 30, 80% at age 80 etc.). Prevalence is higher in third world countries where it is estimated at about 70% of the population, whereas developed countries show a maximum of 40% ratio. Overall, H. pylori infections show a worldwide decrease, more so in developed countries. Transmission is by food, contaminated groundwater, and through human saliva (such as from kissing or sharing food utensils).[tpl]Cite journal |author=Brown LM |title=Helicobacter pylori: epidemiology and routes of transmission. |journal=Epidemiol. Rev. |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=283–97 |year=2000 |pmid=11218379 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/2/283.long |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a018040[/tpl]
A minority of cases of H. pylori infection will eventually lead to an ulcer and a larger proportion of people will get non-specific discomfort, abdominal pain or gastritis.
Peptic ulcer disease had a tremendous effect on morbidity and mortality until the last decades of the 20th century, when epidemiological trends started to point to an impressive fall in its incidence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/meid:32219| title=Peptic ulcer disease |accessdate= 2010-06-18[/tpl] The reason that the rates of peptic ulcer disease decreased is thought to be the development of new effective medication and acid suppressants and the discovery of the cause of the condition, H. pylori.
In the United States about 4 million people have active peptic ulcers and about 350,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Four times as many duodenal ulcers as gastric ulcers are diagnosed. Approximately 3,000 deaths per year in the United States are due to duodenal ulcer and 3,000 to gastric ulcer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kurata JH, Haile BM |title=Epidemiology of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Clin Gastroenterol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=289–307 |date=May 1984 |pmid=6378441 [/tpl]

==History==

John Lykoudis, a general practitioner in Greece, treated patients for peptic ulcer disease with antibiotics, beginning in 1958, long before it was commonly recognized that bacteria were a dominant cause for the disease.[tpl]cite book |first1=Basil |last1=Rigas |first2=Efstathios D. |last2=Papavasassiliou |chapter=Ch. 7 John Lykoudis.

Helicobacter pylori was rediscovered in 1982 by two Australian scientists, Robin Warren and Barry J. Marshall as a causative factor for ulcers.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Marshall B.J. |title=Unidentified curved bacillus on gastric epithelium in active chronic gastritis |journal=Lancet |year=1983 |volume=1 |issue=8336 |pages=1273–75 |pmid=6134060 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(83)92719-8[/tpl] In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most gastric ulcers and gastritis were caused by colonization with this bacterium, not by stress or spicy food as had been assumed before.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Marshall B.J., Warren J.R. |title=Unidentified curved bacilli in the stomach patients with gastritis and peptic ulceration |journal=Lancet |year=1984 |volume=1 |issue=8390 |pages=1311–15 |pmid=6145023 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(84)91816-6[/tpl]
The H. pylori hypothesis was poorly received,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/content/slate/blogs/thewrongstuff/2010/09/09/stress_doesn_t_cause_ulers_or_how_to_win_a_nobel_prize_in_one_easy_lesson_barry_marshall_on_being_right.html |title=Stress Doesn't Cause Ulcers!

His symptoms disappeared after two weeks, but he took antibiotics to kill the remaining bacteria at the urging of his wife, since halitosis is one of the symptoms of infection.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Van Der Weyden MB, Armstrong RM, Gregory AT |title=The 2005 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine |journal=Med.

In 1997, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with other government agencies, academic institutions, and industry, launched a national education campaign to inform health care providers and consumers about the link between H. pylori and ulcers. This campaign reinforced the news that ulcers are a curable infection, and that health can be greatly improved and money saved by disseminating information about H. pylori.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ulcer/history.htm |title=Ulcer, Diagnosis and Treatment - CDC Bacterial, Mycotic Diseases |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl]
In 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and his long-time collaborator Dr. Warren "for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease." Professor Marshall continues research related to H. pylori and runs a molecular biology lab at UWA in Perth, Western Australia.
Some believed that mastic gum, a tree resin extract, actively eliminates the H. pylori bacteria.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Huwez FU, Thirlwell D, Cockayne A, Ala'Aldeen DA |title=Mastic gum kills Helicobacter pylori to the editor, not a peer-reviewed scientific article |journal=N.
