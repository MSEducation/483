Howard G. "Ward" Cunningham (born May 26, 1949) is an American computer programmer who developed the first wiki. A pioneer in both design patterns and Extreme Programming, he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994 and installed it on the website of his software consultancy, Cunningham & Cunningham (commonly known by its domain name, c2.com), on March 25, 1995, as an add-on to the Portland Pattern Repository.
He currently lives in Beaverton, Oregon, and is the Co-Creation Czar for CitizenGlobal.[tpl]cite web |title=OUR PROVEN LEADERSHIP TEAM |publisher=Citizen Global Website |url=http://www.citizenglobal.com/info/team |accessdate=2012-05-08[/tpl] He is Nike's first Code for a Better World Fellow.[tpl]cite news |url=http://events.sfgate.com/san-francisco-ca/events/show/200977186-nike-materials-index-open-data-hackathon |title=Nike Materials Index: Open Data Hackathon |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl]
He has authored a book about wikis, titled The Wiki Way, and also invented Framework for Integrated Tests. He was a keynote speaker at the first three instances of the WikiSym conference series on wiki research and practice.

==Ideas and inventions==

Cunningham is well known for a few widely disseminated ideas which he originated and developed. The most famous among these are the wiki and many ideas in the field of software design patterns. He owns the company Cunningham & Cunningham Inc., a consultancy that has specialized in object-oriented programming.
When asked in a 2006 interview with internetnews.com whether he considered patenting the wiki concept, he explained that he thought the idea "just sounded like something that no one would want to pay money for."[tpl]Citation |date=December 8, 2006 |title=Q&A with Ward Cunningham |publisher=internetnews.com |last=Kerner| first=Sean Michael |url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3648131| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/6BDliIRXj| archivedate =2012-10-07 [/tpl]
Cunningham is interested in tracking the number and location of wiki page edits as a sociological experiment and may even consider the degradation of a wiki page as part of its process to stability. "There are those who give and those who take. You can tell by reading what they write."[tpl]cite news |date=December 7, 2008 |title=Ward Cunningham, Lecture|publisher=Cyborg Camp Live Stream - Mogulus Live Broadcast |author=CubeSpace, Portland Oregon |url=http://cyborgcamp.blip.tv/#1564923[/tpl]
According to Steven McGeady, Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s, "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, itâ€™s to post the wrong answer."  McGeady dubbed this Cunningham's Law. Although Cunningham was referring to interactions on Usenet, the law has been used to describe how Wikipedia works.

===Patterns and extreme programming===

Cunningham has contributed to the practice of object-oriented programming, in particular the use of pattern languages and (with Kent Beck) the Class-Responsibility-Collaboration cards. He also contributes to the extreme programming software development methodology. Much of this work was done collaboratively on the first wiki site.
