Gestodene is a progestogen hormonal contraceptive.  Products containing gestodene include:

==Benefits==

Gestodene is androgenically neutral, meaning that contraceptive pills containing gestodene do not exhibit the androgenic side effects (e.g. acne, hirsutism, weight gain) often associated with second-generation contraceptive pills, such as those containing levonorgestrel.http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/antiandrogens.html
The synthetic estrogen dosage in third-generation contraceptive pills (including those containing gestodene) is lower than that in second-generation oral contraceptives, reducing the likelihood of weight gain, breast tenderness and migraine.[tpl] cite journal | author = Festin | title = Progestogens in combined oral contraceptives for contraception | journal = The WHO Reproductive Health Library | year = 2006 [/tpl]
Third-generation oral contraceptives are also suitable for use in patients with diabetes or lipid disorders because they have minimal impact on blood glucose levels and the lipid profile.[tpl] cite journal | author = Cerel-Suhl | title = Update on Oral Contraceptive Pills | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 2073–2084 | year = 1999 [/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Women who take oral contraceptives containing gestodene are 5.6 times as likely to develop thromboembolism than women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and 1.6 times as likely to develop thromboembolism compared to women taking oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lidegaard et al. | title = Risk of venous thromboembolism from use of oral contraceptives containing different progestogens and oestrogen doses | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2011 | doi= 10.1136/bmj.d6423 [/tpl]
