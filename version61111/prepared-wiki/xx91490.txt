Rosaura Andreu (1 January 1918 – 21 November 2010) was a Cuban-born actress who found wide fame in Puerto Rico as a children's television show host.
Andreu, who was a struggling actress in her country, left Cuba after the revolution, arriving in Puerto Rico during the Puerto Rican television's formation era. She became known to the children television viewers in such programs as Romper Room con Berta and others. During the 1970s, she became widely famous across her adopted island when the public television channel, WIPR-TV, started showing her programme, El Show de Titi Chagua (Auntie Chagua's Show).
The show had tough competition, such as WRIK/WLUZ's Sandra Zaiter show, WAPA-TV's El Show de Pacheco (with Joaquin Monserrat as Pacheco) and WKAQ-TV's El show del Tío Nobel (Uncle Nobel's Show). The four main children's shows in Puerto Rico at that era were shown at the same hour every weekday, to compete against each other as El Show de Tio Nobel also had Saturday and Sunday morning editions. However, her show stayed on the air until the middle 1980s, when WLUZ was sold and relaunched as WSTE in 1987. [tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
