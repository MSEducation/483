[[Capsaicin]]

CATEGORIES: Capsaicinoids

Capsaicin ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|æ|p|ˈ|s|eɪ|.|ɨ|s|ɪ|n[/tpl]; 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is an irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called capsaicinoids and are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.What Made Chili Peppers So Spicy? Talk of the Nation, 15 August 2008. Pure capsaicin is a volatile,  hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, crystalline to waxy compound.

==History==

The compound[ref]History of early research on capsaicin: 
In 1873 German pharmacologist Rudolf BuchheimRudolf Buchheim (1873) "Über die 'scharfen' Stoffe" (On the "hot" substance), Archiv der Heilkunde (Archive of Medicine), vol. 14, pages 1ff. See also: R. Buchheim (1872) "Fructus Capsici," Vierteljahresschrift fur praktische Pharmazie (Quarterly Journal for Practical Pharmacy), vol. 4, pages 507ff.; reprinted (in English) in: Proceedings of the American Pharmaceutical Association, vol. 22, pages 106ff (1873). (1820–1879) and in 1878 the Hungarian doctor Endre HőgyesEndre Hőgyes, "Adatok a paprika (Capsicum annuum) élettani hatásához" on the physiological effects of the pepper (Capsicum annuum), Orvos-természettudumányi társulatot Értesítője of the Medical Science Association  (1877); reprinted in:  Orvosi Hetilap Journal (1878), 10 pages.  Published in German as:  "Beitrage zur physiologischen Wirkung der Bestandtheile des Capiscum annuum (Spanischer Pfeffer)" on the physiological effects of components of Capsicum annuum (Spanish pepper), Archiv für Experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie, vol. 9, pages 117-130 (1878).  See:  http://www.springerlink.com/content/n54508568351x051/  . stated that "capsicol" (partially purified capsaicinF.A. Flückiger, Pharmakognosie des Pflanzenreiches ( Berlin, Germany: Gaertner's Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1891).) caused the burning feeling when in contact with mucous membranes and increased secretion of gastric acid.

==Capsaicinoids==

Capsaicin is the main capsaicinoid in chili peppers, followed by dihydrocapsaicin. These two compounds are also about twice as potent to the taste and nerves as the minor capsaicinoids nordihydrocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, and homocapsaicin. Dilute solutions of pure capsaicinoids produced different types of pungency; however, these differences were not noted using more concentrated solutions.
Capsaicin is believed to be synthesized in the interlocular septum of chili peppers by addition of a branched-chain fatty acid to vanillylamine; specifically, capsaicin is made from vanillylamine and 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl CoA.[tpl]cite journal | author = Fujiwake H., Suzuki T., Oka S., Iwai K. | year = 1980 | title = Enzymatic formation of capsaicinoid from vanillylamine and iso-type fatty acids by cell-free extracts of Capsicum annuum var. annuum cv.

Gang, ed., Recent Advances in Phytochemistry 41:  The Biological Activity of Phytochemicals (New York, New York:  Springer, 2011), pages 117-118. Biosynthesis depends on the gene AT3, which resides at the pun1 locus, and which encodes a putative acyltransferase.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Stewart C, Kang BC, Liu K, et al. |title=The Pun1 gene for pungency in pepper encodes a putative acyltransferase |journal=Plant J. |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=675–88 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15918882 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02410.x |url=[/tpl]
Besides the six natural capsaicinoids, one synthetic member of the capsaicinoid family exists. Vanillylamide of n-nonanoic acid (VNA, also PAVA) is used as a reference substance for determining the relative pungency of capsaicinoids.

==Natural function==

Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum.  The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.[tpl]cite web|author=New Mexico State University - College of Agriculture and Home Economics |title=Chile Information - Frequently Asked Questions |year=2005 |url=http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub |accessdate=May 17, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070504035555/http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub  |archivedate = May 4, 2007[/tpl]
The seeds of Capsicum plants are dispersed predominantly by birds: in birds, the TRPV1 channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sensitivity).  This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating.  Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it reproduce.[tpl]cite doi|10.1038/35086653[/tpl] There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent: the fungal pathogen Fusarium, which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce seed viability, is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality.
In 2006, it was discovered that the venom of a certain tarantula species activates the same pathway of pain as is activated by capsaicin; this was the first demonstrated case of such a shared pathway in both plant and animal anti-mammal defense.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Siemens J, Zhou S, Piskorowski R, et al. |title=Spider toxins activate the capsaicin receptor to produce inflammatory pain |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7116 |pages=208–12 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17093448 |doi=10.1038/nature05285 |url=[/tpl]

==Uses==

===Food===

Because of the burning sensation caused by capsaicin when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, it is commonly used in food products to give them added spice or "heat" (piquancy). In high concentrations, capsaicin will also cause a burning effect on other sensitive areas of skin.  The degree of heat found within a food is often measured on the Scoville scale. In some cases, people enjoy the heat; there has long been a demand for capsaicin-spiced food and beverages.A Perk of Our Evolution: Pleasure in Pain of Chilies, New York Times, September 20, 2010 There are many cuisines and food products featuring capsaicin such as hot sauce, salsa, and beverages.
For information on treatment, see the section Treatment after exposure.
It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoriant effects from ingesting capsaicin.  Folklore among self-described "chiliheads" attributes this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. In support of this theory, there is some evidence that the effect can be blocked by naloxone and other compounds that compete for receptor sites with endorphins and opiates.Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. - The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine - 8(3):341

===Medical===

Capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments, nasal sprays (Sinol-M), and dermal patches to relieve pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.25%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients.Topical capsaicin for pain relief It is also used to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles.[tpl]Cite journal|title= Which Treatment for Postherpetic Neuralgia?  |publisher= PLoS Med |date=July 2005 |volume = 2 | issue = 7 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020238|url= |journal= PLoS Medicine |pages= e238 [/tpl] In direct application the treatment area is typically numbed first with a topical anesthetic; capsaicin is then applied by a therapist wearing rubber gloves and a face mask. The capsaicin remains on the skin until the patient starts to feel the "heat", at which point it is promptly removed. Capsaicin is also available in large bandages (plasters) that can be applied to the back.
Capsaicin creams are used to treat psoriasis as an effective way to reduce itching and inflammation.[tpl]Cite journal|author = Glinski W, Glinska-Ferenz M, Pierozynska-Dubowska M. |title= Neurogenic inflammation induced by capsaicin in patients with psoriasis. |publisher= Acta Derm Venereol.  |year=1991 |volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–4|pmid = 1711752|url= |journal = Acta dermato-venereologica [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0190-9622(93)70208-B |author = Arnold WP, van de Kerkhof PC. |title= Topical capsaicin in pruritic psoriasis. |publisher= J Am Acad Dermatol. |date=September 1993 |volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 438–42|pmid = 8021363|url= |journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology [/tpl]
According to animal and human studies, the oral intake of capsaicin may increase the production of heat by the body for a short time. Due to the effect on the carbohydrates breakdown after a meal, capsaicin may also be used to regulate blood sugar levels.[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1079/BJN2003938 |author = Lejeune MP, Kovacs EM, Westerterp-Plantenga MS. |title= Effect of capsaicin on substrate oxidation and weight maintenance after modest body-weight loss in human subjects.|publisher= Br J Nutr. |date=September 2003 |volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 651–59|pmid = 13129472|url= |journal = The British journal of nutrition [/tpl]
Capsaicin selectively binds to a protein known as TRPV1 that resides on the membranes of pain and heat-sensing neurons.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Caterina MJ, Schumacher MA, Tominaga M, Rosen TA, Levine JD, Julius D | title = The capsaicin receptor: a heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway | journal = Nature | volume = 389 | issue = 6653 | pages = 816–24 |date=October 1997 | pmid = 9349813 | doi = 10.1038/39807 | url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=How Hot is Hot? A Burning Question About a Hot Condiment|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2012/01/how-hot-is-hot-a-burning-question-about-a-hot-condiment/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|accessdate=2012-01-21[/tpl]  TRPV1 is a heat-activated calcium channel that opens between 37 and 45 °C (98.6 and 113 °F, respectively). When capsaicin binds to TRPV1, it causes the channel to open below 37 °C (normal human body temperature), which is why capsaicin is linked to the sensation of heat. Prolonged activation of these neurons by capsaicin depletes presynaptic substance P, one of the body's neurotransmitters for pain and heat.  Neurons that do not contain TRPV1 are unaffected.
The result appears to be that the chemical mimics a burning sensation; the nerves are overwhelmed by the influx, and are unable to report pain for an extended period of time. With chronic exposure to capsaicin, neurons are depleted of neurotransmitters, leading to reduction in sensation of pain and blockade of neurogenic inflammation. If capsaicin is removed, the neurons recover.[tpl]cite pmid|18307678[/tpl][tpl]cite pmid|18635498[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
According to the American Cancer Society although studies have shown some effectiveness of capsicum against cancer in rodent experiments, "available scientific research does not support claims for the effectiveness of capsicum or whole pepper supplements in preventing or curing cancer at this time".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/capsicum |title=Capsicum |date=2008-11-30 |publisher=Amrerican Cancer Society |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl] Other claimed used not supported by evidence are: "addiction, malaria, yellow fever, heart disease, stroke, weight loss, poor appetite, and sexual potency".
Capsaicin is also the key ingredient in the experimental drug Adlea, which is in Phase 2 trials as a long-acting analgesic to treat post-surgical and osteoarthritic pain for weeks to months after a single injection to the site of pain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mail.com/Article.aspx?articlepath=APNews%5CTop%20Headlines%5C20071030%5CHealthBeat_Peppers___Pain_20071030.xml&cat=topheadlines&subcat=&pageid=1 |title=Doctors Test Hot Sauce For Pain Relief |accessdate=2007-10-30[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2011[/tpl] Moreover, it reduces pain resulting from osteoarthritis[tpl]Cite journal|author = Liana Fraenkel; Sidney T.

===Non-lethal force===

Capsaicin is also the active ingredient in riot control and personal defense pepper spray chemical agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it is very painful, and breathing small particles of it as it disperses can cause breathing difficulty, which serves to discourage assailants. Refer to the Scoville scale for a comparison of pepper spray to other sources of capsaicin.

===Pest deterrent===

Capsaicin is also used to deter mammalian pests. Specific targets of capsaicin repellants are voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, insects, and attacking dogs.[tpl]cite web|title=R.E.D. Facts for Capsaicin|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/4018fact.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2012-11-13[/tpl]  The first pesticide product using solely capsaicin as the active ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962.41  A common example is the use of ground-up or crushed dried chili pods in birdseed to deter squirrels,[tpl]cite pmid|12974352[/tpl] since birds are unaffected by capsaicin. Another example is the use of chili peppers by the Elephant Pepper Development Trust to improve crop security for rural communities in Africa.
Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, it is not clear that the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Antonious GF, Meyer JE, Snyder JC |title=Toxicity and repellency of hot pepper extracts to spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch |journal=J Environ Sci Health B |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1383–91 |year=2006 |pmid=17090499 |doi=10.1080/0360123060096419 |url=[/tpl]
There are manufacturers that sell a capsaicin-based gel product that is reported to be a feral-pigeon (Columba livia) deterrent from specific roosting and loafing areas. Some of these products have an EPA label and NSF approval.

===Equestrian sports===

Capsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses tested positive for the substance, which resulted in disqualification.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/equestrian/7574220.stm | work=BBC News | title=Olympic horses fail drugs tests | date=2008-08-21 | accessdate=2010-04-01[/tpl]

==Mechanism of action==

The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, as a member of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). First cloned in 1997, TRPV1 is an ion channel-type receptor. TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane and into the cell when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.
Early research showed capsaicin to evoke a strikingly long-onset current in comparison to other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor.Geppetti, Pierangelo & Holzer, Peter (1996). Neurogenic Inflammation. CRC Press, 1996. Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel has been shown to be a member of the superfamily of TRP ion channels, and as such is now referred to as [tpl]Gene|TRPV1[/tpl]. There are a number of different TRP ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a chemical burn, or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure.  The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of C fibers [ref]Fuller, R. W., Dixon, C. M. S. & Barnes, P. J. (1985). Bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled capsaicin in humans" J. Appl. Physiol 58, 1080–1084.
PubMed, CAS, Web of Science® Times Cited: 174[/ref] culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.

==Toxicity==

===Acute health effects===

Capsaicin is a highly irritant material requiring proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures. Capsaicin takes effect upon skin contact (irritant, sensitizer), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation (lung irritant, lung sensitizer). The [tpl]LD50[/tpl] in mice is 47.2 mg/kg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sciencelab.com/xMSDS-Capsaicin_Natural-9923296 |title=Capsaicin Material Safety Data Sheet |accessdate=2007-07-13 |publisher=sciencelab.com |year=2007 |format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author= Johnson, Wilbur|title=Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin |journal=Int.

===Treatment after exposure===

The primary treatment is removal from exposure. Contaminated clothing should be removed and placed in airtight bags to prevent secondary exposure.
For external exposure, bathing the mucous membrane surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol is the most effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort;[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical antacid suspensions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.
When capsaicin is ingested, cold milk is an effective way to relieve the burning sensation (due to caseins having a detergent effect on capsaicinGeneral Chemistry Online: Fire and Spice); and room-temperature sugar solution (10%) at [tpl]convert|20|°C|°F[/tpl] is almost as effective.Temporal effectiveness of mouth-rinsing on capsaicin mouth-burn.

The burning sensation will slowly fade away over several hours if no actions are taken.
Burning and pain symptoms can also be relieved by cooling, such as from ice, cold water, cold bottles, cold surfaces, or a flow of air from wind or a fan.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] In severe cases, eye burn might be treated symptomatically with topical ophthalmic anesthetics, and mucous membrane burn with lidocaine gel.

===Effects on weight loss and regain===

There is no evidence showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting capsaicin, but there is a positive correlation between ingesting capsaicin and a decrease in weight regain. The effects of capsaicin are said to cause "a shift in substrate oxidation from carbohydrate to fat oxidation".Lejeune, Manuela P. G. M., Eva M. R. Kovacs, and Margriet S. Westerterp- Plantenga. "Effect of Capsaicin on Substrate Oxidation and Weight Maintenance after Modest Body-weight Loss in Human Subjects." British Journal of Nutrition 90.03 (2003): 651. This leads to a decrease in appetite as well as a decrease in food intake. Even though ingestion of capsaicin causes thermogenesis, the increase in body temperature does not affect weight loss. However, both oral and gastrointestinal exposure to capsaicin increases satiety and reduces energy as well as fat intake.Westerterp-Plantenga, M. S., A. Smeets, and M P G. Lejeune. "Sensory and Gastrointestinal Satiety Effects of Capsaicin on Food Intake." International Journal of Obesity 29.6 (2004): 682-88. Oral exposure proves to yield stronger reduction suggesting that capsaicin has sensory effects. Short-term studies suggest that capsaicin aids in the decrease of weight regain. However, long-term studies are limited because of the pungency of capsaicin.Diepvens, K., K. R. Westerterp, and M. S. Westerterp-Plantenga. "Obesity and Thermogenesis Related to the Consumption of Caffeine, Ephedrine, Capsaicin, and Green Tea." AJP: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology 292.1 (2006): R77-85. Another recent study has suggested that the ingestion of capsaicinoids can increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation through the activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans from the effects of the capsaicin.Yoneshiro, Takeshi, Sayuri Aita, Yuko Kawai, Toshihiko Iwanaga, and Mayayuki Saito. "Nonpungent Capsaicin Analogs (capsinoids) Increase Energy Expenditure through the Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue in Humans." American Society for Nutrition (2012).
