The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brazzaville ([tpl]lang-la|Archidioecesis Brazzapolitanus[/tpl]) is the Metropolitan See for the Ecclesiastical province of Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo.

==History==

On 4 June 1886, Pope Leo XIII established the Apostolic Vicariate of French Congo from the Diocese of São Paulo de Loanda in Angola and the Apostolic Vicariate of Two Guineas in Gabon.  It was renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Upper French Congo
on 14 October 1890, and again on 14 June 1922 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Brazzaville. It lost territory in 1950 when the Apostolic Vicariate of Fort-Rousset was established.  Pope Pius XII promoted the vicariate to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Brazzaville on 14 September 1955.  It lost territory again in 1987 when the Diocese of Kinkala was established.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbraz.html|title=Archdiocese of Brazzaville|publisher=catholic-hierarchy.org|accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/braz0.htm|title=Metropolitan Archdiocese of Brazzaville|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=2013-06-18[/tpl]
