It paid taxes on wheat barley, wheat, olives, beehives, and goats.Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 189. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535 In the nineteenth century, Nimrin grew to become a stone-built village of 250 Muslim people. It was described as being built on the slope of a hill, surrounded by arable land.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, Vol. I, p.361. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535 The Ottomans founded an elementary school in the village.
In 1922, Nimrin became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine and its entire population of 316 in 1931 was Muslim. The main economic sectors were farming and livestock, with grain being the most important crop, followed by vegetables. The Ottoman school was closed down.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nimrin fell into Israeli hands on July 17, 1948 after nearby Lubya was captured at the end of Operation Dekel. Its entire population of 320 (1945) fled for unclear reasons. According to Walid Khalidi, "the site and a major part of the lands are surrounded by a fence."
