This Globe is the only one of its kind that hydraulically lifts 5 ft off the ground and splits/separates into three (3) sections while the Garcia Thrill Riders race their motorcycles in the center piece with a 4 ft gap underneath them. During this operation, the entire sphere lifts at over 23 ft high.
