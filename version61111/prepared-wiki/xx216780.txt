Prominent robotic surgeon Dr. Mani Menon is the event's symposium director. 2009 IRUS will be held at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas from January 12-January 14, 2009.Henry Ford Hospital - The Vattikuti Urology Institute

==History==

The Vattikuti Urology Institute (VUI), at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan played a prominent role in the development of robotic surgery as treatment for prostate cancer and, more recently, renal, stone disease, and adrenal surgery.Science Daily - "Fast Track"MSNBC - Robots Invade The Operating Room The institute hosted the 2004 International Robotic Urology Symposium and the 2006 International Robotic Urology Symposium at the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn, Michigan.

==2009 IRUS==

Reflecting the expansion of the role of robotic surgery, 2009 IRUS will for the first time include a section for gynecologic and female urological surgery. Other session offerings include OR management for robotic surgery, economics for robotic programs, robotic pediatric urology, robotic kidney surgery, robotic bladder surgery, and robotic prostate surgery.2009 IRUS Program Agenda  Delegates can also observe 3 live surgeries and 3D surgical video sessions.
The growing prominence of the Vattikuti Urology Institute has allowed 2009 IRUS to host more than 50 faculty members including many of the world's prominent robotic surgeons and two former presidents of the American Urological Association. The event is sponsored by the Endourological Society, the Society of Urologic Oncology, and Intuitive Surgical. Intuitive Surgical, one of America's fastest growing companies, has featured the event on its homepage.Intuitive Surgical
In consideration of the growing demand amongst surgeons for in-depth learning of techniques,  2009 IRUS also hosts two post conference events (Jan 15th-16th) at Intuitive Surgical in Sunnyvale, CA (live tissue experience) and Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI (spectrum of urological surgery).
