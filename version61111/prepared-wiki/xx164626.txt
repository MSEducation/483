[tpl]Unreferenced|date=November 2008[/tpl]Greatstone is a beach-side town, the third town up from the "point" of the Romney Marsh area.
It is situated near the largest town there, New Romney in Kent, England. Permission was given in the 1920s for a company to construct large numbers of homes and facilities; only a small number were built. There was widespread development in the 1960s and 1970s, however, leading to a sizable community. The church of St. Peter's, built in the 1960s, is a daughter church of All Saints, Lydd, in which parish half of Greatstone is situated.
There is a small group of shops at one end of the town, and the other end simply melds into Lydd-on-Sea.
The local school is the Greatstone Primary School, from which most students either go on to the The Marsh Academy, or the Harvey Grammar School. - local website Greatstone Website
