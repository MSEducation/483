[[Provisioning (cruise ship)]]

CATEGORIES: Foodservice, Cruise ships

Cruise ships consume vast amounts of food every day; as an example, the following is a list of supplies provisioned on board the Celebrity cruise ship Constellation, carrying up to 1,950 passengers and 999 crew, for an average 7 day cruise.
Of course, not all this food will be consumed during the voyage, the ship must keep a percentage in reserve to allow for delays, etc.  The figure includes all supplies for cooking meals in the three restaurants and buffets, room service, bars and lounges, as well as all baking and confectionery supplies, for officers and crew as well as passengers.
The Constellation at full capacity feeds 3 meals a day to over 1950 passengers and 999 officers and crew, comparable to the provisions that any small town might consume in one week.
