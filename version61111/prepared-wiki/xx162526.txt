==History and details==

The Pirate Ship is not actually themed as a “Pirate Ship”, but a copy of the VOC - merchant Halve Maen of the Dutch East India Co. VOC, the first limited company which centuries later merged into Unilever. The theming for the surroundings of the ride consists of a harbour in the Anton Pieck style. 
It is the largest Pirate Ship in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records.http://www.wonderlijkewcweb.org/geschiedenis/decennium1982.htm
