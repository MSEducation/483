Park Top (foaled in 1964) was a British racehorse. She had an unfashionable pedigree, cost only 500 guineas as a yearling and did not run as a two-year-old. Her Grand-dam Oola Hills was the dam of Pappa Fourway, but unlike him, Park Top was at her best over middle distances, as she showed when gaining her first major success in the Ribblesdale Stakes at Ascot in 1967. She won the Brighton Cup (then a good handicap) that year and as a four-year-old, when she also took the Prix d'Hedouville at Longchamp. But it was as a five-year-old that she really shone. A victory at Longchamp in May was followed by a success in the Coronation Cup, Hardwicke Stakes and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. She was the victim of alleged poor rides [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and Eclipse Stakes. Park Top went on racing at age six, when she won twice more, bringing her career tally to 13 races worth Â£136,440. She was disappointing as a broodmare and her few foals had shown minimal talent before she was retired in 1979.
