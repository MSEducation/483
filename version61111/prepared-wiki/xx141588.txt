Dr Wesley Duaine Sweetser (1919–2006) was an English critic.
Born in National City, California, USA, he attended the University of Colorado where he gained a Ph.D. in 1958 for a thesis on Welsh writer Arthur Machen. He served for a long period in the United States Air Force reaching the rank of Captain.
This enthusiasm led him to publish a valuable Machen biography and bibliography with Adrian Goldstone based on his earlier thesis. He played an important part in supporting the 1960s revival in Machen’s works.
