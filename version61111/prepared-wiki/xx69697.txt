[[Japanese clans]]

CATEGORIES: Japanese clans

This is a list of Japanese clans. The ancient clans (gozoku) mentioned in the Nihonshoki and Kojiki lost their political power before the Heian period. Instead of gozoku, new aristocracies, Kuge families emerged in this period. In the late Heian period, warrior class clans (Samurai) gradually gained power and subsequently dominated the country.

Kuge families also had used their family name (Kamei/家名) for the same purpose.
