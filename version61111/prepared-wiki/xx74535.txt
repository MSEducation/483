Lukla is a town in the Khumbu area of the Solukhumbu District in the Sagarmatha Zone of north-eastern Nepal. Situated at [tpl]convert|2860|m|ft|0[/tpl], it is a popular place for visitors to the Himalayas near Mount Everest to arrive. Although Lukla means place with many goats and sheep, few are found in the area these days.
Lukla contains a small airport servicing the region, and a variety of shops and lodges catering to tourists and trekkers, providing western-style meals and trail supplies.
From Lukla, most trekkers will take two days to reach Namche Bazaar, both an interesting village and an altitude acclimatization stop for those continuing on.[tpl]cite journal |author=Muza, SR; Fulco, CS; Cymerman, A |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide. |journal=US Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=2009-03-05 [/tpl]

==Airport==

Lukla is served by the Tenzing-Hillary Airport. Weather permitting, twin-engined Dornier and Twin Otters make frequent daylight flights between Lukla and Kathmandu.  Lukla Airport has a very short and steep airstrip, often compounded by hazardous weather, resulting in several fatal accidents. It has been called the most dangerous airport in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=World's Most Dangerous Airports|url=http://www.jaunted.com/story/2007/1/22/163551/923/travel/World%27s+Most+Dangerous+Airports%3A+Lukla+Airport,+Nepal,+LUA|accessdate=2011-03-25 [/tpl]
