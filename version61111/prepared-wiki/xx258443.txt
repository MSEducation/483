==Career==

Robert Rosén started his professional career in 2003 with the Division 2 team Alvesta SK, and played there for two seasons. Rosén then went to Växjö Lakers of the HockeyAllsvenskan where he had great success, scoring a total of 176 points in 211 games. Rosén then signed with Modo Hockey to make his Elitserien debut in the 2010–11 season. His 2010–11 season with Modo ended with 27 points in 65 games.
After that season, which ended in play in the Kvalserien qualification for the team in order to stay in Elitserien, Rosén signed with AIK of the same league. He totalled a career high of 60 points (21 goals, 39 assists) in 55 games, and won the scoring league as a result. In May 2012, due to real-life issues, Rosén moved back to Växjö and signed a five-year contract with Växjö Lakers within the same league. The contract will expire after the 2016–17 season.[tpl]cite web |url=http://vaxjolakers.se/artikel/23509/ |title=Rosén till Växjö Lakers |last=Gustavsson |first=Jonas |publisher=Växjö Lakers |language=Swedish |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2012-05-21[/tpl] Rosén's move was very controversial among AIK fans, and as a result, his contract included a clause prohibiting him from playing the first two road games against AIK at Hovet in the 2012–13 season. The only road game against AIK in which Rosén appeared was played on February 26, 2013; the game ended 4–1 in AIK's favour.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/elitserien/aik/article16318411.ab |title=Nidramsor mot Rosén på Hovet |last1=Abrahamsson |first1=Hans |last2=Ekeliw |first2=Jonathan |work=Sportbladet |language=Swedish |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-26[/tpl]
