Ugeo (died 108 BC) was the last king of Wiman Joseon, the last remnant of Gojoseon. He was a grandson of Wi Man. 
Ugeo was killed by an assassin sent by a faction advocating surrender.  Even after the death of Ugeo, Gojoseon resisted the Han forces until 108 BC but lost and the Four Commanderies of Han were then set up.
