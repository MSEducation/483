[[Plasmodium species infecting mammals other than primates]]

CATEGORIES: Plasmodium, Parasites of mammals

There are Plasmodium  species infecting mammals other than primates. The subgenus Vinckeia of Plasmodium was created by Cyril Garnham to accommodate the mammalian parasites other than those infecting primates. Species infecting lemurs have also been included in this subgenus.
P. aegyptensis, P. bergei, P. chabaudi, P. inopinatum, P. yoelli and P. vinckei infect rodents. P. bergei, P. chabaudi, P. yoelli and P. vinckei have been used to study malarial infections in the laboratory. Other members of this subgenus infect other mammalian hosts.
