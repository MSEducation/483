[[Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans]]

CATEGORIES: Caucuses of the United States Congress

The "Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans" (Turkey Caucus) was established by US Congressmen Robert Wexler (D-Florida), Ed Whitfield (R-Kentucky) and Kay Granger (R-Texas) in March 2001.
The Turkey Caucus is a bi-partisan platform for members of the Caucus to focus on US-Turkey relations and issues that concern Turkish Americans. Many of its members have joined this caucus due to the efforts of their Turkish American constituents and friends of Turkey.
The Congressional Caucus on US-Turkey Relations and Turkish Americans increased to 157 members in July, 2012.
