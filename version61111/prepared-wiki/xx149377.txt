==Club career==

===Early years===

Born in an Aba, Abia, Uche's career began in Nigeria with Enyimba International and Iwuanyanwu Nationale. In the 2000–01 season he joined RCD Espanyol B in Spain, failing to receive any first-team opportunities and competing with the reserves in the third division.
Uche then transferred to Wisła Kraków, playing there until 2005 – winning the Polish League three times and Polish Cup twice – except for the 2004–05 campaign when he represented FC Girondins de Bordeaux, on loan.Uche gives Bordeaux a go; UEFA.com, 30 August 2004

===Almería===

For 2005–06 Uche moved to UD Almería, and was instrumental in helping the Andalusia outfit to its first ever La Liga promotion in his second year, scoring eight league goals (with three in the last five matches). He made his debut in the competition on 26 August 2007, coming from the bench in a 3–0 away win against Deportivo de La Coruña.
On 11 January 2009, profiting from the absence of first-choice Álvaro Negredo, Uche netted both goals in a 2–2 draw at Espanyol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/252876?cc=5739|title=Espanyol 2–2 Almeria|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=11 January 2009|accessdate=7 August 2011[/tpl] On 5 December he scored the side's second goal at Real Madrid for the 2–1, but the hosts eventually rallied back to 4–2.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/275739?cc=5739|title=Ronaldo endures eventful night|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=5 December 2009|accessdate=7 August 2011[/tpl]
In the following summer Negredo was sold to Sevilla FC – via Real Madrid – and Uche became Almería's most important offensive reference. He finished the 2009–10 season with a career-best nine goals, namely a brace on 4 May 2010 against Villarreal CF in a 4–2 home win, which all but certified the club's permanence in the top level for another year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/275905?cc=5739|title=Almeria boost survival hopes|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=4 May 2010|accessdate=7 August 2011[/tpl]
Uche spent the first month of 2010–11 on the sidelines, due to injury. In the second match upon his return, on 26 September 2010, he scored twice at Deportivo (2–0) for Almería's first win of the campaign,[tpl]cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/302086?cc=5739|title=Uche breaks Almeria duck|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=7 April 2011[/tpl] going on to net seven in 32 games as the team was finally relegated after a four-year stay.
