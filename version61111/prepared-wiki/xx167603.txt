DSPnano is an embedded real-time operating system (RTOS) which is compatible with POSIX and embedded Linux.  It was first created in 1996 and was one of the first pthread based real-time kernels.  Its entire focus was on tiny real-time digital signal processing systems and has been optimized to deliver high performance DSP on embedded digital signal controllers and digital signal processors http://rowebots.com/Embedded_System_Software/DSP_RTOS.  Its parent was the Unison Operating System.
Today DSPnano claims full POSIX capabilities for threads, communication, synchronization and I/O.  A full complement of I/O is included as is a full complement of DSP optimized features including: DSP libraries, fix size buffer management, software pipelines and more.  It has also been moved to FPGA platforms to accelerate DSP applications.
Typical processors that DSPnano runs on today include: Microchip PIC microcontroller (24, 30, 33 and 32), Renesas M16C, ARM and more.http://rowebots.com/products/dspnano
