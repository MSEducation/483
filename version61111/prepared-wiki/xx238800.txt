Blair, one of the judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of New Jersey, suspended Charlton's petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a warrant was issued for his arrest. This order for extradition was approved by Philander C. Knox. The extradition was argued before the United States Supreme Court in 1913 as Charlton v. Kelly.
