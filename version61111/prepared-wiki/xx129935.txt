Oskar Rönningberg (born 2 April 1986) is a retired Swedish football player, who recently represented Helsingborgs IF. He was a central defender. He started his career at Torns IF in Lund, but was picked up by the HIF youth academy as a 15-year-old. During the 2006 Allsvenskan, he took a huge step towards establishing himself as a regular starter for the club, due to injuries on other players. He has also represented Swedish national teams at different youth levels.
In the pre-season 2008, Rönningberg suffered a severe injury to his already injured knee, forcing him to retire from professional football at the age of 22.
