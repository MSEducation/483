</ref> The [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) purchased the B&O, also in 1962, and subsequently locomotive repairs were handled at the B&O shops in [[Cumberland, Maryland]]. Only car repairs were continued at Mt. Clare, until 1974, when all shop work on the site was discontinued.  By this time many of the buildings were in disrepair, and most were demolished by 1976, except for those used by the museum.<ref name="HAER1" /><ref name = "harwood1" /> [[CSX Transportation]], the successor railroad company, sold portions of the property, and [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2[/tpl] of the Mt. Clare site have been retained by the museum.<ref name = "b&oguide" />
