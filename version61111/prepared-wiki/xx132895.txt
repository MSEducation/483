CATEGORIES: Medical dictionaries

A medical dictionary is a lexicon for words used in medicine. The three major  medical dictionaries in the United States are Stedman's, Taber's, and Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary. Other significant medical dictionaries are distributed by Elsevier, the world's largest publisher of medical and scientific literature, and their French division Masson. Dictionaries often have multiple versions, with  content adapted for different user groups. For example Stedman's Concise Medical Dictionary and Dorland's are for general use and allied health care, while the full text editions are reference works used by medical students, doctors, and health professionals.
Many of the dictionaries mentioned above are available online, and  other electronic dictionaries for medicine are available as downloadable software packages for Apple Macintosh and Windows computers, PDAs, and smartphones or as CD-ROM, as well as bilingual dictionaries and translation dictionaries.

==History==

The Synonyma Simonis Genuensis (the Synonyms of Simon of Genoa), attributed to the physician to Pope Nicholas IV in the year 1288, was printed by Antonius Zarotus at Milan in 1473. Referring to a copy held in the library
of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, Henry wrote in 1905 that "It is the first edition of the first medical dictionary."[tpl]cite journal |journal=Med Library Hist J. |date=January 1905 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=27–40 |title=A Review of the First Book on the Diseases of the Eye, by Benvenutus Grassus, 1474: Exhibition of Three Other Fifteenth Century Monographs (a) The First Medical Dictionary, Synonyma Simonis Genuensis, 1473; (b) The First Book on Diet, By Isaac, 1487, (c) The Second Edition of The First Book on Diseases of Children, By Paulus Bagellardus, 1487. |author=Henry FP |pmid=18340862 |pmc=1692319[/tpl] By the time of Antonio Guaineri and Savonarola, this work was used alongside others by Oribasius, Isidore of Seville, Mondino dei Liuzzi, Serapion, and Pietro d'Abano. Then, as now, writers struggled with the terminology used in various translations from earlier Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic works. Later works by Jacques Desparts and Jacopo Berengario da Carpi continued building on the Synonyma.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Osiris |author=Danielle Jacquart |title=Theory, everyday practice, and three fifteenth-century physicians |volume=6 |year=1990 |pages=140–160 |jstor=301784[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Summula per alphabetum super plurimis remediis et ipsius |language=Latin |author=Jacobi Partibus |year=1500 |url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb37229239v [/tpl]
