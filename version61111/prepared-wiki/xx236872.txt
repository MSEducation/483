Konnik (July 18, 1974 - March 24, 2011) was an American artist based in New York. His artwork, best described as “abstract portraits” are imbued with religious symbolism, some subtle and some out right blatant, all evidence of his strict Catholic upbringing. Nicknamed “God’s Vile Hand”, his pieces harken back to a time when God was vengeful and people feared him.
It is known that his main painting medium, known as “sauce”, a recipe only known to him, but has a base of acrylics or inks (depending on what he is painting on) dyes, and his own blood. When asked about this ritual of using his own blood. He stated “Each piece is a literal piece of me.”
Konnik recently became a part of the art collective, PUSHART and has some of his work on display permanently at ART N SOUL Studios, in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

Konnik donated a piece of his work to be auctioned off and the proceeds given to the F*ck Cancer Fund in honor of Lou Genise, a fire performer, poet, and artist.
