 cascade]], the [[complement system]], [[apoptosis]] pathways, and the invertebrate prophenoloxidase-activating cascade). Proteases can either break specific peptide bonds (''limited proteolysis''), depending on the [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, or break down a complete peptide to amino acids (''unlimited proteolysis''). The activity can be a destructive change (abolishing a protein's function or digesting it to its principal components), it can be an activation of a function, or it can be a signal in a signalling pathway.

===Plants===

Plant genomes encode hundreds of proteases, largely of unknown function. Those with known function are largely involved in developmental regulation.[tpl]cite journal|last=van der Hoorn|first=RA|title=Plant proteases: from phenotypes to molecular mechanisms.|journal=Annual review of plant biology|year=2008|volume=59|pages=191–223|pmid=18257708|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092835[/tpl] Plant proteases also play a role in regulation of photosynthesis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zelisko|first=A|coauthors=Jackowski, G|title=Senescence-dependent degradation of Lhcb3 is mediated by a thylakoid membrane-bound protease.|journal=Journal of plant physiology|date=October 2004|volume=161|issue=10|pages=1157–70|pmid=15535125|doi=10.1016/j.jplph.2004.01.006[/tpl]

===Animals===

Proteases are used throughout an organism for various metabolic processes. Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as pepsin) and serine proteases present in duodenum (trypsin and chymotrypsin) enable us to digest the protein in food. Proteases present in blood serum (thrombin, plasmin, Hageman factor, etc.) play important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes (elastase, cathepsin G) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some snake venoms are also proteases, such as pit viper haemotoxin and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological role like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes. This is one of the fastest "switching on" and "switching off" regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism.
By complex cooperative action the proteases may proceed as cascade reactions, which result in rapid and efficient amplification of an organism's response to a physiological signal.

===Bacteria===

Bacteria secrete proteases to hydrolyse (digest) the peptide bonds in proteins and therefore break the proteins down into their constituent monomers(amino acids).  Bacterial and fungal proteases are particularly important to the global carbon and nitrogen cycles in the recycling of proteins, and such activity tends to be regulated  by nutritional signals in these organisms.Sims, G.K.  2006. Nitrogen Starvation Promotes Biodegradation of N-Heterocyclic Compounds in Soil. Soil Biology & Biochemistry 38:2478-2480.  The net impact of nutritional regulation of protease activity among the thousands of species present in soil can be observed at the overall microbial community level as proteins are broken down in response to carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur limitation.Sims, G. K., and M. M. Wander.  2002.  Proteolytic activity under nitrogen or sulfur limitation.  Appl. Soil Ecol.  568:1-5.
Bacteria contain proteases responsible for general protein quality control (e.g. the AAA+ proteasome) by degrading unfolded or misfolded proteins.
A secreted bacterial protease may also act as an exotoxin, and be an example of a virulence factor in bacterial pathogenesis (for example,  exfoliative toxin).  Bacterial exotoxic proteases destroy extracellular structures.

===Viruses===

Some viruses express their entire genome as one massive polyprotein and use a protease to cleave this into functional units (e.g. polio, norovirus, and TEV proteases). These proteases (e.g. TEV protease) have high specificity and only cleave very restricted set of substrate sequences.

==Uses==

The field of protease research is enormous. in 2004, approximately 8000 papers related to this field were published each year.[tpl]cite book|last=Woessner|first=edited by Alan J. Barrett, Neil D. Rawlings, J. Fred|title=Handbook of proteolytic enzymes|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=London, UK|isbn=0-12-079610-4|edition=2nd ed.[/tpl] Proteases are used in industry, medicine and a basic biological research tool.[tpl]cite book|last=Hooper|first=ed. by N. M.|title=Proteases in biology and medicine|year=2002|publisher=Portland Press|location=London|isbn=1-85578-147-6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Feijoo-Siota|first=Lucía|coauthors=Villa, Tomás G.|title=Native and Biotechnologically Engineered Plant Proteases with Industrial Applications|journal=Food and Bioprocess Technology|date=28 September 2010|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1066–1088|doi=10.1007/s11947-010-0431-4[/tpl]
Digestive proteases are part of many laundry detergents and are also used extensively in the bread industry in bread improver. A variety of proteases are used medically both for their natural function (e.g. controlling blood clotting) or for completely artificial functions (e.g. for the targeted degradation of pathogenic proteins). Highly specific proteases such as TEV protease and thrombin are commonly used to cleave fusion proteins and affinity tags in a controlled fashion.

==Inhibitors==

The activity of proteases is inhibited by protease inhibitors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Southan|first=C|title=A genomic perspective on human proteases as drug targets.|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=Jul 1, 2001|volume=6|issue=13|pages=681–688|pmid=11427378|doi=10.1016/s1359-6446(01)01793-7[/tpl] One example of protease inhibitors is the serpin superfamily, which includes alpha 1-antitrypsin, C1-inhibitor, antithrombin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and neuroserpin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Puente|first=XS|coauthors=López-Otín, C|title=A genomic analysis of rat proteases and protease inhibitors.|journal=Genome Research|date=April 2004|volume=14|issue=4|pages=609–22|pmid=15060002|doi=10.1101/gr.1946304|pmc=383305[/tpl]
Natural protease inhibitors include the family of lipocalin proteins, which play a role in cell regulation and differentiation. Lipophilic ligands, attached to lipocalin proteins, have been found to possess tumor protease inhibiting properties. The natural protease inhibitors are not to be confused with the protease inhibitors used in antiretroviral therapy. Some viruses, with HIV/AIDS among them, depend on proteases in their reproductive cycle. Thus, protease inhibitors are developed as antiviral means.
Other natural protease inhibitors are used as defense mechanisms. Common examples are the trypsin inhibitors found in the seeds of some plants, most notable for humans being soybeans, a major food crop, where they act to discourage predators. Raw soybeans are toxic to many animals, including humans, until the protease inhibitors they contain have been denatured.
