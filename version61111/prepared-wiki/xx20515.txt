Tunisia inherited much of its rail transport system from the French and the Tunisian Government has developed infrastructure further.  The railways are operated by the Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT), the Tunisian national railway.Welcome to Tunisia Online News Updates : The latest news from Tunisia A modernisation program is currently underway.

In the south of Tunisia, there is a narrow gauge railway called the Sfax-Gafsa Railway which delivers phosphates and iron ore to the harbour at Sfax. Tunisia has rail links with the neighbouring country of Algeria via the Ghardimaou-Souk Ahras line, and another connection to Tébessa, however, the latter link is currently not used.http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r052.html.
There are no railways yet in neighbouring Libya though some are under construction in 2008; some gauge conversion would be required for efficient connections.
