==Career==

===Buffy the Vampire Slayer===

In 1997, Whedon created his first TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The series depicts Buffy Summers, the latest in a line of young women called to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. The inspiration for the idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/component/content/article/34-its-a-different-medium-you-idiot-/1570-buffy-the-vampire-slayer|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer|first=Chris|last=Earl|date=December 14, 2011|publisher=starburstmagazine.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=1553&fulltext=1|title=SXSW Critic’s Notebook: Much Ado About What, Exactly?

Most of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was shot on locations in and around Los Angeles, California.

===Angel===

As a result of Buffy the Vampire Slayer[tpl]'[/tpl]s success, Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin-off series, Angel. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot that was going to be developed for The WB Network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/10/04/angel/|title=City of Angel|first=Joyce|last=Millman|date=October 4, 1999|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate the original concept. "Corrupt", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.timminear.net/archives/angel/000039.html|title=ANGEL: Season One, Episode By Episode with Tim Minear|first=Edward|last=Gross|date=August 14, 2000|publisher=timminear.net|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] James A. Contner—director of the replacement episode—explained, "We were six days into preproduction and suddenly shut down. ... It was a meeting of the minds between the network, the WB and Fox and Joss and Greenwalt about what the direction of the show would be. ... and Fox felt that they didn't want to have character in that place the whole time".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teaattheford.net/conversation.php?id=34|title=The Story of Lonely Hearts AtS 1.02|date=June 5, 2003|publisher=teaattheford.net|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] The tone was softened, establishing in the opening episodes Angel Investigations as an idealistic, shoestring operation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/angel/|title=Angel|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] It follows Angel (played by David Boreanaz), who works as a private detective in order to "help the helpless".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/angel%5Btvseries%5D_v181391/plotsummary|title=Angel TV Series Synopsis|publisher=fandango.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl]
Angel premiered on October 5, 1999. It was praised for presenting a unique and progressive version of the archetypal noir hero as a sympathetic vampire detective.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ncp.pcaaca.org/presentation/fang-noir-revamping-hardboiled-hero-joss-whedon%E2%80%99s-angel|title=Fang Noir: Revamping the Hardboiled Hero in Joss Whedon’s Angel|first=Mary|last=Findley|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=pcaaca.org|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] The series was however at times referred to being lesser than its parent show, regularly dismissed in context of having been derived from a more popular original work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html|title=Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls|first=Sarah|last=Hughes|date=May 15, 2009|publisher=independent.co.uk|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] Despite this, it won a Saturn Award for Best Network TV Series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#tvseries|title=BEST TELEVISION SERIES|publisher=saturnawards.org|accessdate=May 9, 2013[/tpl] The three episodes, "Waiting in the Wings",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/09a/hugo159.htm|title=Hugo Award Nominees|publisher=sfsite.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] "Smile Time" and "Not Fade Away", were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2005/News/03_HugoNominations.html|title=Hugo and Campbell Awards Nominations|publisher=locusmag.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] In addition to Whedon, the writers with the most writing credits include David Greenwalt, Tim Minear, Jeffrey Bell, David Fury, Steven S.

I believe the reason Angel had trouble on The WB was that it was the only show on the network that wasn't trying to be Buffy. It was a show about grown-ups".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,637917,00.html|title=The X Factor|first=Jeff|last=Jensen|date=May 21, 2004|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] Fans attempted to revive the show through the means of online petitions, letter-writing campaigns and seeking to influence other networks for a renewal, but to no avail.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/joss-whedon-angel-40041.aspx|title=Angel Creator's Finale Post-Mortem|first=Ethan|last=Alter|date=May 20, 2004|publisher=tvguide.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] An official continuation of the story came rather in the form of a comic book series called Angel: After the Fall,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.idwpublishing.com/catalog/book/142|title=Angel: After the Fall|publisher=idwpublishing.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] written by Brian Lynch and Whedon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/angel/4050-19692/|title=Angel|publisher=comicvine.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl]

Whedon followed Angel with the space western Firefly (2002), starring Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau and Ron Glass. Set in the year 2517, Firefly explores the lives of the people who, on the outskirts of society, make their living as the crew of Serenity, a "Firefly-class" spaceship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/27/firefly-your-next-box-set|title=Your next box set: Firefly|first=Daniel|last=Bettridge|date=March 23, 2012|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl] The series' concept progressed originally after Whedon read The Killer Angels, a book on the Battle of Gettysburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/937796/Foxs-Firefly-takes-flight.html?pg=all|title=Scott Pierce: Fox's 'Firefly' takes flight|first=Scott D.|last=Pierce|date=September 19, 2002|publisher=deseretnews.com|accessdate=May 10, 2013[/tpl]

[tpl]blockquote|On another level it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping they’ll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances.

About the music Whedon said, "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why Silvestri was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the Hans Zimmer school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love".[tpl]cite web|url=http://collider.com/joss-whedon-cabin-in-the-woods-the-avengers-interview/157304/|title=Joss Whedon Talks THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, THE AVENGERS, His Writing Process, Comic-Con, Collecting and More|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|date=April 5, 2012|publisher=collider.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl]
Whedon commented on the conversion of The Avengers from 2D to 3D, saying that "current 3D conversion technology is really amazing, and Marvel is very picky. Having a sense for things in a 3D space and filming while feeling that space was a very easy thing for me. I’m just tired of seeing just things flying toward the camera. So I had to make things look good for 3D in 2D.

It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. ... Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much.

The more you can warp the frame a little bit, the more it speaks towards what’s going on". The film was shot with multiple hand-held digital cameras, often with a RED Epic, and used a Lensbaby Composer with Double Glass lens on a Canon 7D to differentiate certain scenes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lensbaby.com/blog/film-video/pro-spotlight-jay-hunter/|title=FILM & VIDEO: Jay Hunter|first=Keri|last=Friedman|date=June 3, 2013|publisher=lensbaby.com|accessdate=June 8, 2013[/tpl] Working with the actors, Whedon determined that, although giving them notes for guidance, "...what I understand is what an actor wants to know. ‘Why am I doing this, and how should it come out?’ And ‘Will I be safe to try something strange?’ And ‘Will I be asked to do more?’ I don’t come at it from any other standpoint than that".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=193026|title=How Joss Whedon and his loyal team of actors adapted the Bard in 12 days|first=Norman|last=Wilner|date=June 2013|publisher=nowtoronto.com|accessdate=June 16, 2013[/tpl]

In March 2012, Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film:
[tpl]quote|I think, ultimately, gun to my head, TV is the place. Being able to spend years with a character, to really develop them, to understand them, to challenge the actor, to learn from the actor, to work with a team of writers -- that experience is so fulfilling.

==Unrealized projects==

Whedon had a number of planned projects that became stuck in development or terminally stalled. Among these, a Buffy animated series, a set of television movies for The WB based on Angel and Buffy characters, and Ripper, a proposed BBC pilot about Rupert Giles. Ripper was announced to be in development at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con. The development process was set to begin in 2008, and Ripper to be aired that summer, yet the pilot did not materialize due to copyright issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/808/808993p1.html |title=IGN: SDCC 07: Whedon Says Buffy Spinoff Ripper Still Planned |publisher=Tv.ign.com |author=IGN Staff |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2008[/tpl] Early in his career, Whedon sold two spec scripts that weren't produced; Suspension and Afterlife.

==Style, themes and influences==

Whedon spoke about his approach to screenwriting.
[tpl]quote|Structure is the hardest part of storytelling. With The Avengers, the structure nearly killed me. It was very difficult to make it flow and cohere in terms of all the changing perspectives and characters, all these movie stars, all these beats to hit. It’s a ridiculously complex puzzle. But once you’ve got the puzzle, and you’re just filling in the voices and coming up with the moments, that’s what’s fun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/6-filmmaking-tips-from-joss-whedon.php|title=6 Filmmaking Tips From Joss Whedon|first=Scott|last=Beggs|date=September 26, 2012|publisher=filmschoolrejects.com|accessdate=February 21, 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
He also spoke about his penchant to kill off characters.
[tpl]quote|The percentage of people who die... is a lot. I think it's pretty near everybody. The percentage of people that I kill - not so many. I think the reason that my rep is so nasty is that I tend to do it... unexpectedly, or to someone people are recently invested in, and that is a real mission statement for me, because; death doesn't leave a card. Death doesn't take Hitler. It doesn't work according to story plans. And when a death feels like a loss, gives you grief... then you have told a story that involves death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenerdmachine.com/nerd-hq-on-demand-joss-whedon/|title=Nerd HQ On-Demand: Joss Whedon|date=July 15, 2012|publisher=thenerdmachine.com|accessdate=February 21, 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
Whedon prefers to incorporate as many practical effects as possible when using computer-generated imagery.
[tpl]quote|I don't think it looks good if it doesn't look real. That veracity is the most important thing. You want to feel like this is definitely happening. I am very strict about letting people feel the space that something's happening in, and the environment has got to be a key part of it. Generally you just try to mix just as much practical with CGI as possible, so people really don't know where one begins and the other ends.[tpl]cite web|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/movies/blogs/the-hitlist-blogpost.aspx?post=e00ff786-3518-4d3d-83d1-5c9f3f3fadb7|title=Interview: Director Joss Whedon of ‘The Avengers’|first=James|last=Rocchi|date=May 1, 2012|publisher=msn.com|accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl][/tpl]
On working with high or low budgets, he says: "It's the exact same job. The money has never mattered".
[tpl]quote|If you have $100 million, if you have $100,000, you're trying to hit someone in the gut with an emotional moment. If you can back that up with an awesome visual, that's really neat.

Whedon has kept ambivalent on whether to shoot on film or digital video, saying that he has "no allegiance to film as film.

Many of Whedon's altered phrases, and heavily popularized words have entered a common usage called "Slayer Slang", which PBS included an entire section of in their article series Do You Speak American?.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/words/sezwho/buffy/|title=Slayer Slang|publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl] In an issue of Buffy Season Eight, where Buffy travels to the future, Whedon writes Buffy's reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan; this allows Whedon to comment on the series' distinctive style of dialogue. "Buffy blames herself for what's happened to the English language, and there's a lot of hubris in that joke. I like to think that adding Y's to words that don't usually have Y's is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590279/buffy-heads-future-new-season-eight-comic.jhtml|title=Joss Whedon Sends Buffy Back To The Future In New Season-Eight Comic|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|date=July 2, 2008|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl]

In July 2012, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, in response to one woman who noted the anti-corporate themes in many of his movies, and asked him to give his economic philosophy in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against both the socialism he was brought up listening to and capitalism as well, stating that "ultimately all these systems don't work".
