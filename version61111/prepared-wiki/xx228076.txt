The Sega Vision is a portable media player (PMP) by Sega, first announced in October 2008. It can play various media (MP3 audio, MP4 and AVI video, still images, e-book), features a tuner for analog television and radio, and has a built-in digital still camera and voice recorder. The Sega Vision was originally planned to feature simple mobile game functionality, but the feature was removed. As of 2009, the device is only available in Sega UFO Catcher claw vending machines. Sega Prize Europe plans to sell the device online, and possibly at certain retail stores. Sega also plans to release other models of the Sega Vision in the future.http://seganerds.thekartel.com/blog/2009/02/04/atei_sega_vision_handson/
