The Forbidden City is a rectangle, measuring [tpl]convert|961|m|ft[/tpl] from north to south and [tpl]convert|753|m|ft[/tpl] from east to west. It consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,886 bays of rooms;As larger buildings in traditional Chinese architecture are easily and regularly sub-divided into different configurations, the number of rooms in the Forbidden City is traditionally counted in terms of "bays" of rooms, with each bay being the space defined by four structural pillars. however this figure may not include various antechambers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://museumca.org/exhibit/exhib_fc2.html|title=Amazing Facts About the Forbidden City|publisher=Oakland Museum of California[/tpl] Another common figure points to 9,999 rooms including antechambers;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/31/arts/art-review-they-had-expensive-tastes.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=ART REVIEW; They Had Expensive Tastes|author=Glueck, Grace|publisher=The New York Times|date=2001-08-31[/tpl] although this number is frequently cited, it is likely an oral tradition, and it is not supported by survey evidence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/217858.htm|title=Numbers Inside the Forbidden City|author=China Daily|publisher=China.org.cn|date=2007-07-20[/tpl]  The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient, walled city of Beijing. It is enclosed in a larger, walled area called the Imperial City. The Imperial City is, in turn, enclosed by the Inner City; to its south lies the Outer City.
The Forbidden City remains important in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers.[tpl]cite news|title=北京确立城市发展脉络 重塑7.8公里中轴线 (Beijing to establish civic development network; Recreating 7.8 km central axis)|url=http://house.people.com.cn/chengshi/20060530/article_5338.html|publisher=People Net|date=2006-05-30|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese[/tpl] This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.[tpl]cite news|first=Feng|last=Pan|title=探秘北京中轴线 (Exploring the mystery of Beijing's Central Axis)|url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2005/03/02/5202.htm|work=Science Times|publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences|date=2005-03-02|accessdate=2007-10-19|language=Chinese|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211101908/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2005/03/02/5202.htm |archivedate = 2007-12-11|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Walls and gates===

The Forbidden City is surrounded by a [tpl]convert|7.9|m|ft[/tpl] high city wall[tpl]cite video|people=China Central Television, The Palace Museum|date=2005|url=http://www.cctv.com/history/special/C15041/01/index.shtml|title=Gugong: "II. Ridgeline of a Prosperous Age"|medium=Documentary|location=China|publisher=CCTV[/tpl] and a [tpl]convert|6|m|ft[/tpl] deep by [tpl]convert|52|m|ft[/tpl] wide moat. The walls are [tpl]convert|8.62|m|ft[/tpl] wide at the base, tapering to [tpl]convert|6.66|m|ft[/tpl] at the top.p. 25, Yang (2003) These walls served as both defensive walls and retaining walls for the palace. They were constructed with a rammed earth core, and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides, with the interstices filled with mortar.p. 32, Yu (1984)
At the four corners of the wall sit towers (E) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.
The wall is pierced by a gate on each side. At the southern end is the main Meridian Gate (A).Technically, Tiananmen Gate is not part of the Forbidden City; it is a gate of the Imperial City. To the north is the Gate of Divine Might (B), which faces Jingshan Park. The east and west gates are called the "East Glorious Gate" (D) and "West Glorious Gate" (C). All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with a nine-by-nine array of golden door nails, except for the East Glorious Gate, which has only eight rows.p. 25, Yu (1984)
The Meridian Gate has two protruding wings forming three sides of a square (Wumen, or Meridian Gate, Square) before it.p. 33, Yu (1984) The gate has five gateways. The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads all the way from the Gate of China in the south to Jingshan in the north. Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way, except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding, and successful students after the Imperial Examination.

===Outer Court===

Traditionally, the Forbidden City is divided into two parts. The Outer Court ([tpl]linktext|外|朝[/tpl]) or Front Court ([tpl]linktext|前|朝[/tpl]) includes the southern sections, and was used for ceremonial purposes. The Inner Court ([tpl]linktext|内|廷[/tpl]) or Back Palace ([tpl]linktext|后|宫[/tpl]) includes the northern sections, and was the residence of the Emperor and his family, and was used for day-to-day affairs of state. (The approximate dividing line shown as red dash in the plan above.) Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central north–south axis.
Entering from the Meridian Gate, one encounters a large square, pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River, which is crossed by five bridges. Beyond the square stands the Gate of Supreme Harmony (F). Behind that is the Hall of Supreme Harmony Square. A three-tiered white marble terrace rises from this square. Three halls stand on top of this terrace, the focus of the palace complex. From the south, these are the Hall of Supreme Harmony ([tpl]linktext|太|和|殿[/tpl]), the Hall of Central Harmony ([tpl]linktext|中|和|殿[/tpl]), and the Hall of Preserving Harmony ([tpl]linktext|保|和|殿[/tpl]).p. 48, Yu (1984)
The Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, and rises some [tpl]convert|30|m|ft[/tpl] above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Yin, Yang and the Five Elements in the Forbidden City|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl] Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the "Xuanyuan Mirror".p. 253, Yu (1984) In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as Emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as coronations, investitures, and imperial weddings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/china/c/c2/c2a.htm|title=太和殿 (Hall of Supreme Harmony)|accessdate=2007-07-25|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]
The Hall of Central Peace is a smaller, square hall, used by the Emperor to prepare and rest before and during ceremonies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B484.htm|title=中和殿 (Hall of Central Harmony)|accessdate=2007-07-25|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl] Behind it, the Hall of Preserving Harmony, was used for rehearsing ceremonies, and was also the site of the final stage of the Imperial examination.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/China/phoweb/BuildingPage/1/B396.htm|title=保和殿 (Hall of Preserving Harmony)|accessdate=2007-07-25|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl] All three halls feature imperial thrones, the largest and most elaborate one being that in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.p. 70, Yu (1984)
At the centre of the ramps leading up to the terraces from the northern and southern sides are ceremonial ramps, part of the Imperial Way, featuring elaborate and symbolic bas-relief carvings. The northern ramp, behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony, is carved from a single piece of stone [tpl]convert|16.57|m|ft[/tpl] long, [tpl]convert|3.07|m|ft[/tpl] wide, and [tpl]convert|1.7|m|ft[/tpl] thick. It weighs some 200 tonnes and is the largest such carving in China. The southern ramp, in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, is even longer, but is made from two stone slabs joined together – the joint was ingeniously hidden using overlapping bas-relief carvings, and was only discovered when weathering widened the gap in the 20th century.For an explanation and illustration of the joint, see p. 213, Yu (1984)
In the south west and south east of the Outer Court are the halls of Military Eminence (H) and Literary Glory (J). The former was used at various times for the Emperor to receive ministers and hold court, and later housed the Palace's own printing house. The latter was used for ceremonial lectures by highly regarded Confucian scholars, and later became the office of the Grand Secretariat. A copy of the Siku Quanshu was stored there. To the north-east are the Southern Three Places ([tpl]linktext|南|三|所[/tpl]) (K), which was the residence of the Crown Prince.p. 49, Yu (1984)

===Inner Court===

The Inner Court is separated from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the City's main axis. It was the home of the Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes.p. 73, Yu (1984)
At the centre of the Inner Court is another set of three halls (L). From the south, these are the Palace of Heavenly Court ([tpl]linktext|乾|清|宮[/tpl]), Hall of Union, and the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. Smaller than the Outer Court halls, the three halls of the Inner Court were the official residences of the Emperor and the Empress. The Emperor, representing Yang and the Heavens, would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Empress, representing Yin and the Earth, would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. In between them was the Hall of Union, where the Yin and Yang mixed to produce harmony.p. 75, Yu (1984)
The Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the Gate of Heavenly Purity to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. However, beginning from the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived instead at the smaller Hall of Mental Cultivation (N) to the west, out of respect to the memory of the Kangxi Emperor. The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall.p. 78, Yu (1984) A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. Above the throne hangs a tablet reading "Justice and Honour" ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|正|大|光|明[/tpl]|p=zhèngdàguāngmíng[/tpl]).p. 51, Yang (2003)
The Palace of Earthly Tranquility ([tpl]linktext|坤|寧|宮[/tpl]) is a double-eaved building, 9 bays wide and 3 bays deep. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night.pp. 80–83, Yu (1984)
Between these two palaces is the Hall of Union, which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof. Stored here are the 25 Imperial Seals of the Qing dynasty, as well as other ceremonial items.
Behind these three halls lies the Imperial Garden (M). Relatively small, and compact in design, the garden nevertheless contains several elaborate landscaping features.p. 121, Yu (1984) To the north of the garden is the Gate of Divine Might.
Directly to the west is the Hall of Mental Cultivation (N). Originally a minor palace, this became the de facto residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the Grand Council and other key government bodies.p. 87, Yu (1984)
The north-eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity ([tpl]linktext|寧|壽|宮[/tpl]) (O), a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement. It mirrors the set-up of the Forbidden City proper and features an "outer court", an "inner court", and gardens and temples. The entrance to the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is marked by a glazed-tile Nine Dragons Screen.p. 115, Yu (1984) This section of the Forbidden City is being restored in a partnership between the Palace Museum and the World Monuments Fund, a long-term project expected to finish in 2017.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_12-17_qianlong_layout.pdf|title=Restoring an Intimate Splendor|author=Powell, Eric|publisher=World Monuments Fund[/tpl]

===Religion===

Religion was an importanting part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.p. 176, Yu (1984)
Another prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings.p. 177, Yu (1984) Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.pp. 189–193, Yu (1984)

===Surroundings===

The Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens. To the north is Jingshan Park, also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes.p. 20, Yu (1984)
To the west lies Zhongnanhai, a former garden centred on two connected lakes, which now serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China. To the north-west lies Beihai Park, also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular park.
To the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|太|庙[/tpl]|p=Tàimiào[/tpl]) and the Imperial Shrine of State ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|太|社|稷[/tpl]|p=Tàishèjì[/tpl]), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People's Cultural Hall[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/31019.htm|title=Working People's Cultural Palace|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=China.org.cn[/tpl] and Zhongshan Park (commemorating Sun Yat-sen) respectively.
To the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the Upright Gate ([tpl]zh|c=[tpl]linktext|端|门[/tpl]|p=Duānmén[/tpl]) and the more famous Tiananmen Gate, which is decorated with a portrait of Mao Zedong in the centre and two placards to the left and right: "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples". The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.
While development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City.[tpl]cite news|title=Forbidden City Buffer Zone Plan submitted to World Heritage conference|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2005-07/16/content_3225720.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-07-16|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese[/tpl] In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.[tpl]cite news|first=Yang|last=Li|title=Beijing confirms 7 World Heritage alternate items; Large scale reconstruction of Imperial City halted|url=http://www.bj.xinhuanet.com/bjpd_sdzx/2005-06/04/content_4374144.htm|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-06-04|accessdate=2007-04-13|language=Chinese[/tpl]

===Symbolism===

The design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles, and above all to symbolise the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:

==Collections==

The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City.[ref]
[tpl]cite book|last=Wen|first=Lianxi (ed.)|title=故宫物品点查报告 items auditing report|year=1925|publisher=Caretaker Committee of the Qing dynasty Imperial Family. Reprint (2004): Xianzhuang Book Company|location=Beijing|isbn=7-80106-238-8[/tpl][/ref] In addition, the imperial libraries housed countless rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties.[tpl]cite book|title=The forbidden city: the biography of a palace|author=Dorn, Frank|place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1970|oclc=101030|page=176[/tpl]
From 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.
After 1949, the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.[tpl]cite news|title=北京故宫与台北故宫 谁的文物藏品多？ (Beijing Palace Museum and Taipei Palace Museum: which collection is bigger?)|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/collection/2005-01/16/content_2467212.htm|work=Guangming Daily|publisher=Xinhua Net|date=2005-01-16|accessdate=2007-07-05|language=Chinese[/tpl]
Today, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum,[tpl]cite web|url=http://architecture.about.com/od/asiasouthasia/ig/Ancient-Beijing/Forbidden-City.htm|title=Forbidden City in Beijing, China|publisher=About.com: Architecture|author=Jackie Craven[/tpl] including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. According to an inventory of the Museum's collection conducted between 2004 and 2010, the Palace Museum holds a total of 1,807,558 artifacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected "valuable cultural relics."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-01/27/c_13709525.htm|title= Palace Museum puts its house in order|work=China Daily|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=2011-01-27|accessdate=2011-01-27[/tpl]
The Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain. These include imperial collections from the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty, as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. The Palace Museum holds about 320,000 pieces of porcelain from the imperial collection. The rest are almost all held in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Ceramics|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]
The Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Paintings|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl] The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The collection has subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.
The Palace Museum's bronze collection dates from the early Shang dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1,600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Bronzeware|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]
The Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workshops, Guangzhou (Canton) and Suzhou (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Timepieces|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]
Jade has a unique place in Chinese culture.[tpl]cite book|last=Laufer|first=Berthold|title=Jade: A Study in Chinese Archeology & Religion|year=1912|publisher=Reprint (1989): Peter Smith Pub Inc|location=Gloucestor MA|isbn=978-0-8446-5214-6[/tpl] The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Jade|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]
In addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/|title=Collection highlights – Palace artefacts|accessdate=2007-07-05|author=The Palace Museum|language=Chinese[/tpl]

==Influence==

The Forbidden City, the culmination of the two-thousand-year development of classical Chinese and East Asian architecture, has been influential in the subsequent development of Chinese architecture, as well as providing inspiration for many artistic works. Some specific examples include:
The Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction. In recent years, it has been depicted in films and television series. Some notable examples include:
The Forbidden City has also served as a performance venue. However, its use for this purpose is strictly limited, due to the heavy impact of equipment and performance on the ancient structures. Almost all performances said to be "in the Forbidden City" are held outside the palace walls.
