[[Eadberht II]]

CATEGORIES: Kentish monarchs, 8th-century English monarchs

Eadberht II, King of Kent, jointly with Sigered. He was apparently the son of Æðelberht II.
Eadberht II is known from three charters. As a result of confusion with Eadberht I, these charters have been subjected to tampering. One is dated 747 (the year before the death of Eadberht I), but witnessed by Archbishop Bregowine (761–764), as are the two undated charters, one of whichAnglo-Saxons.net S28. refers to Æðelberht II (atque clementissimi regis Æthelberti, et corporum sepulture, necnon et pro missarum solemniis exhibendis). Eadberht II also witnessed a charter of Sigered,Anglo-Saxon.net S32. dated 762.
