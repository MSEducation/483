==Recording history==

Odessey and Oracle was recorded in 1967 after the Zombies signed to the CBS label. They began work on the album in June 1967. Nine of the twelve songs were recorded at EMI's Abbey Road Studios. In August, when Abbey Road was unavailable, the Zombies temporarily shifted base to Olympic Studios where they recorded "Beechwood Park", "Maybe After He's Gone" and "I Want Her She Wants Me". They returned to Abbey Road Studios in September. The sessions ended in November and the final track to be recorded was "Changes".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yTCSX933VcC&pg=PA174#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Zombies: hung up on a dream : a biography 1962–1967 |page=174 |first=Claes |last=Johansen |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]
Because the album was recorded to a tight budget and deadline, the Zombies worked quickly in the studio, having rehearsed rigorously beforehand. This meant that there would be no outtakes or unused songs recorded during the sessions. Cello and Mellotron parts were added to "A Rose for Emily" but discarded at the final mixing stage.
Colin Blunstone and Paul Atkinson felt disillusioned and tempers flared during the recording of "Time of the Season". Blunstone was not at all keen on the song. When writer Rod Argent insisted he sing it a certain way, Blunstone's patience snapped and he effectively told Argent to sing it himself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://centraltrack.com/Music/3465/Back-From-The-Dead/The-Legendary-Zombies-Tell-Us-Why-They-Broke-Up-Before-Their-Biggest-Singles-Were-Ever-Released |title=Back From the Dead'' (2013) |first=Central |last=Track |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013[/tpl] Blunstone finally sang the vocal as required.
The album was recorded using a Studer four track machine, the same type of tape machine used on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.[tpl]cite book |author=Kevin Ryan |author2=Brian Kehew |title=Recording The Beatles |year=2006 |publisher=Curvebender |isbn=0-9785200-0-9[/tpl] Argent and White mixed the album down into mono, but when they handed the master to CBS, they were informed that a stereo mix was required. The recording budget having been spent, Argent and White used their own money to pay for the stereo mix. One major problem arose when it came time to mix "This Will Be Our Year" into stereo. The Zombies' original producer Ken Jones had dubbed live horn parts directly onto a mono mix. With the horns not having been recorded on the multi-track beforehand, a faked stereo mix had to be made of the mono master. The stereo mix was completed on 1 January 1968.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Morale within the band was at a low point at the end of the recording. Two singles, "Care of Cell 44" and "Friends of Mine", had been unsuccessful, and the band had a declining demand for live appearances, so after a final gig in mid-December 1967, the band split up.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7yTCSX933VcC&pg=PA201#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=201 |title=The Zombies: hung up on a dream : a biography 1962–1967 |first=Claes |last=Johansen |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |date=1 September 2001 |accessdate=28 March 2012[/tpl]

==Other versions==

For the 1997 Zombie Heaven box-set, "This Will Be Our Year" was given a full stereo mix, albeit minus the horns. This was made possible because The Zombies owned the multi track masters, which are in the possession of Chris White. Alternate mixes of "A Rose for Emily", featuring discarded overdubs of cello and Mellotron, appear on Zombie Heaven and the 30th anniversary release of the album.

==Release==

Odessey and Oracle was released in the UK on 19 April 1968 and in the US in June. The single "Time of the Season" became a surprise hit in early 1969, and Columbia Records (in the US) re-released Odessey in February, with a different album cover that severely cropped the original artwork.
American CBS boss Clive Davis initially decided not to release the album. However, at the urging of staff producer Al Kooper, the US CBS/Columbia Records label was eventually persuaded to release the album on their small Date Records subsidiary label. Kooper had picked up a copy of the album during a trip to London and, when he returned to America and played the album, loved it and believed it contained three hit singles. CBS chose to release "Butcher's Tale" as the first single in the States, feeling the song's anti-war theme would resonate with record-buyers due to the Vietnam War. After its release, "Time of the Season" slowly gained popularity before finally hitting big on the US charts in 1969, by which time Rod Argent and Chris White were busy with their new band, Argent.

==Album sleeve==

The album sleeve contains a short text written by keyboard player Argent quoting William Shakespeare's The Tempest.
The misspelling of "odyssey" in the title was the result of a mistake by the designer of the LP cover, Terry Quirk (who was the flatmate of bass player Chris White). The band tried to cover this up at the time of release by claiming the misspelling was intentional.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]

==Reunion performances==

Because the band split before the album was released, they never performed any of the songs onstage. However, due to the surprise success of "Time of the Season", several "fake" versions of the Zombies were created by unscrupulous promoters in 1969 to cash in on public demand to see and hear the band.http://zom.thefondfarewells.com/imposter.htm
The original five-piece line up reformed briefly in 1997 for the launch party of the Zombie Heaven boxset. They performed "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season" at London's Jazz Café. In 2001, Blunstone and Argent resurrected The Zombies as a recording and touring unit with ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford, his son Steve Rodford on drums and Keith Airey on guitar. The Blunstone-Argent line-up toured for several years, performing a number of songs from the album. There was one final reunion of the original five members in 2004 at a benefit gig for Paul Atkinson, and though Atkinson was very ill, he insisted on performing with them. Atkinson passed away in 2004.
In March 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album's release, the four surviving members performed Odessey and Oracle in its entirety for three shows at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London. They were joined by Keith Airey, Darian Sahanaja and various friends. The Zombies were insistent on recreating the sound as authentically as possible, hence the extra singers, Sahanaja filling in keyboard and mellotron parts via use of a Memotron, and Argent himself playing an original mellotron on a couple of numbers. Argent also tracked down a Victorian pump organ dating from 1896 so they could recreate White's "Butcher's Tale", the original organ having long since been given away or sold by White.
The 40th anniversary concerts were sold-out and critically acclaimed. One of the shows was recorded, filmed, and released on CD and DVD as Odessey and Oracle (Revisited). The reunion was so successful that they decided to reprise the show on a short four-date British tour in April 2009, playing in Glasgow, Bristol, Manchester, and ending on 25 April at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, which Argent stated would be the very last time the album would be performed on stage, at least until the songs are reverted to public domain.

==Reception==

===Critical===

While the album was received indifferently upon its release, it has since gone on to gain a cult following and become a critically respected album. In their retrospective review, Allmusic gave the album five stars out of five, calling it "one of the flukiest (and best) albums of the 1960s, and one of the most enduring long-players to come out of the entire British psychedelic boom". BBC Music wrote "To this day it remains a word-of mouth obscurity. But by those who know it's held in such regard that the remaining living members of the band are to perform it in its entirety this year, on the fortieth anniversary of its release." treblezine.com wrote "Odessey and Oracle, even by today's standards, is impossible to top."

===Legacy===

The first song on the album, "Care of Cell 44", has been covered by a number of artists including Elliott Smith and Of Montreal.
