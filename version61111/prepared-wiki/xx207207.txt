Perzinfotel (EAA-090) is a drug which acts as a potent NMDA antagonist.Kinney WA, Abou-Gharbia M, Garrison DT, Schmid J, Kowal DM, Bramlett DR, Miller TL, Tasse RP, Zaleska MM, Moyer JA. Design and synthesis of 2-(8,9-dioxo-2,6-diazabicyclo5.2.0non-1(7)-en-2-yl)-ethylphosphonic acid (EAA-090), a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, via the use of 3-cyclobutene-1,2-dione as an achiral alpha-amino acid bioisostere. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 1998 Jan 15;41(2):236-46. PMID 9457246 It has neuroprotective effects and has been investigated for the treatment of stroke,Sun L, Chiu D, Kowal D, Simon R, Smeyne M, Zukin RS, Olney J, Baudy R, Lin S. Characterization of two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists: EAA-090 (2-5.2.0non-1(7)-en2-ylethylphosphonic acid) and EAB-318 (R-alpha-amino-5-chloro-1-(phosphonomethyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-propanoic acid hydrochloride). Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 2004 Aug;310(2):563-70. PMID 15075380 but lacks analgesic effects.Brandt MR, Cummons TA, Potestio L, Sukoff SJ, Rosenzweig-Lipson S. Effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist perzinfotel 2-(8,9-dioxo-2,6-diazabicyclo5.2.0non-1(7)-en-2-yl)-ethylphosphonic acid on chemically induced thermal hypersensitivity. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 2005 Jun;313(3):1379-86. PMID 15764736 Nevertheless it shows a good safety profile compared to older drugs, and further research is ongoing.
