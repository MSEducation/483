He has worked for the BBC since 1972 and is known for his forthright and abrasive interviewing style, particularly when interrogating politicians. His regular appearances on the BBC Two's Newsnight programme have been criticised as aggressive, intimidating and condescending, yet also applauded as tough and incisive.[tpl]cite news |last=Mosey |first=Roger |title=BBC and the 'Paxman Problem' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4460000/newsid_4463800/4463837.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=20 April 2005|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] He is also the question master of University Challenge, succeeding Bamber Gascoigne when the programme was revived in 1994.
At the end of April 2014, Paxman announced that he is to leave Newsnight in June after 25 years of presenting the programme.Hannah Ellis-Petersen "Jeremy Paxman to quit Newsnight after 25 years", theguardian.com, 30 April 2014

==Early life and education==

Paxman was born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire. His mother, Joan McKay, née Dickson (1920–2009), was a housewife, and his father, Arthur Keith Paxman, worked in industry.[tpl]cite episode |title=Who Do You Think You Are? with Jeremy Paxman |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_s2_celeb_gallery_01.shtml|series=Who Do You Think You Are? |serieslink=Who Do You Think You Are?

He was brought up in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Peopleton, near Pershore, Worcestershire. In 1964, he went to Malvern College,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=34562 |title=Toffs at the top|work= Press Gazette|date= 16 June 2006|accessdate=  8 September 2010[/tpl] an independent school, and later read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/jeremy-paxman-the-outsider-462914.html|title=Jeremy Paxman: The outsider|work=The Independent|date=25 August 2007|accessdate=6 April 2010 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Burrell[/tpl] where he edited the undergraduate newspaper Varsity.[tpl]cite news |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |title=Now Paxman rails against the 'Scottish Raj' |work=The Independent |date=14 March 2005 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article6106.ece | location=London|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Rayner |first=Jay |title=Hah! |work=Comment |date=19 May 2002 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,718152,00.html | location=London|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] While at Cambridge, Paxman was briefly a member of the Labour Club.
Paxman was the subject, in January 2006, of an episode of the BBC genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are? The documentary concluded him to be descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman (man of peace, "Pax" translates from Latin as peace) to impress "the electorate." His maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying Paxman teary-eyed on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary Mackay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.[tpl]cite news |last=Peek |first=Sitala |title=The Day Paxman Shed a Tear |url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/features/newsfeatures/671528.the_day_paxman_shed_a_tear/ |work=Bucks Free Press |date=11 January 2006|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]

==Career==

===Journalism===

Paxman joined the BBC's graduate trainee programme in 1972. He started in local radio, at BBC Radio Brighton. He moved to Belfast, where he reported the Troubles. He moved to London in 1977. Two years later he transferred from the Tonight programme to Panorama. After five years reporting from places such as Beirut, Uganda and Central America, he read the Six O'Clock News for two years, before moving to BBC1's Breakfast Time programme.

===Newsnight===

Paxman became a presenter of Newsnight in 1989.
On 13 May 1997 he interviewed Michael Howard in what has become the programme's most recalled encounter.[tpl]fact|date=January 2014[/tpl] Howard, who had been Home Secretary until 13 days earlier, had held a meeting with Derek Lewis, head of Her Majesty's Prison Service, about the possible dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison, John Marriott. Howard, having given evasive answers, was asked by Paxman the same question[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] "Did you threaten to overrule him Lewis?" [tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] a total of twelve times in succession (14 if the first two inquiries worded somewhat differently and some time before the succession of 12 are included). Howard did not give a direct answer, instead repeatedly saying that he "did not overrule him", and ignoring the "threaten" part of the question.[tpl]cite news |last=Horrocks |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Horrocks |title=Paxman versus Howard |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/newsnight25/4182569.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=21 January 2005|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] 
Later, during a 20th anniversary edition of Newsnight, Paxman told Howard that he had simply been trying to prolong the interview since the next item in the running order wasn't ready.Paxman's explanation was that "by the time I'd asked the question five or six times... it was clear... that you Howard weren't going to answer it... at which point a voice came in my ear and said "The next piece of tape isn't cut, you'd better carry on with this for a while" and I'm afraid I couldn't think of anything else to ask you."
In 1998, Denis Halliday, a United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator, resigned his post in Iraq, describing the effects of his own organisation's sanctions as genocide.[tpl]cite news |title=Former U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Denis Halliday opposes U.N.'s sanctions |url=http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2001/01/16/halliday/ |publisher=CNN |date=16 January 2001|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] Paxman asked Halliday in a Newsnight interview, "Aren't you just an apologist for Saddam Hussein?" Later that year Paxman won a Royal Television Society award.
In 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair opted to make the case for the invasion of Iraq via questions from a TV studio audience, mediated by Paxman. The programme is chiefly remembered for the fact that Paxman asked Blair if he and U.S. President Bush prayed together. Blair replied, "No, Jeremy. We don't pray together."[tpl]cite news |last=Clarke |first=Steve |title=BBC America Banks on Brash Brit: Network Hopes Paxman is Next U.S. Hit |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967484.html?categoryId=2610&cs=1 |work=Variety |date=22 June 2007|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Assinder |first=Nick |title=Blair Tries to Shift Focus |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1987432.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=14 May 2002|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
During the 2005 general election some viewers complained to the BBC that Paxman's questioning of party leaders had been rude and aggressive.[tpl]cite news |last=Holder |first=Matt |title=Paxman Special Sparks Backlash |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4460000/newsid_4461600/4461649.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 2005|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=I'm Only Human, Says Paxman |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4490000/newsid_4493600/4493665.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2005|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] There was criticism of his 5am results interview with George Galloway. Referring to Oona King, whom Galloway had just defeated, Paxman asked more than once whether he was proud of having got rid of "one of the very few black women in Parliament."[tpl]cite news |title=Paxman v Galloway |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/blog/4519553.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=6 May 2005|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] Galloway cut the interview short. Paxman later made a taped guest appearance on the Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show challenging Galloway to a follow-up session "with or without your leotard" (Galloway, a Big Brother contestant at the time, had in an earlier much-publicised stunt during the show dressed up in a leotard whilst drinking milk from a bowl on the floor).[tpl]cite news |title=Out of the frying pan into the ire|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jan/26/otherparties.bigbrother |work=The Guardian |date=26 January 2006 | location=London | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]
On 26 June 2012 he interviewed the Economic Secretary to the Treasury Chloe Smith about Chancellor George Osborne's decision that day to delay plans to increase fuel duty. Paxman questioned the apparent change in her views on fuel duty.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18606060 |title=BBC Newsnight Interview |publisher=BBC |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012[/tpl] Senior politicians, including John Prescott and Nadine Dorries questioned Osborne's judgement for sending a junior minister onto the programme in place of himself.[tpl]cite news|first=Ben|last= Quinn |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/27/tory-minister-chloe-smith-newsnight-disaster?newsfeed=true|title= George Osborne branded a coward after Tory minister's Newsnight disaster|publisher= Guardian Media Group|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 27 June 2012|accessdate= 29 June 2012|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18608133 |publisher=BBC News |title=David Cameron denies George Osborne 'hid' after fuel U-turn  |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012[/tpl]
The BBC announced Paxman's departure from Newsnight at the end of April 2014. He had told BBC Head of News James Harding and BBC Director General Tony Hall that he wished to leave in July 2013, but agreed to stay on Newsnight for another year after the programme had been damaged by the Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals."Jeremy Paxman to quit BBC Two's Newsnight", BBC News, 30 April 2014 In his statement Paxman commented: "After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people."
Paxman's brusque manner is not restricted to political interviews. When around 2005 Newsnight's editor decided to broadcast brief weather forecasts instead of financial reports he openly ridiculed the decision: "And for tonight's weather – it's April, what do you expect?".[tpl]cite news|title=Paxo's Weather Report|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/3616249/Paxos-weather-report.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=16 April 2005 | location=London | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl] The financial reports were re-introduced after a few weeks.

===Other TV work===

Paxman has presented the weekly TV programme review Did You See?, You Decide and, since 1994, University Challenge, bringing him the distinction of "longest-serving current quizmaster on British TV."[tpl]cite web|title=UK Game Show Records|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/UK_Game_Show_Records#Hosts|publisher=UKGameShows.com|accessdate=4 July 2007[/tpl] He presented on BBC America and BBC World a weekly compilation of highlights from the domestic edition of Newsnight from February 2008 until shortly after the 2008 U.S. election, when the American programme was cancelled. The programme is still aired on BBC World.[tpl]cite news|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|title=Paxman Crosses the Pond|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/bbc/story/0,,2105601,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2007 | location=London|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
In April 2006 The Sun claimed that Paxman earned £800,000 for his Newsnight job and £240,000 for presenting University Challenge, bringing his TV earnings to a yearly total of £1,040,000. This was one of a series of BBC salary leaks in the tabloid press that prompted an internal BBC investigation.[tpl]cite news|title=BBC Probes DJ Salary Disclosure|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4919678.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=19 April 2006|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
Paxman appeared as himself in an episode of BBC comedy The Thick of It which aired in January 2007.

Beginning on 15 February 2009, his four part documentary The Victorians was transmitted on BBC One. The series explores Victorian art and culture.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/16/tv-ratings-jeremy-paxman-victorians|title= TV ratings: Paxman's Victorians launches with more than 4m|work= The Guardian|date= 16 February 2009|accessdate= 17 February 2009 | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood[/tpl] From 27 February until 26 March 2012, BBC One broadcast Paxman's series Empire, examining the history and legacy of the British Empire.
In 2014 Paxman presented Britain's Great War, an accompaniment to his 2013 book Great Britain's Great War.

===Books===

Paxman's first book, A Higher Form of Killing (1982), written with then BBC colleague and friend Robert Harris, arose out of an edition of the Panorama programme they had made together on biological and chemical warfare. In a revised 2002 version they asserted that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons. In 1985, Paxman published Through the Volcanoes: A Central American Journey, an eyewitness account of people, places and politics. Friends in High Places: Who Runs Britain? (1991) was the result of numerous detailed interviews with the powerful or highly influential, what used to be called The Establishment. Paxman's The English: A Portrait of a People (1999) was not the first of his books to be greeted with wide critical acclaim. The Political Animal: An Anatomy (2003), again based on extensive interviews, examines the motivations and methods of those who constitute the author's professional prey: Westminster politicians.
The otherwise-republican Paxman's On Royalty, which entailed the cooperation of Britain's royal family, became by the time it was published in 2006, to his own surprise and somewhat to the surprise of others, a defence of the country's constitutional monarchy. His recent books have been big sellers. His book, The Victorians: Britain through the Paintings of the Age, published in 2009, was accompanied by a BBC documentary series. In his introduction, Paxman acknowledged that the Irish writer Neil Hegarty had played a significant role in editing the book and bringing it to completion. Paxman stated that since all television is a "collaborative exercise", it was "rather silly for this book – which accompanies a television series – to appear with only one name on the cover."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/mar/20/jeremy-paxman-victorians-neil-hegarty |work=The Guardian |title=Jeremy Paxman too busy to finish his own best-seller |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=20 March 2009 | location=London|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] Paxman's most recent book is a study of the British Empire, Empire: What Ruling the World Did to the British.[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/05/empire-ruling-world-paxman-review| title = Jeremy Paxman's survey of British imperial rule is sharp and engaging| last= Porter|first= Bernard| date = 5 October 2011| accessdate = 11 October 2011| work = The Guardian| location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/09/jeremy-paxman-felt-myself-outsider | title=Jeremy Paxman: 'I've always felt myself to be an outsider' | work=The Guardian | date=9 October 2011 | accessdate=13 October 2011 | last=Moss|first= Stephen | location=London[/tpl]

===Radio===

Paxman presented the flagship BBC Radio 4 show Start the Week from 1998 to 2002.

==Paxman and the BBC==

While John Birt was Director General of the BBC, the British press from time to time reported Paxman's criticism of his boss. The former, suspected at first to be an outsider brought in by a hostile government to supervise the BBC's break-up and ultimate sell-off, in turn publicly questioned the confrontational approach, as he saw it, of certain TV and radio interviewers. This was seen at the time as coded criticism of Paxman himself and of his BBC colleague John Humphrys.[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/diary-fired-by-john-birts-phillippic-1572182.html | title= DIARY: Fired by John Birt's Phillippic | work=The Independent | location=London | first=John | last=Walsh | date=9 February 1995 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2000/aug/07/broadcasting.mondaymediasection | title= I don't snort | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Merope | last=Mills | date=7 August 2000 | accessdate=6 May 2010[/tpl]
On 24 August 2007 Paxman delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival.[tpl]cite news|last=Paxman|first=Jeremy|title=MacTaggart Memorial Lecture: Never Mind the Scandals: What's It All For?|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Media/documents/2007/08/24/MacTaggartLecture.pdf|format=PDF|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2007 | location=London[/tpl] In it he was critical of much of contemporary TV in Britain. He expressed concern that as a consequence of recent production scandals the medium was rapidly losing public trust. Speaking of prime minister Tony Blair's criticism of the mass media at the time he left office, Paxman asserted that often press and broadcasting may be "oppositional" in relation to the government of the day this could only benefit democracy. Those Reithian goals, to "inform, educate and entertain," still remained valid. Paxman took the opportunity to dismiss as "inaccurate" the attribution to himself, which was, in fact, Louis Heren,[tpl]cite news|title=No disrespect|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13135192|work=The Economist|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] of the oft-quoted "Why is this lying bastard lying to me?" as the supposed dominant thought in his mind when interviewing senior politicians. He called on the television industry to rediscover a sense of purpose.
In November 2012, Paxman publicly defended George Entwistle after his resignation as Director-General of the BBC in connection with a Newsnight report which falsely implicated Lord McAlpine in the North Wales child abuse scandal. Paxman claimed Entwistle had been "brought low by cowards and incompetents" and criticised appointments of "biddable people" to the BBC in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, as well as cuts to BBC programme budgets and bloated BBC management.[tpl]cite web|title=Jeremy Paxman: George Entwistle brought low by "cowards and incompetents"|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/11/jeremy-paxman-george-entwistle-brought-low-cowards-and-incompetents|work=New Statesman|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=10 November 2012[/tpl]
In August 2013 Paxman appeared on Newsnight with a beard, causing a Twitter trend when the broadcaster accused the BBC of pogonophobia.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/is-the-bbc-pogonophobic-jeremy-paxmans-beard-raises-a-hairy-issue-8760547.html |title=Is the BBC pogonophobic?

==Awards and honours==

In 1996 Paxman received BAFTA's Richard Dimbleby Award for "outstanding presenter in the factual arena." Two years later he won the Royal Television Society's Interviewer of the Year Award for his Newsnight interview (see above) with Michael Howard, as well as the Broadcasting Press Guild's award for best "non-acting" performer. He gained another Richard Dimbleby Award in 2000 and was nominated for the award in 2001 and 2002. He won the Royal Television Society TV journalism presenter of the year award in 2002 and 2007.
Paxman was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Leeds in the summer of 1999 and in December that year received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford.[tpl]cite news|title=University Honours Paxman and Birt|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/558355.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=10 December 1999|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] In 2006 he received an honorary doctorate from the Open University. Among those at the ceremony were three members of the Open University's 1999 University Challenge team. Paxman is a Fellow by special election of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and an Honorary Fellow of his alma mater, St. Catharine's College, Cambridge.

==Personal life==

Paxman lives with his partner Elizabeth Ann Clough in Stonor, southeast Oxfordshire. They have three children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/may/19/foodanddrink.television|title=Profile: Jeremy Paxman|date=19 May 2002|work=The Observer|accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl] He supports Leeds United and he also enjoys fly fishing in his leisure time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/jeremypaxman.shtml |title=Jeremy Paxman |publisher= BBC Press Office|date=June 2008|archivedate=9 November 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101109045526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/news/jeremypaxman.shtml|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl] He is vice-chairman of the Wild Trout Trust conservation charity. He is also a patron of the charity Sustrans.
When, in his twenties, Paxman unsuccessfully applied for the vacant editorship of the Labour-supporting weekly, the New Statesman, he said that in his youth he considered himself a socialist.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/dec/17/labour.labour1997to99 |title=Focus: Is there a liberal elite? | Politics|work= The Observer |date= 17 December 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010 | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/09/bbc-television|title=Decca Aitkenhead meets Jeremy Paxman|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|date=9 February 2009|work=The Guardian|page=6|accessdate=9 February 2009 | location=London[/tpl] He had previously stood as a Communist candidate in his school elections. More recently, he has been described as "the archetypal floating voter", and Jon Snow once said that Paxman's greatest strength was being "not very political". Paxman himself has stated that he has no dominant political ideology:
 
 I do understand we have to have a government, and I do firmly believe in democracy. So it's not true to say I'm not a political person. I am a political person. But I'm not a party political person. I don't believe there is a monopoly of wisdom in any one party. I suppose as one gets older – I would have described it at the age of 21 as the process of selling out, but another way of looking at it is to say, actually, the world is not a very simple place, and that as you get older simple-minded solutions seem less attractive.

==Criticism==

Paxman has been publicly criticised over his and his partner's home help arrangements. Having advertised on a Romanian website, they hired two people at below minimum wage without a written contract. While this is not illegal in the UK if employees live in, Paxman, known for grilling interviewees on workers' rights issues, was criticised when his employees went public, claiming to have been paid "the bare minimum".[tpl]cite news|last=Saner|first=Emine|title=Paxo's dirty laundry gets a very public airing|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/12/5|work=The Guardian|date=12 February 2008 | location=London|accessdate=15 April 2013[/tpl]
Paxman's controversial remarks about the Scots provoked anger at parliamentary level. Twenty Scottish members of parliament signed a House of Commons motion in March 2005 condemning him for comparing supposed Scottish dominance at Westminster to British rule in India: a "Scottish Raj" was running the UK, said Paxman. The row came right after a Cabinet minister had complained that the Newsnight host had been offensive about his Glasgow accent.
