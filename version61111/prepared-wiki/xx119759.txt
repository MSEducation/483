The small company was bought by Bristol-Myers in 1931.

==Branding as "Ban"==

In the late 1940s, an employee (Helen Diserens) developed an applicator based on the newly invented ball-point pen. In 1952, the company began marketing the product under the name Ban Roll-On. In 1958, the product was launched in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations as Mum Rollette.
The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the United States, but is again widely available.
