[[Lateral tarsal artery]]

CATEGORIES: Arteries of the lower limb

The lateral tarsal artery (tarsal artery) arises from the dorsalis pedis, as that vessel crosses the navicular bone; it passes in an arched direction lateralward, lying upon the tarsal bones, and covered by the Extensor digitorum brevis; it supplies this muscle and the articulations of the tarsus, and anastomoses with branches of the arcuate, anterior lateral malleolar and lateral plantar arteries, and with the perforating branch of the peroneal artery.
It runs with the lateral terminal branch of deep fibular nerve.
