Upon graduation from New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Lupton secured immediate stage work. Then he was signed as a contract player at MGM in Hollywood. Lupton was lanky and handsome like James Stewart or Henry Fonda but never achieved similar fame.

On October 30, 1959, Lupton was cast in the episode "Client Peter Warren" of the ABC western series Black Saddle, starring Peter Breck as gunfighter-turned-lawyer Clay Culhane. Lupton portrays Peter Warren, a man accused by townspeople of starting a fire that caused the death of his estranged wife's wealthy and respected aunt. The motive is inheritance of joint property from the aunt's pending estate. Culhane agrees to defend Warren but instead finds evidence that Warren had been present at the scene of the fire. Ed Nelson portrays Lee Coogan, a former suitor of Mrs. Mary Warren (played by Aneta Corsaut), who is also determined to show Warren's guilt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0526611/|title=Black Saddle: "Client Peter Warren", October 30, 1959|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 4, 2012[/tpl]
