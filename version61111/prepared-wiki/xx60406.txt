==Major characters==

===Artemis Fowl===

Artemis Fowl II uses his intelligence to build his family fortune through crime. This stems from his family, who have been criminals for generations.[tpl]AF Cite Book | booknumber = 1 | pages = yes | startpage = 28 | endpage = 29[/tpl] Artemis is cold, cynical, and distant even from his closest friend and bodyguard, Butler. He is very pale with raven black hair and blue eyes.

===Butler===

Domovoi Butler is the Fowl's loyal manservant and Artemis' bodyguard. Butler accompanies Artemis around the world on his adventures and possesses a wide variety of contacts he uses to aid Artemis. He also has a little sister who appears in a couple of books.

===Holly Short===

Holly is a determined, forthright elf and the only female member of LEPrecon, the recon division of the LEP. Holly is three feet tall and slender, with nut brown skin and crew-cut style auburn hair. She has often helped Artemis and Butler save the human and fairy worlds.

===Foaly===

Foaly is a centaur, technical genius, and computer geek. He works for the LEP (Lower Elements Police), the fairy authorities, and is in charge of preventing humankind from discovering the fairy civilization. He designs weaponry, wings, and other technical gadgets that the LEP need. He frequently pokes fun at Commander Julius Root. He is 'hitched' or married to a centaur named Caballine, and apparently has foals.

===Opal Koboi===

Opal is a deranged pixie whose dream is world-domination and the destruction of the LEP. A prodigy, she built Koboi Laboratories, a technology company, which she used to crush her father's company. Featured in several of the Artemis Fowl books as the main antagonist. She detests Foaly.

===Mulch Diggums===

Mulch is a kleptomaniac, criminal dwarf who has been involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much better. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP or Lower Elements Police against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.

===Julius Root===

Julius Root is the Commander of the reconnaissance branch of the LEP. Known for his ruddy face (hence his nickname, "Beetroot") and extremely short temper, he commands Holly Short on many missions until Koboi kills him in The Opal Deception and frames Holly Short.

==Themes==

Colfer has said in interviews that the series is about Artemis growing up. Themes of greed, trust, and the difference between good and evil are also present in the books.

==Critical reception==

Colfer summed up the series as "Die Hard with fairies."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Frederick |first1=Heather Vogel |date=23 April 2001 |title='Die Hard' With Fairies |journal=Publishers Weekly |volume=248 |issue=17 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20010423/32877-die-hard-with-fairies-.html |accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl] Critics call the series "the new Harry Potter",[tpl]cite web|title=Film Runs Afoul on Artemis – Fi Sci – Your Source for Sci Fi Goodness – Sci fi/ Fantasy News|url=http://www.fi-sci.com/movies/film-runs-afoul-on-artemis|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090327163742/http://www.fi-sci.com/movies/film-runs-afoul-on-artemis|archivedate = 27 March 2009|accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl] although Colfer does not agree.[tpl]cite news |title=Elf and happiness |first=Kate |last=Kellaway |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/may/13/booksforchildrenandteenagers.features |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2001 |location=London |accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl] Kate Kellaway of The Observer called the first book "a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention – as if Colfer were as much an inspired boffin as a writer". Time.com said, "Artemis Fowl is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime",[tpl]cite journal|last=Shields|first=Elinor|title=A Magical Myth|journal=Time Magazine|date=7 May 2011|volume=157|issue=18|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,108134,00.html|accessdate=24 March 2012[/tpl] while The New York Times Book Review said that "Colfer has done enormously, explosively well".[tpl]cite news|last=Maguire|first=Gregory|title=Children's Books|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/17/reviews/010617.17kidd.html|accessdate=24 March 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 June 2001[/tpl]
