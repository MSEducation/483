Ian Bruce Carrick Kiernan AO (born 4 October 1940) is an environmentalist  and also a builder who organised the Clean Up Australia campaign, and in 1993 a similar Clean Up the World operation which attracted participation from 30 million volunteers in 80 countries.
Kiernan was born in Sydney to George Arthur and Leslie Katherine Kiernan. He was educated at The Scots College in Sydney, The Armidale School in northern New South Wales, and the Sydney Technical College,[tpl]cite encyclopedia| editor = Suzannah Pearce| encyclopedia = Who's Who in Australia Live!| title = KIERNAN Ian Bruce Carrick| accessdate = 23 September 2007| date = 17 November 2006| year = 2007| publisher = Crown Content Pty Ltd| location = North Melbourne, Vic[/tpl] where he trained as a builder.
Kiernan is a passionate yachtsman, sailing competitively for more than 40 years and representing Australia at the Admiral's, Southern Cross, Dunhill, Clipper, Kenwood and Trans Pacific Cup competitions[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]. In 1986/87 Kiernan represented Australia in the BOC Challenge solo around-the-world yacht race. He finished 6th out of a fleet of 25 yachts from 11 nations, setting an Australian record for a solo circumnavigation of the world[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl].
It was during the BOC Challenge that Kiernan saw and was appalled by the amount of rubbish choking the world's oceans.  With the support of a committee of friends, he organised a community event – Clean Up Sydney Harbour on Sunday 8 January 1989. 40,000 volunteers turned out to help clean up.

==Clean-up==

The success of the first Clean Up event in 1989 sparked national interest in the simple but effective community-based idea. In 1990, the first Clean Up Australia Day took place on Sunday, 21 January. Again, the response of Australians was astounding. More than 300,000 Australians volunteered their time to help make a difference to the health of their local environment.
Since then more than 7 million people have heeded the call through annual Clean Up Australia Days, Friday Schools Clean Up Days and Business Clean Ups.
Clean up Australia's Mission is "To inspire and work with communities to clean up and fix up our Earth".
Kiernan met with the United Nations Environment Plan to discuss a global Clean Up. Then Clean Up the World event took place in 1993. Over three days (17–19 September), over 30 million people from 80 nations turned out to Clean Up their world in May 2009. Currently 40 million people from 120 countries taking part in the annual Clean Up the World in May 2009.
