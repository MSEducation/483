[[Church–Turing–Deutsch principle]]

In computer science and quantum physics, the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle (CTD[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] principle) is a stronger, physical form of the Church–Turing thesis formulated by David Deutsch in 1985. The principle states that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process. The principle was originally stated by Deutsch with respect to finitary machines and processes. He immediately observed that classical physics, which makes use of the concept of real numbers, cannot be simulated by a Turing machine, which can only represent computable reals. Deutsch proposed that quantum computers may actually obey CTD, assuming that the laws of quantum physics can completely describe every physical process.
