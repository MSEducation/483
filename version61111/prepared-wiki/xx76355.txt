The Pratt & Whitney PW2000, also known by the military designation F117, is a series of high-bypass turbofan aero engines with a thrust range from 37,000 to 43,000 lbf (165 to 190 kN). Built by Pratt & Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pw.utc.com/Content/PW2000_Engine/pdf/B-1-5_commercial_pw2000.pdf |title=PW2000 Engine: Lowest Operating Cost for Mid-Range-Thrust Engines |publisher=Pratt & Whitney |format=PDF; 28 KB |date=October 2012| accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]

==Design and development==

The PW2000 is a dual-spool, axial air flow, annular combustion, high by-pass turbofan with a dual-channel Full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. It was certified in 1984 as the first civilian FADEC-controlled aviation engine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pw.utc.com/PW2000_Engine |title=PW2000 Engine |publisher=Pratt & Whitney |accessdate=10 July 2013[/tpl]
MTU Aero Engines holds a 21.2% stake in the engine, having developed the low-pressure turbine and turbine exit casing as well as producing critical parts of the low-pressure turbine, the turbine exhaust casing, high-pressure compressor and high-pressure turbine components.
The first PW2000 series engine, the PW2037, powered the Boeing 757-200 and entered service with Delta Air Lines as the launch customer for the civil aviation version of the engine.
Other than the 757, the PW2000 series engines also power the C-17 Globemaster III military transport; the United States Department of Defense designation for the engine is F117,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-seeks-to-bypass-aircraft-engine-manufacturers-369201/|title=USAF seeks to bypass aircraft engine manufacturers|last=Majumdar|first=Dave|date=March 7, 2012|work=FlightGlobal|accessdate=2012-09-05[/tpl] with the specific variant used on the C-17 being the F117-PW-100.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=86|title=Factshets: C-17 Globemaster III|publisher=United States Air Force|accessdate=2012-09-05|archiveurl=http://archive.is/yqod|archivedate=2012-07-20[/tpl]  The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991.
The PW2000 also powered the abortive Ilyushin Il-96M; the engine first flew on the Il-96M in 1993.
On October 16, 2008 the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue urgent new inspection procedures on the PW2037 model of the engine, following an uncontained turbine failure event in August 2008. The NTSB recommended that the FAA order PW2037 engines inspected beyond a threshold of flight hours or flight cycles less than that of the event engine, and be reinspected at regular intervals.NTSB Safety Recommendation A-08-85 Urgent and -86, National Transportation Safety Board, Oct 16, 2008
The latest build standard, named PW2043, launched in 1994. It provides over 43,000 lbf (190 kN) of thrust. Previous generations of engines can be converted to the PW2043 version.
