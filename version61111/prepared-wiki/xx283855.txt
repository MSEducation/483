==Background==

When Martin emerged with the duet "Separate Lives" with Phil Collins, Martin signed with Atlantic Records for a two-record deal. Her 1986 self-titled debut album Marilyn Martin peaked at #72 on the Billboard 200, whilst the single "Night Moves" entered the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100.[tpl]cite web|author=Artist Biography by Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marilyn-martin-mn0000268538/awards |title=Marilyn Martin | Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=1954-05-04 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl] In 1988, Atlantic released Martin's second album, This is Serious, which included "Possessive Love" However, the album and its singles did not sell very well, with "Possessive Love" failing to make a chart impact.
"Possessive Love" was written purposely for Martin, at the suggestion to Madonna by Leonard. However the song has also been reputed to have been originally written and demoed by Madonna during the sessions for her 1987 film/soundtrack Who's That Girl but then got scrapped. The original demo sung by Madonna remains unreleased, and in 1988 the track was given to Martin, who recorded the track with Leonard. Martin's version features longtime backup singer Donna DeLory. A year later, Martin sang backing vocals for Madonna's hit 1989 single "Cherish" from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer.[tpl]cite web|author=Bart Vanmaele |url=http://www.mad-eyes.net/disco/misc/possessive-love.htm |title=Possessive Love - Mad-Eyes - Madonna outtake song lyrics, Marilyn Martin |publisher=Mad-Eyes |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]"Possessive Love" CMRRA entry retrieved November 22, 2010[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In an exclusive interview with Martin by Breathe Cast writer Timothy Yap, one question spoke of the song, stating "You also got a chance to record an original song by Madonna and Patrick Leonard called "Possessive Love" and you did sing backing vocals for Madonna on her "Like a Prayer" album. How did you get to work with Madonna? What was it like working with her? Are you still in contact with her?" Martin replied "I met Pat Leonard when I began the search for a producer for my second album. He's the one who approached Madonna with the idea of writing a song for me and she graciously agreed. Pat called me one day while he was working on her "Like a Prayer" album and asked if I would like to come and sing backgrounds... talk about an "Are you kidding?" moment!! She was impressive, to say the least, very in charge. That was the only time I met her."[tpl]cite web|url=http://breathecast.christianpost.com/articles/exclusive-interview-marilyn-martin-madonna-jesus-christ-7547/ |title=An Exclusive Interview with Marilyn Martin: From Madonna to Jesus Christ : Interviews : breathecast |publisher=Breathecast.christianpost.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]

==Critical reception==

Alex Henderson of Allmusic reviewed the This is Serious album, and stated "Even though "This is Serious" is very much a pop/rock record, there are hints of R&B on spirited, infectious tracks like "Try Me," the title song, and the single "Possessive Love" (which Madonna co-wrote). And that isn't surprising because Martin was quick to point out that she grew up listening to R&B extensively. "This is Serious" had the makings of a hit, but surprisingly, the album turned out to be a commercial disappointment. Even though "Marilyn Martin" is the more essential of her two albums, "This is Serious" is also quite enjoyable."[tpl]cite web|author=Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-serious-mw0000199692 |title=This Is Serious - Marilyn Martin | Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]
On April 10, 1988, staff writer Deborah Wilker of the South Florida Sun - Sentinel reviewed the album and stated "Possessive Love, the best track from her second album, bares striking similarities to Madonna's style, with good reason: The tune was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/88679166.html?dids=88679166:88679166&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+10%2C+1988&author=DEBORAH+WILKER%2C+Staff+Writer&pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&desc=SEXY%2C+HARD-EDGED+STEWART&pqatl=google |title=Sexy, Hard-Edged Stewart |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1988-04-10 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]http://www.google.co.uk/#bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&fp=d28f706d37e3f4ce&q=Possessive+Love%2C+the+best+track+from+her+second+album%2C+bares+striking+similarities+to+Madonna%27s+style%2C+with+good+reason:+The+tune+was+written+by+Madonna+and&tbm=nws&tbs=ar:1
In a review of Martin's 2012 album Trust, Love, Pray, Breathe Cast writer Timothy Yap mentioned the song, stating "After her bubbly girlish pop image on "Possessive Love," her leather slick rock chick look on "Night Moves" or her girl-next-door country gal vulnerability on "Through His Eyes," what is the musical direction of this new record? She answers it in the title of one of her songs, "every way and always." Like a buffet of styles, there is much to enjoy here: from string-laden big balladry to jaunty soul-filled funk to straight ahead vintage pop."[tpl]cite web|url=http://breathecast.christianpost.com/articles/marilyn-martin-trust-love-pray-album-review-6415/ |title=Review of Marilyn Martin’s "Trust, Love, Pray" Album : Reviews : breathecast |publisher=Breathecast.christianpost.com |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2013-08-11[/tpl]
