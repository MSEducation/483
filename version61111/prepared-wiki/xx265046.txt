Food Feuds is a weekly series hosted by Iron Chef Michael Symon that premiered on Food Network October 10, 2010. The show features food rivalries or "feuds" between local restaurants in cities around the United States.

==Synopsis==

In each episode Michael Symon travels from city to city to settle some of the most famous food rivalries/feuds in the country. Symon visits both establishments, see how the specialties are prepared, tries both dishes up for the challenge, then talks with local food critics and fans to help him decide who should win. At the end, a final critique of the specialty is conducted by Symon himself, the only judge. He bases the food on three criteria: appearance, taste, and overall product while both challengers stand by to find out if they will receive the Food Feud trophy and be crowned the champion.
