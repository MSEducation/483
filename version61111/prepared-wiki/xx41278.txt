CATEGORIES: Inflorescence vegetables, Brassica oleracea, Cultivars, Edible plants

Cauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea, in the family Brassicaceae. It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed. Typically, only the head (the white curd) is eaten. The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds. 
Its name is from Latin caulis (cabbage) and flower,.[tpl]cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cauliflower | title = Cauliflower: definition | publisher = dictionary.com | accessdate = 2008-11-22 | year = 2006 [/tpl] Brassica oleracea also includes broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, though they are of different cultivar groups.
For such a highly modified plant, cauliflower has a long history. François Pierre La Varenne employed chouxfleurs in Le cuisinier françois.Wheaton, Barbara Ketcham (1996) Savoring the Past: the French kitchen and table from 1300 to 1789, Touchstone, p. 118, ISBN 0684818574. They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century, and are featured in Olivier de Serres' Théâtre de l'agriculture (1600), as cauli-fiori "as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy",Wheaton, Barbara Ketcham (1996) Savoring the Past: the French kitchen and table from 1300 to 1789, Touchstone, p. 66, ISBN 0684818574. but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV.Toussaint-Samat, Maguelonne (2009) A History of Food, 2nd ed., John Wiley & Sons, pp. 625f, ISBN 144430514X.

==Classification and identification==

===Major groups===

There are four major groups of cauliflower.[tpl]cite journal|author=Crisp, P.|title=The use of an evolutionary scheme for cauliflowers in screening of genetic resources|journal=Euphytica|year=1982|volume=31|page=725|doi=10.1007/BF00039211|issue=3[/tpl]

===Varieties===

There are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.[tpl]cite web| author=Farnham, M.|url =http://cuke.hort.ncsu.edu/cucurbit/wehner/vegcult/cauliflower.html |year=2007|title = Vegetable Cultivar Descriptions for North America:Cauliflower| accessdate=2007-09-19[/tpl]

==Nutrition==

Cauliflower is low in fat, low in carbohydrates but high in dietary fiber, folate, water, and vitamin C, possessing a high nutritional density.[tpl]cite web | url = http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2956?qlookup=11135&format=Full&max=25&man=&lfacet=&new=1 | title = Cauliflower Nutrient Data Table | work = USDA | accessdate = 15 May 2013 | date = 2003[/tpl]
Cauliflower contains several phytochemicals, common in the cabbage family, that may be beneficial to human health.
Boiling reduces the levels of these compounds, with losses of 20–30% after five minutes, 40–50% after ten minutes, and 75% after thirty minutes. However, other preparation methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on the compounds.[tpl]cite news |author=Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick| title= Research Says Boiling Broccoli Ruins Its Anti Cancer Properties. |date=2007-05-15 | url =http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/research_says_boiling/[/tpl]
A high intake of cauliflower has been associated with reduced risk of aggressive prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author =  Kirsh VA, Peters U, Mayne ST, Subar AF, Chatterjee N, Johnson CC, Hayes RB | pmid = 17652276 | title = Prospective study of fruit and vegetable intake and risk of prostate cancer | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 99 | issue = 15 | pages = 1200–9 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djm065 [/tpl]

==Cooking==

Cauliflower can be roasted, boiled, fried, steamed, or eaten raw. Steaming or microwaving better preserves anticancer compounds than boiling. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are removed, leaving only the florets. The leaves are also edible, but are most often discarded.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://extension-horticulture.tamu.edu/extension/newsletters/vpmnews/apr02/art4apr.html|last = Stephens | first = MJ | title = Secondary Edible Parts of Vegetables | journal = Vegetarian | volume = 5 | year = 1998[/tpl] The florets should be broken into similar-sized pieces so they are cooked evenly. After eight minutes of steaming, or five minutes of boiling, the florets should be soft, but not mushy (depending on size). Stirring while cooking can break the florets into smaller, uneven pieces.
Low carbohydrate dieters can use cauliflower as a reasonable substitute for potatoes or rice; while they can produce a similar texture, or mouth feel, they lack the starch of the originals.

==Fractal dimension==

Cauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension,Walker, John. (2005-03-22) Fractal Food. Fourmilab.ch. Retrieved on 2013-09-03.Description of the Julia sets of the cabbage fractal. Iwriteiam.nl. Retrieved on 2013-09-03. predicted to be about 2.8.[tpl]cite journal| author = Kim, Sang-Hoon |arxiv=cond-mat/0409763| title = Fractal Structure of a White Cauliflower| journal = Journal of Korean physical society | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 474–477 | url = http://icpr.snu.ac.kr/resource/wop.pdf/J01/2005/046/R02/J012005046R020474.pdf[/tpl]

==History==

The first reliable reference to cauliflower is found in the writings of the Arab Muslim scientists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar, in the 12th and 13th centuries.[tpl]cite journal|last=Fenwick|first=G.
