==Performances==

===Football===

The band forms the core of the student section at intercollegiate football games hosted by Vanderbilt at Vanderbilt Stadium and  performs at all Vanderbilt Commodores home football games, as well as a select number of away games. 
The Spirit of Gold works with the Office of the Dean of Students to coordinate the band's performances at football games.  The band has developed many traditions that help add to the exciting atmosphere of Southeastern Conference football on game day. For example, the band leads a parade through campus before games and provides music for pre-game and in-game spirit.  The band plays the university's fight song, "Dynamite", throughout the game as well.
The Spirit of Gold prepares a unique halftime show for every home game, performing from variety of musical genres and eras.  Recent performances have featured music from Lady Gaga, The Blues Brothers, Tower of Power, the Backstreet Boys, and Bon Jovi. The last halftime performance of the year is traditionally a completely student-run, student-organized show.

===Basketball===

During the spring semester, a 50-piece pep band is formed for performances at Vanderbilt's men's and women's basketball games played in Memorial Gym.http://www.vanderbilt.edu/vuband/basketball.html  The basketball band performs music similar to that which the football band performs.
The Spirit of Gold has also established a smaller, 30-piece pep band called Encorps, that performs an indoor marching show.  Encorps has been featured at home basketball games and at events around Nashville.http://www.vanderbilt.edu/vuband/encorps.html
