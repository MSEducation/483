Velvet Tone Records was a United States based record label, active from 1925 through 1932. It was produced by Columbia Records and contained material identical to that of Columbia's two other low price labels, Harmony Records and Diva Records (and after Diva was discontinued, Clarion Records).Allan Sutton: Directory of American Disc Record Brands and Manufacturers, 1891-1943 (Westport & London, 1994)
Audio fidelity is about average for the era (though most issues were still made by the then out-dated acoustic recording process, though 1929), with pressings in above average quality shellac.  A clean copy plays as well as any record of the era.
