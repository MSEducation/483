CATEGORIES: Vaishya community

Vaishya is one of the four varnas of the Hindu social order.

==Traditional duties==

Hindu religious texts assigned Vaishyas to traditional roles in agriculture and cattle-rearing but over time they came to be landowners, traders and money-lenders.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&pg=PA24 |page=24 |title=The First Great Political Realist |first=Roger |last=Boesche[/tpl] The Vaishyas, along with members of the Brahmin and Kshatriya varnas, claim "twice born" (dvija) status in Hindu theology.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n84OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA112 |page=112 |title=Western Sociologists on Indian Society: Marx, Spencer, Weber, Durkheim, Pareto |first=Gurmukh Ram |last=Madan |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=1979 |isbn=9780710087829[/tpl] Indian traders were widely credited for the spread of Indian culture to regions as far as southeast Asia.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xn-6yMhAungC&pg=PA361 |page=361 |title=Asia in western and world history |first1=Ainslie Thomas |last1=Embree | authorlink1 = Ainslie Embree|first2=Carol |last2=Gluck | authorlink2 = Carol Gluck[/tpl]
Historically, Vaishyas have been involved in roles other than their traditional pastoralism, trade and commerce. According to Ram Sharan Sharma, a historian, the Gupta Empire was a Vaishya dynasty that "may have appeared as a reaction against oppressive rulers".[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i_sIE1sO5kwC&pg=PA69 |title=Early medieval Indian society: a study in feudalisation |first=Ram Sharan |last=Sharma |authorlink=Ram Sharan Sharma | |publisher=Orient Blackswan |year=2003 |origyear=2001 |page=69 |accessdate=2012-01-26[/tpl]
