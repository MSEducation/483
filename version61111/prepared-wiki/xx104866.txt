[tpl]Prokofiev Operas[/tpl]Betrothal in a Monastery (original Russian title Обручение в монастыре), Op. 86 is an opera by Sergei Prokofiev, his sixth with an opus number.  The libretto, in Russian, was by the composer and Mira Mendelson (his companion in later life), after Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ballad opera libretto for Thomas Linley the younger's The Duenna.
Prokofiev began the work in 1940, and it was in rehearsal that year, but World War II halted production of the opera.Slonimsky, Nicolas, "The Duenna.

Commentators have noted that, given the context of its creation in the 1940s in the Soviet Union, this opera lacks any particular political or social comment, except perhaps for a scene involving drunken monks.[tpl]cite news | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1827928,00.html | title=Betrothal in a Monastery/Glyndebourne | publisher=The Guardian | author=Tom Service | date=2006-07-25 | accessdate=2007-08-12[/tpl]

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

Don Jerome intends his daughter Louisa to marry the wealthy fish merchant Mendoza.  However, she loves instead Antonio, who is poor, though noble in spirit.  Furthermore, Don Ferdinand, son of Don Jerome and prone to fits of jealousy, wants to marry Clara d'Almanza, who is a virtual prisoner of her stepmother.

===Act 2===

Louisa's Duenna suggests that she and Louisa exhange clothes - the Duenna will then marry Mendoza and Louisa can elope with Antonio.
Louisa finds her friend Clara hiding in a monastery from the ardour of her lover Ferdinand (Louisa's brother). Disguising herself now as Clara, she takes Mendoza to the house of Don Jerome to meet 'Louisa' (the Duenna in disguise); they agree to elope.

===Act 3===

Mendoza and Don Carlos unintentionally help Louisa elope with Antonio.  Don Jerome is tricked into composing a letter that gives his permission for Louisa to marry Antonio.  In a fit of jealousy, Don Ferdinand chases after Louisa and Antonio, after he mistakes Louisa for Clara.

===Act 4===

The act opens with a drinking song for the monks in the monastery where the marriages are to be performed.  The monks then switch to a hymn that extols fasting and abstinence, to a tune that is a slower variant of the earlier drinking song.  Finally, Louisa and Antonio are united, as are Don Ferdinand and Clara.  In addition, Mendoza ends up marrying Louisa's Duenna.
