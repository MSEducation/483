</ref> Burgon was a defender of the [[Byzantine text-type|Traditional Text]] and for him Codex Vaticanus, as well as codices Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant. He felt that each of these three codices "clearly exhibits a fabricated text – is the result of arbitrary and reckless recension."<ref>D. Burgon, ''Revision Revised'', p. 9.</ref> The two most widely respected of these three codices, א and B, he likens to the "two false witnesses" of Matthew 26:60.<ref>D.

In 1861, Henry Alford collated and verified doubtful passages (in several imperfect collations), which he published in facsimile editions complete with errors. Until he began his work he met unexpected hindrances: He received a special order from Cardinal Antonelli "per verificare", to verify passages, but this license was interpreted by the librarian to mean that he was to see the book, but not to use it. In 1862, secretary of Alford, Mr. Cure, continued Alford's work.H. Alford, Life by my Widow, pp. 310, 315. For some reason which does not clearly appear, the authorities of the Vatican Library put continual obstacles in the way of all who wished to study it in detail.It should be noted that the Vatican Library was opened for three hours a day. See F. H. A. Scrivener, Six Lectures on the Text of the New Testament and the Ancient Manuscripts (Cambridge, 1875), p. 27. In 1867 Tischendorf published the text of the New Testament of the codex on the basis of Mai's edition.Constantin von Tischendorf, Novum Testamentum Vaticanum. Post Angeli Maii Aloirumque Imperfectos Labores ex ipso Codice (Lipsiae 1867). It was the "most perfect edition of the manuscript which had yet appeared".
In 1868–1881 C. Vercellone, Giuseppe Cozza-Luzi, and G. Sergio published an edition of the entire codex in 6 volumes (New Testament in volume V; Prolegomena in volume VI). A typographical facsimile appeared between 1868 and 1872. In 1889–1890 a photographic facsimile of the entire manuscript was made and published by Cozza-Luzi, in three volumes. Another facsimile of the New Testament text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan.Bibliorum Scriptorum Graecorum Codex Vaticanus 1209 (Milan, 1904–1907). As a result the Codex became widely available.Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, "The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration", Oxford University Press (New York – Oxford, 2005), p. 68.
In 1999, the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca della Stato in Rome (the Italian State Printing House and Mint) published a limited edition, full-color, exact scale facsimile of Codex Vaticanus. The facsimile reproduces the very form of the pages of the original manuscript, complete with the distinctive individual shape of each page, including holes in the vellum. It has an additional Prolegomena volume with gold and silver impressions of 74 pages.The "Uncrating" of Codex Vaticanus: the Facsimile at the Bethel University.

==Importance==

Codex Vaticanus is one of the most important manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text.Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort, The New Testament in the original Greek: Introduction, appendix, p. 34. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.K. Aland & B. Aland, Text of the New Testament, pp. 26–30.
According to the commonly accepted opinion of the textual critics, it is the most important witness of the text of the Gospels, in the Acts and Catholic epistles, with a stature equal to Codex Sinaiticus,W. L. Richards, The Classification of the Greek Manuscripts of the Johannine Epistles, SBL Dissertation Series, 1977, p. 141. although in the Pauline epistles it includes Western readings and the value of the text is somewhat less than the Codex Sinaiticus.[tpl]r|Waltz|Metzger[/tpl] Unfortunately the manuscript is not complete. Aland notes: "B is by far the most significant of the uncials".[tpl]r|Aland[/tpl]
