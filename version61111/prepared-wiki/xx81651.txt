Ganong Bros., Limited is Canada's oldest candy company; it was founded by James and Gilbert Ganong in 1873 in St. Stephen, New Brunswick where it is based to this day. The primary product is boxed chocolates. It now provides many chocolates for Laura Secord stores.
The Ganongs were descendants of Huguenots who fled persecution in France and emigrated to New Amsterdam in the second half of the 17th century, the family name "Ganong" is a corruption of the original French language name, "Guenon".
Ganong Bros.' Limited has been one of the chocolate industry's most important companies.  Arthur Ganong was the first to make any sort of a wrapped chocolate bar;  Ganong began selling the first chocolate bars in 1910. In 1920 they began using the brand name "Pal-O-Mine" for their chocolate bar.
The company also was the first to introduce a heart-shaped box of chocolates in North America. The heart-shaped boxes were originally used for presents over the Christmas season before it also succeeded around Valentine's Day
In 1911, Ganong Bros. purchased the bankrupt White Candy Company in Saint John, New Brunswick and operated a factory there until 1931.
