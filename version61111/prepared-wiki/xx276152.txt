In 1925 an exhibition of portraits of early Americans was held in New York by the gentlemen's arts and literature club called the Century Association. At this exhibition an oil portrait was shown of Oloff Stevense Van Cortlandt (father of the 17th century mayor of New York Stephanus Van Cortlandt) that at that time was attributed to Couturier. This prompted the New York art collector Thomas B. Clarke to purchase it, who later showed it in 1928 as part of his collection.Listed item "Oloff Stevense Van Cortlandt by Henri Couturier", in Portraits by Early American Artists of the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, Collected by Thomas B.
