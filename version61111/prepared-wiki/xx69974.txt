in terms of Chebyshev polynomials is sometimes used for [[approximation theory|polynomial
approximations]] in computer math libraries.
Some authors use versions of these polynomials that have been shifted so that the
interval of orthogonality is 0, 1 or −2, 2.
We have:

polynomials, see Chebyshev polynomials.

===Laguerre polynomials===

The most general Laguerre-like polynomials, after the domain has been shifted
and scaled, are the Associated Laguerre polynomials (also called Generalized Laguerre polynomials),
real number strictly greater than −1.  The parameter is put in parentheses to avoid confusion
version of these:
The differential equation is
This is Laguerre's equation.
The second form of the differential equation is
The recurrence relation is
Rodrigues' formula is
or, more generally:
Laguerre's equation can be manipulated into a form that is more useful in applications:
is a solution of
is a solution of
The solution is often expressed in terms of derivatives instead of associated Laguerre polynomials:
This equation arises in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution
of the Schrödinger equation for a one-electron atom.
Physicists often use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials that is larger,

===Hermite polynomials===

The differential equation is
This is Hermite's equation.
The second form of the differential equation is
The third form is
The recurrence relation is
Rodrigues' formula is
The first few Hermite polynomials are
One can define the associated Hermite functions
Because the multiplier is proportional to the square root of the weight function, these functions
The third form of the differential equation above, for the associated Hermite functions, is
The associated Hermite functions arise in many areas of mathematics and physics.
In quantum mechanics, they are the solutions of Schrödinger's equation for the harmonic oscillator.
They are also eigenfunctions (with eigenvalue (−i)n) of the continuous Fourier transform.
For further details, see Hermite polynomials.

==Characterizations of classical orthogonal polynomials==

There are several conditions that single out the classical orthogonal polynomials from the others.
The first condition was found by Sonine (and later by Hahn), who showed that (up to linear changes of variable) the classical orthogonal polynomials are the only ones such that their derivatives are also orthogonal polynomials.
Bochner characterized classical orthogonal polynomials in terms of their recurrence relations.
Tricomi characterized classical orthogonal polynmials as those that have a certain analogue of the Rodrigues formula.
