CATEGORIES: Curricula, Didactics

A course catalog or course calendar is an organized, detailed, descriptive list of course offerings at a college, university or other educational outlet.  Educational organizations usually publish a course catalog with additional information covering academic and administrative policies and procedures.  They detail what courses are offered in each department, along with the course's number, title, description, prerequisites, and frequency of offering.
