Urijah (or Uriah in many English translations) is a prophet mentioned in Jeremiah 26:20-23. He is described as being the son of Shemaiah from Kirjath-jearim. During the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, he fled into Egypt from the cruelty of the king, but having been brought back he was beheaded and his body "cast into the graves of the common people."
