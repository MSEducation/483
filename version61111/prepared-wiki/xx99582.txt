Georg Benedikt Winer (April 13, 1789 – May 12, 1858), German Protestant theologian, was born at Leipzig.
He studied theology at Leipzig, where eventually (1832) he became professor ordinarius. From 1824 to 1830 he edited with J. G. V. Engelhardt the Neues kritisches Journal der theologischen Literatur, and alone from 1826 to 1832 the Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie.
