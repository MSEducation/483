[[Sleipner-class corvette]]

CATEGORIES: Corvette classes, Corvettes of the Royal Norwegian Navy

The ''Sleipner''-class corvette was a part of the Royal Norwegian Navy's 1960 fleet plan. It was intended to build five ships of the class, but because of economic problems only two were built; [tpl]Ship|HNoMS|Sleipner|1963|2[/tpl] and [tpl]Ship|HNoMS|Æger|1965|2[/tpl].
Sleipner was built by Nylands Mekaniske Verksted, Oslo, and Æger by Aker Mekaniske Verksted, Oslo, and handed over to the Royal Norwegian Navy between 1965–1967. The ships were armed with an American [tpl]convert|3|in|mm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] gun forward and a Bofors 40 mm gun aft, with a Terne III anti-submarine rocket launcher ahead of the 40 mm gun. The ships were fitted with American SQS-36 sonar.
The ships had their anti-submarine capabilities improved in 1972, when they were fitted with Mark 32 anti-submarine torpedo tubes. The ships were mainly used as training ships in the 1980s, although they did retain a wartime role as coastal escorts.Grove 1990, p. 107. They were again modernised between 1988 and 1989, with new sonar and gun fire control systems fitted.  They were decommissioned in 1993.
