==Major League Baseball career==

===1960s===

Bench played baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at Binger High School in Binger, Oklahoma. He is one-eighth Choctaw.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082237/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Video | date=March 31, 1969[/tpl] His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher. Bench was drafted 36th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 1965 amateur draft, playing for the minor-league Buffalo Bisons in the 1966 and 1967 seasons before being called up to the Reds in August 1967.1965 Amateur Baseball Draft, Second Round at The Baseball Cube He hit only .163, but impressed many with his defense and strong throwing arm. Among them: Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Williams signed a baseball for him which predicted that the young catcher would be "a Hall of Famer for sure!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportsmemorabilia.com/articles/johnny-bench-memorabilia-buying-guide |title=Johnny Bench Memorabilia Buying Guide | Autographed Sports Memorabilia and Sports Collectibles at Sports Memorabilia |publisher=Sportsmemorabilia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24[/tpl] Williams' prediction eventually became fact with Johnny Bench's election to the Hall of Fame in 1989.
During a spring training game in 1968, Bench was catching the eight-year veteran right-hander Jim Maloney. Once a noted hard thrower, injuries had reduced Maloney's fastball's speed dramatically by this time. However, Maloney insisted on repeatedly "shaking off" his younger catcher and throwing the fastball instead of the breaking balls Bench called for. An exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, "Your fastball's not popping". Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball wasn't effective anymore, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher's mitt and comfortably caught the fastball barehanded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/fastest-pitcher-in-baseball.shtml |title=Fastest Pitcher in Baseball by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24[/tpl] Bench was the Reds' catcher on April 30, 1969 when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the Houston Astros.April 30, 1969 Astros-Reds box score at Baseball Reference

===1970s===

1970 was Bench's finest statistical season; he became the youngest man (22) to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award, hit .293, led the National League with 45 home runs and a franchise-record 148 Runs batted in, and helped the Reds win the National League West Division.1970 National League Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Reference The Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1970 National League Championship Series, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.1970 NLCS at Baseball Reference1970 World Series at Baseball Reference

In 1973, Bench slumped to 25 home runs and 104 RBI, but helped the Reds rally from a 10 1/2 game deficit in July to the Los Angeles Dodgers to win a major league-high 99 games and claim another National League West Division. In the 1973 National League Championship Series, the Reds met a New York Mets team that won just 82 regular season games, but boasted three of the best starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Jon Matlack.

He bounced back to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBIs in 1977, but the Reds would only reach the post-season once more during Bench's career, when the 1979 Reds were swept in three games by the Pirates in the 1979 National League Championship Series.1979 NLCS at Baseball Reference

===1980s===

For the last three seasons of his career, Bench caught only 13 games and played mostly first base or third base. The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, "Johnny Bench Night" at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning before a record crowd.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qflVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PeIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6855%2C4847428|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|agency=wire services|title=On Bench's special night, Houston spoils finish 4-3|date=September 18, 1983 |page=7C[/tpl]September 17, 1983 Astros-Reds box score at Baseball Reference He retired at the end of the season at age 35.

Bench popularized the hinged catcher's mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs.Randy Hundley at The Baseball LibraryAre Catchers Today As Good Defensively As In The Past?, by Rick Van Blair, Baseball Digest, March 1994, Vol. 53, No. 3, ISSN 0005-609X He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand. The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch. By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers' equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right handhttp://www.uc.edu), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.
