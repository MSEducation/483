==Life==

He was the son of John J. Graves (1840–1921) and Sarah (Seath) Graves (1844–1917). The family removed to Baltimore, Maryland, while Ross was still a child, and later to Buffalo, New York.
Graves was a member of the New York State Assembly (Erie Co., 2nd D.) in 1915 and 1916.
He was a member of the New York State Senate (48th D.) from 1917 to 1919, sitting in the 140th, 141st and 142nd New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat on December 27, 1919, having been elected Commissioner of Finance and Accounts of the City of Buffalo in November 1919.
Graves took office as Commissioner in January 1920, and was re-elected in November 1923. In November 1925, he ran on a "dry" ticket for Mayor of Buffalo, but was defeated by the "wet" incumbent Frank X. Schwab.
He was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.
