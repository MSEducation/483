Buren Skeen (September 28, 1936 - September 13, 1965) was a NASCAR driver from Denton, North Carolina.

==Career==

He competed in eight Grand National Series events in his career, earning three finishes in the top ten.
All of those races came in 1965, when Skeen finished 60th in points. His debut went miserably, finishing 30th at North Wilkesboro after transmission woes. But then Skeen improved over the next two races, finishing 9th at Martinsville and then a career-best 5th at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem. Skeen would add a 7th place finish in another race later in the year at Bowman Gray. However, four DNFs in five races were capped when Skeen was killed in the 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. His car spun, and was hit on the driver's side, fatally. An iconic video shows the car being towed away, the drivers seat was moved completely to the other side of the car, and the steering wheel poking out of the window.
