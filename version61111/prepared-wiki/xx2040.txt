</ref>  The advantage of using a coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current.  The magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) to produce a strong field there.<ref name="Arun" />  The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced.   Conversely, a ''changing'' external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to [[Faraday's law of induction]].<ref name="Arun" /><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA129&dq=Faradays+law    Newnes 2002, p. 129]</ref>  The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil, because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.<ref name="Arun" />
The direction of the magnetic field produced by a coil can be determined by the right hand grip rule.  If the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the magnetic core of a coil in the direction of conventional current through the wire, the thumb will point in the direction the magnetic field lines  pass through the coil.
There are many different types of coils used in electric and electronic equipment.

==Windings and taps==

The wire or conductor which constitutes the coil is called the winding.Stauffer 2005, p. 273  The hole in the center of the coil is called the core area or magnetic axis.[ref]
