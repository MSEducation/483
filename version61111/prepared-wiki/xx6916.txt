==Early life==

Marvin was born in New York City. He was the son of Lamont Waltman Marvin, an advertising executive and the head of the New York and New England Apple Institute, and his wife Courtenay Washington (née Davidge), a fashion writer and beauty consultant."Lee Marvin's ancestors." freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com.

Marvin studied violin when he was young.  As a teenager, Marvin "spent weekends and spare time hunting deer, puma, wild turkey and bobwhite in the wilds of the then-uncharted Everglades.""Elk Hunting with Lee Marvin." Gun World,  May 1964; retrieved October 11, 2013.
He attended Manumit School, a Christian socialist boarding school in Pawling, New York, during the late 1930s, and later attended St. Leo College Preparatory School in St. Leo, Florida after being expelled from several other schools for bad behavior.Zec 1980, pp. 20–25.

==Military service==

In August 1942 Marvin left school to enlist in the United States Marine Corps , serving with the 4th Marine Division in the Pacific Theater.Wise and Rehill 1999, p. 43. He was wounded in action during the World War II Battle of Saipan, in the assault on Mount Tapochau, during which most of his unit ("I" Company, 24th Marines, 4th Marine Division) were killed.Zec 1980, p. 38.  Marvin's wound (shot in the buttocks) was from machine gun fire, which severed his sciatic nerve."The real thing: Marvin and Point Blank." The First Post, February 15, 2007. Retrieved: October 11, 2013. Marvin was awarded the Purple Heart and was given a medical discharge with the rank of Private First Class in 1945 at Philadelphia."Captain Kangaroo Court."

Contrary to rumors, Marvin did not serve with producer and actor Bob Keeshan during World War II.

==Career==

After the war, while working as a plumber's assistant at a local community theatre in Upstate New York, Marvin was asked to replace an actor who had fallen ill during rehearsals. He then began an amateur off-Broadway acting career in New York City and eventually made it to Broadway with a small role in the original production of Billy Budd.Epstein 2013, p. 67.
In 1950, Marvin moved to Hollywood. He found work in supporting roles, and from the beginning was cast in various war films. As a decorated combat veteran, Marvin was a natural in war dramas, where he frequently assisted the director and other actors in realistically portraying infantry movement, arranging costumes, and the use of firearms. His debut was in You're in the Navy Now (1951), and in 1952 he appeared in several films, including Don Siegel's Duel at Silver Creek, Hangman's Knot, and the war drama Eight Iron Men. He played Gloria Grahame's vicious boyfriend in Fritz Lang's The Big Heat (1953). Marvin had a small but memorable role in The Wild One (1953) opposite Marlon Brando (Marvin's gang in the film was called "The Beetles"), followed by Seminole (1953) and Gun Fury (1953). He also had a notable small role as smart-aleck sailor Meatball in The Caine Mutiny. He had a substantially more important part as Hector, the small-town hood in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955) with Spencer Tracy.Epstein 2013, pp. 95–96.
During the mid-1950s, Marvin gradually began playing more important roles. He starred in Attack, (1956) and had a  supporting role in the Western Seven Men from Now (1956). He also starred in The Missouri Traveler (1958) but it took over 100 episodes as Chicago cop Frank Ballinger in the successful 1957–1960 television series M Squad to actually give him name recognition.Epstein 2013, p. 112.
One critic described the show as "a hyped-up, violent Dragnet... with a hard-as-nails Marvin" playing a tough police lieutenant. Marvin received the role after guest-starring in a memorable Dragnet episode as a serial killer.Epstein 2013, p. 79. 
In the 1960s, Marvin was given prominent supporting roles in such films as The Comancheros (1961), John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), and Donovan's Reef (1963), all starring John Wayne, with Marvin's roles getting larger with each film. As the vicious Liberty Valance, Marvin played his first title role and held his own with two of the screen's biggest stars (Wayne and James Stewart).Epstein 2013, p. 124.
For director Don Siegel, Marvin appeared in The Killers (1964) playing an efficient professional assassin alongside Clu Gulager. The Killers was also the first film in which Marvin received top billing.Epstein 2013, p. 135.
Playing alongside Vivien Leigh and Simone Signoret, Marvin won the 1966 National Board of Review Award for male actors for his role in Ship of Fools (1965)."Awards: Ship of Fools (1965)." IMDb.

Leigh's performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Marvin were sympathetic and understanding.David 1995, p. 46. In one unusual instance, she hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe, that it marked his face.Walker 1987, p. 281.|group=N[/tpl]
Marvin won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actor for his comic role in the offbeat Western Cat Ballou starring Jane Fonda. He also won the 1965 Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 15th Berlin International Film Festival."Berlinale 1965: Prize Winners". Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlin. Retrieved: October 11, 2013.
Marvin next performed in the hit Western The Professionals (1966), in which he played the leader of a small band of skilled mercenaries (Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan, and Woody Strode) rescuing a kidnap victim (Claudia Cardinale) shortly after the Mexican Revolution. He followed that film with the hugely successful World War II epic The Dirty Dozen (1967) in which top-billed Marvin again portrayed an intrepid commander of a colorful group (future stars John Cassavetes, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown, and Donald Sutherland) performing an almost impossible mission. In the wake of these two films and after having received an Oscar, Marvin was a huge star, given enormous control over his next film Point Blank.
In Point Blank, an influential film for director John Boorman, he portrayed a hard-nosed criminal bent on revenge. Marvin, who had selected Boorman himself for the director's slot, had a central role in the film's development, plot line, and staging. In 1968, Marvin also appeared in another Boorman film, the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful World War II character study Hell in the Pacific, also starring famed Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Marvin was originally cast as Pike Bishop (later played by William Holden) in The Wild Bunch (1969), but fell out with director Sam Peckinpah and pulled out in order to star in the Western musical Paint Your Wagon (1969), in which he was top-billed over a singing Clint Eastwood. Despite his limited singing ability, he had a hit song with "Wand'rin' Star". By this time he was getting paid a million dollars per film, $200,000 less than top star Paul Newman was making at the time; yet he was ambivalent about the film business, even with its financial rewards:Ebert, Roger. "An interview with Lee Marvin." Chicago Sun-Times for Esquire,  October 1970.
Marvin had a much greater variety of roles in the 1970s and 1980s, with fewer 'bad-guy' roles than in earlier years. His 1970s films included Monte Walsh (1970) with Jeanne Moreau, the violent Prime Cut (1972) with Gene Hackman, Pocket Money (1972) with Paul Newman, Emperor of the North Pole (1973) opposite Ernest Borgnine, as Hickey in The Iceman Cometh (1973) with Fredric March and Robert Ryan, The Spikes Gang (1974) with Noah Beery, Jr., The Klansman (1974) with Richard Burton, Shout at the Devil (1976) with Roger Moore, The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday (1976) with Oliver Reed, and Avalanche Express (1978) with Robert Shaw. Marvin was offered the role of Quint in Jaws (1975) but declined, stating "What would I tell my fishing friends who'd see me come off a hero against a dummy shark?".Zec 1980, p. 217. Marvin's immediately previous co-star Robert Shaw accepted the part, which gave Shaw his most prominent role and vaulted the supporting player into mainstream leading man status.
Marvin's last big role was in Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One (1980), a war film based on Fuller's own war experiences. His remaining films were Death Hunt (1981) with Charles Bronson, Gorky Park (1983), Dog Day (1984), and The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (1985; a sequel with Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, and Richard Jaeckel picking up where they'd left off despite being 18 years older); his final appearance was in The Delta Force (1986) with Chuck Norris.Epstein 2013, p. 202.

==Personal life==

During the 1970s, Marvin resided off and on in Woodstock, caring for his dying father,Flick, A.J. "Marvin in Love". Classic Movies, 1997.

The Cairns Post website.  Retrieved: October 11, 2013. In 1975 Marvin and his second wife Pamela moved to Tucson, where he lived until his death.
Despite starring in conservative films, Marvin was a liberal Democrat who opposed the Vietnam War. He publicly endorsed John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election despite Kennedy's escalation of American involvement.

===Marriages and children===

A father of four, Marvin was married twice. His first marriage to Betty Ebeling began in February 1951 and ended in divorce on January 5, 1967; during this time his hobbies included sport fishing off the Baja California coast and duck hunting along the Mexican border near Mexicali. He and Ebeling had a son, Christopher (1952–2013),"Obituary Christopher Marvin" and three daughters: Courtenay (b. 1954), Cynthia (b. 1956) and Claudia (b. 1958).Epstein 2013, p. 256.

Marvin was married to Pamela Feeley (who had been his girlfriend in Woodstock, New York, a quarter century earlier) from October 18, 1970 until his death.Marvin 1997, p. 12.

===Community property case===

In 1971, Marvin was sued by Michelle Triola, his live-in girlfriend from 1965 to 1970, who legally changed her surname to "Marvin". Although the couple never married, she sought financial compensation similar to that available to spouses under California's alimony and community property laws. Triola claimed Marvin made her pregnant three times and paid for two abortions, while one pregnancy ended in miscarriage.Woo, Elaine. "Michelle Triola Marvin dies at 75; her legal fight with ex-lover Lee Marvin added 'palimony' to the language." Los Angeles Times, October 31, 2009. Retrieved: October 11, 2013. She claimed the second abortion left her unable to bear children. The result was the landmark "palimony" case, Marvin v. Marvin, 18 Cal. 3d 660 (1976)."18 C3d 660: Marvin v. Marvin (1976)." online.ceb.com. Retrieved: October 11, 2013. In 1979, Marvin was ordered to pay $104,000 to Triola for "rehabilitation purposes" but the court denied her community property claim for one-half of the $3.6 million which Marvin had earned during their six years of cohabitation – distinguishing non-marital relationship contracts from marriage, with community property rights only attaching to the latter by operation of law. Rights equivalent to community property only apply in non-marital relationship contracts when the parties expressly, whether orally or in writing, contract for such rights to operate between them. After the case, Marvin was the subject of controversy when he said that the trial was a "circus" and that "everyone was lying, even I lied."
In August 1981, the California Court of Appeal found there was no such contract, and thus nullified the award she had received.Laskin, Jerry. "California 'Palimony' Law; An Overview." Goldman & Kagon Law Corporation. Retrieved: October 11, 2013."Unmarried Cohabitant's Right to Support and Property." peoples-law.org. Retrieved: October 11, 2013.

==Death==

In December 1986, Marvin underwent intestinal surgery after suffering abdominal pains while at his ranch outside Tucson. Doctors said then that there was an inflammation of the colon, but that no malignancy was found. After being hospitalized for more than two weeks because of "a run-down condition related to the flu," Marvin died of a heart attack on August 29, 1987.Hevesi, Dennis.
