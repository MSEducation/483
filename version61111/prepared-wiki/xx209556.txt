Moses Bruine Cotsworth (Willitoft, Yorks 3 December 1859 - Vancouver 4 June 1943) was a calendar reformer.
He started his career in a variety of companies where his analytical skills were valuable.  Based on his work at the North Eastern Railway Company, he published a book on railway rates. In 1907, he was chosen to chair a commission to reorganize the British Columbia civil service.
His interest in calendar reform began when he was working at a railroad company, and found that monthly accounting was greatly complicated by the fact that months did not divide evenly into weeks.
He devised what is now known as the International Fixed Calendar. In 1922, he founded the International Fixed Calendar League.
He was a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants[tpl]dn|date=January 2013[/tpl], of the Royal Statistical Society, and of the Geological Society.
