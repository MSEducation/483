Geto-Dacians inhabited both sides of the Tisa River before the rise of the Celtic Boii, and again after the latter were defeated by the Dacians under king Burebista.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215[/tpl] During the second half of the 4th century BC, Celtic cultural influence appears in the archaeological records of the middle Danube, Alpine region, and north-western Balkans, where it was part of the Middle La Tène material culture. This material appears in north-western and central Dacia, and is reflected especially in burials.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 [/tpl] The Dacians absorbed the Celtic influence from the northwest in the early third century BC.[tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50[/tpl] Archaeological investigation of this period has highlighted several Celtic warrior graves with military equipment. It suggests the forceful penetration of a military Celtic elite within the region of Dacia, now known as Transylvania, that is bounded on the east by the Carpathian range.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 |p=549[/tpl] The archaeological sites of the third and second centuries BC in Transylvania revealed a pattern of co-existence and fusion between the bearers of La Tène culture and indigenous Dacians. These were domestic dwellings with a mixture of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and several graves in the Celtic style containing vessels of Dacian type.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 |p=549[/tpl] There are some seventy Celtic sites in Transylvania, mostly cemeteries, but most if not all of them indicate that the native population imitated Celtic art forms that took their fancy, but remained obstinately and fundamentally Dacian in their culture.[tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50[/tpl]
thumb|left|300px The Celtic Helmet from Satu Mare, Romania (northern Dacia), an Iron Age raven totem helmet, dated around 4th century BC. A similar helmet is depicted on the Thraco-Celtic Gundestrup cauldron, being worn by one of the mounted warriors (detail tagged here). See also an illustration of Brennos wearing a similar helmet.
Around 150 BC, La Tène material disappears from the area. This coincides with the ancient writings which mention the rise of Dacian authority. It ended the Celtic domination, and it is possible that Celts were driven out of Dacia. Alternatively, some scholars have proposed that the Transylvanian Celts remained, but merged into the local culture and thus ceased to be distinctive.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=549 [/tpl][tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=50[/tpl]
Archaeological discoveries in the settlements and fortifications of the Dacians in the period of their kingdoms (1st century BC and 1st century AD) included imported Celtic vessels, and others made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic prototypes, showing that relations between the Dacians and the Celts from the regions north and west of Dacia continued.[tpl]sfn | Koch | 2005 | p=550[/tpl] In present-day Slovakia, archaeology has revealed evidence for mixed Celtic-Dacian populations in the Nitra and Hron river basins.[tpl]sfn | Skvarna | Cicaj | Letz| 2000 | p=14[/tpl]
After the Dacians subdued the Celtic tribes, the remaining Cotini stayed in the mountains of Central Slovakia, where they took up mining and metalworking. Together with the original domestic population, they created the Puchov culture that spread into central and northern Slovakia, including Spis, and penetrated northeastern Moravia and southern Poland. Along the Bodorog River in Zemplin they created Celtic-Dacian settlements which were known for the production of painted ceramics.[tpl]sfn | Skvarna | Cicaj | Letz| 2000 | p=14[/tpl]

===Relations with Greeks===

Greek and Roman chroniclers record the defeat and capture of the Macedonian general Lysimachus in the 3rd century BC by the Getae (Dacians) ruled by Dromihete, their military strategy, and the release of Lysimachus following a debate in the assembly of the Getae.

===Relations with Persians===

Herodotus says: "before Darius reached the Danube, the first people he subdued were the Getae, who believed that they never die".[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl] It is possible that the Persian expedition and the subsequent occupation may have altered the way in which the Getae expressed the immortality belief. The influence of thirty years of Achaemenid presence may be detected in the emergence of an explicit iconography of the "Royal Hunt" that influenced Dacian and Thracian metalworkers, and of the practice of hawking by their upper class.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 1987| p=130[/tpl]

===Relations with Scythians===

====Agathyrsi Transylvania====

The Scythians' arrival in the Carpathian mountains is dated to 700 BC.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1928|p=48[/tpl] The Agathyrsi of Transylvania had been mentioned by Herodotus (fifth century BC),[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.48-4.49[/tpl] who regarded them as not a Scythian people, but closely related to them. In other respects their customs were close to those of the Thracians.Herodotus, Rawlinson G, Rawlinson H, Gardner (1859) 93 The Agathyrsi were completely denationalized at the time of Herodotus and absorbed by the native Thracians.[tpl]sfn| Thomson |1948|p=399[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Parvan|1928|p=48[/tpl]
The opinion that the Agathyrsi were almost certainly Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, and we know that the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians.[tpl]sfn| Hrushevskyĭ | Poppe | Skorupsky | 1997 |p=97[/tpl] That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.[tpl]sfn| Hrushevskyĭ | Poppe | Skorupsky | 1997 |p=97[/tpl]

===Relations with Germanic tribes===

The Goths, a confederation of east German peoples, arrived in the southern Ukraine no later than 230.[tpl]sfn | Watson | 2004 | p=8 [/tpl] During the next decade, a large section of them moved down the Black Sea coast and occupied much of the territory north of the lower Danube.[tpl]sfn | Watson | 2004 | p=8 [/tpl] The Goths' advance towards the area north of the Black Sea involved competing with the indigenous population of Dacian-speaking Carpi, as well as indigenous Iranian-speaking Sarmatians and Roman garrison forces.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2006 | p=85 [/tpl] The Carpi, often called "Free Dacians", continued to dominate the anti-Roman coalition made up of themselves, Taifali, Astringi, Vandals, Peucini, and Goths until 248, when the Goths assumed the hegemony of the loose coalition.[tpl]sfn | Burns | 1991 |pp=26-27[/tpl] The first lands taken over by the Thervingi Goths were in Moldavia, and only during the fourth century did they move in strength down into the Danubian plain.[tpl]sfn | Burns | 1991 | pp=110-111 [/tpl] The Carpi found themselves squeezed between the advancing Goths and the Roman province of Dacia.[tpl]sfn | Watson | 2004 | p=8 [/tpl] In 275 AD, Aurelian surrendered the Dacian territory[tpl]clarify|date = November 2013[/tpl] to the Carpi and the Goths.[tpl]sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 [/tpl] Over time, Gothic power in the region grew, at the Carpi’s expense. The Germanic-speaking Goths replaced native Dacian-speakers as the dominant force around the Carpathian mountains.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=128[/tpl] Large numbers of Carpi, but not all of them, were admitted into the Roman empire in the twenty-five years or so after 290 AD.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=116[/tpl] Despite this evacuation of the Carpi around 300 AD, considerable groups of the natives (non-Romanized Dacians, Sarmatians and others) remained in place under Gothic domination.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=165[/tpl]
In 330 the Gothic Thervingi contemplated moving to the Middle Danube region,[tpl]citation needed|date = November 2013[/tpl] and from 370 relocated with their fellow Gothic Greuthungi to new homes in the Roman Empire.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2010 | p=116[/tpl] The Ostrogoths were still more isolated, but even the Visigoths preferred to live among their own kind. As a result, the Goths settled in pockets. Finally, although Roman towns continued on a reduced level, there is no question as to their survival.[tpl]sfn | Burns | 1991 | pp=110-111 [/tpl]
In 336 AD, Constantine took the title Dacicus Maximus ("The great victory over Dacians"), implying at least partial reconquest of Trajan Dacia.[tpl]sfn | Barnes | 1984 | p=250[/tpl] In an inscription of 337, Constantine was commemorated officially as Germanicus Maximus, Sarmaticus, Gothicus Maximus, and Dacicus Maximus, meaning he had defeated the Germans, Sarmatians, Goths, and Dacians.[tpl]sfn| Elton | Lenski | 2005 | p=338[/tpl]

===Dacian kingdoms===

Dacian states arose as a tribal confederacy that included the Getae, the Daci, the Buri, and the Carpi[tpl]dubious|date = November 2013[/tpl] (cf. Bichir 1976, Shchukin 1989),[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215[/tpl] united only periodically by the leadership of Dacian kings such as Burebista and Decebal. This union was both military-political and ideological-religious.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 |p=215[/tpl] The following are some of the attested Dacian kingdoms:
The kingdom of Cothelas, one of the Getae, covered an area near the Black Sea, between northern Thrace and the Danube, today Bulgaria, in the 4th century BC.Lewis et al. 2008, p. 773 The kingdom of Rubobostes controlled a region in Transylvania in the 2nd century BC.[tpl]sfn | Berresford Ellis | 1996 | p=61[/tpl] Gaius Scribonius Curio (proconsul 75-3 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the Moesi, becoming the first Roman general to reach the river Danube with his army.Smith's Dictionary: Curio His successor, Marcus Licinius Lucullus, brother of the famous Lucius Lucullus, campaigned against the Thracian Bessi tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of Moesia, the region between the Haemus (Balkan) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of Scythia Minor (the modern Dobruja region in Romania and Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome's Hellenistic arch-enemy, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, in the Third Mithridatic War.Smith's Dictionary: Lucullus Greek geographer Strabo claimed that the Dacians and Getae had been able to muster a combined army of 200,000 men during Strabo's era, the time of Roman emperor Augustus.[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,13[/tpl]

====The kingdom of Burebista====

The Dacian kingdom reached its maximum extent under king Burebista (ruled 82 - 44 BC). The capital of the kingdom was possibly the city of Argedava, also called Sargedava in some historical writings, situated close to the river Danube. The kingdom of Burebista extended south of the Danube, in what is today Bulgaria, and the Greeks believed their king was the greatest of all Thracians.[tpl]sfn|Grumeza|2009|p=54[/tpl][tpl]better source|date=February 2014[/tpl] During his reign, Burebista transferred the Geto-Dacians' capital from Argedava to Sarmizegetusa.[tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |1975|p=48[/tpl][tpl]sfn| Goodman | Sherwood |2002|p=227[/tpl] For at least one and a half centuries, Sarmizegethusa was the Dacian capital, reaching its acme under king Decebal. Burebista annexed the Greek cities (55-48 BC).Crişan (1978) 118 Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of C. Antonius at Histria (Sinoe) 32 years before, and to recover the lost standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called Genucla (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, in the Danube delta region of Romania), controlled by Zyraxes, the local Getan petty king.Dio LI.26.5 The man selected for the task was Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir, and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.Dio LI.23.2

====The kingdom of Decebalus 87 – 106====

By the year AD 100, more than 400,000 square kilometers were dominated by the Dacians, who numbered two million.De Imperatoribus Romanis". http://www.roman-emperors.org/assobd.htm#t-inx. Retrieved 2007-11-08. "In the year 88, the Romans resumed the offensive. The Roman troops were now led by the general Tettius Iulianus. The battle took place again at Tapae but this time the Romans defeated the Dacians. For fear of falling into a trap, Iulianus abandoned his plans of conquering Sarmizegetuza and, at the same time, Decebalus asked for peace. At first, Domitian refused this request, but after he was defeated in a war in Pannonia against the Marcomanni (a Germanic tribe), the emperor was obliged to accept the peace." Decebalus was the last king of the Dacians, and despite his fierce resistance against the Romans, was defeated and committed suicide rather than being marched through Rome in a triumph as a captured enemy leader.

===Conflict with Rome===

Burebista's Dacian state was powerful enough to threaten Rome, and Caesar contemplated campaigning against the Dacians.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 1994 |p=404[/tpl] Despite this, the formidable Dacian power under Burebista lasted only until his death in 44 BC. The subsequent division of Dacia continued for about a century until the reign of Scorillo. This was a period of only occasional attacks on the Roman Empire’s border, with some local significance.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54[/tpl]
The unifying actions of King Scorillo (27 BC – AD 14) and of the last King Decebalus (ruled 87–106 AD) might have been perceived as dangerous by Rome, despite the fact that the Dacian army could now gather only some 40,000 soldiers.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54[/tpl] In the Romans’ eyes, the situation at the border with Dacia was out of control, and Emperor Domitian (ruled 81 to 96 AD) tried desperately to deal with the danger through military action. But the outcome of Rome's disastrous campaigns into Dacia in AD 86 and AD 88 pushed Domitian to settle the situation through diplomacy.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|pp=53-54[/tpl] Emperor Trajan (ruled 97–117 AD) opted for a different approach and decided to conquer the Dacian kingdom, partly in order to seize its vast gold mines. The effort required two major wars (the Dacian Wars), one in 101–102 AD and the other in 105–106 AD. Only fragmentary details survive of the Dacian war: a single sentence of Trajan’s own Dacica; little more of the Getica written by his doctor, T. Statilius Crito; nothing whatsoever of the poem proposed by Caninius Rufus (if it was ever written), Dio Chrysostom’s Getica or Appian’s Dacica. Nonetheless, a reasonable account can be pieced together.[tpl]sfn|Bennett|1997|p=97[/tpl]
In the first war, Trajan invaded Dacia by crossing the river Danube with a boat-bridge and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dacians at the Second Battle of Tapae in 101 AD. The Dacian king Decebalus was forced to sue for peace. Trajan and Decebalus then concluded a peace treaty which was highly favourable to the Romans. The peace agreement required the Dacians to cede some territory to the Romans and to demolish their fortifications. Decebalus' foreign policy was also restricted, as he was prohibited from entering into alliances with other tribes.
However, both Trajan and Decebalus considered this only a temporary truce, and readied themselves for renewed war. Trajan had Greek engineer Apollodorus of Damascus construct a stone bridge over the Danube river, while Decebalus secretly plotted alliances against the Romans. In 105, Trajan crossed the Danube river and besieged Decebalus' capital, Sarmizegetusa, but the siege failed because of Decebalus' allied tribes. However, Trajan was an optimist. He returned with a newly constituted army and took Sarmizegetusa by assault. Decebalus fled into the mountains hoping to assemble a new army, but was cornered by pursuing Roman cavalry and committed suicide. The Romans took his head and right hand to Trajan, who had them displayed in the Forums. Trajan's Column in Rome was constructed to celebrate the conquest of Dacia.
The Roman people hailed Trajan's triumph in Dacia with the longest and most expensive celebration in their history.[tpl]sfn | Hooper | 2002 |p=434[/tpl] For his triumph, Trajan gave a 123-day festival (ludi) of celebration, in which approximately 11,000 animals were slaughtered and 11,000 gladiators fought in combats. This surpassed Emperor Titus's celebration in AD 70, when a 100-day festival included 3,000 gladiators and 5,000 to 9,000 wild animals.[tpl]sfn | Snooks | 1997 |p=154[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Campbell | 2002 |p=144[/tpl]

===Roman rule===

Only about half part of Dacia then became a Roman province,[tpl]sfn | Boia | 2001 |p=47[/tpl] with a newly built capital at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, 40 km away from the site of Old Sarmizegetusa, which was razed to the ground. The name of the Dacians' homeland, Dacia, became the name of a Roman province, and the name Dacians was used to designate peoples of varying ancestry in the region.[tpl]sfn|Waldman |Mason |2006|p=205[/tpl] Roman Dacia, also Dacia Traiana or Dacia Felix, was a province of the Roman Empire from 106 to 271 or 275 AD.[tpl]cite book | last = Klepper | first = Nicolae | title = Romania: An Illustrated History[/tpl][tpl]Verify credibility|date=March 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = MacKendrick | first = Paul | title = The Dacian Stones Speak[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Pop | first = Ioan Aurel | title = Romanians and Romania: A Brief History[/tpl] Its territory consisted of eastern and southeastern Transylvania, and the regions of Banat and Oltenia (located in modern Romania). Dacia was organised from the beginning as an imperial province, and remained so throughout the Roman occupation.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007[/tpl] It was one of the empire’s Latin provinces; official epigraphs attest that the language of administration was Latin.[tpl]cite book | last1 = Köpeczi | first1 = Béla | last2 = Makkai | first2 = László | last3 = Mócsy | first3 = András | last4 = Szász | first4 = Zoltán | last5 = Barta | first5 = Gábor |title = History of Transylvania - From the Beginnings to 1606[/tpl] Historian estimates of the population of Roman Dacia range from 650,000 to 1,200,000.[tpl]cite book | last = Georgescu | first = Vlad | title = The Romanians - A History[/tpl]
Dacians that remained outside the Roman Empire after the Dacian wars of AD 101-106 had been named Dakoi prosoroi (Latin Daci limitanei), "neighbouring Dacians". Modern historians use the generic name "Free Dacians" or Independent Dacians.[tpl]sfn|Bowman| Cameron |Garnsey | 2005|p=224[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Schütte|1917|p=143[/tpl]Tomaschek (1883) 407 The tribes Daci Magni (Great Dacians), Costoboci (generally considered a Dacian subtribe), and Carpi remained outside the Roman empire, in what the Romans called Dacia Libera (Free Dacia).[tpl]sfn|Waldman |Mason |2006|p=205[/tpl] By the early third century the "Free Dacians" were a significantly troublesome group, by now identified as the Carpi.[tpl]sfn|Bowman| Cameron |Garnsey | 2005|p=224[/tpl] Bichir argues that the Carpi were the most powerful of the Dacian tribes who had become the principal enemy of the Romans in the region.[tpl]sfn|Siani-Davies P.|Siani-Davies M.|Deletant |2006|p=205[/tpl] In 214 AD, Caracalla campaigned against the Free Dacians.[tpl]sfn | Cowan | 2003 | p=5 [/tpl] There were also campaigns against the Dacians recorded in 236 AD.[tpl]sfn | Hazel | 2002 | p=360[/tpl]
Roman Dacia was evacuated by the Romans under emperor Aurelian (ruled 271-5 AD). Aurelian made this decision on account of barbarian pressures on the Empire there caused by the Carpi, Visigoths, Sarmatians, and Asding Vandals; the lines of defence needed to be shortened, and Dacia was deemed not important enough given the demands on available resources. Roman power in Thracia rested mainly with the legions stationed in Moesia. The rural nature of Thracia's populations, and the distance from Roman authority, encouraged the presence of local troops to support Moesia's legions. Over the next few centuries, the province was periodically and increasingly attacked by migrating Germanic tribes. The reign of Justinian saw the construction of over 100 legionary fortresses to supplement the defense. Thracians in Moesia and Dacia were Romanized, while those within the Byzantine empire were their Hellenized descendants that had mingled with the Greeks.

===After the Aurelian Retreat===

Dacia was never a uniformly Romanised area. Post-Aurelianic Dacia fell into three divisions: the area along the river, usually under some type of Roman administration even if in a highly barbarized form; the zone beyond this area, from which Roman military personnel had withdrawn, leaving a sizable population behind that was heavily Romanised; and finally what is now the northern parts of Moldavia, Crisana, and Maramures. This final area was always peripheral to the Roman province, not militarily occupied but nonetheless controlled by Rome and part of the Roman economic sphere. Here lived the Carpi, often called “Free Dacians”.[tpl]sfn | Burns | 1991 | pp=110-111 [/tpl]
The Aurelian retreat was a purely military decision to withdraw the Roman troops to defend the Danube. The inhabitants of the old province of Dacia displayed no awareness of impeding disaster. There were no sudden flights or destruction of property.[tpl]sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 [/tpl] It is not possible to discern how many civilians followed the army out of Dacia; it is clear that there was no mass emigration, since there is evidence of continuity of settlement in Dacian villages and farms; the evacuation may not at first have been intended to be a permanent measure.[tpl]sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 [/tpl] The Romans left the province, but they didn’t consider that they lost it.[tpl]sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 [/tpl] Dobrogea was not abandoned at all, but continued as part of the Roman Empire for over 350 years.[tpl]sfn| MacKendrick |2000|p=161[/tpl] As late as AD 300, the tetrarchic emperors had resettled tens of thousands of Dacian Carpi inside the empire, dispersing them in communities the length of the Danube, from Hungary to the Black Sea.[tpl]sfn | Heather | 2006 | p=159 [/tpl]

==Society==

Dacians were divided into two classes: the aristocracy (tarabostes) and the common people (comati). Only the aristocracy had the right to cover their heads, and wore a felt hat. The common people, who comprised the rank and file of the army, the peasants and artisans, might have been called capillati in Latin. Their appearance and clothing can be seen on Trajan's Column.

===Occupations===

The chief occupations of the Dacians were agriculture, apiculture, viticulture, livestock, ceramics and metalworking. They also worked the gold and silver mines of Transylvania. At Pecica, Arad a Dacian workshop was discovered, along with equipment for minting coins and evidence of bronze, silver, and iron-working that suggests a broad spectrum of smithing.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 [/tpl] Evidence for the mass production of iron is found on many Dacian sites, indicating guild-like specialization.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 [/tpl] Dacian ceramic manufacturing traditions continue from the pre-Roman to the Roman period, both in provincial and unoccupied Dacia, and well into the fourth and even early fifth centuries.[tpl]sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=229[/tpl] They engaged in considerable external trade, as is shown by the number of foreign coins found in the country (see also Decebalus Treasure). On the northernmost frontier of "free Dacia", coin circulation steadily grew in the first and second centuries, with a decline in the third and a rise again in the fourth century; the same pattern as observed for the Banat region to the southwest. What is remarkable is the extent and increase in coin circulation even after Roman withdrawal from Dacia, and as far north as Transcarpathia.[tpl]sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=232[/tpl]

===Currency===

The first coins produced by the Geto-Dacians were imitations of silver coins of the Macedonian kings Philip II and Alexander III (the Great). Early in the 1st century BC, the Dacians replaced these with silver denarii of the Roman Republic, both official coins of Rome exported to Dacia, as well as locally made imitations of them. The Roman province Dacia is represented on the Roman sestertius coin as a woman seated on a rock, holding an aquila, a small child on her knee. The aquila holds ears of grain, and another small child is seated before her holding grapes.

===Construction===

Dacians had developed the murus dacicus (double-skinned ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmizegetusa in what is today Hunedoara County, Romania.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215[/tpl] This type of wall has been discovered not only in the Dacian citadel of the Orastie mountains, but also in those at Breaza near Fagaras, Tilisca near Sibiu, Capalna in the Sebes valley, Banita not far from Petrosani, and Piatra Craivii to the north of Alba Iulia.[tpl]sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=91 [/tpl] The degree of their urban development was displayed on Trajan's Column and in the account of how Sarmizegetusa was defeated by the Romans. The Romans identified and destroyed the aqueducts and pipelines of the Dacian capital, only thus being able to end the long siege of Sarmizegetusa.

==Material culture==

According to archaeological findings, the cradle of the Dacian culture is considered to be north of the Danube towards the Carpathian mountains, in the historical Romanian province of Muntenia. It is identified as an evolution of the Iron Age Basarabi culture. The earlier Iron Age Basarabi evidence in the northern lower Danube area connects to the iron-using Ferigile-Birsesti group. This is an archaeological manifestation of the historical Getae who, along with the Agathyrsae, are one of a number of tribal formations recorded by Herodotus.[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.48-4.49[/tpl][tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=86 [/tpl] In archaeology, "free Dacians" are attested by the Puchov culture (in which there are Celtic elements) and Lipiţa culture to the east of the Carpathians.[tpl]sfn| Millar |1981|p=279[/tpl] The Lipiţa culture has a Dacian/North Thracian origin.[tpl]sfn | Shchukin|Kazanski|Sharov | 2006 | p=20 [/tpl] [tpl]sfn | Kostrzewski | 1949 | p=230 [/tpl] This North Thracian population was dominated by strong Celtic influences, or had simply absorbed Celtic ethnic components.[tpl]sfn |Jażdżewski | 1948 | p=76[/tpl] Lipiţa culture has been linked to the Dacian tribe of Costoboci.[tpl]sfn | Shchukin | 1989 | p=306 [/tpl][tpl]sfn | Parvan | Florescu | 1982 | p=547 [/tpl]
Specific Dacian material culture includes: wheel-turned pottery that is generally plain but with distinctive elite wares, massive silver dress fibulae, precious metal plate, ashlar masonry, fortifications, upland sanctuaries with horseshoe-shaped precincts, and decorated clay heart altars at settlement sites. Among many discovered artifacts, the Dacian bracelets stand out, depicting their cultural and aesthetic sense.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 [/tpl] There are difficulties correlating funerary monuments chronologically with Dacian settlements; a small number of burials are known, along with cremation pits, and isolated rich burials as at Cugir.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp=214-215 [/tpl] Dacian burial ritual continued under Roman occupation and into the post-Roman period.[tpl]sfn | Ellis | 1998| p=233[/tpl]

===Language===

The Dacians are generally considered to have been Thracian speakers, representing a cultural continuity from earlier Iron Age communities.[tpl]sfn|Peregrine|Ember|2001|p=215[/tpl] Some historians and linguists consider Dacian language to be a dialect of or the same language as Thracian.[tpl]sfn|Oltean|2007|p=45[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=401[/tpl] The vocalism and consonantism differentiate the Dacian and Thracian languages.[tpl]sfn|Pârvan|1926|p=648[/tpl] Others consider that Dacian and Illyrian form regional varieties (dialects) of a common language. (Thracians inhabited modern southern Bulgaria and northern Greece. Illyrians lived in modern Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia.)
The ancient languages of these people became extinct, and their cultural influence highly reduced, after the repeated invasions of the Balkans by Celts, Huns, Goths, and Sarmatians, accompanied by persistent hellenization, romanisation and later slavicisation. Therefore, in the study of the toponomy of Dacia, one must take account of the fact that some place-names were taken by the Slavs from as yet unromanised Dacians.[tpl]sfn|Pares|Seton-Watso|Williams|Brooke Jopson |1939|p=149[/tpl] A number of Dacian words are preserved in ancient sources, amounting to about 1150 anthroponyms and 900 toponyms, and in Discorides some of the rich plant lore of the Dacians is preserved along with the names of 42 medicinal plants.[tpl]sfn|Nandris|1976|p=730[/tpl]

The Dacians knew about writing.[tpl]sfn| Turnock |1988|p=42 [/tpl][tpl]sfn| Cunliffe |1994|p=193 [/tpl][tpl]sfn | Millar | 1981 | p=275[/tpl] Permanent contacts with the Graeco-Roman world had brought the use of the Greek and later the Latin alphabet.[tpl]sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=94 [/tpl] It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there is no doubt about the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society.[tpl]sfn | Glodariu | 1976 | p=101 [/tpl] However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains.[tpl]sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=94[/tpl] Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.[tpl]sfn | Applebaum | 1976 | p=95[/tpl]

===Religion===

Dacian religion was considered by the classic sources as a key source of authority, suggesting to some that Dacia was a predominantly theocratic state led by priest-kings. However, the layout of the Dacian capital Sarmizegethusa indicates the possibility of co-rulership, with a separate high king and high priest.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 [/tpl] Ancient sources recorded the names of several Dacian high priests (Deceneus, Comosicus and Vezina) and various orders of priests: "god-worshipers", "smoke-walkers" and "founders".[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 [/tpl] Both Hellenistic and Oriental influences are discernible in the religious background, alongside chthonic and solar motifs.[tpl]sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p=215 [/tpl]
According to Herodotus' account of the story of Zalmoxis or Zamolxis,[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl] the Getae (speaking the same language as the Dacians, according to Strabo) believed in the immortality of the soul, and regarded death as merely a change of country. Their chief priest held a prominent position as the representative of the supreme deity, Zalmoxis, who is called also Gebeleizis by some among them.[tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl]Histories by Herodotus Book 4 translated by G. Rawlinson Strabo wrote about the high priest Decaeneus: "a man who not only had wandered through Egypt, but also had thoroughly learned certain prognostics through which he would pretend to tell the divine will; and within a short time he was set up as god (as I said when relating the story of Zamolxis)."[tpl]sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,11[/tpl]
The Goth Jordanes in his Getica (The origin and deeds of the Goths), gives an account of Deceneus, the highest priest of King Burebista, and considered Dacians a nation related to the Goths. Besides Zalmoxis, the Dacians believed in other deities, such as Gebeleizis, the god of storm and lightning,  possibly related to the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos.Tomashek,Die Alten Thrakern, II, page 62 He was represented as a handsome man, sometimes with a beard. Later Gebeleizis was equated with Zalmoxis as the same god. According to Herodotus, Gebeleizis (*Zebeleizis/Gebeleizis who is only mentioned by Herodotus) is just another name of Zalmoxis.[tpl]sfn|Glodariu|Pop|Nagler|2005|p=120[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Herodotus|440 BC|loc=4.93-4.97[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Tomaschek|1883|p=410[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Paliga|1994|p=440[/tpl]
Another important deity was Bendis, goddess of the moon and the hunt.BENDIS : Thracian goddess of the moon & hunting ; mythology ; pictures
By a decree of the oracle of Dodona, which required the Athenians to grant land for a shrine or temple, her cult was introduced into Attica by immigrant Thracian residents,Extensive discussion of whether the date is 429 or 413 BC was reviewed and newly analyzed in Christopher Planeaux, "The Date of Bendis' Entry into Attica" The Classical Journal 96.2 (December 2000:165-192). Planeaux offers a reconstruction of the inscription mentioninmg the first introduction, p and, though Thracian and Athenian processions remained separate, both cult and festival became so popular that in Plato's time (c. 429-13 BC) its festivities were naturalised as an official ceremony of the Athenian city-state, called the Bendideia.Fifth-century fragmentary inscriptions that record formal descrees regarding formal aspects of the Bendis cult, are reproduced in Planeaux 2000:170f
Known Dacian theonyms include Zalmoxis, Gebeleïzis and Darzalas.Hdt. 4.94,Their belief in their immortality is as follows: they believe that they do not die, but that one who perishes goes to the deity Salmoxis, or Gebeleïzis, as some of them call him.Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898),(Zalmoxis) or Zamolxis (Zamolxis). Said to have been so called from the bear's skin (zalmos) in which he was clothed as soon as he was born. He was, according to the story current among the Greeks on the Hellespont, a Getan, who had been a slave to Pythagoras in Samos, but was manumitted, and acquired not only great wealth, but large stores of knowledge from Pythagoras, and from the Egyptians, whom he visited in the course of his travels. He returned among the Getae, introducing the civilization and the religious ideas which he had gained, especially regarding the immortality of the soul. Herodotus, however, suspects that he was an indigenous Getan divinity ( Herod.iv. 95) Gebeleizis is probably cognate to the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos (also Zbelsurdos, Zibelthurdos), wielder of lightning and thunderbolts. Derzelas (also Darzalas) was a chthonic god of health and human vitality. The pagan religion survived longer in Dacia than in other parts of the empire; Christianity made little headway until the fifth century.[tpl]sfn | Southern | 2001 | p=325 [/tpl]

===Pottery===

Fragments of pottery with different "inscriptions" with Latin and Greek letters incised before and after firing have been discovered in the settlement at Ocnita – Valcea.[tpl]sfn | Glodariu | 1976 | p=128 [/tpl] An inscription carries the word Basileus (Βασιλεύς in Greek, meaning "king") and seems to have been written before the vessel was hardened by fire.[tpl]sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=67[/tpl] Other inscriptions contain the name of the king, believed to be Thiemarcus,[tpl]sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=67[/tpl] and Latin groups of letters (BVR, REB).[tpl]sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=26 [/tpl] BVR indicates the name of the tribe or union of tribes, the Buridavensi Dacians who lived at Buridava and who were mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century AD under the name of Buridavensioi.[tpl]sfn | MacKenzie| 1986 | p=66 [/tpl]

===Clothing and science===

The typical dress of Dacians, both men and women, can be seen on Trajan's column.[tpl]sfn | Bury | Cook |Adcock|Percival Charlesworth| 1954 |p=543 [/tpl] Dio Chrysostom described the Dacians as natural philosophers.[tpl]sfn | Sidebottom | 2007 |p=5[/tpl]

==Warfare==

The history of Dacian warfare spans from c. 10th century BC up to the 2nd century AD in the region typically referred to by Ancient Greek and Latin historians as Dacia. It concerns the armed conflicts of the Dacian tribes and their kingdoms in the Balkans. Apart from conflicts between Dacians and neighboring nations and tribes, numerous wars were recorded among Dacian tribes as well.

===Weapons===

The weapon most associated with the Dacian forces that fought against Trajan’s army during his invasions of Dacia was the falx, a single-edged scythe-like weapon. The falx was able to inflict horrible wounds on opponents, easily disabling or killing the heavily armored Roman legionaries that they faced. This weapon, more so than any other single factor, forced the Roman army to adopt previously unused or modified equipment to suit the conditions on the Dacian battlefield.Schmitz (2005) 30

==Notable individuals==

This is a list of several important Dacian individuals or those of partly Dacian origin.

==Legacy==

In 2004, a study of mitochondrial DNA polymorphism was performed on the skeletal remains of Thracians from southeastern Romania dating from the Bronze Age and Iron Age. MtDNA were compared with several modern mtDNA sequences from five present-day European populations. The results reflect a genetic similarity between the old Thracian individuals and the modern south-east European populations.[tpl]sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246[/tpl]
The Thracian individuals show informative point mutations in 7np (nucleotide position), the Romanian, Greek and Albanian individuals in 7np, and the Bulgarian individuals in only 5np out of 12 most informative nucleotide positions presented in the study.[tpl]sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246[/tpl] As concerns the frequency of point mutations in the 12 nucleotide positions, the Italian individuals show the highest mutation frequency with 12.5%, followed by the Thracian individuals with 8.3%, the Albanian individuals with 7.5%, the Romanian and Greek individuals with 6.25%, and the Bulgarian individuals with only 4.6%.[tpl]sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246[/tpl]
Computing the frequency of common point mutations of the present-day European population with the Thracian population has indicated that the Italians (7.9%), the Albanians (6.3%) and the Greeks (5.8%) have a bias of closer genetic kinship with the Thracian individuals than the Romanian and Bulgarian individuals (only 4.2%).[tpl]sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246[/tpl] The study concluds that, it can only be supposed, but cannot be proven that "the old Thracian populations contributed to the modern Romanian genetic pool."[tpl]sfn| Cardos| Stoian | Miritoiu | Comsa |2004|pp=239 & 246[/tpl]
