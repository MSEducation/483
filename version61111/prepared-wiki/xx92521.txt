[[Cephamycin]]

CATEGORIES: Cephalosporin antibiotics

Cephamycins are a group of beta-lactam antibiotics. They are very similar to cephalosporins, and the cephamycins are sometimes classified as cephalosporins.
Like cephalosporins, cephamycins are based upon the cephem nucleus. Unlike most cephalosporins, cephamycins are a very efficacious antibiotic against anaerobic microbes.
Cephamycins were originally produced by Streptomyces, but synthetic ones have been produced as well.
Cephamycins possess a methoxy group at the 7-alpha position.[tpl]cite book |author=Oreste A. Mascaretti |title=Bacteria Versus Antibacterial Agents: An Integrated Approach |publisher=American Society Microbiology |location= |year=2003 |pages=144  |isbn=1-55581-258-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]
In addition, cephamycins have been shown to be stable against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms although their use in clinical practice is lacking for this indication.
