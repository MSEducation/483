[[Lumsden, Newfoundland and Labrador]]

CATEGORIES: Populated coastal places in Canada, Towns in Newfoundland and Labrador

The community of Lumsden, formerly known as Cat Harbour, is located on the Straight Shore of Newfoundland and Labrador near communities such as Musgrave Harbour and Newtown. Lumsden was formerly made up of two settlements, Lumsden North on the tip of a sandy peninsula and Lumsden South on the main road. Although the harbour in Lumsden is not ideal because it is not sheltered, Lumsden does have great fishing grounds.W.G Handcock and C.W. Sanger, Outports on the Northeast Coast of Newfoundland, 1981.

==History==

Lumsden, then called Cat Harbour, was visited as early as the 18th century by French fishermen because of its good inshore fishing grounds. It was a part of the French Shore until 1783. In 1836 census the population was recorded as 97 for Lumsden and Cape Freels combined. The population of Lumsden increased as the migratory fishery declined because people began to setlle permanently. The name was changed from Cat Harbour to Lumsden in 1917 after the Rev. James Lumsden. The economy in Lumsden was based on the Labrador fishery, inshore fishery, seal fishery, and woods work. There was also a small boat fishery which trucked the fish to the community of Valleyfield. The people of Lumsden were avid supporters of the Fisherman's Protective Union, a local council was formed in 1901 and a Union Store was built in 1912 and was open until 1932. The first highroad in Lumsden was built in 1952, a regional highschool was built ten years later in 1962. Eventually Lumsden North and South merged when the North settlement was vacated, and the town of Lumsden was incorporated in 1968.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador
