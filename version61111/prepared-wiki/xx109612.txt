The Liga Nacional de Básquet (abbreviated LNB, and literally in English "National Basketball League") is the top level of the Argentine basketball league system. The league is controlled by the Basketball Clubs' Association (in Spanish: Asociación de Clubes de Básquetbol). The LNB's predecessor is the defunct Campeonato Argentino de Clubes, organized by the Argentine Basketball Federation.
The league was created through the efforts of coach León Najnudel and sports journalist Osvaldo Orcasitas in the 1980s to make Argentine basketball more competitive through the merging of the many existing local leagues.[tpl]cite web |url=http://indeportes.com.ar/basquet/novedades/articulos/1353_lnb-la-historia-de-su-origen.html |title=LNB: la historia de su origen |author=Matías Ron Ares |publisher=In Deportes |language=Spanish |date=2010-03-14 |accessdate=2010-10-19 [/tpl] It is designed like the NBA, with regular season, all-star game, and playoffs. However, unlike the NBA, the LNB has promotion and relegation with the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA), the league immediately below.
A tribute to Najnudel's vision is the string of successes of the Argentine national basketball team, culminating with the team's Olympic gold medal won at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the international careers of many players who started in the league.

==Competition format==

Following a system similar to the European basketball leagues, there are two leves of competition: the Liga A (first division) and the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (National Promotion Tournament in Spanish) or TNA (second division). Both tournaments feature promotions and relegations and are organized by the Clubs Association of Argentina. On the 2011–12 season a third level of competition was inaugurated, the Torneo Federal de Básquetbol,Torneo Federal de Básquetbol, Official site.[tpl]es icon[/tpl] which encompasses a wide array of teams from all over the country and is organized by the Argentine Basketball Federation. An additional short tournament between the top seven teams in the first division and a wild card takes place before the start of the regular season.

===Liga A===

The top tier of the league consists of 16 teams, which are later divided into two Divisions, North and South, according to their geographical location. The regular season is divided in two stages: the first stage consists of a double round-robin between teams on the same Division only, with standings decided by a points system. On the second stage, each team carries over 50% of the points obtained in the first stage and a new double round-robin starts, this time between all 16 teams. After the regular season ends, the standings determine different outcomes which are as follows:
The Championship Playoffs follow a tournament format, where each team plays against the opponent in a best-of-five series in the quarterfinals and semifinals, and a best-of-seven series in the finals.

===Torneo Nacional de Ascenso===

The TNA consists of 21 teams, which are divided into two Divisions, North and South, with 10 teams going to the North Division and 11 teams going to the South Division. The competition format is similar to the Liga A, with a regular season divided in two stages. On the first stage, teams from the same division compete in a double round-robin format, with standings determined by a points system. After the first phase each team carries over 50% of the points obtained to the second stage. On the second stage, each division is split into two groups as follows: the top five teams from the North Division (TNA1 North), the top six teams from the South Division (TNA1 South), and the remaining teams from the North and South groups (TNA2 North and TNA2 South, respectively). Each group then competes in a separate double round-robin.
