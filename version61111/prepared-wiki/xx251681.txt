CATEGORIES: Geography of St. Charles County, Missouri, New Urbanism communities

New Town at St. Charles is a partially completed planned community within the city of St. Charles, Missouri. The community's developers espouse the principles of Traditional Neighborhood Design and New Urbanism. New Urbanists designers advocate walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods with relatively high population densities, as an alternative to the urban sprawl of conventional, automobile-centered suburbs.http://www.newurbannews.com/NewTownInsideJul05.html  When complete, New Town will cover [tpl]convert|755|acre|km2[/tpl], will contain up to 5,700 dwellings, and will be one of the largest new urbanist communities in the United States. It is expected to take 12 to 15 years to complete.http://www.southernliving.com/travel/south-west/new-town-st-charles-st-louis-missouri-00400000046775/

==Natural environment==

New Town is located in northeastern St. Charles County, approximately [tpl]convert|18|mi|km[/tpl] from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. New Town was built on a small natural ridge and is surrounded by low farmland and wetland. The area is home to many species of ducks,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2002-11-27/news/odd-ducks/|title=Odd Ducks|author=Rushton, Bruce|work=Riverfront Times|date=2002-11-27|accessdate=2010-01-09[/tpl] cranes, geese, snakes, deer, fish, hawks, and eagles. The Great Rivers Greenway District and Katy Trail State Park both run close by New Town and provide residents access to wildlife.
In 1993, the Midwest experienced the most severe flood in recent history,[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1993|title=Great Flood of 1993|work=Wikipedia[/tpl] and much of St. Charles County was underwater. Because of its higher elevation, little flooding occurred on the future site of New Town. Nevertheless, New Town's developers built a series of lakes and canals for drainage and used the excavated dirt to raise the site's elevation by several feet.
