===Television career===

====Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher====

Maher assumed the host role on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher, a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on ABC from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the  discussions. Jerry Seinfeld, a regular guest on the show, stated that Politically Incorrect reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and 60s "when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host."[tpl]Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/arts/television-lots-of-political-humor-and-no-morton-kondracke.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/M/Maher,%20Bill|title =  Talking Issues|date = August 10, 1995|accessdate = August 9, 2010|publisher = Chicago Tribune| first=Hugh| last=Hart[/tpl]
Politically Incorrect won an array of awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Technical Direction, two CableACE awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing and hosting of Politically Incorrect, including ten Emmy nominations, two TV Guide nominations, and two Writers Guild nominations.  ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for Politically Incorrect in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark shortly after the September 11 attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html |title=The Big Story: Politically Incorrect |accessdate=June 19, 2007 |work=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070713120522/http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html| archivedate= July 13, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He agreed with his guest, conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush's statement calling 9/11 hijackers cowards). Maher said, "We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right." Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military.[tpl]Cite book|last=Goldberg |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September 11 |publisher=RDV Books |year=2002 |page=77 |isbn=0-9719206-0-5[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |title=Talk host's towering rant: S.F. not worth saving |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/MNGFMFMNV41.DTL |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |postscript=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071102175526/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/MNGFMFMNV41.DTL| archivedate= November 2, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  After receiving complaints, FedEx and Sears Roebuck pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Navasky |first=Victor |title= Profiles in Cowardice |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011105/navasky |accessdate=October 9, 2007|newspaper=The Nation |postscript=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071102202757/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011105/navasky| archivedate= November 2, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjnUyVhccr4C&pg=PA389&lpg=PA389&dq=Maher+cancellation+free+speech+award&source=bl&ots=K22Ak8bwb7&sig=1Ew7n6dRZHwLgaHQ5EqNJkGDoDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mYhwUYSyFOmQ2gXGvoCQBw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Maher%20cancellation%20free%20speech%20award&f=false |title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations - |author=Sayre, Shay; King, Cynthia King|publisher=Google Books|year=2010|accessdate=2013-04-19|edition=2[/tpl]
Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on Politically Incorrect. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to retarded children.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9D06E6DA1F3DF93BA25752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=TV Host's Words Draw Criticism and Apology | date=January 18, 2001 | accessdate=April 1, 2010[/tpl]
The show was canceled on June 16, 2002, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group had dropped the show from its ABC-affiliated stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of Politically Incorrect, Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president's award (for "championing free speech").

====Real Time with Bill Maher====

In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer and co-writer of Real Time with Bill Maher, a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network HBO. HBO announced in July 2011 the show had been renewed for its tenth season (2012) and is currently in its 12th.[tpl]cite news|author=Collins, Scott|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 28, 2011 |title=TCA 2011: HBO to get 'Luck'-y in January |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/07/tca-2011-.html[/tpl] During an interview, Maher told Terry Gross (on NPR's Fresh Air) that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on Politically Incorrect.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4490632 | work=NPR | title=Bill Maher: Four More Years | date=February 8, 2005 | accessdate=August 9, 2010[/tpl]
As with his previous show, Politically Incorrect, Maher begins Real Time with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with three panelists, usually consisting of pundits, authors, activists and journalists, for a discussion of the week's events. In the segment "New Rules" at the end of each show, Maher delivers a humorous editorial on popular culture and American politics.
In late May 2005, Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus sent a letter to Time Warner's board of directors requesting Real Time be canceled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous.  Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157435,00.html |title=Bill Maher's Remark About Army 'Borders on Treason,' Lawmaker Says – Celebrity Gossip | Entertainment News | Arts And Entertainment |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=October 18, 2010[/tpl]
Real Time has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime Emmy Awards and six Writer's Guild awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America.Producers Guild of America Awards - Winners 1990-2010; PGA.org; May 29, 2012 Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once.

Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to fundamental change in gun laws because both Democrats and Republicans favor guns.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Walls Have Ears, and Other Side Effects of This Medication|series=Conan|season=3|number=45|airdate=February 12, 2013|network=TBS[/tpl]

===Religion===

He is described as an agnostic, and refers to himself as one in his feature film Religulous.Holden, Stephen (September 30, 2008). "Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks", The New York Times  As for labels, he has denied being an atheist, saying, "I'm not an atheist. There's a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn't believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don't need. But I'm not an atheist, no."Thompson, Stephen (October 9, 2002). "Is There a God?". The AV Club. Maher has also occasionally referred to himself as an "apatheist", saying "I don't know what happens when you die, and I don't care", adding, "there's atheist and there's agnostic, and I'm okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team"."Bill Maher explains his 'apatheism,' apathetic atheism". CNN Belief Blogs.

He asked, "Am I a racist to feel alarmed by that? Because I am. And it's not because of the race, it's because of the religion. I don’t have to apologize, do I, for not wanting the Western world to be taken over by Islam in 300 years? Sharia law is being institutionalized in England? Well, then I am right, I should be alarmed."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/11/01/bill_maher_on_muslims|title=Bill Maher to Muslims: Go away|publisher = Salon.com|date = October 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110222111356/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/11/01/bill_maher_on_muslims| archivedate= February 22, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He later defended his comments on CNN, saying, "And when I say Westerner, I mean someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not.

On August 24, 2009, Maher was a guest on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. On the topic of getting health care reform legislation passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, "he only needs 51." "Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent — sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country — he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697/ |title=Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |accessdate=October 18, 2010[/tpl]
Maher has expressed the view that most illness is generally the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine is often not the best way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is a primary cause of illness, and that "the answer isn't another pill."Real Time with Bill Maher; September 28, 2007; HBO He also has said:" If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you're already on drugs!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.winhs.org/ |title=WINHS, World Institute of Natural Health Sciences - Home |publisher=Winhs.org |accessdate=2012-02-24[/tpl]
He has expressed his distaste for the pharmaceutical and health care industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming unhealthy food that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of high-fructose corn syrup is a contributor to the rise in frequency of obesity in the United States.Larry King Live – Interview With Bill Maher; CNN; September 13, 2004
In a discussion with Michael Moore about the film Sicko, Maher said, "The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit."Maher and Moore Chew (Out) the Fat; Kerry Trueman, The Huffington Post; May 30, 2007
On October 9, 2009, on his HBO show, Maher debated the effectiveness of flu vaccinations with Bill Frist and stated, "Why would you let them be the ones to stick a disease into your arm? I would never get a swine flu vaccine or any vaccine. I don’t trust the government, especially with my health."  Maher also expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the swine flu and whether completely healthy people could die from it.
Maher's comments on medicine have generated criticism from the medical and skeptic communities, and his remarks have been called unscientific and even harmful.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/bill-maher-vs-the-flu-vaccine/ | work=The New York Times | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | date=October 13, 2009 | accessdate=April 1, 2010 | title=Bill Maher vs. the Flu Vaccine[/tpl]  Infectious diseases expert Paul Offit has written that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher have put children at unnecessary risk.

Maher responded to the criticism, saying, "What I've read about what they think I'm saying is not what I've said. I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No."Slotek, Jim (October 28, 2009). "Needling Bill Maher". Winnipeg Sun.
