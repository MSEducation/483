The Camden Riversharks is an American  professional baseball team based in Camden, New Jersey.  They are a member of the Liberty Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball.  From the 2001 season to the present, the Riversharks have played their home games at Campbell's Field, which is situated at the base of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.  Due to its location on the Delaware River, the ballpark offers a clear view of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania skyline.
Since beginning play in 2001 as an expansion team, the Riversharks have consistently averaged over 4,000 fans per game, with crowds approaching and sometimes exceeding 7,000 on fireworks nights. The Riversharks are a cheaper alternative to the Philadelphia Phillies for area baseball fans. The "Riversharks" name refers to the location of Camden on the Delaware River, as the primary logo incorporates the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that links Camden to Philadelphia.
In June 2008, the Riversharks unveiled a partnership with Wawa Food Markets, based in nearby Wawa, Pennsylvania.  The partnership includes a series of giveaway promotions and the addition of Wawa's mascot, Wally Goose, to the entourage of Riversharks mascots.Sharks partner with Wawa
