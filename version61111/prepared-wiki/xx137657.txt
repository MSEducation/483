==Athletics, Mascot==

Richland is classified as a single "A" school for most sports, while in other sports it reaches the double "A" classification. Though Richland has not had any state championship teams for a while, Richland has had success on the state level with individual athletes.
Notable individual athletes have gone through its doors in the sports of swimming– Jessica Brutz was a state champion (6-Time High School All-American and 6-Time NCAA All-American)– and wrestling– Eric Bowser in 1986 and Chad Sichak in 2002. The girls volleyball team has done exceptionally well, winning the state title a number of times in the 1990s as well as placing in states in numerous years. Stephanie Istvan may be the most decorated athlete to pass through Richland earning two consecutive Gatorade player of the year honors.--> In 2002, the Girls soccer team won its first District Championship and advanced to the State Playoffs, as well as won District Championships in 2008 and 2009, also advancing in the State Playoffs. In addition, The Richland Boys Soccer Team has won its District Championship three years in a row (2004-2006) however lost in 2007, but won again in 2008, and not again until 2010 advancing to the Pennsylvania Single A State Boys Soccer Playoffs each time and only making it past the first round in 2004. The Richland Football program has been rebuilding recently. In 2008 they made it to the State playoffs. In 2010 their record was 6-4, including 5 straight wins to close the season. In 2012, they went undefeated and beat rival Forest Hills 27-0 to win the District 6 AA Championship, ultimately losing in the PIAA Western Finals to Aliquippa High School 37-21.
