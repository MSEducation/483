==Criticisms==

Peter, not unlike other technology media personalities, has attracted criticism for a thin technical background in the technologies he showcases, and for not disclosing affiliations with particular companies and brands such as Philips and Samsung.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1421581.htm| title= Gadget Makers Love the Gadget Guy| first=Peter| last=Lacina| date=25 July 2005| publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation| accessdate=2005-05-25[/tpl]  His appearances on the My Business Show typically feature him presenting recommendations to business owners that appear on face value to prioritise low initial cost rather than best practices or value.
Though his actual technical knowledge has been questioned from time to time, on 28 April 2009 Peter covered for the Sunrise program the issue of the "Internet Filling Up".[tpl]cite web| url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/sunrise/video/gadgets/index.html?autoplay_id=13190117| title= Internet Filling Up| date=28 April 2009| publisher=Channel Seven Australia| accessdate=2009-05-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] During the segment there was a reference to the infamous internet tubes, a statement that the internet was founded in 1996, and a strong push towards naming Cisco switches as a solution to the crisis, Cisco being a company Peter has known connections with via the ZyNet television show.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.zynet.com.au/about_us/media_release__operation_fifteen_disaster_recovery| title= Operation Fifteen Technology Recovery| publisher=ZyNet| accessdate=2009-05-25[/tpl] This segment has been debunked in the media and by technology specialists, including the Australian political site Crikey.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2009/05/05/sunrise-cisco-and-the-internet-is-full-astroturfing-campaign/| title= Sunrise, Cisco and the “Internet is full” astroturfing campaign| date=5 May 2009| publisher=crikey.com.au| accessdate=2009-05-05[/tpl] The original source for the segment is a report by Nemertes Research,Internet Interrupted: Why Architectural Limitations Will Fracture The 'Net which in itself has also been heavily criticised for being factually incorrect.Timothy Karr Suckered by AstroturfSteve Lohr Bits
