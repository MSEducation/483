[[Akashiyaki]]

CATEGORIES: Dumplings, Japanese cuisine

[tpl]nihongo|Akashiyaki|明石焼き[/tpl] is a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Made of an egg-rich batter and octopus dipped into dashi (a thin fish broth) before eating. Locals refer to it simply as [tpl]nihongo|tamagoyaki|玉子焼き[/tpl]. Modern style akashiyaki first started selling in the Taishō period by a yatai shopper Seitarō Mukai. There are over 70 akashiyaki shops in Akashi now.[tpl]cite web | title = 明石名物玉子焼き | trans_title = Tamagoyaki, a specialty of Akashi | publisher = Akashi Tourism Association | date =  | url = http://www.yokoso-akashi.jp/tamago-top.htm| accessdate = 2011-04-13 | language = Japanese[/tpl]
Although takoyaki, another Japanese dumpling, is more popular in Japan, it is based on akashiyaki.[tpl]cite web | last = Alan | first = Wiren | title = Takoyaki: Icon of Osaka | publisher = Japan Visitor | date =  | url = http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=361&pID=1168 | accessdate = 2011-04-13[/tpl] Both are made with a takoyaki pan, a type of frying pan or cooktop with many hemispherical molds. Compared to takoyaki, akashiyaki has a softer, more eggy texture.
A similar dish called "Neo Kobe Pizza" is shown in the cyberpunk visual novel video game Snatcher.
