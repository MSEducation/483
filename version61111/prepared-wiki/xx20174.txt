Due to the past importance of Utrecht as a religious centre, several monumental churches have survived.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kerkenkijken.nl/|title=Kerken Kijken Utrecht | Home|publisher=Kerkenkijken.nl|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] Most prominent is the Dom Church. Other notable churches include the romanesque St Peter's and St John's churches, the gothic churches of St James and St Nicholas, and the so-called Buurkerk, now converted into a [[Museum Van Speelklok tot Pierement|museum for automatically playing musical instruments
]].

==Transport==

===Public transport===

Because of its central location, Utrecht is well connected to the rest of the Netherlands and has a well-developed public transport network.

====Heavy and light rail====

Utrecht Centraal is the main railway station of Utrecht. There are also some smaller stations in the suburbs: Utrecht Lunetten, Utrecht Overvecht, Utrecht Terwijde, Utrecht Zuilen and Vleuten. Utrecht Maliebaan closed in 1939 and has since been converted into the Dutch Railway Museum.
From Utrecht Centraal, there are regular services to all major Dutch cities; direct services to Schiphol Airport began in March 2006 with the opening of the Utrechtboog. International InterCityExpress (ICE) services to Germany as well as regular local trains to all areas surrounding Utrecht also depart from Utrecht Centraal.
The Utrecht sneltram is a light rail scheme running southwards Utrecht Centraal to the suburbs of IJsselstein, Kanaleneiland, Lombok-Leidseweg and Nieuwegein. The sneltram began operating in 1983 and is currently operated by the private transport company Connexxion; from December 2011, it will be operated by Qbuzz. In 2018 the new extension to the Uithof will start operating creating a direct mass transit connection from the central station to the university campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/qbuzz-wins-utrecht-sneltram-concession.html|accessdate=2010-10-31|title=Railway Gazette: Qbuzz wins Utrecht sneltram concession[/tpl]
Utrecht is also the location of the headquarters of both Nederlandse Spoorwegen (English: Dutch Railways) – the largest rail operator in the Netherlands – and ProRail – the state-owned company responsible for the construction and maintenance of the country's rail infrastructure.

====Bus transport====

The main local and regional bus station of Utrecht is located adjacent to Utrecht Centraal railway station, at the East and West entrances. Due to large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station, the station's bus stops are changing frequently. As a general rule, westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance, other buses from the east side station. Local buses in Utrecht are operated by Qbuzz – its services include a high-frequency service to the Uithof university district. The local bus fleet is one of Europe's cleanest, using only buses compliant with the Euro-VI standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport. Regional buses from the city are operated by Arriva, Connexxion, Qliner and Veolia. Utrecht Centraal's bus station is the busiest in the Netherlands.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The Utrecht Centraal railway station is also served by the pan-European services of Eurolines. Furthermore, it acts as departure and arrival place of many coach companies serving holiday resorts in Spain and France – and during winter in Austria and Switzerland.http://shakespeare.let.uu.nl/sheuropol.travel.htm#bus

===Cycling===

Like most Dutch cities, Utrecht has an extensive network of cycle paths, making cycling safe and popular. 33% of journeys within the city are by bicycle, more than any other mode of transport.http://blog.zeit.de/gruenegeschaefte/files/2010/05/2008-06-11-utrecht_city_document-ditewig.pdf (Cars, for example, account for 19% of trips). Bicycles are used by young and old people, and by individuals and families. They are mostly traditional, upright, steel-framed bicycles, with few or no gears. There are also barrow bikes, for carrying shopping or small children. As thousands of bicycles are parked haphazardly in town, creating an eyesore but also impeding pedestrians, the City Council decided in 2014 to build the world's largest bicycle parking station, near the Central Railway Station. This 3-floor construction will cost an estimated 48 million Euro's and will hold 12,500 bicycles. Completion is foreseen in 2018.See: Utrecht to build world's biggest bike park - for 12,500 bikes, DutchNews.nl, Sunday 27 April 2014. Geraadpleegd op 28 April 2014.

===Road transport===

Utrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of the most important major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the Almere–Breda A27 and the Utrecht–Groningen A28[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.nl/|title=Autosnelwegen.nl|publisher=Autosnelwegen.nl|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] Due to the increasing traffic, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of air pollutants. This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city's air quality.

====Shipping====

Utrecht has an industrial port located on the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal.[tpl]cite web|first=Michael|last=Clarke|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-21914/Amsterdam-Rhine-Canal|title=Amsterdam-Rhine Canal (canal, the Netherlands) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl] The container terminal has a capacity of 80,000 containers a year. In 2003, the port facilitated the transport of four million tons of cargo; mostly sand, gravel, fertilizer and fodder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctu.net/|title=Container Terminal Utrecht|publisher=Ctu.net|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl]
Additionally, some tourist boat trips are organised from various places on the Oudegracht.[tpl]cite web|author=Martijn Elsinghorst|url=http://vareninutrecht.nl/index.php?page=lp_rondvaart_utrecht|title=Rondvaart Utrecht|publisher=Vareninutrecht.nl|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schuttevaer.com/|title=50 JAAR REDERIJ|publisher=Schuttevaer|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inutrechtuit.nl/leuk_en_doen/lovers_rondvaart.html|title=Lovers Rondvaart – In Utrecht uit – de uitagenda over uitgaan restaurants in Utrecht|publisher=Inutrechtuit.nl|accessdate=2011-04-13[/tpl]

==Economy==

The economy of Utrecht depends for a large part on the several large institutions located in the city. Production industry has a relatively small influence in Utrecht. Rabobank, a large bank, has its headquarters in Utrecht. It is the centre of the Dutch railroad network and the location of the head office of Nederlandse Spoorwegen. The former offices of Nederlandse Spoorwegen – De Inktpot (The Inkpot) – is the largest brick building in the Netherlands (the "UFO" featured on its façade stems from an art program in 2000). The building is currently used by ProRail.
A large indoor shopping centre called [tpl]ill|nl|Hoog Catharijne[/tpl] is located between Utrecht Centraal railway station and the city centre. The corridors have been considered public places like streets, and the route between the station and the city centre is open all night. Over the next 20 years (counting from 2004), parts of Hoog Catharijne will disappear as a consequence of the renovation of the station area.Utrecht.nl – Stationsgebied Parts of the city's network of canals, which were filled to create the shopping center and central station area, will be recreated.
The Jaarbeurs, one of the largest convention centres in the Netherlands, is located at the west side of the central railway station.
One of Europe's biggest used car markets is located in the Voordorp district. It is open every Tuesday except on official holidays. With thousands of second-hand vehicles on sale the market is a special point of interest for customers from Eastern European countries who even organize special one-way bus tours for shopping there.
