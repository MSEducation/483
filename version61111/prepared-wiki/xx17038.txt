The High Tatras are a popular destination for mountaineers. Many climbs begin at Morskie Oko, a lake at an elevation of 1,395 meters.

A slightly shorter but more difficult climb is Mieguszowiecki Szczyt. Other popular climbs include Giewont, Mnich, and Cubryna. Most of the High Tatras are visible from these peaks on clear days.
