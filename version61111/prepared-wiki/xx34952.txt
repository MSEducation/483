Thirlmere Lakes is a national park in New South Wales (Australia), 70Â km southwest of Sydney, and lying just to the west of Thirlmere, New South Wales. It is part of the Greater Blue Mountains Area World Heritage Site. Covering an area of 629 hectares,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkManagement.aspx?id=N0033|title=Thirlmere Lakes National Park:Park management |work=Office of Environment & Heritage website|publisher= NSW Government|accessdate=26 May 2011[/tpl] it was gazetted in 1972 as Thirlmere Lakes State Park, before being subsequently reclassified as a National Park.Wright, p. 37.
The main feature of the park are the lakes, thought to have formed around 15 million years ago by geological activity, the land lifting and largely cutting them off from the local river system. Their outflow is reduced to the small Blue Gum Creek, which flows west into the Little River in the adjacent Nattai National Park to the west.Wright, p. 36.
The lakes and their environs contain an unusual and diverse array of flora and fauna. It contains the rare freshwater sponge Radiospongilla sceptroides,[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/pomfinalthirlmere.pdf|title=Thirlmere Lakes National Park: New Plan of Management |publisher=Office of Environment & Heritage, NSW Government|date=November 1997|isbn= 0 7310 7619 |accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl] and is notable for an absence of freshwater snails. The lakes contain the rare watershield (Brasenia schreberi) and are lined with rare species such as the grey sedge (Lepironia articulata) and the wooly frogsmouth lily (Philydrum lanuginosum). The habitat provides a home for the otherwise scarce Australasian Bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), and migratory Latham's Snipe Gallinago hardwickii.
The habitat around the lakes is open sclerophyll forest, the dominant trees being rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda) nearby and sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) on elevated areas. The understory species include many familiar sydney sandstone flora such as members of the genera Banksia, Acacia, pea flowers, and the New South Wales waratah (Telopea speciosissima)
