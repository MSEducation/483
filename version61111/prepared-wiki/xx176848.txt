Barbara Turner Smith (born 1931, Pasadena, California) [tpl]cite news |title=Artist's bio |url=http://www.barbaratsmithart.com/bio.html |accessdate=2010-06-06[/tpl] is an American artist known for her performance work in the late 1960s. She studied painting, art history and religion as an undergraduate at Pomona College, being graduated in 1953. In 1965, after raising three children, she returned to study at Chouinard Art Institute, making The Black Glass Paintings, a series of primarily black surfaces under glass.[ref]
Charlotte  Lindenberg 'Barbara T. Smith Revisited'  vol.24 Jly 2009 n.paradoxa: international feminist art journal pp.85-93[/ref] She received her MFA from University of California, Irvine in 1971. During her time at UC Irvine, Smith and other artist such as Nancy Buchanan, and Chris Burden, founded F-Space, the experimental art gallery where she launched her career as a performance artist (it was also where Burden’s notorious “Shoot” (1971) was staged).
In her early work, Smith collaged photographs of herself and her three children, impressions of portions of her body, and articles of clothing into her self-published Xeroxed books. Titles like “Broken Heart,” “Bond,” “Undies” and “Do Not Touch” suggest the personal nature of her subject matter. As her marriage disintegrated in the late 1960s, autobiography and the creation of community by means of interaction with her audience became central to Smith’s art. The themes she began to explore, “the body, food, nurturing, female desire, heterosexual relationships, sexuality, religion, spiritual transformation, love, and death."
