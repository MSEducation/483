Thixendale is a tiny village and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England. It is located in the Yorkshire Wolds, about 20 miles east of York.
The population of the village and surrounding farms is 130.
For travellers looking for a quaint little place to sleep (during summer months), Thixendale is an interesting choice. It is a reasonable driving distance from York, and provides serene country landscapes and interesting hikes in the immediate vicinity, including a popular walk to the nearby Wharram Percy, a deserted medieval village. A tiny no-frills (and no-shower) YHA youth hostel used to serve frugal travellers, until it was closed in 1999. Other accommodation options are still available.
The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long distance footpath passes to the east end of the village.
The church of St Mary, Thixendale is one of a group of village buildings constructed to designs by George Edmund Street in 1868â€“70. It was designated in 1966 by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.[tpl]NHLE|num=1316014|desc=Church of Saint Mary|accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl] It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Historic Churches Group.[tpl]cite news|title=Sykes Churches Trail Southern Route|publisher=East Yorkshire Historic Churches Group|location=Beverley, East Yorkshire[/tpl]
For many years until the late 1990s, it was obscured from television transmissions by the nearby landscape until a small transmitter was built to provide villagers with terrestrial television for the first time.
