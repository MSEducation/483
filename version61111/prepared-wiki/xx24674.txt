==Education and young adulthood==

Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1942 to 1944, and Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947.
When she made her society debut in 1947, Hearst columnist Igor Cassini dubbed her "debutante of the year."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/arts/igor-cassini-hearst-columnist-dies-at-86.html|title=Igor Cassini, Hearst Columnist, Dies at 86 | author = Severo, Richard|accessdate= January 9, 2002 | work= The New York Times | date=January 9, 2002[/tpl]
Beginning in 1947, Bouvier spent her first two years of college at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and then spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France – at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris – in a study-abroad program through Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.[tpl]cite book|title=The First Ladies Fact Book – The Childhoods, Courtships, Marriages, Campaigns, Accomplishments, and Legacies of Every First Lady from Martha Washington to Michelle Obama| author = Harris, Bill; Ross, Laura|year=2009| publisher = Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers | location = New York City | isbn = 978-1-57912-809-8[/tpl] Upon returning home to the U.S., she transferred to The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; she graduated in 1951 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=36 | title = First Lady Biography: Jackie Kennedy | work = First Ladies' Biographical Information | accessdate = February 21, 2012 [/tpl] Bouvier's college graduation coincided with her sister's high school graduation, and the two spent the summer of 1951 on a trip through Europe. This trip was the subject of Jacqueline's only autobiographical book, One Special Summer, – co-authored with her sister; it is also the only one of Jacqueline's publications to feature her drawings.[tpl]cite book| author = Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy; Radziwill, Lee Bouvier |title=One Special Summer|location=New York City|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1974 | isbn = 978-0-440-06037-6 [/tpl]
Following her graduation, Bouvier was hired as "Inquiring Photographer" for The Washington Times-Herald. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures to be published in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. During this time, she was engaged to a young stockbroker, John G. W. Husted, Jr., for three months. Bouvier later took continuing education classes in American History at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

==Kennedy marriage and family==

Jacqueline Bouvier and then-U.S. Representative John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy belonged to the same social circle and often attended the same functions. They were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist Charles L. Bartlett, at a dinner party in May 1952. Kennedy was then busy running for the US Senate but after his election in November, the relationship grew more serious and led to their engagement, officially announced on June 25, 1953.[tpl]cite book|first=Donald|last=Spoto|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life|year=2000 | isbn = 978-0-312-97707-8 [/tpl]
They were married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a Mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing.[tpl]cite news|title=Jack and Jackie's Wedding| work = Life|url=http://www.life.com/image/50476398/in-gallery/22929/john-and-jackie-kennedys-wedding|accessdate=October 9, 2009[/tpl] The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm.jfklibrary.org, Special Exhibit Celebrates 50th Anniversary of the Wedding of Jacqueline Bouvier and John F.

Jack had some serious health issues then unknown to the public: he suffered from Addison's Disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain due to a war injury. During the fall and winter of 1954, he underwent two delicate spinal operations which almost proved fatal.Dallek, Robert. An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917 – 1963.

The couple sold their Hickory Hill estate to Jack's brother Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy, his wife Ethel Skakel, and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown. Jackie subsequently gave birth to a second daughter, Caroline Bouvier, in 1957, and a son, John F. Kennedy Jr., in 1960, both via Caesarean section. A second son, Patrick, was born prematurely in an emergency caesarean section on August 7, 1963, and died two days later.[tpl]cite book| author = Beschloss, Michael. |title=Historical Conversations on Life with John F.

===Campaign for Presidency===

On January 3, 1960, John announced his candidacy for the Presidency and launched his nationwide campaign.[tpl]cite book|first=Barbara|last=Harrison|first2=Daniel|last2=Terris|title=A Twilight Struggle: The Life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy|year=1992 | isbn = 978-0-688-08830-9 [/tpl] Though she had initially intended to take an active role in the campaign, Kennedy learned that she was pregnant shortly after the campaign began.[tpl]cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004[/tpl] Due to her previous difficult pregnancies, Kennedy's doctor instructed her to stay at home.[tpl]cite book|first=Carl Sferrazza|last=Anthony|title=As We Remember Her: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the Words of Her Family and Friends|year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-06-017690-7 [/tpl] From Georgetown, Kennedy participated in her husband's campaign by answering letters, taping television commercials, giving televised and printed interviews, and writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, Campaign Wife. She also made rare personal appearances.
Kennedy was fluent in Spanish and French, and during her husband's presidential campaign, she spoke in Italian and Polish in public.[tpl]cite news|title=Camelot's stylish first lady / What Jackie Kennedy wore in Washington influenced more than fashion during the '60s|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-04-03/news/17541815_1_john-f-kennedy-library-white-house-inauguration | first=Edward|last=Epstein|date=June 24, 2011[/tpl]

===As First Lady===

In the general election on November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly beat Republican Richard Milhous Nixon in the U.S. presidential election.Looking Backward: A Reintroduction to American History, by Lloyd C. Gardner, William L. O'Neill A little over two weeks later, Jackie gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy, Jr.Wead, Doug (2004). All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families. When her husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961, Kennedy became, at age 31, the third youngest First Lady in history, behind Frances Folsom Cleveland (21) and Julia Gardiner Tyler (24).The Presidents' First Ladies, by Rae Lindsay, 2001
Jackie is remembered for reorganizing entertainment for White House social events, restoring the interior of the presidential home, her taste in clothing worn during her husband's presidency, her popularity among foreign dignitaries, and leading the country in mourning after JFK's 1963 assassination.[tpl]cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-9428644|work=biography.com|accessdate=May 20, 2013[/tpl]
Like any First Lady, she was thrust into the spotlight and while she did not mind giving interviews or being photographed, she preferred to maintain as much privacy as possible for herself and her children.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first_ladies/jacquelinekennedy |title=Jacqueline Kennedy biography |accessdate= September 30, 2009 |publisher= White House[/tpl] She ranks among the most popular of First Ladies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3415/most-admired-men-women-19481998.aspx |title=Gallup Most Admired Women, 1948–1998 |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |publisher=Gallup[/tpl]

===Social success===

As First Lady, Kennedy devoted much of her time to planning social events at the White House and other state properties. She often invited artists, writers, scientists, poets, and musicians to mingle with politicians, diplomats, and statesmen. She also began to let guests at The White House drink cocktails, to give the mansion a more relaxed feeling.[tpl]cite book|author = Baldrige, Letitia|title=In the Kennedy Style – Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House|publisher= Doubleday|year=1998 | isbn = 978-0-385-48964-5 |authorlink= Letitia Baldrige[/tpl]
Perhaps due to her skill at entertaining, Kennedy proved quite popular among international dignitaries. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake President Kennedy's hand for a photo, Khrushchev said, "I'd like to shake her hand first."[tpl]cite book|author = Perry, Barbara A.|title=Jacqueline Kennedy: First Lady of the New Frontier|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2009 | isbn = 978-0-7006-1343-4 [/tpl] Kennedy was well received in Paris, France, when she visited with her husband, and when she traveled with Lee to Pakistan and India in 1962.

===White House restoration===

The restoration of the White House was Kennedy's first major project as First Lady. She was dismayed during her pre-inauguration tour of the White House to find little of historic significance in the house. The rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that she felt lacked a sense of history. Her first efforts, begun her first day in residence (with the help of society decorator Sister Parish), were to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life. Among these changes was the addition of a kitchen on the family floor and rooms for her children. Upon almost immediately exhausting the funds appropriated for this effort, Kennedy established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and asked early American furniture expert Henry du Pont to consult.[tpl]cite book|last=Cassidy|first=Tina|title=Jackie After O: One Remarkable Year When Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Defied Expectations and Rediscovered Her Dreams|year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eL_z6PD4ct0C&pg=PT65&dq=Henry+du+Pont+and+jackie+onassis#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780062098917[/tpl]
While her initial management of the project was hardly noted at the time, later accounts have determined that she managed the conflicting agendas of Parish, du Pont, and Boudin with seamless success; she initiated publication of the first White House guidebook, whose sales further funded the restoration; she initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution, rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own; and she wrote personal requests to those who owned pieces of historical interest that might be, and later were, donated to the White House.[tpl]cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428919/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=August 10, 2012[/tpl]
On February 14, 1962, Kennedy took American television viewers on a tour of the White House with Charles Collingwood of CBS News. In the tour she said, "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best." Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, she oversaw redesign and replanting of the White House Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination. Her efforts on behalf of restoration and preservation at the White House left a lasting legacy in the form of the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House which was based upon her White House Furnishings Committee, a permanent Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust.
Broadcasting of the White House restoration greatly helped the Kennedy administration. The U.S. government sought international support during the Cold War, which it achieved by affecting public opinion. The First Lady's celebrity and high profile status made viewing the tour of the White House very desirable. The tour was filmed and distributed to 106 countries since there was a great demand to see the film. In 1962 at the 14th Annual Emmy Awards (NBC, May 22), Bob Newhart emceed from the Hollywood Palladium; Johnny Carson from the New York Astor Hotel; and NBC newsman David Brinkley hosted at the Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington D.C., and took the spotlight as a special Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Trustees Award was given to Jacqueline Kennedy for her CBS-TV tour of the White House. Lady Bird Johnson accepted for the camera-shy First Lady. The Emmy statuette is on display in the Kennedy Library located in Boston, Massachusetts. Focus and admiration for Jacqueline Kennedy took negative attention away from her husband. By attracting worldwide public attention, the First Lady gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.[tpl]cite journal | doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4901_7 | author = Schwalbe, Carol B. | title=Jacqueline Kennedy and Cold War Propaganda | journal=Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media | volume=49 | issue=1 | year=2005 | pages=111–127[/tpl]

===Foreign trips===

Before the Kennedys visited France, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history. Kennedy had been aided in her learning of the French language by the prominent Puerto Rican educator María Teresa Babín Cortés.María Teresa Babín Cortés. InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico. At the conclusion of the visit, Time magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, "There was also that fellow who came with her." Even President Kennedy joked, "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris — and I have enjoyed it!"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938093,00.html|title=Nation: La Presidente|date=June 9, 1961|work= Time |accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl]
At the urging of John Kenneth Galbraith, U.S. Ambassador to India, she undertook a tour of India and Pakistan, taking her sister Lee Radziwill along with her, which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. At the time, Ambassador Galbraith noted a considerable disjunction between Kennedy's widely-noted concern with clothes and other frivolity and, on personal acquaintance, her considerable intellect.[tpl]cite book|last2=Goodman|last=Sidey|first2=Jon|first=Hugh|coauthors=Letitia Baldrige|title=The Kennedy Mystique: Creating Camelot: Essays|publisher=National Geographic Books|year=2006|authorlink=Hugh Sidey[/tpl]
While in Karachi, Pakistan, she found some time to take a ride on a camel with her sister.Camel ride pic In Lahore, Pakistan, Pakistani President Ayub Khan presented the First Lady with a much-photographed horse, Sardar (the Urdu term meaning "leader"). Subsequently this gift was widely misattributed to the king of Saudi Arabia, including in the various recollections of the Kennedy White House years by President Kennedy's friend, journalist and editor Benjamin Bradlee. While at a reception in her honor at the Shalimar Gardens, Kennedy told guests "all my life I've dreamed of coming to the Shalimar Gardens. It's even lovelier than I'd dreamed. I only wish my husband could be with me."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895946,00.html?promoid=googlep | work = Time| title=Foreign Relations: Benign Competition | date=March 30, 1962 | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl]

===Death of younger son===

In early 1963, Jackie was pregnant again and curtailed her official duties. She spent most of the summer at the Kennedys' rented home on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy family's Cape Cod compound at Hyannis Port, where she went into preterm labor on August 7, 1963. She gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarian section at Otis Air Force Base, five and a half weeks prematurely. His lungs were not fully developed, and he died at Boston Children's Hospital of hyaline membrane disease (now known as respiratory distress syndrome) two days after birth on August 9, 1963.Taraborrelli, J.

==Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy==

On November 21, 1963, the First Couple left the White House for a political trip to Texas, stopping in San Antonio, Houston, and Fort Worth that day. After a breakfast on November 22, the Kennedys flew from Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas' Love Field on Air Force One, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie.[tpl]cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Four Days in November: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |year=2007 | isbn = 978-0-393-33215-5 |pages=30, 34[/tpl] The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit. A [tpl]convert|9.5|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the President was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated next to her husband in the limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.
After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and she leaned toward her husband. Another shot struck the President in the head. Almost immediately, she reached out across the trunk of the car for something. Her Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of the President's skull that had been blown off.[tpl]cite book|author = Manchester, William |title=Death of a President|year=1967|location= New York City|publisher= Harper & Row | isbn = 978-0-88365-956-4 |authorlink= William Manchester[/tpl]jfklancer.com Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. The car rushed to Dallas' Parkland Hospital, and on arrival there, the president was rushed into a trauma room. The First Lady, for the moment, remained in a room for relatives and friends of patients just outside.
A few minutes into her husband's treatment, accompanied by the President's doctor, Dr. Malcolm Perry, she left her folding chair outside Trauma Room One and attempted to enter the operating room. Nurse Doris Nelson stopped her and attempted to bar the door to prevent her from entering. She persisted, and the President's doctor suggested she take a sedative, which she refused. "I want to be there when he dies," she told Burkley. He eventually persuaded Nelson to grant her access to Trauma Room One, saying: "It's her right, it's her prerogative."
Later, when the casket arrived, the widow removed her wedding ring and slipped it onto the President's finger. She told aide Ken O'Donnell, "Now I have nothing left."
After the president's death, she refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands. She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on board Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. She told Lady Bird Johnson, "I want them to see what they have done to Jack."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/ladybird/epicenter/epicenter_doc_diary.html | title= Selections from Lady Bird's Diary on the assassination: November 22, 1963 | work=Lady Bird Johnson: Portrait of a First Lady | publisher= PBS| accessdate= March 1, 2008[/tpl]
Kennedy took an active role in planning the details of her husband's state funeral, which was based on Abraham Lincoln's. The funeral service was held at Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, Washington D.C., and the burial at Arlington National Cemetery; the widow led the procession there on foot and lit the eternal flame at the gravesite, a flame that had been created at her request. Lady Jeanne Campbell reported back to The London Evening Standard: "Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty."[tpl]cite news|title=Magic Majesty of Mrs. Kennedy|date=November 25, 1963|author = Campbell, Lady Jeanne|newspaper=The London Evening Standard|page=1|authorlink= Jeanne Campbell[/tpl]
Following the assassination and the media coverage which had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view. She did, however, make a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.
In September 2011, audio tapes of Jackie Kennedy were released that had been recorded in 1964 after her husband's assassination. They were not supposed to be released until 50 years after her death (she died in 1994). Approximately 8.5 hours in length, the tapes contain an interview with Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., in which Jackie reveals her thoughts on a wide range of topics, including the vice-president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and civil rights leader, Martin Luther King, Jr. She also discusses how she refused to leave her husband's side during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when other officials had sent their wives away for their safety.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/2011/09/15/140508717/jackie-o-tapes-offer-window-on-an-era-and-an-icon | title= Jackie Kennedy Tapes Offer View On An Era, And Icon | publisher=NPR | date=September 15, 2011 | accessdate= October 1, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/therootdc/jacqueline-kennedy-book-historic-conversations-reveals-candid-first-lady/2011/09/14/gIQARTGFTK_story.html | title=Jacqueline Kennedy book, 'Historic Conversations,' reveals woman with strong views, political candor | publisher= The Washington Post | date=September 14, 2011 | accessdate= October 1, 2011 | first=Lori | last=Montgomery[/tpl]

===Life following the JFK assassination===

A week after her husband's assassination, Kennedy was interviewed in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, on November 29 by Theodore H. White of Life magazine. In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's mythical Camelot, commenting that the President often played the title song of Lerner and Loewe's musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted Queen Guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Life |date=December 6, 1963|volume=55|issue=23 |issn=0024-3019|title=For President Kennedy, an Epilogue| author = White, Theodore H.|authorlink= Theodore H.

Kennedy| author = Beschloss, Michael | isbn = 978-1-4013-2425-4 [/tpl]
Her steadiness and courage after her husband's assassination and funeral won her admiration around the world. Following his death, Kennedy and her children remained in their quarters in the White House for two weeks, preparing to vacate. They spent the winter of 1964 in Averell Harriman's home in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., before purchasing their own home on the same street. Later in 1964, in the hope of having more privacy for her children, Kennedy decided to buy an apartment located at 1040 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan and sold her new Georgetown house and the country home in Atoka, Virginia, where she and her husband had intended to retire. She spent a year in mourning, making few public appearances; during this time, Caroline told one of her teachers that her mother cried frequently.[tpl]cite book|title=American Legacy: The Story of John & Caroline Kennedy| author = Heymann, Clemens David | isbn = 978-0-7434-9738-1 [/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Sweet Caroline: Last Child of Camelot| author = Andersen, Christopher P. | isbn = 978-0-06-103225-7 [/tpl]
In 1965, Kennedy and Queen Elizabeth II dedicated the United Kingdom's official memorial to President Kennedy at Runnymede, England. The memorial included several acres of meadowland given in perpetuity from the UK to the U.S., near where King John had signed the Magna Carta in 1215.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3915.html|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|work=www.u-s-history.com[/tpl]
Jackie perpetuated her husband's memory by attending selected, additional memorial dedications. These included the 1967 christening of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier [tpl]USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67[/tpl] (decommissioned in 2007), in Newport News, Virginia, and a memorial in Hyannisport. They also included the dedication of a park near New Ross, Ireland. She also oversaw plans for the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Library, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Original plans were to have the library situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Harvard University, but it was instead situated in Boston, in Dorchester, next to the University of Massachusetts, Boston Campus. The finished library, designed by I.M. Pei, includes a museum and was dedicated in Boston in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter.
In November 1967, during the midst of the Vietnam War, Life magazine recognized Kennedy as "America's unofficial roving ambassador" during her visit to Cambodia, when she met with Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk. During the visit, Kennedy joined Sihanouk on a visit to Angkor Wat.Jacqueline Kennedy Visits Angkor Wat November 1967 At that point, diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cambodia had been broken since May 1965.US Department of State

==Onassis marriage==

In June 1968, when her brother-in-law Robert F.

Mrs. Onassis' financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal battle, she eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis, Onassis' daughter and sole heir, waiving all other claims to the Onassis estate.[tpl]cite book|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=Everything Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Book: A portrait of an American icon|year=2010|page=232[/tpl]

==Book editor and preservationist==

Aristotle Onassis' death in 1975 made Onassis a widow for the second time. Now that her children were older, she decided to find work that would be fulfilling to her. Since she had always enjoyed writing and literature, in 1975 she accepted a job offer as an editor at Viking Press. But, in 1978, the President of Viking Press, Thomas H. Guinzburg, authorized the purchase of the Jeffrey Archer novel Shall We Tell the President?, which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him. Although Guinzburg cleared the book purchase and publication with Onassis, upon the publication of a negative New York Times review which asserted that Onassis held some responsibility for its publication, she abruptly resigned from Viking Press the next day.[tpl]cite book|title=The Time of Their Lives| author = Silverman, Al |pages=171–172|publisher= St. Martin's Press |year=2008|location=New York | isbn = 978-0-312-35003-1 [/tpl] She then moved to Doubleday as an associate editor under an old friend, John Sargent, and lived in New York City, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts. From the mid-1970s until her death, her companion was Maurice Tempelsman, a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was long separated from his wife.Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis at Arlington National Cemetery website
Among the many books Onassis edited was Larry Gonick's The Cartoon History of the Universe.Spoto, p. 319. He expressed his gratitude in the acknowledgments in Volume 2. At Doubleday she also oversaw, with Martha Levin, the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz's Cairo Trilogy.Hutchins MSS at Indiana University's Lilly Library Manuscript Collections
Onassis also appreciated the contributions of African-American writers to the American literary canon. She encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel The Wedding (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.; West acknowledged Onassis' encouragement in the foreword.

Onassis also worked to preserve and protect America's cultural heritage. The notable results of her hard work include Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. and Grand Central Terminal, New York City's historic railroad station. While First Lady, she helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square, because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.[tpl]cite book|author = Abbott, James; Rice, Elaine |title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year=1997 | isbn = 978-0-442-02532-8 [/tpl] Later, in New York City, she led an historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate Grand Central Terminal. A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle which would have cast large shadows on Central Park;[tpl]cite book|title=The Eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis – A Portrait in Her Own Words|volume=1| author = Adler, Bill | isbn = 978-0-06-073282-0 [/tpl] the project was cancelled, but a large twin-towered skyscraper would later fill in that spot in 2003, the Time Warner Center.
She remained the subject of considerable press attention, most notoriously involving the photographer Ron Galella.

From her apartment windows in New York City she had a splendid view of a glass-enclosed wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which displays the Temple of Dendur. This was a gift from Egypt to the U.S. in gratitude for the generosity of the Kennedy administration, which had been instrumental in saving several temples and objects of Egyptian antiquity that would otherwise have been flooded after the construction of the Aswan Dam.

==Death and funeral==

In January 1994, Onassis was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. Her diagnosis was announced to the public the following month. The family and doctors were initially optimistic, and she stopped smoking at the insistence of her daughter, having previously been a three-pack-a-day smoker.medpedia.com She continued her work with Doubleday, but curtailed her schedule. The cancer proved to be aggressive, and by April had spread. She made her last trip home from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Wednesday, May 18, 1994. A large crowd of well-wishers and reporters gathered on the sidewalk outside her apartment. The following night at 10:15 p.m. Onassis died in her sleep. It was Thursday, May 19, 1994, two and a half months before her 65th birthday. Her son, John F. Kennedy, Jr., announced her death with the following: "My mother died surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved. She did it in her own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that."[tpl]cite book|first=Nicholas A.|last=Basbanes|authorlink=Nicholas A.

==Fashion icon==

During her husband's presidency, Jacqueline Kennedy became a symbol of fashion for women worldwide. She retained French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini in the fall of 1960 to create an original wardrobe for her as First Lady. From 1961 to late 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In her first year in the White House, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president (He donated the annual salary to charity). Her clean suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and famous pillbox hats were overnight successes around the world and quickly became known as the "Jackie" look.[tpl]cite web|title=Return of the Jackie Look – Sort of Fashion from A-Line Dresses to Fitted Jackets |work = Newsweek |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1994/08/28/return-of-the-jackie-look-sort-of-fashion-from-a-line-dresses-to-fitted-jackets.html[/tpl] Although Cassini was her primary designer, she also wore ensembles by French fashion legends such as Chanel, Givenchy, and Dior. More than any other First Lady her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women. Her influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a "grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair," was created by Kenneth, whom she had been seeing since 1954, and who continued to style her hair until 1986.[tpl]cite news|last=Collins|first=Amy Fine|title=It had to be Kenneth.(hairstylist Kenneth Battelle)(Interview)|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7037828_ITM|accessdate=December 3, 2012|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=June 1, 2003[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Wong|first=Aliza Z.|title=The American beauty industry encyclopedia: Hairstylists, Celebrity |year=2010|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn=9780313359491 |pages=151–154 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CljLw4sH2DMC&pg=PA151&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=Julie Willett[/tpl]
In the years after the White House, her style changed dramatically. Gone were the modest "campaign wife" clothes. Wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk Hermès head scarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses became her new look. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public.[tpl]cite news |title = Jackie Kennedy: Post-Camelot Style | work = Life |url = http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/31382/jackie-kennedy-postcamelot-style |accessdate = October 9, 2009[/tpl] Beltless, white jeans with a black turtleneck, never tucked in, but pulled down over the hips, was another fashion trend that she set.[tpl]cite web|title=Jackie Kennedy Style|publisher=Famous Women and Beauty|url=http://www.famous-women-and-beauty.com/jackie-kennedy-style.html[/tpl]
Throughout her lifetime, Kennedy acquired a large collection of exquisite and priceless jewelry. Her triple-strand pearl necklace designed by American jeweler Kenneth Jay Lane became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as First Lady in the White House. Often referred to as the "berry brooch," the two-fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler Jean Schlumberger for Tiffany & Co., was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961.[tpl]cite web|title=Treasures of the Kennedy Library|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/NR/rdonlyres/5CE1EDAD-4E84-4DE6-AE2A-E01C47655B32/22759/TreasuresExhibit.pdf[/tpl] Kennedy wore Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them "Jackie bracelets;" she also favored his white enamel and gold "banana" earrings. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by Van Cleef & Arpels throughout the 1950s,[tpl]cite web|title=The Jacqueline Kennedy Collection by Camrose & Kross|url=http://jackiesjewelry.com[/tpl] 1960s and 1970s; her sentimental favorite was the Van Cleef & Arpels wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy.[tpl]cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Jewelry|publisher=Famous Women and Beauty|url=http://www.famous-women-and-beauty.com/jacqueline-kennedy-jewelry.html[/tpl]
