==Early life==

Penélope Cruz Sánchez was born in Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain, the daughter of Encarna Sánchez, a hairdresser and personal manager, and Eduardo Cruz, a retailer and auto mechanic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Penelope-Cruz.html |title=Penelope Cruz Biography (1974–) |publisher=Film Reference |accessdate=April 18, 2010[/tpl] She was raised Roman Catholic.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/javier-bardem-and-penelope-cruz-are-engaged-2009510|title=Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem Are Engaged!|work=Us Weekly|date=October 5, 2009|accessdate=May 13, 2010 [/tpl] Throughout her childhood, Cruz lived in Alcobendas, a working-class town, although she spent "a lot" of time at her grandmother's apartment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/15/60minutes/main6101587_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title=The Rising Star of Penelope Cruz (Page 2) |publisher=CBS News |first=Charlie |last=Rose |date=January 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 25, 2010[/tpl] Cruz is the oldest of three siblings; she has a younger brother, Eduardo, who is a singer, and a younger sister, Mónica, who is an actress. She has said that she had a happy childhood, and Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes described Cruz's childhood as a "simple life". In a foreshadowing way, Cruz remembers when she was four years old, "playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them—I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else."
Initially, Cruz had no ambition to be an actress and focused on dance, having studied classical ballet for nine years at Spain's National Conservatory. She received three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theater at Cristina Rota's New York school.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_200/230_penelope_cruz_interview.html |title=10 Questions With Penelope Cruz |first=Todd |last=Gilchrist |publisher=AskMen|accessdate=March 14, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.hola.com/biografias/penelope-cruz/biografia/|title= Últimas noticias y biografía de Penélope Cruz|language= Spanish|work=Hola |accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl] She commented that "I used to take my toenails—they would die from dancing—so I would just take the whole toenail and throw it away, and not feel anything", however, ballet instilled in her discipline that would be important in her future acting career. She became a fan of movies at age 10 or 11. With no movie theaters nearby, her first relationship with cinema was watching movies on Betamax. Her father bought this "Betamax machine", of which Cruz recalls that it was very rare to own one in her neighborhood at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/penelope-cruz/|title=Penelope CRUZ|last=Cotillard|first=Marion|date=April 28, 2010|work=Interview|accessdate=April 2, 2011[/tpl]
When Cruz was a teenager, she began having an interest in acting after seeing the film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! by Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/11/penelope-cruz200911?currentPage=2 |title=The Passions of Penélope |work=Vaniety Fair  |first=Ingrid |last=Sischy |date=November 2009 |accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl] She began doing casting calls for an agent, but was rejected multiple times because the agent felt that she was too young. Cruz commented on the experience that "I was very extroverted as a kid. ... I was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/penelope_cruz/biography |title=Penélope Cruz Biography |work=People |publisher=Time Warner Inc |accessdate=March 14, 2010[/tpl] In 1999, Katrina Bayonas, Cruz's agent, commented, "She was absolutely magic the audition. It was obvious there was something very impressive about this kid. ... She was very green, but there was a presence. There was just something coming from within."

==Acting career==

===Early work, 1989–1996===

In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz made her acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song "La Fuerza del Destino". Between 1990 and 1997, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show La Quinta Marcha, a program that was hosted by teenagers, aimed at a teenage audience. She also played in the "Elle et lui" episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared totally naked.[tpl]cite web|title=Série rose Elle et lui|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0715270/|publisher=imdb|accessdate=19 September 2013[/tpl] In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, a young woman who is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became "a major sex symbol". In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Cruz commented that "it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. ... But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life." Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent". When Rose asked Cruz if she was concerned about how she would be perceived after her role in the film, Cruz replied, "I just knew I had to do the complete opposite."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/15/60minutes/main6101587_page3.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody|title=The Rising Star of Penelope Cruz (Page 3) |publisher=CBS News |first=Charlie |last=Ross |date=January 17, 2010 |accessdate=April 25, 2010[/tpl]

The same year she appeared in the Academy-Award winning Belle Epoque as the virginal Luz. People magazine noted that Cruz's role as Luz showed that she was versatile. From 1993 to 1996, Cruz appeared in ten Spanish and Italian films.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004851/ |title=Penelope Cruz |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=April 26, 2010[/tpl] At 20, she went to live in New York for two years at Christopher and Greenwich to study ballet and English between movies. She recalls learning English "kind of late" only knowing the dialogue she had learned for the casting beyond that, she could only say, "How are you?" and "Thank you."

===Early critical success, 1997–2000===

Cruz's agent is Hylda Queally, who she shares with Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/reviews/the-power-list-the-agents-513395|title=Hylda Queally|publisher=Elle|accessdate=7 January 2014[/tpl] In 1997, Cruz appeared in the Spanish comedy film Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health.

Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal commented in his September 2002 review that Cruz "has been getting some really bad reviews for her recent American work, but I personally think that she's a more than decent actress, especially here, where she's charming, moving and always believable. ... There's one shot in particular, where Cruz enters a room in a greenish glow, which is right out of Hitchcock's picture Vertigo."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montrealfilmjournal.com/review.asp?R=R0000451 |title=Abre Los Ojos |first=Kevin N. |last=Laforest |publisher=Montreal Film Journal |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=April 25, 2010[/tpl]

They are part of a Francoist movie troupe that travels from Spain during the Spanish Civil War to Nazi Germany for a joint production with UFA. Cruz's performance in the film was praised by film critics, with Jonathan Holloland of Variety magazine writing "if confirmation is still needed that Cruz is an actress first and a pretty face second, then here it is".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117913687.html |title=The Girl of Your Dreams |first=Jonathan |last=Holloland |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=November 16, 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2010[/tpl] A writer for Film4 commented that "Cruz herself is the inevitable focus of the film" but noted that overall the film "looks great".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1998/girl-of-your-dreams-the |title=Girl Of Your Dreams, The |publisher=Film4 |accessdate=April 24, 2010[/tpl] Cruz's role as Macerna has been viewed as her "largest role to date".
