==History==

Fylingdales was recorded as Figclinge in the 11th century, Figelinge and Fielinge in the 11th and 12th centuries and possibly as Saxeby in the 12th century. It was a  parochial chapelry south of Whitby and contained the villages of Robin Hood's Bay and Thorpe, or Fylingthorpe (which was recorded as Prestethorpe in the 13th century) and the hamlets of Normanby, Parkgate, Ramsdale, Raw (Fyling Rawe, 16th century) and Stoupe Brow. The church, dedicated to St Stephen replaced an ancient chapel which had Saxon origins and was demolished in about 1821 and was a dependent chapel of Whitby Abbey.[tpl]cite web |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |title=Parishes:Fylingdales|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64704|work=A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2|series=Victoria County History |publisher=British History Online |pages=534â€“537 |year=1923|accessdate=4 September 2010[/tpl]
Fyling Old Hall is in Fylingthorpe not far from the Fyling Beck and was leased by the abbey in 1539. It is built in sandstone with a slate roof and mullioned windows. Sir Hugh Cholmley sold Fyling Hall in 1634 to Sir John Hotham whose descendants held the estate including the hall and mill until the 18th century.
The moor within the parishes of Fylingdales and Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre is managed by the ancient Manor of Fyling Court Leet. Courts Leet can be traced to Norman times, and the Manor of Fyling Court Leet was mentioned and recognised in the Administration of Justices Act 1977 to continue to transact the "Management of the Commons in the Manor".[tpl]cite web |title=Fyling Court Leet|url=http://fylingcourtleet.org/|publisher=Fyling Court Leet|accessdate=17 November 2010[/tpl]

==Geography==

The area of Fylingdales is [tpl]convert|13325|acre|km2[/tpl] of land and inland water. The chief crops grown were barley and oats but most of the land was in pasture or moorland. The cliffs are Upper Lias shale capped by Dogger and False Bedded Sandstones and shales of the Lower Oolite. The height varies from [tpl]convert|75|ft|m[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] above the ordnance datum on the cliffs to [tpl]convert|775|ft|m[/tpl] on the moors. Alum was worked at Stoupe Brow and Peak. There were brick and tile-works at High Normanby and at Quarry Hill, Raw.
The moorland has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is managed by the Manor Court.

==RAF Fylingdales==

The Tri-Partite site known as RAF Fylingdales is named after the place but is not actually in the parish. Originally planned to be built on a site at Grouse Hill within Fylingdales, when the site was moved the name was not changed.[tpl]Citation needed|date= September 2011[/tpl]
