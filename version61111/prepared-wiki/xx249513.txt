==Features and uses==

Rounds users create their own (embeddable) personal slide show to inform other users about themselves.[tpl]cite web | title=6rounds wants to add video to all your web activity (invites)|author=Ha, Anthony| publisher = VentureBeat| url =http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/08/28/6rounds-wants-to-add-video-to-all-your-web-activity-invites/|accessdate= 2009-08-28 [/tpl] Users connect through messaging and video chats (referred to as rounds). They initiate rounds either by inviting a specific person or by joining a specified room based on activity, game or topic. Once users join a specified round they are systematically matched with another user interested in the same type of round.
As of 2013, Rounds requires a pre-existing Facebook friendship before users can begin video chatting one another.
While chatting, users can share in various activities, including watching videos on YouTube, co-browsing on Facebook, and playing games such as chess, backgammon, checkers, and truth or dare.

==External features==

The Rounds platform offers an open API which allows third party integrations, from small scaled modifications to white-label solutions. Rounds was one of the first Google Wave extensions to be featured and the only video chat to be launched at the Google Wave beta launch.[tpl]cite web | title=6rounds brings video conversation to Google Wave|author=Zee| publisher = TheNextWeb| url =http://thenextweb.com/2009/09/29/6rounds-brings-video-conversation-google-wave/|accessdate= 2009-09-29 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091002205202/http://thenextweb.com/2009/09/29/6rounds-brings-video-conversation-google-wave/| archivedate= 2 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
