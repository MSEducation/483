Lymington Town railway station is a railway station serving the town of Lymington in Hampshire, England. It is the only intermediate station on the Lymington Branch Line from Brockenhurst to Lymington Pier.  Celebrations were held at Lymington Town (as well as at Brockenhurst) in mid-2008, to mark the 150th anniversary of the branch line.

==History==

The Lymington Railway, running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier was established in 1856 and opened on 12 July 1858.C.F. Dendy Marshall, History of the Southern Railway: Volume 1. 2nd ed. London: Ian Allan, 1963 p.98. Three years later the company acquired a ferry to the Isle of Wight. The company was absorbed by the London and South Western Railway in 1879.

===Motive Power Depot===

The Lymington Railway built a small engine shed north of the station in 1858. This was extended in 1874, and remained open until 1966.Hawkins, Chris and Reeve, George, An historical survey of southern sheds, Oxford: OPC, 1979, p.50-1.

==Services==

The station is served by South West Trains, who operate two trains an hour in each direction.  Services were provided using restored British Rail Class 421 slam-door trains until 22 May 2010 when they were withdrawn. Services are now provided by a Class 158 or Class 450.
