Vanderbilt Reef is a rocky outcropping in Lynn Canal, a fjord in Alaska, USA at [tpl]coord|58|35|31|N|135|0|55|W|scale:100000_type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-AK|display=inline,title[/tpl].  The outcropping is visible just above the water's surface.
On October 25 1918, the Canadian Pacific steamer [tpl]SS|Princess Sophia[/tpl] ran aground on Vanderbilt Reef in the early morning during poor visibility.  The ship remained lodged in the reef for 40 hours, the end of which saw a large storm develop.  The ship broke apart at night, and all on board were lost.
