The Galgala campaign was a military campaign by Transitional Federal Government-linked Puntland, Somalia, that took place from August 8 until October 17, 2010. It was aimed at re-gaining control of the Galgala hills, which had fallen in hands of al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab commander Sheikh Mohamed Said Atom and his militia.
