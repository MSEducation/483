The Northern Illinois Commuter Transportation Initiative (NICTI) is a body formed from county and municipal governments and agencies in the north-central region of the U.S. state of Illinois, defined as those areas to the north and west of Chicago metropolitan area, principally Rockford and Belvidere.

===Commuter rail===

The NICTI has studied the possibility of creating a commuter rail link between Rockford and the western Chicago suburbs. Rockford has not had passenger rail service since 1981, when Amtrak discontinued the Chicago–Rockford–Dubuque Black Hawk. The new service would run east from Rockford through Belvidere to the West Chicago station on the Union Pacific/West Line which runs between Ogilvie Transportation Center in Chicago and Elburn. NICTI projects a daily ridership of 5,200.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.rrstar.com/belvidere/x914621510 | title=All aboard?
