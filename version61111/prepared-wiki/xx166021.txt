Fred Leach (6 March 1878â€“1908) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood in the VFL. 
Leach was a centreman in the losing Grand Final side of 1901, but played at centre half-back in the 1902 premiership team. 
He died in 1908 of Typhoid fever, just five years after retiring. However, he had previously retired twice, and Collingwood expected him to "walk back after a few weeks absence". 
Leach's brothers Arthur and Ted also played for Collingwood.
