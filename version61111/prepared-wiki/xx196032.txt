[[Xiao Zhao (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on Mercury

Xiao Zhao crater is small in comparison with many other craters on Mercury. However, Xiao Zhao's long bright rays make it a readily visible feature. The fresh, bright rays, which were created by material ejected outward during the impact event that formed the crater, indicate that Xiao Zhao is a relatively young crater on Mercury's surface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=184 |title=MESSENGER: MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging |publisher=Messenger.jhuapl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-22[/tpl]
