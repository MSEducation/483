==Retrospective reviews==

When Psychic Hearts was re-released the next decade it was praised by critic Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork Media:[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11832-sonic-youth-the-whitey-album-psychic-hearts/ |title=Thurston Moore: Sonic Youth / The Whitey Album / Psychic Hearts | Album Reviews |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2006-04-05 |accessdate=2012-03-06[/tpl]
 Released after Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star and joined by Steve Shelley on drums and Tim Foljahn on second guitar, Moore's femme-themed solo debut, Psychic Hearts, is a collection of often-beautiful sunset guitar rock. Of his vocal turns, my favorite is the caffeinated, teen-angst/dysfunction of the propulsive title track. Moore's vocals are also particularly swoon-worthy on the whispery "Pretty Bad" and breathy "Ono Soul".
 Most of Psychic Hearts, however, works because of the simple repetitions of instrumentals like lilting opener "Blues From Beyond the Grave" and the gently paranoid "(I Got a) Catholic Block" patterning that surfaces between Moore's voice in "Feathers". The centerpiece is the 20-minute instrumental exeunt, "Elegy for All the Dead Rock *s". The track's distinct movements mingle fluidly, swerving into a sideways cascade before bursting and blooming until notes sharpen and a final tidal wave arcs and releases. The noise implosions of its final third are anti-climactic, but after some gentle plucks and slides, Moore grabs his pick and glides into that dark night as gorgeously as he began, only this time with more triumphal drums.
