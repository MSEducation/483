CATEGORIES: Buildings and structures in Cardiff, Cardiff University

The Redwood Building is a building part of Cardiff University, situated in the Cathays Park area of Cardiff, Wales. 
Opened in 1960, it was named after Theophilus Redwood, a founding father of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Above the entrance a large relief sculpture shows an elderly toga-clad person, surrounded by books and a globe, reaching out protectively over a youthful scientist and a nurse. The building was part of the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST), which merged into the University of Wales College Cardiff.
