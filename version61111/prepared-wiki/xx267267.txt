==Reviews==

mxdwn.com gave Honkey Kong a generally favorable review, saying "Despite what Hughes and fellow Eagles of Death Metal member have gone through in the past, the guy still manages to push fresh, exciting, music that sounds simply…effortless. When you’re pushing 40, maybe all you need is a 4/4 beat and a couple fun, life-assuring chords.".[tpl]cite web|last=Calacsan |first=Terence |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/09/20/reviews/boots-electric-honkey-kong/ |title=Boots Electric – Honkey Kong | mxdwn.com Reviews |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl] rocksound.tv had a mostly positive review, saying, "A blend of electronic beats, keyboard-heavy dance grooves and hip-shaking pop underpinned by distorted guitar lines, this is funky and enjoyable stuff. ‘Speed Demon’ sees his rock ‘n’ roll roots in full blossom, though things take a turn for the worse when he tries his hand at electro-baladry on ‘No Fun’."
