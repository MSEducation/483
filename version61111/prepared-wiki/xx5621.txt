Kista ([tpl]IPA-sv|ˈɕiːsta[/tpl]) is a district of Stockholm Municipality in Sweden. Located northwest of central Stockholm, it is divided by the Stockholm Metro blue line into a western part which is primarily a working class and middle class residential area, and an eastern part occupied by commercial ventures, mostly in the telecommunication and information technology industry.
Kista is named after an old farm, still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s.[tpl]cite book|last1=Antonella|first1=Noya|last2=Emma|first2=Clarence|last3=Gary|first3=Craig|title=Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Community Capacity Building Creating a Better Future Together: Creating a Better Future Together|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8_TFVEFrqSsC&pg=PA119|date=7 December 2009|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-07329-6|page=119[/tpl] Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in Denmark, Iceland, Greenland and Faroe Islands.
