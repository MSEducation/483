Collecting counterfeits and forgeries is a controversial area because of the possibility that counterfeits might someday reenter the coin market as authentic coins, but US statutory and case law do not explicitly prohibit possession of counterfeit coins.

==Coin condition and value==

In coin collecting, the condition of a coin is paramount to its value; a high-quality example is often worth many times more than a poor example. Collectors have created systems to describe the overall condition of coins.
In the early days of coin collecting—before the development of a large international coin market—extremely precise grades were not needed.  Coins were described using only three adjectives: "good," "fine" or "uncirculated". By the mid 20th century, with the growing market for rare coins, the American Numismatic Association helps identify most coins in North America. It uses a 1–70 numbering scale, where 70 represents a perfect specimen and I represents a barely identifiable coin. Descriptions and numeric grades for coins (from highest to lowest) is as follows:[tpl]cite web |title=History of Grading |url=http://www.slatercoins.com/main/page_grading_history.html |year= 2008|work=www.slatercoins.com |publisher=Slater Numismatics, LLC |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Grading U.S. Coins|url=http://www.coin-gallery.com/cggradingart.htm  |author=Mitch Hight |work=www.coin-gallery.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ngccoin.com/coingrading/grading2.asp|work=NGC Grading, www.ngccoin.com|title=Grading|accessdate=17 July 2008[/tpl]
Coin experts in Europe and elsewhere often shun the numerical system, preferring to rate specimens on a purely descriptive, or adjectival, scale. Nevertheless, most grading systems use similar terminology and values and remain mutually intelligible.[tpl]cite web |title=European Collectors Stick With Verbal Grading System  |url=http://www.pcgs.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=1470&universeid=105&type=1   |date=20 September 1999 |work=Professional Coin Grading Service, www.pcgs.com|first=Alan |last= Herbert |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=German Coin Grading |url=http://www.germancoins.com/grading.html  |year=2009 |work= www.germancoins.com|first= Ron |last= Guth|accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title= Grading Standards|url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/articles/grade_standards.html  |work=www.fleur-de-coin.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]
When evaluating a coin, the following—often subjective—factors may be considered: 1) "eye appeal" or the aesthetic interest of the coin; 2) dents on the rim; 3) unsightly scratches or other blemishes on the surface of the coin; 4) luster; 5) toning; 6) level of detail retained, where a coin with full details obviously is valued higher than one with worn details. If the coin is judged favorably in all of these criteria, it will generally be awarded a higher grade.
Damage of any sort (e.g., holes, edge dents, repairs, cleaning, re-engraving or gouges) can substantially reduce the value of a coin. Specimens are occasionally cleaned or polished in an attempt to pass them off as higher grades or as uncirculated strikes. Because of the substantially lower prices for cleaned or damaged coins, some enthusiasts specialize in their collection.[tpl]cite web |title=Can Damaged Coins Find A Home? |url= http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art52620.asp  |first= Gary |last= Eggleston|work=www.bellaonline.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]

===Coin grading services===

Coin grading services are a relatively recent phenomenon, having emerged in the 1980s as a response to the need for buyers and sellers to agree on common measures of a coin's value.[tpl]cite web |title=Coin Grading Systems - The History of Coin Grading Scales |url=http://coins.about.com/od/coingrading/a/grading_systems.htm |work= |publisher=About.com |accessdate=13 December 2009[/tpl]  
Such services are an effort to bring more confidence to investors in rare coins under the guise of being "official." Grading services certify the authenticity and rate the quality of individual coins, thus—it is hoped—establishing the worth of the coin relative to all others of its kind. Many coin grading services will also seal coins in a labeled, air-tight plastic holder, ensuring the coin is protected from deterioration. This process is commonly known as coin slabbing and is most prevalent in the US market.[tpl]cite web |title=Coin Grading Services: Who They Are and What They Do |url=http://www.coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com/coin-grading-services.html|work=www.coin-collecting-guide-for-beginners.com |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009[/tpl]  The two most prominent grading services at present are the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) and the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS).
While professional grading has reduced the number of counterfeits foisted upon investors and has improved buyer confidence substantially, the goal of creating a sight-unseen market for coins remains somewhat elusive.  Professional grading services remain the subject of controversy because grading is ultimately subjective; coins may receive different grades by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. In addition, the numeric grade alone cannot represent other factors, such as toning, which are often important considerations to buyers. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some commercial coin dealers will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of a higher grade. Furthermore, grading services are not free, and by using them collectors funnel money into an ancillary aspect of the hobby, instead of purchasing additional material for their collections. Reputable coin dealers eschew the growing tendency to sell higher graded coins via sales pitches asserting that grading removes subjectivity as to the value of mint state coins. Dealers that sponsor infomercials on shortwave radio are notorious for such sales pitches, most notably Discount Gold & Silver Trading on WWCR, which proclaims graded coins, in direct contradiction to their pricing history, as having appreciated more than non-graded coins, or as not likewise being "opinion coins."
