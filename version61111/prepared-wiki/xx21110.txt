A diastase ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|ə|s|t|eɪ|z[/tpl]; from [[Greek 
language|Greek]] διαστασις, "separation") is any one of a group of 
into maltose. Alpha amylase degrades starch to a mixture of the 
disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, which contains 
three α (1-4)-linked glucose residues, and oligosaccharides known as 
dextrins that contain the α (1-6)-linked glucose 
branches. Diastase was the first 
enzyme discovered.[ref]See:
