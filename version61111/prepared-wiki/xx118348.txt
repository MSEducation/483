==Biography==

Emon is thought to be the daughter of Akazome Tokimochi, but her biological father was likely her mother's first husband,  Taira Kanemori. Emon was born before her mother's marriage to Tokimochi in the Akazome family. Her husband Ōe no Masahira was a famous literary scholar, and the couple were considered to be [tpl]nihongo|"lovebirds"|おしどり夫婦|oshidori fūfu[/tpl]. She had two children, Ōe no Takachika and Gōjijū, and at least one grandchild, Ōe no Masafusa. In 1012, after her husband drowned, she lost her interest in religion and in raising her children. 
Akazome Emon served Genrinshi and Fujiwara no Shōshi, respectively the wife and daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga, and she was present at the Imperial court at the same time as Izumi Shikibu.  She was a contemporary of Murasaki Shikibu, who praised her writing, and Sei Shōnagon. She took part in two poetry competitions in 1035 and 1041.
A collection of her poetry is published as the [tpl]nihongo|Akazome Emon Collection|赤染衛門集|Akazome Emon Shū[/tpl]. She is believed to be the chief author or compiler of the Eiga Monogatari, an epic that chronicles Fujiwara[tpl]dn|date=June 2012[/tpl] history and serves as an important follow-up to the earlier Rikkokushi.
