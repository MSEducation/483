==Career==

After receiving his PhD, Mullis left science to write fiction, but quit and became a biochemist at a medical school in Kansas City. He then managed a bakery for two years.[tpl]Citation | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DD1331F936A2575AC0A96E958260 | title = Scientist at Work/Kary Mullis; After the 'Eureka', a Nobelist Drops Out | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | journal = The New York Times | date = September 15, 1998[/tpl]. Mullis returned to science at the encouragement of friend Thomas White, who later got Mullis a job with the biotechnology company Cetus Corporation of Emeryville, California. Mullis worked as a DNA chemist at Cetus for seven years; it was there, in 1983, that Mullis invented his prize-winning improvements to the polymerase chain reaction.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=2477036 |title= The Economist |date= 2004-03-13|accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl] After leaving Cetus in 1986, Mullis served as director of molecular biology for Xytronyx, Inc. in San Diego for two years. Mullis has consulted on nucleic acid chemistry for multiple corporations.
In 1992, Mullis founded a business with the intent to sell pieces of jewelry containing the amplified DNA of deceased famous people like Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HL2GySNR8dj13v4D64WDGhlzhN8Fkspv6nJF6JwngX1NzhyfwZlK!930663388?docId=5002303854 |title= The Hastings Center Report | year = 1998 |publisher=Questia |accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl] Mullis is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors |title=Advisors |publisher=USA science festival |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl]

===PCR and other inventions===

In 1983, Mullis was working for Cetus Corp. as a chemist. That spring, according to Mullis, he was driving his vehicle late one night with his girlfriend, who was also a chemist at Cetus, when he had the idea to use a pair of primers to bracket the desired DNA sequence and to copy it using DNA polymerase; a technique which would allow rapid amplification of a small strand of DNA and become a standard procedure in molecular biology labs. Cetus took Mullis off his usual projects to concentrate on PCR full-time. Mullis succeeded in demonstrating PCR December 16, 1983. In his Nobel Prize lecture, he remarked that the success didn't make up for his girlfriend breaking up with him shortly before: "I was sagging as I walked out to my little silver Honda Civic. Neither assistant Fred, empty Beck's bottles, nor the sweet smell of the dawn of the age of PCR could replace Jenny. I was lonesome." He received a $10,000 bonus from Cetus for the invention.
Other Cetus scientists, including Randall Saiki and Henry Erlich, were placed on PCR projects to work on evaluating whether PCR could amplify a specific human gene (betaglobin) from genomic DNA. Saiki generated the needed data and Erlich authored the first paper to include utilization of the technique, while Mullis was still working on a paper that would describe PCR itself.
A complication at that point was that the DNA polymerase used was destroyed by the high heat used at the start of each replication cycle and had to be replaced. In 1986, Saiki started to use Thermophilus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase to amplify segments of DNA. The Taq polymerase was heat resistant and would only need to be added once, thus making the technique dramatically more affordable and subject to automation. This has created revolutions in biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, medicine and forensics.
Mullis has also invented a UV-sensitive plastic that changes color in response to light, and most recently has been working on an approach for mobilizing the immune system to neutralize invading pathogens and toxins, leading to the formation of his current venture, Altermune LLC, in 2011.Loxbridge and Dr Kary Mullis Announce the Formation of Altermune Technologies with $7m Seed Investment. Archived Mullis described this idea this way:
 It is a method using specific synthetic chemical linkers to divert an immune response from its nominal target to something completely different which you would right now like to be temporarily immune to. Let's say you just got exposed to a new strain of the flu. You're already immune to alpha-1,3-galactosyl-galactose bonds. All humans are. Why not divert a fraction of those antibodies to the influenza strain you just picked up? A chemical linker synthesized with an alpha-1,3-gal-gal bond on one end and a DNA aptamer devised to bind specifically to the strain of influenza you have on the other end will link anti-alpha-Gal antibodies to the influenza virus and presto!--you have fooled your immune system into attacking the new virus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/kary_mullis_next_gen_cure_for_killer_infections.html |title=Kary Mullis' next-gen cure for killer infections | Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl] 

===Accreditation of the PCR technique===

A concept similar to that of PCR had been described before Mullis' work. Nobel Prize laureate H. Gobind Khorana and Kjell Kleppe, a Norwegian scientist, authored a paper seventeen years earlier describing a process they termed "repair replication" in the Journal of Molecular Biology. Using repair replication, Kleppe duplicated and then quadrupled a small synthetic molecule with the help of two primers and DNA-polymerase. The method developed by Mullis, used repeated thermal cycling, which allowed the rapid and exponential amplification of large quantities of any desired DNA sequence from an extremely complex template. Later a heat stable DNA polymerase was incorporated into the process.
The suggestion that Mullis was solely responsible for the idea of using Taq polymerase in the PCR process has been contested by his co-workers at the time, who were embittered by his abrupt departure from Cetus. However, other scientists have written that "the full potential PCR was not realized" until Mullis' work in 1983,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dexRnDtLlWUC&pg=PA20&dq=%22kary+mullis%22+%2B+%22kjell+kleppe%22 |title=Artificial DNA: Methods and Applications by Yury E. Khudyakov, Howard A. Fields |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27|isbn=978-0-8493-1426-1|year=2003[/tpl] and that Mullis' colleagues failed to see the potential of the technique when he presented it to them.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=J5IwomfEGiEC&pg=PA103&dq=%22kary+mullis%22 |title=Life on the Edge: Amazing Creatures Thriving in Extreme Environments by Michael Gross |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-01-24|accessdate=2010-07-27|isbn=978-0-7382-0445-1[/tpl] As a result, some controversy surrounds the balance of credit that should be given to Mullis versus the team at Cetus. In practice, credit has accrued to both the inventor and the company (although not its individual workers) in the form of a Nobel Prize and a $10,000 Cetus bonus for Mullis and $300 million for Cetus when the company sold the patent to Roche Molecular Systems. After DuPont lost out to Roche on that sale, the company unsuccessfully disputed Mullis's patent on the alleged grounds that PCR had been previously described in 1971. Mullis and Erlich took Cetus' side in the case, and Khorana refused to testify for DuPont; the jury upheld Mullis's patent in 1991.
The anthropologist Paul Rabinow wrote a book on the history of the PCR method in 1996 (entitled Making PCR) in which he discussed whether or not Mullis "invented" PCR or "merely" came up with the concept of it. Rabinow, a Foucault scholar interested in issues of the production of knowledge, used the topic to argue against the idea that scientific discovery is the product of individual work, writing, "Committees and science journalists like the idea of associating a unique idea with a unique person, the lone genius. PCR is, in fact, one of the classic examples of teamwork."[tpl]cite web|author=Richard Bilsker |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/4/bilsker.htm |title=Ethnography of a Nobel Prize |publisher=Hyle.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl]

==Personal views==

Mullis has said that the never-ending quest for more grants and staying with established dogmas has hurt science. He believes that "Science is being practiced by people who are dependent on being paid for what they are going to find out," not for what they actually produce.  Mullis has been described as an "impatient and impulsive researcher" who avoids lab work and instead thinks about research topics while driving and surfing.[tpl]cite book | last =Fridell | first = R |title=Decoding life: unraveling the mysteries of the genome |publisher= Lerner Publications | location =Minneapolis |year=2005 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=_Cpa6lEhiD0C&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 88 |isbn = 0-8225-1196-7[/tpl]
In his 1998 autobiography, Mullis expressed disagreement with the scientific evidence supporting climate change and ozone depletion, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS, and asserted his belief in astrology.  Mullis claims climate change and the HIV/AIDS connection are due to a conspiracy of environmentalists, government agencies and scientists attempting to preserve their careers and earn money, rather than scientific evidence.[tpl]cite book | title = Dancing Naked in the Mind Field | last = Mullis | first = K | year = 1998 | publisher = Vintage Books | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=MCAqomvRYNMC&pg=PA115#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 115–18, 143–53 | isbn = 0-679-44255-3[/tpl]  Mullis has drawn controversy for his association with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/AIDS/9909/15/aids.heresies3/ | title=AIDS heresies: From maverick science to conspiracy theories | publisher=CNN | date=15 September 1999 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Horvath, Hacsi[/tpl] claiming that AIDS is an arbitrary diagnosis only used when HIV antibodies are found in a patient's blood.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79665692.html |title= Washington Informer | date = May 31, 2000 |publisher=High beam |date=2000-05-31 | accessdate = 2010-07-27[/tpl]  The medical and scientific consensus is that Duesberg's hypothesis is pseudoscience, HIV having been conclusively proven to be the cause of AIDS[tpl]cite web | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&page=2 | title = Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 | publisher = Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences | year = 1988 | quote = …the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/HIVcausesAIDS.htm | title = The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS | accessdate = 2009-10-14 | publisher = National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease | date = 2009-09-04 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091124091249/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/HIVcausesAIDS.htm |archivedate=November 24, 2009[/tpl] and that global warming is occurring because of human activities.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Oreskes| first = Naomi| author-link = Naomi Oreskes | title = Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change | journal = Science | volume = 306 | page = 1686 | date = December 2004| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 | quote = Such statements suggest that there might be substantive disagreement in the scientific community about the reality of anthropogenic climate change.

==Use of LSD==

Mullis details his experiences synthesizing and testing various psychedelic amphetamines and a difficult trip on DET in his autobiography. In a Q&A interview published in the September 1994, issue of California Monthly, Mullis said, "Back in the 1960s and early '70s I took plenty of LSD. A lot of people were doing that in Berkeley back then. And I found it to be a mind-opening experience. It was certainly much more important than any courses I ever took."[tpl]cite journal | last = Schoch | first = Russell | title = Q&A - A Conversation with Kerry Mullis | journal = California Monthly | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | page = 20 | publisher = California Alumni Association | location = Berkeley, CA |date = September 1994| url = http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/Alumni/Cal_Monthly/September_1994/QA_-_A_Conversation_with_Kerry_Mullis.asp | accessdate = 2008-03-11[/tpl] During a symposium held for centenarian Albert Hofmann, "Hofmann revealed that he was told by Nobel-prize-winning chemist Kary Mullis that LSD had helped him develop the polymerase chain reaction that helps amplify specific DNA sequences."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70015 |title=LSD: The Geek's Wonder Drug? |accessdate=2008-03-11 |author=Ann Harrison |date=2006-01-16 |work=Wired |publisher=Wired |quote=Like Herbert, many scientists and engineers also report heightened states of creativity while using LSD.

==Publications and Books==

Mullis's 1998 autobiography Dancing Naked in the Mind Field, gives his account of the commercial development of PCR, as well as providing insights into his opinions and experiences. In the book, Mullis chronicles his romantic relationships, use of LSD, synthesis and self-testing of novel psychoactive substances, belief in astrology and an encounter with an extraterrestrial in the form of a fluorescent raccoon.

===Awards and honors===

Mullis also received the John Scott Award in 1991, given by the City Trusts of Philadelphia to others including Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/johnscottaward(full).html |title=John Scott Award Winners | publisher= U Penn | date = 2005-10-28 |accessdate=2010-07-27[/tpl]
