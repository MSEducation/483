The Southern Review is a quarterly literary magazine that was established in 1935 by Robert Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks. It publishes fiction, poetry, critical essays, and excerpts from novels in progress by established and emerging writers and includes reproductions of visual art. The Southern Review continues to follow Warren's articulation of the mission when he said that it gives "writers decent company between the covers, and concentrates editorial authority sufficiently for the journal to have its own distinctive character and quality."
