The Moto Guzzi V8, or the Otto motorcycle was designed by Giulio Cesare Carcano specifically for the Moto Guzzi Grand Prix racing team for the 1955 to 1957 seasons. Though following the two-stroke Galbusera V8 of 1938, the Moto Guzzi Otto motorcycle and its engine represent a unique and historically significant engineering milestone.
The Discovery Channel ranked the Moto Guzzi Otto as one of the ten greatest motorbikes of all time.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/greatest_ever/motorbikes/index.shtml | work= Discovery Channel| title= Greatest Motorbikes Ever[/tpl]

==History==

By 1955, Moto Guzzi had already demonstrated its engineering prowess, creating motorcycles with a wide breadth of configurations: horizontal singles, parallel twins, V-twins in in-line and transverse layouts, 3-cylinders, and 4-cylinders in horizontal and in-line form.   The Moto Guzzi V8 reinforced Moto Guzzi's commitment to pushing engineering boundaries.  The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano, Enrico Cantoni, Umberto Todero, Ken Kavanagh and Fergus Anderson just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano.[tpl]Citation |title=Guzzi V8 (1955 - 1957) |url=http://www.motopaedia.com/Bikes/guzzi_v8_1955__1957.htm |work=Motopaedia |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110728075708/http://www.motopaedia.com/Bikes/guzzi_v8_1955__1957.htm |archivedate=July 28, 2011 [/tpl]

Very few guessed correctly, and the Otto made a stunning public debut a few months later.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
The engine and the bike were without precedent: a water-cooled, [tpl]convert|500|cc|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] V-8 motorcycle — with dual overhead cams and a separate carburetor for each of the eight cylinders. Weighing only [tpl]convert|45|kg|lbs|abbr=on[/tpl] (overall bike weight [tpl]convert|148|kg|lbs|abbr=on[/tpl]), its miniaturized components tightly packaged, the engine produced an unprecedented [tpl]Convert|78|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 12000 rpm. The motorcycle proved capable of achieving [tpl]convert|172|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on[/tpl]—20 years before the speed was reached again in Grand Prix motorcycle racing.
Tyre, brake and suspension technology, however, lagged behind the powerful engine—making race course field testing difficult and actual racing dangerous. Fergus Anderson crashed the motorcycle on its maiden run in Modena. Only Fergus Anderson, Stanley Woods, Dickie Dale, Ken Kavanagh, Keith Campbell, Giuseppe Colnago and Bill Lomas were ever able to even ride the V8 motorcycle. Several of the riders experienced spectacular falls—Bill Lomas suffering a head injury at the 1956 Senigallia Grand Prix. Ken Kavanagh refused to ride the motorcycle after the 1956 race at Spa-Francorchamps.
The Otto Cilindri also proved complex and expensive to build and maintain because bikes suffered broken crankshafts, overheating, and seizing, all in addition to the danger the bike posed to the racers themselves. By 1957 there were two bikes available and no one willing to race the bike without further development. Instead, the Otto remained undeveloped, as Moto Guzzi and other manufacturers withdrew from racing entirely in the 1957 season.DPGuzzi Guzzi V8 (Retrieved 28 October 2006) Speculation suggests that with further development, the V8 could have proved a formidable Grand Prix contender.
Two authentic examples of the engine remain in the possession of Moto Guzzi, at the Moto Guzzi Museum in Mandello. For the 2013 Guzzi World Days (Giornate Mondiali Guzzi, GMG) gathering, the racing bike was rolled out and started for the crowd to hear the sound of the unmuffled V8's exhaust.[tpl]Citation |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Moto Guzzi’s Faithful Surprise It With a Visit |date=September 16, 2013 |first= Jerry |last= Garrett |url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/16/moto-guzzis-faithful-surprise-it-with-a-visit/ [/tpl]
