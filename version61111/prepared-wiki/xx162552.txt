 [[Joseph Smith Translation|Smith's translation of the Bible]] also refers to "many worlds", and states that the vision Moses had on [[Sinai]] was limited to "only account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, [but] there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power[, a]nd there are many that now stand."
Book of Moses 1:35.
