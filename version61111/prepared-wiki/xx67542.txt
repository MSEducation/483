</ref> These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors. The price was based on price in US dollars of [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] [[West Texas Intermediate]] oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011,<ref>
[/ref] it was highly profitable assuming it could be delivered to that point. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading.
The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) further refined the numbers and estimated that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were consistently profitable from 2011 onward. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies which are in a more competitive market and have access to more capital than in Venezuela preferred to spend the extra money on SAGD or mining and recover more oil.

===Production forecasts===

Oil sands production forecasts released by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. The list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m3/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead.
A more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production will reach 800,000 m3/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth will likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods.
A key assumption is that there will be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this is not the case, there may be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, and there may be reductions in future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, could reduce US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines.
A shortage of skilled workers is developing in the Canadian oil sands as overall demand for labor increases. The oil and gas industry needs to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages will continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage may increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development.
The skilled worker shortage is much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.

==Environmental issues==

In their 2011 commissioned report entitled "Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America’s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources," the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, acknowledged health and safety concerns regarding the oil sands which include "volumes of water needed to generate issues of water sourcing; removal of overburden for surface mining can fragment wildlife habitat and increase the risk of soil erosion or surface run-off events to nearby water systems; GHG and other air emissions from production."[tpl]citation|title=Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America’s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources|publisher=National Petroleum Council|year=2011|url=http://www.npc.org/reports/NARD-ExecSummVol.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=12 April 2014|page=22[/tpl]
Oil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions.R.
