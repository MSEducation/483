==Philanthropic works==

Sir Ganesh continued as a minister of Bihar and Orissa till 31 March 1936. After the separation of Orissa and Bihar he continued to hold the position. He became minister on the 27th of March, 1923 and five years later in June, 1928, he was knighted by the King Emperor, in recognition of his ability as an administrator and his service to the country. He retired from ministership on the introduction of provincial autonomy in 1937 after having held office continuously for 14 years from 1923. During his tenure of office as minister he set apart most of his salary for charitable and educational purposes.
He gave Rs. 1 lakh to Patna University on November 30, 1931, and a further Rs. 2 lakhs on May 27, 1933. With this endowment the Patna University Sir Ganesh Dutt Singh's Trust Fund was created, funding loan scholarships for higher studies in industry, agriculture, science, medicine, engineering, etc. Dutt required that, all else being equal, preference was to be given to the untouchable castes and backward castes over the forward castes.
Patna University awarded him the degree of Doctor Honouris Causa in 1933.

==Policy criticism==

In 1928 there had been  widespread agitation in Bihar due to an ill-advised step on the part of the ruling British Government in superseding the District Board at Gaya and removing Anugraha Narain Sinha, a prominent national leader, from its chairmanship. Sri Krishna Sinha(first Chief Minister of Bihar),leader of the Congress party, disapproved of the policy of Ganesh Dutt Singh as Minister of the Local-Self Government in superseding the Gaya district board, and came down heavily on the government in the Bihar and Orissa Legislative council.
