==History==

===During the Middle Ages===

Prior to the 11th century, the Franks and the Armenians didn't have much contact together, because of the distance separating them.  However, there were earlier contacts between Armenians and Franks by way of the Roman Empire.  In 554 during the Battle of Casilinum the Armenian general Narses of the Eastern Roman Empire drove out the Franks and their allies the Alemanni from the Italian peninsula.
Towards the 11th century, the Armenians established the Principality and then Kingdom of Cilicia, which was located on the Mediterranean coast and thus accessible to the Franks and other Europeans who were participating in the Crusades. Armenia was the last Christian safe haven for the Crusaders before facing the Islamic armies of Syria and Palestine.  Unlike the Turkic arrival into the area, the Frankish arrival was interpreted positively by Armenian writers and other intellectuals.
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, continuous contact with Western Europe, most notably with the Frankish Kingdom made way for major social, cultural, and political change in Cilician Armenia. Armenians, who have their own branch of Christianity, came in contact with (and were influenced by) Catholic ideals.
The last dynasty (the Lusignans) to rule Cilician Armenia was of Frankish origin. The last king, Leo VI of Armenia, was buried in Saint Denis Basilica alongside notable French kings such as Charles Martel, Louis XIV, and many others. He was in fact the only foreigner who was buried there.

===Contact within the Ottoman Empire===

During the reign of Louis XIV, a large number of Armenian manuscripts were taken into the National Library of France. Armenia and Armenian characters are often featured in classical French literature. Authors such as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, and many others often talked about the contact of their main characters with Armenian secondary characters.
Armenian studies would start to develop in France after the creation of the Armenian department of the School of Oriental languages with the initiative of Napoleon I.

==Modern diplomatic relations==

==Armenian Genocide==

Towards the beginning of the 20th century, the pro-Armenian French would start to defend the Armenians’ rights whenever they were least respected. During 1915, the French welcomed tens of thousands of Armenians into their country which was a safe haven for them.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] France was also one of the few countries to send rescue boats for the Armenians. The population of Musa Dagh were rescued by the French who settled them in Lebanon, mainly in the town of Anjar.
In 1998, a resolution by the French National Assembly, saying “France recognizes the Armenian genocide of 1915." was passed which came with strong Turkish objection.[tpl]cite book|last=Jones|first=Adam|title=Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction|year=2010|pages=170[/tpl]
