==Critical reception==

Completely received positive reviews from critics. Resty Odon of Titik Pilipino gave the album four out of five stars, explaining "This album starts off with the regular ballads ... It then shifts to an experimentation with more upbeat tunes". He added "This album boasts of having employed international songwriters ... Christian also proves he can write a song or two ("Now That You Are Here", "Please Don’t Go") – another plus point". He praised the last number, "Nais Ko", stressing out the new side of Bautista that he called "louder, bolder, zippy". However, he disliked the upbeat numbers, saying "I think Christian’s almost one-dimensional pitch should stick to the ballads".Resty Odon, Album review, "Christian Bautista - Completely", Titik Pilipino, Retrieved 2010-09-08
