Słupsk [tpl]IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Słupsk.ogg|s|ł|u|p|s|k[/tpl] (also known by several alternative names) is a city in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, in the northern part of Poland. Before 1 January 1999, it was the capital of the separate Słupsk Voivodeship. It is also a part of the historic region of Pomerania.
The city is located in the northwestern part of present-day Poland, near the Baltic Sea on the Słupia River. It is the administrative seat of Słupsk County, although it is not part of that county (the city has county status in its own right). It has a population of 98,757[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=79|title=Słupsk.pl: Dane statystyczne|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl] and occupies [tpl]convert|43.15|km2|sqmi[/tpl],[tpl]Cite book|author=Collaborative work|title=Gminy w Polsce|publisher=Central Statistical Office|language=Polish|year=1999[/tpl] being one of the most densely populated cities in the country according to the Central Statistical Office.[tpl]Cite book|author=Collaborative work|title=Powierzchnia i ludność w przekroju terytorialnym w 2007|year=2007|publisher=Central Statistical Office|language=Polish[/tpl] The neighbouring administrative districts (gminas) are Gmina Kobylnica and Gmina Słupsk. There is ongoing discussion regarding extension of the city boundaries to include some territory belonging to those two gminas.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.wspolnota.org.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5165&Itemid=2|title=Ekspansja miast|language=Polish|accessdate=April 12|year=2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.gp24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080328/SLUPSK/108160305&SearchID=73314477932279|title=Gp24.pl: Dyskusja o powiększeniu Słupska|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl]
Słupsk had its origins as a Slavic Pomeranian settlement on the Słupia river in early Middle Ages, which later became part of Piast Poland. In 1265 it was given city rights. By the 14th century, the town had become a centre of local administration and trade and a Hanseatic League associate. Between 1368 and 1478, it was the residence of the Dukes of Pomerania. In 1648, according to the peace treaty of Osnabrück, Słupsk became part of Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1815 it was incorporated into the newly formed Prussian Province of Pomerania. The city became part of the People's Republic of Poland in 1945.[tpl]Cite book|first=Jan M.|year=1999|title=Pomorze Zachodnie poprzez wieki|publisher=The Castle of Pomeranian Dukes in Szczecin-Stettin|language=Polish|last=Piskorski[/tpl]

==Name==

Slavic names in  Pomeranian — Stolpsk,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=20|title=Słupsk.pl: Informacje ogólne|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl] Stôłpsk, Słëpsk, Słëpskò, Stôłp[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.naszekaszuby.pl/modules/artykuly/article.php?articleid=196|title=Nasze Kaszuby: Zestawienie kaszubskich i polskich nazw miejscowości na Kaszubach, z wariantami, z wyszczególnieniem powiatów|language=Polish / Kashubian|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] — and Polish — Słupsk — may be etymologically related to the words słup ("pile") and stołp ("keep"). Two hypotheses regarding the origins of those names exist: one claims that it refers to a specific way of constructing buildings on boggy ground with additional pile support, which is still in use, while the other says that it is connected with a tower or other defensive structure built on the banks of the Słupia River.
Later during German rule the town was named Stolp, to which the suffix in Pommern was attached in order to avoid confusion with other places similarly named. The Germanised name comes from one of five Slavic Pomeranian names of this settlement. The city was occasionally  called Stolpe (referring to the Słupia River, whose German name is also Stolpe. Stolpe is also the Latin exonym for this place.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/hofmann/s/books/s_4559.html|title=Lexicon Universale|language=Latin|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Geography==

===Boundaries===

Administratively, the city of Słupsk has the status of both an urban gmina and a city county (powiat). The city boundaries are generally artificial, with only short natural boundaries around the villages of Kobylnica and Włynkówko on the Słupia River. The boundaries have remained unchanged since 1949, when Ryczewo became a part of the city.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.powiatslupsk.info/ryczewo.htm|title=Powiat słupski: Ryczewo|language=Polish|accessdate=April 12, 2008[/tpl] In March 2008, Mayor Maciej Kobyliński put forward a proposal to expand the city limits by incorporating some territory from neighbouring districts.
Słupsk shares about three-quarters of its boundaries with the rural district called Gmina Słupsk, of which Słupsk is the administrative seat (although it is not part of the district). The city's other neighbouring district is Gmina Kobylnica, to the south-west. The Słupsk Special Economic Zone is not entirely contained within the city limits: a portion of it lies within Gmina Słupsk, while some smaller areas are at quite a distance from Słupsk (Debrzno), or even in another voivodeship (Koszalin, Szczecinek, Wałcz).
The city has a fairly irregular shape, with its central point at Plac Zwycięstwa ("Victory Square") at [tpl]Coord|54|27|51|N|17|01|42|E[/tpl].

===Topography and landmarks===

Słupsk lies in a pradolina of the Słupia River. The city centre is situated significantly lower than its western and easternmost portions. Divided into two almost equal parts by the river, Słupsk is hilly when compared to other cities in the region. About [tpl]convert|5|km2|sqmi[/tpl] of the city's area is covered by forests, while [tpl]convert|17|km2|sqmi[/tpl] is used for agricultural purposes.
Słupsk is rich in natural water bodies. There are more than twenty ponds, mostly former meanders of the Słupia, within the city limits. There are also several streams, irrigation canals (generally unused and abandoned) and a leat. Except in the city centre, all these watercourses are unregulated.
There is generally little human influence on landform features visible within the city limits. However, in the northwestern part of the city there is a huge hollow, a remnant of a former sand mine. Although there were once plans to build a waterpark in this area,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.gp24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070924/SLUPSK/70923013|title=Gp24.pl: Coraz bliżej aquaparku|accessdate=April 13, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl] they were later abandoned and the site remains unused.

===Climate===

Słupsk has a temperate marine climate, like the rest of the Polish coastal regions.[tpl]Cite book|title=Ilustrowana Geografia Polski|author=Kaczmarek, T., Kaczmarek, U., Sołowiej D., Wrzesiński, D.|year=2002|publisher=Świat Książki|language=Polish[/tpl] The city lies in a zone where the continental climate influences are very weak compared with other regions of Poland.[tpl]Cite book|title=Altas geograficzny dla szkół średnich|author=Collaborative work|year=2000|publisher=PPWK|language=Polish[/tpl] The warmest month is July, with an average temperature range of [tpl]convert|11|to|21|C|F[/tpl]. The coolest month is February, averaging [tpl]convert|-5|to|0|°C|F[/tpl]. The wettest month is August with average precipitation of [tpl]convert|90|mm|in[/tpl], while the driest is March, averaging only [tpl]convert|20|mm|in[/tpl]. Snowfalls are always possible between December and April.

===Neighbourhoods===

The neighbourhoods (osiedla, singular osiedle) of Słupsk do not have any administrative powers. Their names are used for traffic signposting purposes and are shown on maps. The neighbourhoods are as follows:

===Parks===

Słupsk has many green areas within its city limits. The chief of these are the Park of Culture and Leisure (Park Kultury i Wypoczynku), the Northern Wood (Lasek Północny) and the Southern Wood (Lasek Południowy). There are also smaller parks, squares and boulevards.

==History==

===Middle Ages===

Słupsk developed from a few medieval settlements located on the banks of the Słupia River, at the unique ford along the trade route connecting the territories of modern Pomeranian and West Pomeranian Voivodeships. This factor led to construction of a grad, a Slavic fortified settlement, on an islet in the middle of the river. Surrounded by swamps and mires, the fortress had perfect defence conditions. Archeological research has shown that the grad was situated on an artificial hill and had a natural moat formed by the branches of the Słupia, and was protected by a palisade. The city's official webpage notes that the area of Ziemia Słupska was part of the Polish realm during the reign of Mieszko I and in the eleventh centuryhttp://www.slupsk.pl/miasto/dokumenty/114.html Histroria Słupska do roku 1945. Official webpage of the city.
According to the city's webpage, the first historic note about Słupsk comes from 1015 when ruler of Poland Bolesław I Chrobry took over the town, incorporating it into Polish state.  In the twelfth century, the town became one of the most important castellanies in Pomorze besides Gdańsk and Świecie.http://www.slupsk.pl/miasto/dokumenty/113.html Historia. Official webpage of the city Historian Roderich Schmidt says that the first mention was in two documents dating to 1227, signed by the Pomeranian dukes Wartislaw III and Barnim I and their mothers, confirming the establishment of Marienbusch Abbey in 1224 and donating estates, among them a village "in Stolp minore" or "in parvo Ztolp", respectively, to that abbey.[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern.

The Griffin dukes lost the area to the Samborides during the following years, and the next surviving documents mentioning the area concern donations made by Samboride Swietopelk II, dating to 1236 (two documents) and 1240.[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern. Personen, Orte, Ereignisse|volume=41|series=Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Pommern|edition=2|publisher=Böhlau|location=Köln-Weimar|year=2009|isbn=3-412-20436-6|language=German|page=142[/tpl] In the earlier of the two 1236 documents, a Johann "castellanus de Slupcz" is mentioned as a witness,[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern. Personen, Orte, Ereignisse|volume=41|series=Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Pommern|edition=2|publisher=Böhlau|location=Köln-Weimar|year=2009|isbn=3-412-20436-6|language=German|pages=142, 147[/tpl] Schmidt considers this to be the earliest mention of the gard, since a castellany required the existence of a gard.[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern. Personen, Orte, Ereignisse|volume=41|series=Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Pommern|edition=2|publisher=Böhlau|location=Köln-Weimar|year=2009|isbn=3-412-20436-6|language=German|page=147[/tpl] The first surviving record explicitly mentioning the gard is from 1269: it notes a "Christianus, castellanus in castro Stolpis, et Hermannus, capellanus in civitate ante castrum predictum", thus confirming the existence of a fortress ("castrum") with a suburbium ("civitas"). Schmidt further says that the office of a capellanus required a church, which he identifies as Saint Peter's. This church is mentioned by name for the first time in a 1281 document of Samboride Mestwin II, which also mentions Saint Nicolai church and a Saint Mary's chapel in the fortress.[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern.

Modern Słupsk's website says that the town was probably given city rights in 1265.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=63|title=Słupsk.pl: Historia Słupska do roku 1945|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl] Schmidt says that city rights were granted for the first time in a document dated 9 September 1310: Brandenburgian margraves Waldemar and Johann V granted Lübeck law, which he confirmed and extended in a second document, dated 2 February 1313. The margraves had acquired the area when Mestwin II accepted them as his superiors in 1269, confirmed in 1273,[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern. Personen, Orte, Ereignisse|volume=41|series=Veröffentlichungen der Historischen Kommission für Pommern|edition=2|publisher=Böhlau|location=Köln-Weimar|year=2009|isbn=3-412-20436-6|language=German|pages=143–144[/tpl] and kept it after Mestwin II's death while leaving local rule in the hands of the Swenzones dynasty, whose members were castellans in Stolp.[tpl]cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Roderich|title=Das historische Pommern.

In 1368 Pomerania-Stolp was split off from Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1410 Bogusław VIII gave a tribute to Polish king Władysław Jagiełłohttp://www.slupsk.pl/miasto/dokumenty/114.html Historia Słupska do roku 1945 It became part of the Duchy of Pomerania in 1478.

===Modern ages===

The Reformation reached the town in 1521, when Christian Ketelhut preached in the town. Ketelhut had to leave Stolp in 1522 due to an intervention of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania. Peter Suawe, a Protestant from Stolp, however kept on preaching. In 1524, Johannes Amandus from Königsberg and others arrived and preached in a more radical way. As a consequence, the Holy Mary's Church was profaned, the monastery's church was burned, and the clergy were treated poorly.Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.211, ISBN 3-88680-272-8 The inhabitants of the town began converting to Lutheranism. In 1560 Polish pastor Paweł Buntowski preaches in the town, and in 1586 Polish religious literature spreads out.Historia Słupska do roku 1945
The local ruling house, the House of Pomerania (Griffins), died out in 1637. The territory of the Duchy of Pomerania was partitioned between Brandenburg-Prussia and Sweden. After the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the Treaty of Stettin (1653), Stolp came under Brandenburgian control. In 1660, Kashubian dialect was allowed to be taught but only in religious studies. Polish language in general however was experiencing very unfavourable conditions due to depopulation of the area in numerous wars and germanization made great advances in this time periodJęzyk polski, Tomy 19-20 Towarzystwo Miłośników Języka Polskiego, page 194, W Drukarni Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego, 1999
After the Thirty Years' War, Stolp lost much of its former importance—despite the fact that Stettin was then a part of Sweden, the province's capital was situated not in the second-largest city of the region, but in the one closest to the former ducal residence—Stargard. However, the local economy stabilized. The constant dynamic development of the Kingdom of Prussia and good economic conditions saw the city develop. After the major state border changes (modern Vorpommern and Stettin joined the Prussian state after a conflict with Sweden) Stolp was only an administrative centre of the Kreis within the Regierungsbezirk of Köslin. However, its geographical location led to rapid development, and in the 19th century it was the second city of the province in terms of both population and industrialization.
In 1769, Frederick II of Prussia established a military school in the city, according to Stanisław Salmonowicz its purpose was the germanization of local Polish nobility.Polacy i Niemcy wobec siebie Stanisław Salmonowicz, Ośrodek Badań Naukowych im. W. Kętrzyńskiego 1993, page 43
During the Napoleonic Wars, the city was taken by 1500 Polish soldiers under the leadership of general Michał Sokolnicki in 1807.
In 1815 it became one of the cities of the Province of Pomerania (1815–1945), in which it remained until 1945. In 1869 a railway from Danzig reached Stolp.
During the 19th century, the city's boundaries were significantly extended towards the west and south. The new railway station was built about 1,000 metres from the old city. In 1901, the construction of a new city hall was completed, followed by a local administration building in 1903. In 1910 a tram line was opened. The football club Viktoria Stolp was formed in 1901. In 1914, before the First World War, Stolp had 34,340 inhabitants.

===Interwar period===

Stolp was not directly affected by the fighting in the First World War. The trams did not run during the war, returning to the streets in 1919. Demographic growth remained high, although development slowed, because the city became peripheral, the Kreis being situated on post-war Germany's border with the Polish Corridor. Polish claims to Stolp and its neighbouring area were refused during the Treaty of Versailles negotiations. From 1926 the city became an active point of Nazi supporters, and NSDAP influence grew rapidly. The party received 49.1% of the city's vote in the German federal election of March 1933.Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichtevon der Reichseinigung 1871 bis zur Wiedervereinigung 1990 von Dr. Michael Rademacher M.A.
During the Kristallnacht, the night of 9/10 November 1938, the local synagogue was burned down.Słupsk po wybuchu II wojny światowej

===Second World War===

The beginning of the Second World War halted the development of the city. The Nazis created a labour camp there, which became Außenarbeitslager Stolp, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp. 
During the war, Germans brought forced labourers from occupied and conquered countries and committed numerous atrocities. People in the labour camp were maltreated physically and psychologically and forced to undertake exhausting work while being subject to starvation.http://www.slupsk.pl/miasto/dokumenty/1505.html Słupsk po wybuchu II wojny światowej. Official city webpage
Between July 1944 and February 1945, 800 prisoners were murdered by Germans in a branch of the Stutthof camp located in a railway yard in the city; today a monument honours the memory of those victims.
Other victims of German atrocities included 23 Polish children murdered between December 1944 and February 1945, and 24 people (23 men and one woman) murdered by the SS on 7 March 1945, just before the Red Army took over the city without any serious resistance on 8 March 1945. In fear of Soviet repressions, up to 1,000 inhabitants committed suicide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/spiegelspecial/d-39863564.html|title=Tief vergraben, nicht dran rühren|last=Lakotta|first=Beate|publisher=SPON|date=2005-03-05|accessdate=2010-08-16|language=German[/tpl] 
Thousands remained in the city; the others had fled and the Nazi soldiers abandoned it. However, Russian soldiers were ordered to set fire to the centre of the city. The Red Army initially set up administrative headquarters in the city hall.

===Post-war till 1989===

After the war, according to the preliminary agreements of the conferences of Yalta and Potsdam, the German territories east of the  Oder-Neisse line — most of Pomerania, Silesia and East Prussia — were transferred to Poland and from the middle of 1945 through to 1946 the surviving Germans were expelled. The town's name was now changed into "Słupsk" (the Polish version of its name) by the Commission for the Determination of Place Names on 23 April 1945. It was initially part of Okręg III, comprising the whole territory of the former Province of Pomerania east of the Oder River. Nearly the entire German population was expelled and deported soon after 1945. Their houses in Stolp were taken over by Poles from central Poland and from the former Polish eastern territories re-conquered by the Soviet Union. Also   Ukrainians and Lemkos settled into the town during Operation Vistula.
Słupsk later became part of Szczecin Voivodeship and then Koszalin Voivodeship, and in 1975 became the capital of the new province of Słupsk Voivodeship. The city was a cultural centre. The Millennium Cinema was one of the first in Poland to have a cinerama. The puppet theatre Tęcza used to collaborate with the similar institution called Arcadia in Oradea, Romania, but the partnership ceased after 1989.
During the 1970 protests there were minor strikes and demonstrations. No-one was killed during the militia's interventions.

===After 1989===

Major street name changes were made in Słupsk after the Autumn of Nations in 1989. Also a process of major renovations and refurbishments began, beginning in the principal neighbourhoods. According to the administrative reform of Poland in 1999, Słupsk Voivodeship was dissolved and divided between two larger regions: Pomeranian Voivodeship and West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Słupsk itself became part of the former. The reform was criticized by locals, who wanted to create a separate Middle Pomeranian Voivodeship.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/proc5.nsf/projekty/312_p.htm|title=Legislative proposal of July 24, 1998 regarding the introduction of the three-level administrative division of Poland|language=Polish|accessdate= April 22, 2008[/tpl] In 1998 a major riot took place after a basketball game.

==Demographics==

Before the end of World War II, the vast majority of the town's population was composed of Protestants.

==Transport==

===Railways===

Słupsk is a railway junction, with four lines running north, west, east and south from the city.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kolej.one.pl/index.php?dzial=stacje&id=91&okno=start|title=Kolej.One.Pl: Słupsk|accessdate=April 22, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl] Currently, one station, opened January 10, 1991 serves the whole city. This is a class B station according to PKP (Polish Railways) criteria.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.pkp.pl/zrodlo/plan_operacyjny/zal1.pdf|format=PDF|title=List of stations maintained by Dworce Kolejowe|accessdate=April 22, 2008|language=Polish |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060109183600/www.pkp.pl/zrodlo/plan_operacyjny/zal1.pdf |archivedate=January 9, 2006[/tpl] The city has rail connections with most major cities in Poland: Białystok, Gdańsk, Gdynia, Katowice, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Olsztyn, Poznań, Szczecin, Warsaw and Wrocław, and also serves as a junction for local trains from Kołobrzeg, Koszalin, Lębork, Miastko, Szczecinek and Ustka. Słupsk is the westernmost terminus of the Fast Urban Railway serving the Gdańsk conurbation.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.skm.pkp.pl/dali.php?aa=mapa_trasy|title=SKM network map|accessdate=April 22, 2008|language=Polish[/tpl]
The first railway reached Słupsk (then Stolp) from the east in 1869. The first rail station was built north of its current location. The line was later extended to Köslin (Koszalin), and further lines were built connecting the city with Neustettin (Szczecinek), Stolpmünde (Ustka), Zezenow (Cecenowo) (narrow gauge) and Budow (Budowo) (narrow gauge). The narrow gauge tracks were rebuilt as standard gauge by 1933, but were demolished during the Second World War. After the war, the first train connection to be restored was that with Lębork, reopened May 27, 1945. Between 1988 and 1989 almost all of the lines traversing the city were electrified.

===Roads===

Słupsk used to be traversed east-west by European route E28, which is known as National route 6 in Poland until a bypass running to the south of the town to carry the 6/E28 traffic was built. The bypass is a part of Expressway S6 which, when completed some time after 2015, will give Słupsk a fast road connection to Szczecin and Gdańsk. The city can also be accessed by the National route 21 from Miastko, Voivodeship route 210 from Ustka to Unichowo and Voivodeship route 213 from Puck. Local roads of lesser importance connect Słupsk with surrounding villages and towns.
The city's network of streets is well developed, but many of them require general refurbishment. The city is currently investing significant sums of money in road development.

===Air===

Słupsk-Redzikowo Airport is now defunct, however, it once worked as a regular passenger airport of local significance. Several plans to eventually reopen it failed because of lack of funds. The facility was earmarked for use within the US missile defense complex as a missile launch site. Policy changes by the US government regarding the missile shield have made this development unlikely however.

==Monuments==

==Culture==

Słupsk is the regular venue for a number of festivals, most notably:
For a long time here lived Anna Łajming (1904–2003), Kashubian and Polish author.

===Theatres===

Słupsk currently has three theatres:
In the 1970s the Tęcza Theatre collaborated with the Arcadia Theatre from Oradea, Romania. This partnership ended after 1989 for political reasons.

===Cinemas===

At one time Słupsk had five functioning cinemas, but only one, 'Multikino' cinema multiplex based in shopping mall Jantar, remains open today. There is also a small specialist cinema on 3 Maja street. Famous cinema 'Milenium' has been replaced by growing chain of shops Biedronka.

==Economy==

Słupsk has a developing economy based on a number of large factories. The footwear industry has been particularly successful in the region, expanding its exports to many countries.
The Scania commercial vehicles plant also plays a very significant role in Słupsk's economy, generating the highest revenue out of all companies currently based in Słupsk. Most of the buses currently manufactured there are exported to Western Europe.

==Notable citizens==

==Sports clubs==

==Energy and communications==

Słupsk has a lattice tower used for television broadcasting. Near Słupsk is the static invertor station of the SwePol high-voltage submarine cable link.

==US missile defense complex==

The European Interceptor Site (EIS) of the US was planned in nearby Redzikowo, forming a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system in conjunction with a US narrow-beam midcourse tracking and discrimination radar system in the Czech Republic. It was supposed to consist of up to 10 silo-based interceptors, a two-stage version of the existing three-stage Ground Based Interceptor (GBI), with Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV).
The missile shield has received much local opposition in the area, including several protests. This included a protest in March 2008, when an estimated 300 protesters marched on the proposed site of the missile base.Protesters March on Proposed US Missile Base The planned installation was later scrapped by President Obama on 17 September 2009.President Obama announces scrapping the planned missile defense system in Poland and the Czech republic New York Times Retrieved on 09-17-09
