[[Olympic medal table]]

CATEGORIES: Olympic medals, Olympic Games medal tables

The Olympic medal table is a method of sorting the medal placements of countries in the modern-day Olympics and Paralympics. Officially, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not recognize a ranking of participating countries at the Olympic Games.[tpl]cite news |last=Johnson|first=Ian|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121856271893833843.html?mod=psp_free_today&mg=com-wsj#printMode|title=Who's on First in Medals Race|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl]  Nevertheless, the IOC does publish medal tallies for information purposes, showing the total number of Olympic medals earned by athletes representing each country's respective National Olympic Committee.[tpl]Cite news|last=Araton|first=Harvey|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/sports/olympics/19araton.html?_r=2&ref=sports&pagewanted=print|title=A Medal Count That Adds Up To Little|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 18, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl] The convention used by the IOC is to sort by the number of gold medals the athletes from a country have earned. In the event of a tie in the number of gold medals, the number of silver medals is taken into consideration, and then the number of bronze medals.  If two countries have an equal number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, they are ordered in the table alphabetically by their IOC country code.

==Background==

The Olympic Charter, Chapter 1, section 6 states that:
[tpl]cquote|The Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries …|20|20|International Olympic Committee[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf|title=Olympic Charter|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=2011-07-08|accessdate=2012-08-04[/tpl][/tpl]
The Charter goes even further in Chapter 5, section 57, expressly prohibiting the IOC from producing an official ranking:[tpl]cquote|The IOC and the OCOG shall not draw up any global ranking per country. A roll of honour bearing the names of medal winners and those awarded diplomas in each event shall be established by the OCOG and the names of the medal winners shall be featured prominently and be on permanent display in the main stadium.|20|20|International Olympic Committee[/tpl]
According to Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper, the IOC began to accommodate medals tables in 1992, releasing 'information' based on the 'gold first' standard. The medal tables provided on its website carry this disclaimer:[tpl]cquote|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not recognise global ranking per country; the medal tables are displayed for information only. Furthermore, the results that we publish are official and are taken from the "Official Report" - a document published for each Olympic Games by the Organising Committee. However, for the first Olympic Games (until Antwerp in 1920), it is difficult to give the exact number of medals awarded to some countries, due to the fact that teams were composed of athletes from different countries. The medal tables by country are based on the number of medals won, with gold medals taking priority over silver and bronze. A team victory counts as one medal.|20|20|International Olympic Committee[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1896|title=Olympic Games Athens 1896 - Medal Table|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl][/tpl]

==Ranking systems==

As the IOC does not consider its sorting of nations to be an official ranking system, various methods of ranking nations are used. Some sort rankings decided by the total number of medals the country has but most list by the gold medals counted. However, if two or more teams have the same number of gold medals, the silver medals are then judged from the most to the least and then the bronze medals.

===Medal count ranking===

The gold first ranking system described above is used by most of the world media, as well as the IOC. While the gold first ranking system has been used occasionally by some American media outlets, newspapers in the United States primarily publish medal tables ordered by the total number of medals won.[tpl]cite news|last=Eason|first=Kevin|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/olympics/article4599875.ece?print=yes&randnum=1268512737712|title=America refuses to accept defeat in Olympic medal count|publisher=The Times (UK)|date=2008-08-25|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Flyan|first=Kevin |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/china/2008/08/19/whos-top-of-the-medals-table/|title=Who’s top of the medals table?|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Wetzel|first=Dan|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=Av5FIN9FAQzc5PVxJGoYmla7KZt4?slug=dw-medalcount082208&prov=yhoo&type=lgns&print=1|title=U.S. will be rocked by China’s heavy medals|publisher=Yahoo!

This difference in rankings has its origins in the early days of the Olympics, when the IOC did not publish or recognise medal tables. Before 2002 Winter Olympics the difference in ranking system received scant notice, since in recent Olympic history the country that led in total medals also led in the gold count. However, in 2002 Winter Olympics Germany won the highest number of medals (36) but was left behind by Norway in gold medal count - Germany winning 12 and Norway winning 13.http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamesyear.htm?g=45 A similar situation occurred at the 2008 Summer Olympics, with China and U.S. topping the gold and total medal tallies respectively,[tpl]cite news |first=Robert |last=Hardaway |title=Weighing Olympic gold |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-hardaway22-2008aug22,0,52982.story |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-08-22 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and then again at the 2010 Winter Olympics when Canada and the U.S. finished 1st and 3rd respectively in the "gold first" ranking2010 Official Medal Table or 3rd and 1st respectively in terms of total medals won.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-medals/|title=Official Website for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics|accessdate=2010-03-01[/tpl] 
Other exceptions are the 1896, 1912, and 1964 Summer Olympics when the United States finished first in gold medal count but second in the overall medal count.
In an August 24, 2008 news conference, IOC President Jacques Rogge confirmed that the IOC does not have a view on any particular ranking system.[tpl]cite web|author=Shipley, Amy|title=China's Show of Power|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/24/AR2008082400851.html?hpid=topnews|accessdate=2008-08-28[/tpl]

===Population-size, resources-per-person and multivariate prediction models and ratings===

Sporting success predictions and ratings can be univariate, i.e. based on one independent variable, such as a country's population size and the number of medals is divided by the population of the country,[tpl]cite web|title=We are second in medals table-behind Slovenia|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10528184|accessdate=2009-01-16|date=2008-08-21|publisher=New Zealand Herald|last=Donovan|first=Brooke[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Olympics 2012: the alternative medals table|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/30/olympics-2012-alternative-medal-table#pop|accessdate=2012-08-06|date=2012-08-30|publisher=The Guardian|last=Rogers|first=Simon[/tpl] or multivariate, where resources-per-person in the form of GDP per capita and other variables are included. 
Resources per person in the form of GDP per capita has been included in an article by The Guardian published during 2012 Summer Olympics.[tpl]cite web|title=Olympics 2012: the alternative medals table|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/30/olympics-2012-alternative-medal-table#pop|accessdate=2012-08-06|date=2012-08-30|publisher=The Guardian|last=Rogers|first=Simon[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=2008 Summer Olympics: GDP Adjusted Performance Ranking|url=http://www.flagandmap.com/famcore/olympics-2008-gdpadj-ranking|accessdate=2012-07-25|publisher=FlagAndMap[/tpl] Already in 2002, the research done by Meghan Busse of Northwestern University suggested that both a large population and high per capita GDP are needed to generate high medal totals,Who Wins the Olympic Games: Economic Resources and Medal Totals, Review of Economics and Statistics, December 2002. and predictive models have been built trying to predict success with multivariate analysis that included also past record and host-nation advantage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18976333 |title=Medals table: The alternative rankings for London 2012 |publisher=The BBC |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/newsevents/newsroom/dan-johnson-the-man-who-predicts-medals |title=Dan Johnson: "The Man Who Predicts Medals" |publisher=Colorado College |date=18 July 18, 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19249898 |title=Medals table: The real winners and losers |publisher=The BBC |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl]

===Weighted ranking===

Systematic rankings based upon a weighted point system with the most points awarded to a gold medal have also been devised. For example, in 1908, the British press invented a ranking system based on awarding gold medals 5 points, silver medals 3 points, and bronze medals 1 point (5:3:1).[tpl]cite news |first=Robert |last=Hardaway |title=Weighing Olympic gold |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/22/news/OE-HARDAWAY22 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2012-05-18 [/tpl] In 2004, a linear system awarding 3 points to gold, 2 points to silver and 1 point to bronze (3:2:1) was used by the Australian Geography Teachers Association.[tpl]cite news |first=Andrew |last=Bernard |title=Medal points data for Athens 2004 Olympic Games |url=http://www.geography.org.uk/download/GA_PSMMAthensPoints.pdf |publisher=Review of Economics and Statistics |year=2004 |accessdate=2010-02-15 [/tpl] This weighting values a gold medal as much weight as a silver and a bronze medal combined. In response to the 2008 controversy over medal rank, a New York Times article on the subject described a points system in which 4 points was awarded for every gold medal, 2 points for every silver medal, and 1 point for every bronze medal (4:2:1).[tpl]cite web |title=The Medal Rankings: Which Country Leads the Olympics?|author=Klein, Jeff |publisher=New York Times|date=2008-08-17 |url=http://beijing2008.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/the-medal-rankings-which-country-leads-the-olympics/|accessdate=2010-01-10[/tpl]  These systems have been popular in some places at some time, but none of them have been adopted on a large scale.
