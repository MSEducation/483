Officials from the Research Center determined that a fall from the trees was the probable cause of death. Scratches on Xiang Xiang's body suggest that he was probably being pursued by other pandas when he fell.[tpl]cite news | title = Panda that was released into wild dies | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18953949/ | publisher = MSNBC | date = 2007-05-31 | accessdate = 2007-08-04[/tpl]
