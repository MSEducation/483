A car-boat is a boat or marine vessel built from, or powered by, an automobile chassis and engine. They have recently become well known in the United States media for being the vehicle ridden by a number of Cubans who have attempted to emigrate to the United States by water. The term taxi-boat has also been used for a car-boat built from a taxi.
Another example of a car-boat is the Aquada; earlier examples of this "car-boat" have been around since the 1950s.
