Victoria Caroline Beckham (née Adams; born 17 April 1974)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/victoria_beckham/biography |title=Victoria Beckham |work=People|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|first=Ellen |last=Barbara.  |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1076151,00.html  |title=Watch this Spice |work=The Guardian |date=2 November 2003|accessdate=20 December 2007 | location=London[/tpl] is an English businesswoman, fashion designer, model and singer. In the late 1990s, Beckham rose to fame with the all-female pop group Spice Girls and was dubbed Posh Spice by the July 1996 issue of the British pop music magazine Top of the Pops.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline | title=Spice Girls Facts[/tpl] Since the Spice Girls split, she has had a solo pop music career, scoring four UK Top 10 singles. Her first single to be released, "Out of Your Mind", reached Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and is her highest chart entry to date. During her solo career, she has been signed to Virgin Records and Telstar Records.
Beckham has found more success as an internationally recognised and photographed style icon. Her career in fashion includes designing a line of jeans for Rock & Republic and later designing her own denim brand, dVb Style. Beckham has brought out her own range of sunglasses and fragrance, titled Intimately Beckham, which has been released in the UK and the US. In association with the Japanese store Samantha Thavasa and Shiatzy Chen, she has produced a range of handbags and jewellery. In addition, Beckham has released two best-selling books; one her autobiography, the other a fashion guide.
In her television ventures, Beckham has participated in five official documentaries and reality shows about her, including Being Victoria Beckham, The Real Beckhams, and Victoria Beckham: Coming to America. She has since made a cameo appearance in an episode of American TV series Ugly Betty, and been a guest judge on Project Runway, Germany's Next Topmodel, and American Idol.   She is married to David Beckham and they have four children. As of 2009, the couple's joint wealth is estimated at £125 million.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/rich_list_2009/article6068955.ece |title=Britain's rich list – David and Victoria Beckham |work=The Sunday Times | publisher=Times Newspapers | date=26 April 2009 | accessdate=10 September 2009 | location=London[/tpl]

==Music career==

===1994–2000: Spice Girls===

Beckham auditioned for a March 1993 advertisement in The Stage which required girls who were "street smart, extrovert, ambitious and able to sing and dance". In 1994, Beckham joined the all-female group, the Spice Girls. In the recordings before her marriage, she is credited with her maiden name as Victoria Adams. The group's first single was called "Wannabe" (1996), and she worked alongside Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisholm. It went to number one in the United Kingdom and United States, and another 29 countries. It was followed by nine further number one singles from their albums Spice, Spiceworld and Forever. Each member of the group received a nickname from the media. Beckham was named "Posh Spice"."Posh v Posh: Spice Girl launches bid to claim club's nickname".

The group was one of the most successful pop acts of the 1990s, selling over fifty-five million records worldwide.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6246448.stm  |title=Spice Girls announce reunion tour |work=BBC News |date=13 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007[/tpl] After the release of their third album, Forever (UK number 2), which was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording, leading Beckham to try to build a solo career.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===2000–02: Victoria Beckham===

On 14 August 2000, Beckham released her first solo single, "Out of Your Mind" in collaboration with Dane Bowers and Truesteppers. The week of release coincided with the release of "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, resulting in a chart battle dubbed 'Posh vs. Posher' by the tabloids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/music-records/read-my-lips-sophie-ellis-bextor/390329 |title=Here One She Made Earlier... |work=Dooyoo|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl]  Before the single's release, on 8 July 2000, Beckham made her public solo debut at London's Hyde Park at a concert to raise money for the Prince's Trust charity. She sang "Out of Your Mind" to a 100,000-strong audience.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/826061.stm |title=Solo debut for Posh Spice |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2000|accessdate=28 December 2007[/tpl] Beckham then signed a recording contract with her group label Virgin Records. Her next single as a solo artist, "Not Such An Innocent Girl", was released on 17 September 2001. Again, she faced competition in another hugely hyped chart battle, this time with Kylie Minogue's single "Can't Get You Out of My Head".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1548445.stm |title=Kylie and Beckham begin chart race |work=BBC News |date=17 September 2001|accessdate=19 December 2007[/tpl] Despite a huge promotional campaign, Beckham was outsold eight to one, and her single debuted at number 6. Beckham's eponymous debut album, which was released on 1 October 2001, reached Number 10 in the UK album chart.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1586093.stm |title=Double chart triumph for Kylie |work=BBC News |date=22 October 2001|accessdate=19 December 2007[/tpl] The album cost a reputed £5 million to produce and it sold a modest 50,000 copies.
The second and final single to be released from the album was "A Mind of Its Own" on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://foreverspice.com/spicediscography/victoriabeckham-amoio.htm |title=Victoria Beckham – A Mind Of Its Own |publisher=foreverspice.com|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl] Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three.

A third single, "I Wish", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on Friday Night's All Wright.Arlidge, John.

===2002–03: Open Your Eyes, Come Together and final releases===

In 2002, Beckham signed a contract with Telstar Records and 19 Management worth £1.5 million. Beckham then began recording a pop-influenced album, Open Your Eyes, which yielded the single "Let Your Head Go", but she allegedly chose not to release it after being disappointed with the results.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/115472004.htm |title=Victoria Beckham's scrapped album leaked |work=Female First|date=8 September 2006|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl]Regan, Susannah.

A Dash-produced track "It's That Simple" featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003, generating mixed reviews. Beckham's first single with Telstar, "Let Your Head Go" / "This Groove", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, following heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period with the video being directed by Andy Hylton. The single charted at Number 3 in the UK.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3367315.stm |title=Beckham misses out on number one |work=BBC News |date= 4 January 2005|accessdate=19 December 2007[/tpl] This double A-side lifted "Let Your Head Go" from Beckham's earlier pop-inspired work with "This Groove" one of her Hip-Hop/R'n'B songs and remains Beckham's last single release to date. She is currently the only Spice Girl never to have had a UK solo number one, though she is also the only Spice Girl to have all her single/album releases go Top 10.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Outside of the UK, Damon Dash had plans for Beckham in the US, including a potential release of "Let Your Head Go / This Groove" under the name of "Posh Spice Victoria Beckham". The release was proposed for sometime between March to May 2004, but never eventuated.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/mtv_news_round_up_25_05_2004 |title=MTV News Round-Up 25 May 2004 |work=MTV |date=25 May 2004|accessdate=18 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071210075028/http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/mtv_news_round_up_25_05_2004 |archivedate=10 December 2007[/tpl]
With the UK media describing her solo music career a failure, combined with a rumoured fall-out between Dash and Fuller, her hip hop album, Come Together, was not released.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/beckham.s%20rapping%20ridiculed |title=Beckham's Rapping Ridiculed |work=Contact Music|accessdate=28 December 2007[/tpl] Beckham's final attempt at a solo career came with the announcement of a new single "My Love Is for Real", in which she switched back from urban music to pop. She was dismissed from Telstar when the company became bankrupt, and gave up music to focus her fashion career.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article461539.ece |title=Posh Spice has finally done something to improve pop music |work=The Times |date=26 July 2004|accessdate=28 December 2007 | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sherwin[/tpl]

===2009–present: Viva Forever: The Musical===

In October 2009, reports suggested that the Spice Girls were to star in a reality show in which they would cast female actors to play their roles in a musical.[tpl]cite web|first=Luisa|last=Metcalfe|url= http://www.okmagazine.com/2009/10/the-truth-about-the-spice-girls-reunion/ |title= The Truth about the Spice Girls Reunion |work=OK!|date=23 October 2009|archivedate=3 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120503102327/http://www.okmagazine.com/news/truth-about-spice-girls-reunion[/tpl] The following year, Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller to start developing a Spice Girls musical titled Viva Forever. Although the girls are not to be in the show, they are to influence the show's cast and production choices in a story which uses their music but bears no relation to their personal story, similar to that of ABBA's music in Mamma Mia!.[tpl]Cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article6997164.ece |work=The Times |location= London |title= Viva Forever Mamma Mia creator creates Spice Girls musical |first= Ben |last= Hoyle |date= 22 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] On 28 August 2010, it was reported that Jennifer Saunders would pen the script for the Spice Girls' musical, Viva Forever.
