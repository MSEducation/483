Callisto, one of the many moons of Jupiter, is the most heavily cratered moon in the solar system. Many Callistoan craters have been given names, most of which are taken from the mythologies of the peoples of the Arctic Circle, although some are from Greek myths relating to the nymph Callisto. Here is a list of all craters on Callisto that have been given names.
