Canada Carries On (French: En avant Canada) was a series of short films by the National Film Board of Canada, which ran from 1940 to 1959.  The series was initially created as morale boosting propaganda films during World War II. With the end of the war, the series lost its financial backing from the Wartime Information Board, but continued under as an NFB series of theatrical shorts that included newsreels as well as animated shorts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=615&navid=66|title=Canada Carries On|last=Morris|first=Peter|work=Canadian Film Encyclopedia|publisher=Film Reference Library|accessdate=2009-10-17[/tpl]
The series was initially produced by Stuart Legg, who also directed many of the early films in Canada Carries On. The first film in the series was Legg's Atlantic Patrol, released in April 1940, about the Canadian Navy's role in protecting convoys from Halifax to the United Kingdom from U-boat attack.[tpl]cite book|last=Ellis|first=Jack C.|coauthors=Betsy A.

The success of Canada Carries On inspired a second NFB series The World in Action, which was more tailored to international audiences.[tpl]cite book|last=Ellis|first=Jack C.|coauthors=Betsy A.

==Canadian distribution==

The series was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market. Each film was shown in approximately 800 theatres across Canada, over a six-month period. Films were distributed by Columbia Pictures, and the NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast to coast had access to the films. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, church basements and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two. Films were also made available to film libraries operated by university and provincial authorities. A total of 199 films were produced before the series was canceled in 1959.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2009/07/13/propaganda-cinema/|title=Propaganda cinema at the NFB|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|date=July 13, 2009|work=NFB.ca|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl]

===En avant Canada===

The French-language series En avant Canada was distributed in Quebec and New Brunswick by France Film Distribution in some 60 theatres. 8 to 12 issues were produced each year in French; some versions of English titles, others original, for a total of 173 French titles before the program's cancellation in 1959.

==International distribution==

Some films were distributed internationally in Australia, the UK and USA (by Telenews), in India (by Fox Film Corporation) and the West Indies (by Inter-continental). These were usually titles that dealt with international rather than Canadian issues. One such film was Warclouds in the Pacific, released just one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor, warning of an imminent Japanese attack.
