West Ham United Football Club is an English professional  football club based in Upton Park, East London, England currently playing in the Premier League, England's top tier of football. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks FC and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. In 1904 the club relocated to their current Boleyn Ground stadium. They initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before eventually joining the full Football League in 1919 and subsequently enjoyed promotion to the top flight for the 1923 season. 1923 also saw the club feature in the first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley against Bolton Wanderers.
In 1940 the team won the inaugural Football League War Cup. The club have won the FA Cup three times: in 1964, 1975 and 1980 as well as being runners-up twice, in 1923 and 2006. In 1965, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, and in 1999 they won the Intertoto Cup.

==History==

===Origins===

The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as the Thames Ironworks team by foreman and local league referee Dave Taylor and owner Arnold Hills[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WHhistory1.htm|title=The History of West Ham United 1895–1896|publisher=Spartacus Schoolnet|accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl] and was announced in the Thames Ironworks Gazette of June 1895.
The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees including Thomas Freeman (ships fireman), Walter Parks (clerk), Tom Mundy, Walter Tranter and James Lindsay (all boilermakers), William Chapman, George Sage, and William Chamberlain and apprentice riveter Charlie Dove.
The club, Thames Ironworks[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A965054| title=West Ham United origins | date=15 March 2003|publisher=BBC | author=DogManStar | accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl] were the first ever winners of the West Ham Charity Cup in 1895 contested by clubs in the locality, then won the London League in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the Southern League Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt.'[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/THAMEIRO.HTM | title= Source for Thames Ironworks statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl] The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals Fulham in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.
The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University "Blue", but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn through 1897 to 1899. In 1899 they acquired their now-traditional home kit combination of claret shirts and sky blue sleeves in a wager involving Aston Villa players, who were League Champions at the time.[tpl]cite web|title=West ham Historical kits|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/West_Ham_United/West_Ham_United.htm|publisher=Historicalkits|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded, then almost immediately relaunched on 5 July 1900 as West Ham United F.C. with Syd King as their manager and future manager Charlie Paynter as his assistant. Because of the original "works team" roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as 'the Irons' or 'the Hammers' amongst fans and the media.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/thames%20ironworks.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013213258/http://eastlondonhistory.com/thames+ironworks.htm | archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=East London History regarding Thames Ironworks | publisher=EastLondonHistory.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All%20abstracts.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050117001255/http://www.lmu.ac.uk/ces/lss/lsa/All+abstracts.pdf | archivedate=17 January 2005 | title=Pg24, citing study into West Hams community ties | publisher=Leeds Metropolitan University|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Birth of West Ham United===

West Ham Utd had joined the Western League for the 1901 season'[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fchd.info/W-HAMU.HTM | title=Source for West Ham statistics | publisher=Football Club History Database | author=Richard Rundle | accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl] in addition to continuing playing in the Southern Division 1. In 1907 West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1–0 to become the Western League Overall Champions. The reborn club continued to play their games at the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a pitch in the Upton Park area in the guise of the Boleyn Ground stadium in 1904. West Ham's first game in their new home was against fierce rivals Millwall (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 3–0 winners,[tpl]Cite book|last = Northcutt| first =John | coauthors = Roy Shoesmith| title =West Ham United: A Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books | year =1993 | location =Derby | page =198 | url = | id = | isbn =1-873626-44-4 [/tpl] and as the Daily Mirror wrote on 2 September 1904:
In 1919, still under King's leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the Football League Second Division, the first game being a 1–1 draw with Lincoln City, and were promoted to Division One in 1923, also making the first ever FA Cup Final to be held at the old Wembley stadium. Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers. This was also known as the White Horse Final. This is because so many people turned up to the game, (estimated at 200,000), that they spilled out on to the pitch. The pitch had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by Billie, a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC George Scorey. The Cup Final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton Wanderers. The team enjoyed mixed success in Division 1 but retained their status for 10 years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=1282&united=18_Mar_1933 | title=Game played on 18 March 1933 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl]
In 1932 the club was relegated to Division Two[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&ham=1932&united=1st_Division_1931-32 | title=1st Division 1931–32 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl] and long term custodian Syd King was sacked after serving the club in the role of Manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P38foEpwni4C&pg=PT12&lpg=PT12&dq=syd+king+sacked+west+ham&source=bl&ots=LGv0kjR4gN&sig=kI1XOrcXhLrETkpLzcVbrZoh_BI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xU1PUsqLKsSfiQf2-oHQDA&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=syd%20king%20sacked%20west%20ham&f=false | title=The Manager: The absurd ascent of the most important man in football | publisher=Hachette Digital | accessdate=5 October 2013 | author=Ronay, Barney[/tpl]  He was replaced with his assistant manager Charlie Paynter who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next 30 years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player Ted Fenton. Fenton succeeded in getting the club once again promoted to the top level of English football in 1958, and, with the considerable input of player Malcolm Allison, helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham's approach to the game.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101015/malcolm-allison-1927-2010_2236884_2185790 | title=Malcolm Allison 1927–2010 | publisher=www.whufc.com | date=15 October 2010 | accessdate=5 October 2013 | author=Helliar, John[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Ted Fenton biography|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/WHfentonT.htm|publisher=Spartacus|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=A brief history of West ham United|url=http://espnfc.com/feature/_/id/841093?cc=4716|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Tributes pour in for Bond|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120926/tributes-pour-in-for-bond_2236884_2930511|publisher=West Ham United|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

===The glory years===

There is a "Champions" statue in Barking Road, opposite The Boleyn Tavern, commemorating West Ham's three sons who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Also included on the statue is Everton's Ray Wilson.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newham.com/work/attractions/champions_sculpture/33,10,0,0.html | title=Champions Sculpture | publisher=www.newham.com | accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

After a difficult start to the 1974–75 season Greenwood moved himself "upstairs" to become General Manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant John Lyall as team manager.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4922314.stm | title=Former West Ham boss Lyall dies | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=4 October 2013 | date=19 April 2006[/tpl] The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games combined and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 2–0 in the 1975 final.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20120517/hammerabilia-wembley-special_2236884_2774289 | title=Hammeralelia Wembley special | publisher=www.whufc.com | accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl] Lyall then guided West Ham to another European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4–2 to Anderlecht.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071018/anderlecht-deny-european-repeat_2236895_1328709 | title=Anderlecht deny European repeat | publisher=www.whufc.com | accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl] Greenwood's tenure as General Manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of Don Revie's resignation in 1977.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.thefa.com/england/All-Teams/Staff/RonGreenwood | title=Ron Greenwood | publisher=www.thefa.com | accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

===Ups and downs===

In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to Division Two, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to an FA Cup Final win against Arsenal in 1980. This is notable as no team outside the top division has won the trophy since. West Ham were promoted to Division One in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the first division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86. However, they suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall's sacking.[tpl]cite news|author=Julie Welch |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/apr/20/guardianobituaries.mainsection1 |title=Obituary John Lyall |publisher=Guardian |date= 20 April 2006|accessdate=29 April 2010 | location=London[/tpl] He was awarded an ex gratia payment of £100,000 but left the club in what Lyall described as 'upsetting' circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme, Lyall left West Ham after 34 years service.[tpl]cite book | title=Nearly Reached the Sky | publisher=Football World | author=Blowers, Steve | year=2005 | page=18 | isbn=0-9548336-8-6[/tpl]
After Lyall, Lou Macari briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of Swindon Town.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/Person.asp?PersonID=MACARILO | title=Lou Macari | publisher=www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk | accessdate=2013-05-30[/tpl]
He was replaced by former player Billy Bonds.[tpl]cite book | title=The Essential History of West Ham United | publisher=Headline Book publishing | author=Blows, Kirk | year=2000 | page=193 | isbn=0-7472-7036-8[/tpl] In Bonds' first full season (1990–91), West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme there was crowd unrest.[tpl]cite news|last=Pierson|first=Mark|title=Football: West Ham fear FA censure over pitch invasion|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-west-ham-fear-fa-censure-over-pitch-invasion-1285373.html|publisher=Independent|accessdate=30 May 2013|location=London|date=27 January 1997[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=May|first=John|title=Who IS Terence Brown?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/2539355.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=3 December 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite book| title= The Essential History of West Ham United | pages = 197, 198 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Kirkby|first=Darren|title=Peter Storrie|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/6630/29/|publisher=www.wsc.co.uk|accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl]  Bond's West Ham finished 2nd and again gained promotion, this time to the Premier League.

With the team in the Premier League there was a need to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was recruited for a fee of £1.2m. Shortly after arriving at the club he complained that he should not have made the move as it was too far from his Oxford home. Bonds found this attitude hard to understand compared with his own committed, never-say-die style. This was the first evidence of his losing appetite for the modern game and modern player.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heraldseries.co.uk/sport/oxfordunited/unitednews/8220434.I_was_sold_to_save_United_says_Beauchamp/ |title=I was sold to save United says Beauchamp |publisher=Heraldseries.co.uk |date=22 June 1994 |accessdate=16 June 2010[/tpl] 58 days later Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000, which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 in the deal.Coventry ask Babb bidders to raise offers Liverpool made to wait
Assistant manager Harry Redknapp was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club, AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.football-england.com/billy_bonds.html | title=Billy Bonds | publisher=www.football-england.com | accessdate=18 August 2013[/tpl] the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club, on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club.[tpl]cite book | title=Bring Me the Head of Trevor Brooking | publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company | author=Blow, Kirk | year=2010 | location=Edinburgh | page=136 | isbn=978-1-84596-661-4[/tpl] His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager".[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jIZpr9jkPPoC&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=redknapp+bonds+storrie&source=bl&ots=vO7zjfYC-Q&sig=aDZ-HogTzt3aLRg6m8MJs1H94dQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AbcRUt3lFsitiQeWzIGYDw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=redknapp%20bonds%20storrie&f=false | title=Harry's Games The Biography of H | accessdate=19 August 2013 | author=Crace, John[/tpl]

Redknapp's time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16m even after the £18m sale of Rio Ferdinand.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/redknapp-blamed-for-west-ham-loss-6353787.html | title=Redknapp blamed for West Ham loss | publisher=London Evening Standard | date=8 November 2001 | accessdate=14 August 2013 | author=Dyer, Ken[/tpl] Some were notably successful such as  the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/news/131949.stm | title=Sport: Football: News | publisher=BBC Sport | accessdate=18 August 2013 | date=13 July 1998[/tpl] Some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham such as Florin Raducioiu, Davor Suker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand yet made only eight appearances, Christian Bassila who cost £720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football, Titi Camara, Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to £4.4m but made only three starts for the club, Rigobert Song, Paolo Futre and Marco Boogers,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1321837.stm | title=Harry Leaves his legacy | publisher=BBC Sport | date=9 May 2001 | accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport16 | title=The 10 worst foreign signings of all time | publisher=The Guardian | date=6 August 2000 | accessdate=18 August 2013 | author=Hills, Dave[/tpl] His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=4&ham=1995&united=Premier_League_1994-95 | title=Premier League 1994–95 | publisher=www.westhamstats.info | accessdate=19 August 2013[/tpl] His third season saw another relegation battle.

In 1999, West Ham finished fifth. This was their highest position in the top flight since 1986. They also won the Intertoto Cup beating FC Metz to qualify for the UEFA Cup.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20130824/on-this-day-24-august_2236884_3435367 | title=On this day – 24 August | publisher=www.whufc.com | accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl] Things started to falter for Redknapp with the sale for £18m to Leeds United of Rio Ferdinand in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as Ragnvald Soma who cost £800,000 and played only seven league games, Camera and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1321273.stm | title=Cash row key to Redknapp exit | publisher=BBC Sport | date=12 May 2001 | accessdate=15 August 2013[/tpl] Chairman Brown lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds. In June 2001 called to a meeting with Brown expecting to discuss contracts, he was fired. His assistant Frank Lampard left too, making the sale of his son Frank jnr inevitable.

===Recent seasons===

On their return to the top division, West Ham finished in 9th place, The highlight of the 2005–06 season, however, was reaching the FA Cup final, and taking favourites Liverpool to a penalty shootout, after a three-all draw. West Ham lost the shootout but still gained entry to the UEFA Cup as Liverpool had already qualified for the Champions League.
In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window, after completing the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium, led by Eggert Magnússon in November 2006."West Ham accept £85m takeover bid", BBC News, 21 November 2006. Retrieved 11 June 2007.

The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined 5.5 million pounds in April 2007.Daily Mail article on fine. However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the 2006–07 season.

==Crest==

The original club crest was a crossed pair of rivet hammers; tools commonly used in the iron and shipbuilding industry. A castle was later (circa 1903–04) added to the crest and represents a prominent local building, Green Street House, which was known as "Boleyn Castle" through an association with Anne Boleyn. The manor was reportedly one of the sites at which Henry VIII courted his second queen, though in truth there is no factual evidence other than the tradition of rumour.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=42741 | title=East Ham: Manors and estates | publisher=University of London & History of Parliament Trust | author=Various | accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl]
The castle may have also been added as a result of the contribution made to the club by players of Old Castle Swifts, or even the adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC as their reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site.
The crest was redesigned and updated by London design agency Springett Associates in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform "windows" along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty's Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/the-clubs/west-ham|publisher=premierskills|accessdate=3 October 2013[/tpl]
When the club redesigned the facade of the stadium (construction finished 2001–02) the 'castle' from the later badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers are now prominent features of the ground's appearance, both bearing the club's modern insignia (which is also located in the foyer and other strategic locations).[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham|url=http://www.footballbadgesguide.com/West%20Ham.html|publisher=Footballbadgesguide|accessdate=3 October 2013[/tpl]

==Colours==

The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being a former student of Oxford University. However the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif | title=West Ham kits since inception I | publisher=Various sources, image of kits | author=kitclassics.co.uk | accessdate=15 August 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625144306/http://www.kitclassics.co.uk/kits/westham.gif| archivedate = 25 June 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/West_Ham_United/West_Ham_United.htm | title=West Ham kits since inception II| publisher=Various sources, images of kits | author=Dave Moor | accessdate=15 August 2009[/tpl]
The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in the summer of 1899. Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win.[tpl]cite web|title=History of West Ham United colours|url=http://hammersnews.blogspot.in/2009/09/history-of-west-ham-united-colours.html|publisher=Hammernews|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]
Bill Dove defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team's kit offered a complete team's 'football kits' to Dove in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was 'missing'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.football-kits-online.co.uk/english-premier-league/west-ham-united/9.aspx |title=West Ham United Kits at Football Kits Online – Replica Shirts & Soccer Gear |publisher=Football-kits-online.co.uk |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl] This however, is often disputed. The predecessors of Thames Ironworks, Old Castle Swifts FC, played in pale blue shirts, white shorts and claret socks as early as 1892, around the same time Aston Villa played in said same colours.
Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, retained the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits.

==Supporters, hooliganism and rivalries==

===Supporters===

The team's supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team's anthem, "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A Pears soap commercial featuring the curly haired child in the Millais' "Bubbles" was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. "Bubbles" Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" whenever any player was having a good game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983| title=The Story of Bubbles | publisher=West Ham United F.C | author=John Helliar[/tpl]
Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett. Through this contrivance of association the clubs fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.whufc.com/claret/?page_id=3595 | title=The Story of Bubbles | publisher=West Ham United F.C | author=John Helliar[/tpl]
There is a slight change to the lyrics sung by the Upton Park faithful. The second line's "nearly reach the sky" is changed to "they reach the sky", "Then like my dreams" is also changed to "And like my dreams". In addition the fans begin a chant of "United, United!" to cap it off.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20071017/the-story-of-bubbles_2240257_1193983|publisher=West Ham United |title=The story of Bubbles|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]

Like other teams the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as "The Bells are Ringing", along with more pun laden or humorous efforts such as chanting former player Paolo di Canio's name to the canzone "La donna è mobile" by Verdi,[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=46kADtKInKAC&pg=PA109&dq=i'm+forever+blowing+bubbles+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JvxSUui9HuHoiAeZkYDgAg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=i'm%20forever%20blowing%20bubbles%20history&f=false | title=Football Delirium | publisher=Karnac Books | year=2007 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Oakley, Chris[/tpl] or D.I.

Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham in his first away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/156542.stm |title=Beckham runs gauntlet at West Ham |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=29 August 1998 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl]  Coinciding with the game there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game, however.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/07/14/beckham_safety/|title=Beckham still subject of fans' ire | publisher=CNN – Sports Illustrated | date=19 September 1998[/tpl]

===Hooliganism===

The origins of West Ham's links with organised football-related violence starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The Mile End Mob (named after an area of the East End of London).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.casspennant.com/book-aggro.shtml | title=Want Some Aggro? | publisher=www.casspennant.com | accessdate=5 October 2013[/tpl]
During the 1970s and 1980s (the main era for organised football-related violence) West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham Fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.[tpl]cite web|title=CONFESSIONS OF A TERRACE LEGEND The fights, the politics, the rival firms: Cass Pennant, notorious founder member of West Ham's InterCity Firm, recalls hooliganism's heyday.|url=http://www.casspennant.com/news.php?8|publisher=CassPennant|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]
The Inter City Firm were one of the first "casuals", so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular InterCity trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed "football special" charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm's moniker "inter city" suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.
The 2005 independent film Green Street starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam focuses on a firm of West Ham United hooligans.[tpl]cite web|title=Green Street summary|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385002/plotsummary|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=7 October 2013[/tpl]

The oldest and fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The two sides are local rivals, having both formed originally around the works sides Thames Ironworks and Millwall Ironworks shipbuilding companies. They were rivals for the same contracts and the players lived in the same locality. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s the rivalry was intensified during strike action started by the East End (perceived to be West Ham fans) which Isle Of Dogs-based companies (i.e. Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years.

The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of football hooliganism. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the 2009–10 League Cup and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. Clashes between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions which brought a temporary halt to the game.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8221451.stm |title=Violence erupts at London derby |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=25 August 2009 | date=25 August 2009[/tpl]

==Nicknames==

The team and supporters are known as "The Hammers", in part because of the club's origins as Thames Ironworks (see club crest) and also erroneously, due to the club's name.[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham United|url=http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/west-ham-united/|publisher=The beautifulhistory.wordpress.com|accessdate=19 July 2011[/tpl] They are also known as "The Irons" and as "The Cockney Boys" as they are a Cockney club.[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham United chants|url=http://www.footballchants.org/viewChants.php?divs=D0&teams=24&let=-1&teamname=West%20Ham%20United|publisher=footballchants.org|accessdate=19 July 2 011[/tpl] Other nicknames are "The Academy of Football", or just "The Academy".[tpl]cite news|title=The academy of football – The MirrorFootball best homegrown West Ham XI|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-banter/Rio-Ferdinand-Frank-Lampard-s-Bobby-Moore-and-Trevor-Brooking-The-MirrorFootball-best-homegrown-West-Ham-XI-article409203.html|accessdate=19 July 2011|newspaper=Daily Mirror[/tpl]

==Stadium==

West Ham is currently based at the Boleyn Ground, commonly known as Upton Park, in Newham, east London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground is 35,016.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/page/StadiumInformation/0,,12562,00.html |title=Stadium information | West Ham United | Tickets | Stadium Information |publisher=West Ham United F.C |accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl] This has been West Ham's ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of Thames Ironworks, they played at Hermit Road in Canning Town and briefly at Browning Road in East Ham, before moving to the Memorial Grounds in Plaistow in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904.
Former chairman Eggert Magnússon made clear his ambition for West Ham United to move to the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Olympics, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the Government as it was in the borough of Newham.
However in February 2010, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field. On 17 May 2010 West Ham and Newham London Borough Council submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympic Games. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look like you had a track between you and the pitch".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100517/olympic-stadium-proposal-submitted_2236884_2053629 |title=Olympic Stadium proposal submitted |publisher=West Ham United F.C |accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/8670638.stm |title=UK Athletics boss Ed Warner boosts West Ham's 2012 plan |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=18 May 2010[/tpl]
On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at 10 Downing Street,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20100930/hammers-at-no10_2236884_2170275 |title=Official Olympic Stadium bid. |publisher=West Ham United F.C |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2010[/tpl] and on 8 October 2010 the world's largest live entertainment company Live Nation endorsed the club's Olympic Stadium plans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101008/live-nation-back-hammers-bid_2236884_2178677 |title=Live Nation back hammers bid. |publisher=West Ham United F.C |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=9 October 2010[/tpl] Three days after Live Nation's endorsement UK Athletics confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/20101011/uk-athletics-back-the-hammers_2236884_2180792 |title=UK Athletics back the Hammers |publisher=West Ham United F.C |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010[/tpl] In November 2010 West Ham United commenced a search for potential developers for "informal discussions" about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by the summer of 2014. On 11 February 2011 the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham United as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.[tpl]cite web|title=West Ham working with Populous on designs for Olympic Stadium after London 2012|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/summer-olympics/2012/11979-west-ham-working-with-populous-on-designs-for-olympic-stadium-after-london-2012|publisher=Inside the games|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=West Ham must guarantee to keep running track warns Olympics Minister|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/summer-olympics/2012/11939-west-ham-must-guarantee-to-keep-running-track-warns-olympics-minister|publisher=Inside the games|accessdate=4 October 2013[/tpl]

On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Westfield Shopping Centre had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2011/06/06/westfield-to-sponsor-west-ham-olympic-stadium |title=Westfield to sponsor West Ham Olympic stadium |publisher=construction enquirer |date= 8 June 2011[/tpl] In August 2011 an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.

By March 2012 West Ham was one of the four bidders for the Stadium.

It was announced on 22 March 2013, that the team signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £25m towards the costs of converting the site. It is seen as a massive step forward for the club.

==The Academy of Football==

The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being "The Academy of Football", with the moniker adorning the ground's new stadium façade. The comment predominantly refers to the club's youth development system which was established by manager Ted Fenton during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1192517.stm |title=BBC SPORT | WEST HAM UTD | Hammer house of legends |publisher=BBC News  |date=27 February 2001 |accessdate=6 August 2011[/tpl]  Most notably the club contributed three players to the World Cup winning England side of 1966 including club icon Bobby Moore, as well as Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst who between them scored all of England's goals in the eventual 4–2 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included Trevor Brooking, Alvin Martin, Tony Cottee and Paul Ince.
Since the late 1990s Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Glen Johnson began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for one of the "Big Four" clubs. Most recently the likes of first team midfield regulars Mark Noble and Jack Collison and younger stars Freddie Sears, Junior Stanislas, James Tomkins, Josh Payne, Jordan Spence and Zavon Hines have emerged through the Academy. Frustratingly, for the fans and managers alike,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071219110614/http://www.squarefootball.net/article/article.asp?aid=1080 |archivedate=19 December 2007 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2011[/tpl] the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060529201217/http://www.kumb.com/0506_story.php?id=10182 |archivedate=29 May 2006 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=29 May 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2011[/tpl]  West Ham, during the 2007–08 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7417746.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=England player numbers at new low | date=27 May 2008 | accessdate=6 April 2010[/tpl] which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having 'homegrown players'.

The majority shareholder under the limited company with 1100 of the 4000 shares issued was Arnold Hills and on his death his descendents . Two unsuccessful attempts by the board were made to buy the shares in 1927 on Hills' death and in 1948 from his family. From 1924 until 1961, 1142 shares remained unsold giving the statutory five man board with only 403 shares between them the ability to consolidated their position dictating who would be sold shares and elected to the board as there was no interference from Hills or his descendents. In 1961 the board members each bought 200 of the unsold shares and 142 were sold to newly elected director R G Brandon at face value.West Ham United by Charles Korr pages 20,21,22 ISBN 0-7156-2126-2 Jack Petchey was a director at from June 1978 until 1989.Hammers Handbook 1989–90 page 27 whos who at Upton Park Terry Brown joined the board in November 1990 and chairman from May 1992.Hammers Handbook 1992–93 page60
