==Plot==

Tarzan is called to Brazil by an old friend, The Professor (Paulo Gracindo) to help stop the Jaguar Cult, led by Barcuma (Rafer Johnson), from running off Dr. Ann Philips (Diana Millay) who is there to give much-needed inoculations to native villagers along the Amazon River.
Tarzan is assisted by Baron (a lion) and Cheeta (a chimpanzee), both of whom he brought from Africa, as well as Captain Sam Bishop (Jan Murray), a riverboat pilot, and Bishop's young ward, Pepe (Manuel Padilla Jr.).

==Production notes==

The movie was filmed entirely on location in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro (Zoo, Parque Lage, Floresta da Tijuca).
Dinky, the chimp portraying Cheeta, bit Mike Henry on the jaw during filming, requiring twenty stitches.  The chimpanzee was destroyed, and Henry later sued the producers for this accident and other unsafe working conditions on all three of his Tarzan films.  The parties settled out of court.
