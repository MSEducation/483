Patricia "Pan" Godchaux is a moderate Republican who ran for the United States Congress for the 9th federal congressional district in the state of Michigan.  She challenged seven-term incumbent Joe Knollenberg in the Republican primary and hoped to get Democratic support in the primary, as the Democrats' challenger, Nancy Skinner, didn't have to face a primary contest. She notes that the district leans Republican, and that unless citizens of the district want to re-elect a conservative Republican, their best chance to avoid doing so was by placing a moderate one on the ballot in November.  Ultimately Gochaux failed in her attempt to unseat the seven-term incumbent, garnering 30% of the vote to Knollenberg's 70%, or 20,211 to 46,713 votes.News From The Associated Press
