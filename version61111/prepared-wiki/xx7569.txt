[[Metallocene]]

CATEGORIES: Metallocenes

A metallocene is a compound typically consisting of two cyclopentadienyl anions (Cp, which is C5H5-) bound to a metal center (M) in the oxidation state II, with the resulting general formula (C5H5)2M. Closely related to the metallocenes are the metallocene derivatives, e.g. titanocene dichloride, vanadocene dichloride. Certain metallocenes and their derivatives exhibit catalytic properties, although metallocenes are rarely used industrially. Cationic group 4 metallocene derivatives related to Cp2ZrCH3+ catalyze olefin polymerization. Metallocenes are a subset of a broader class of organometallic compounds called sandwich compounds.
In the structure shown at right, the two pentagons are the cyclopentadienyl anions with circles inside them indicating they are aromatically stabilized. Here they are shown in a staggered conformation.

==History==

The first metallocene to be classified was ferrocene, and was discovered simultaneously in 1951 by Keally and Pauson, and Miller et al.[tpl]cite journal|author1 = Miller, S. A.|author2 = Tebboth, J. A.|author3 = Tremaine, J. F.|journal = J. Chem. Soc.|year = 1952|pages = 632–635|title= 114. Dicyclopentadienyliron|doi = 10.1039/JR9520000632[/tpl] Keally and Pauson were attempting to synthesize fulvalene through the oxidation of a cyclopentadienyl Grignard reagent with anhydrous FeCl3 when they discovered C10H10Fe as their product.[tpl]cite journal |author1 = Kealy, T. J.|author2 = Pauson, P. L. |title = A New Type of Organo-Iron Compound |journal = Nature |year = 1951 |volume = 168 |pages = 1039 |doi = 10.1038/1681039b0 |issue=4285|bibcode = 1951Natur.168.1039K [/tpl] At the same time, Miller et al reported the same iron product from a reaction of cyclopentadiene with iron in the presence of aluminum, potassium, or molybdenum oxides. The structure was determined independently by Wilkinson and Fischer[tpl]cite journal|author1 = Fischer, E. O.|authorlink1 = Ernst Otto Fischer|author2 = Pfab, W.|title = Zur Kristallstruktur der Di-Cyclopentadienyl-Verbindungen des zweiwertigen Eisens, Kobalts und Nickels|journal = Z. Naturforsch. B|year = 1952|volume = 7|pages = 377–379|doi =[/tpl] and they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973 for their work on sandwich compounds, including the structural determination of ferrocene.[tpl]cite journal|author1 = Wilkinson, G.|author2 = Rosenblum, M.|author3 = Whiting, M. C.|author4 = Woodward, R. B.|authorlink1 = Geoffrey Wilkinson|authorlink4 = Robert Burns Woodward|title = The Structure of Iron Bis-Cyclopentadienyl|journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year = 1952|volume = 74|pages = 2125–2126|doi = 10.1021/ja01128a527|issue = 8[/tpl] They determined that the carbon atoms of the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand contributed equally to the bonding and that bonding occurred due to the metal d-orbitals and the π-electrons in the p-orbitals of the Cp ligands. This complex is now known as ferrocene and the group of transition metal dicyclopentadienyl compounds is known as metallocenes and have the general formula (η5-C5H5)2M. Fischer et al. first prepared the ferrocene derivatives involving Co and Ni.

==Definition==

The general name metallocene is derived from ferrocene, (C5H5)2Fe or Cp2Fe, systematically named bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)iron(II). According to the IUPAC definition, a metallocene contains a transition metal and two cyclopentadienyl ligands coordinated in a sandwich structure, i. e., the two cyclopentadienyl anions are co-planar with equal bond lengths and strengths. Using the nomenclature of "hapticity", the equivalent bonding of all 5 carbon atoms of a cyclopentadienyl ring is denoted as η5, pronounced "pentahapto." There are exceptions, such as uranocene, which has two cyclooctatetraene rings sandwiching a uranium atom.
In metallocene names, the prefix before the -ocene ending indicates what metallic element is between the Cp groups. For example in ferrocene, iron(II), ferrous iron is present. 
In contrast to the more strict definition proposed by IUPAC, which requires a d-block metal and a sandwich structure, the term metallocene and thus the denotation -ocene, is applied in the chemical literature also to non-transition metal compounds, such as Cp2Ba, or structures where the aromatic rings are not co-planar, such as found in manganocene or titanocene dichloride (Cp2TiCl2).
Some metallocene complexes of actinides have been reported where there are three cyclopendadienyl ligands for a monometallic complex, all three of them bound η5.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Inorg.

==Classification==

There are many (η-C5H5)-metal complexes and they can be classified by the following formulas:
Metallocene complexes can also be classified by type:

==Synthesis of metallocenes==

There are three main routes that are normally employed in the formation of these types of compounds:[tpl]cite book|author=Long, N. J.|title=Metallocenes: Introduction to Sandwich Complexes|year=1998|isbn=978-0632041626|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=London[/tpl]

A structural trend for the series MCp2 involves the variation of the M-C bonds, which elongate as the valence electron count deviates from 18.[tpl]cite journal|first1 = K.

In metallocenes of the type (C5R5)2M, the cyclopentadienyl rings rotate with very low barriers. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal both eclipsed or staggered rotamers. For non-substituted metallocenes the energy difference between the staggered and eclipsed conformations is only a few kJ/mol. Crystals of ferrocene and osmocene exhibit eclipsed conformations at low temperatures, whereas in the related bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes the rings usually crystallize in a staggered conformation, apparently to minimize steric hindrance between the methyl groups.

==Derivatives==

Derivatives of metallocenes:
After the discovery of ferrocene, the synthesis and characterization of derivatives of metallocene and other sandwich compounds attracted researchers’ interests.
1. Metallocenophanes
2. Polynuclear and heterobimetallic metallocenes
3. Multi-decker sandwich compounds
4. Metallocenium cations 

==Applications==

Many derivatives of early metal metallocenes are active catalysts for olefin polymerization.  Unlike traditional and still dominant heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, metallocene catalysts are homogeneous.  Early metal metallocene derivatives, e.g. Tebbe's reagent, Petasis reagent, and Schwartz's reagent are useful in specialized organic synthetic operations.
