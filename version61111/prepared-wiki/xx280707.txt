In the mid-2000s, each member of the collective had established himself as part of Michigan’s independent music scene. Knoxville and J-Fab gained national recognition following the success of Jim Jones’ Summer Wit’ Miami - produced by Knoxville.[tpl]cite web|title=Jim Jones (2) - Harlem: Diary Of A Summer|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jim-Jones-Harlem-Diary-Of-A-Summer/release/535446|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] J-Fab was selected to produce on former Shady Records artist Stat Quo's debut album, Statlanta.[tpl]cite web|title=Statlanta - Stat Quo|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/statlanta-mw0002002544/credits|work=AllMusic|publisher=All Media Netword, LLC.|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl]
The goal of The Olympicks’ partnership was to create a “one-stop shop” that could cater to the production needs of any artist or project based on the different qualities of each member. Knoxville is considered to be the team’s “crate-digger,” and produces a sound which tends to incorporate soul samples and breakbeats. J-Fab’s production technique also makes heavy utilization of record samples, but uses more pop and techno influences to create various sounds across multiple genres. Finally, Flawless crafts universal R&B/Pop beats that are prevalent in today’s mainstream music.
The Olympicks have worked with both established mainstream artists as well as local and underground artists. The group was involved in Big Sean's early career, as they produced the single, "Bullshittin".[tpl]cite web|title=Producer's Corner: The Olympicks|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1649/title.producers-corner-the-olympicks|work=Hip Hop DX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] They also have a relationship with Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group[tpl]cite web|title=Producer's Corner: The Olympicks|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/interviews/id.1649/title.producers-corner-the-olympicks|work=Hip Hop DX|publisher=Cheri Media Group|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] and recently signed a song production deal with Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records.[tpl]cite web|title=Young Money/Cash Money Signs Production Crew The Olympicks|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/08/27/young-moneycash-money-signs-production-crew-the-olympicks/|work=All Hip Hop|publisher=Infinity|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] They also produced "Out Of This World"[tpl]cite web|title=ASAP Rocky - LiveLoveA$AP|url=http://www.discogs.com/ASAP-Rocky-LiveLoveAAP/release/3237123|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] for A$AP Rocky's mixtape, LiveLoveA$AP.
