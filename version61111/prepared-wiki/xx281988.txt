Champion Lodge was a large house at Camberwell in London.

==History==

The lodge was built at the foot of Denmark Hill by Claude de Crespigny in 1717.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45281|title='Camberwell', Old and New London: Volume 6 (1878), pp. 269-286|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] The Prince of Wales visited the lodge in 1804 and Claude Champion de Crespigny, the then owner of the house, was made a baronet in 1805. The lodge, which was originally surrounded by a 30 acre park, was demolished in 1841. The family then moved to Maldon in Essex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southlondonguide.co.uk/camberwell/deCrespignyfamily.htm|title=Champion de Crespigny family|publisher=South London Guide|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]
