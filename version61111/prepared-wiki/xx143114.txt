Electric Tonic is a live album by Medeski Martin & Wood consisting of totally improvised material recorded at Tonic. The concert was recorded as one piece on July 4, 1998 during the first summer that Tonic was open.  It is only available through the band's online store or at their live shows. Electric Tonic makes use of electric keyboards and basses, and is a counterpart to the group's album Tonic, which was recorded at the same venue but featured acoustic performances.  Electric Tonic was the second live recording released by MMW from Tonic, with the first record, Tonic, having been recorded 2 years after Electric Tonic in 2000 but released before.  As mentioned, the first record is Medeski Martin & Wood acoustic with John Medeski on piano.
The concert was recorded by Federico Cribiore, archivist for Medeski Martin & Wood with 2 Earthworks microphones, Sonosax pre-amps, Apogee A/D converters live to a two track DAT @ 48kz.
