[[Hepburn romanization]]

CATEGORIES: Romanization of Japanese

The [tpl]Nihongo|Hepburn romanization system|ヘボン式ローマ字|Hebon-shiki Rōmaji[/tpl] is named after James Curtis Hepburn, who used it to transcribe the sounds of the Japanese language into the Latin alphabet in the third edition of his Japanese–English dictionary, published in 1887. The system was originally proposed by the [tpl]Nihongo|Romanization Club|羅馬字会|Rōmajikai[/tpl] in 1885. The revised edition by Romaji-Hirome-kai in 1908 is called [tpl]Nihongo|"standard style romanization"|標準式ローマ字|Hyōjun-shiki Rōmaji[/tpl] and this system has been used as the Hepburn system in Japan traditionally.[tpl]cite book|title=Daijirin|publisher=Sanseido|title=ヘボン式ローマ字綴り|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch/0/0ss/117680900000/|language=Japanese|accessdate=May 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]deadlink|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The original and revised variants of Hepburn remain the most widely used methods of transcription of Japanese. As Hepburn is based on English and Italian phonology,Carr, Denzel. The New Official Romanization of Japanese. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar., 1939), pp. 99-102.[tpl]cite book|title=日本語百科大事典|trans_title=Japanese encyclopedia|author=Haruhiko Kindaichi, Takeshi Shibata, Naoki Hayashi|year=1988|publisher=Taishukan Shoten[/tpl] an English speaker unfamiliar with Japanese will generally pronounce a word romanized in Hepburn more accurately than a word romanized in the competing Kunrei-shiki.

==Legal status==

Hepburn is based on English phonology and has competed with the alternative Nihon-shiki romanization, which was developed in Japan as a replacement of Japanese script. In 1930, a Special Romanization Study Commission was appointed to compare the two. The Commission eventually decided in favor of a slightly modified version of Nihon-shiki, which was proclaimed to be Japan's official romanization for all purpose by a September 21, 1937 cabinet ordinance and is now known as Kunrei-shiki. The ordinance was temporarily overturned by the Supreme Commander Allied Powers (SCAP) during the Occupation of Japan, but was reissued (with slight revisions) in 1954.
In 1972, a revised version of Hepburn was codified as ANSI standard Z39.11-1972. It was proposed in 1989 as a draft for ISO 3602, but rejected in favor of Kunrei-shiki. The Z39.11-1972 standard was consequently deprecated on October 6, 1994.
As of 1978, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and many other official organizations used Hepburn instead of Kunrei-shiki. In addition The Japan Times, the Japan Travel Bureau, and many other private organizations used Hepburn instead of Kunrei-shiki. The National Diet Library used Kunrei-shiki.Kent, et al. "Oriental Literature and Bibliography." p. 155.
Although Hepburn is not a government standard, some government agencies mandate it. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires the use of Hepburn on passports, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport requires the use of Hepburn on transport signs, including road signs and railway station signs.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=inconsistent with the last part of "Variants of Hepburn romanization" section|date=April 2011[/tpl]
In many other areas where it lacks de jure status, Hepburn remains the de facto standard. Signs and notices in city offices and police stations, at shrines, temples and attractions also use it. English-language newspapers and media use the simplified form of Hepburn. Cities and prefectures use it in information for English-speaking residents and visitors, and English-language publications by the Japanese Foreign Ministry use simplified Hepburn too. Official tourism information put out by the government uses it, as do guidebooks, local and foreign, on Japan.
Many students of Japanese as a foreign language learn Hepburn.

==Variants of Hepburn romanization==

There are many variants of Hepburn romanization. The two most common styles are:
In Japan itself, there are some variants officially mandated for various uses:
Details of these variants can be found below.

===Obsolete variants===

The romanizations set out in the first and second versions of Hepburn's dictionary are primarily of historical interest. Notable differences from the third and later versions include:

====Second version====

The following differences are in addition to those in the second version:

==Features of Hepburn romanization==

The main feature of Hepburn is that its spelling is based on English phonology. More technically, where syllables constructed systematically according to the Japanese syllabary contain the "unstable" consonant for the modern spoken language, the orthography is changed to something that, as an English speaker would pronounce it, better matches the real sound, for example し is written shi not * si.
Some linguists such as H.E.Palmer, Daniel Jones and Otto Jespersen object to Hepburn, as the pronunciation-based spellings can obscure the systematic origins of Japanese phonetic structures, inflections, and conjugations.[tpl]Cite journal|author=松浦四郎|date=October 1992|title=104年かかった標準化|journal=標準化と品質菅理 -Standardization and Quality Control-|volume=45|pages=P.92–93|publisher=Japanese Standards Association[/tpl] Supporters [tpl]Who|date=May 2010[/tpl] argue that Hepburn is not intended as a linguistic tool.

===Long vowels===

The long vowels are generally indicated by macrons.[tpl]cite book|title=A Japanese-English And English-Japanese Dictionary. (Third Edition)|author=James Curtis Hepburn|year=1886|publisher=Z.

The combinations of vowels are written as follows in traditional/modified Hepburn:

====A + A====

====Other combination of vowels====

All remaining combinations of two different vowels are written separately:

====Loanword====

The long vowels within loanword are indicated by macrons (ā, ī, ū, ē, ō) as follows:

====Variations====

There are many variations of the Hepburn system for indicating the long vowels. For example, [tpl]nihongo2|東京（とうきょう）[/tpl] can be written as:

===Particles===

In traditional Hepburn:
In modified Hepburn:

===Syllabic n===

In traditional Hepburn:

===Double consonants===

Double (or "geminate") consonant sounds are marked by doubling the consonant following the sokuon, っ; for consonants that are digraphs in Hepburn (sh, ch, ts), double only the first consonant of the set, except for ch → tch.

==Hepburn romanization charts==

===For extended katakana===

These combinations are used mainly to represent the sounds in words in other languages.
Digraphs with orange backgrounds are the general ones used for loanwords or foreign places or names, and the ones with blue backgrounds are used for more accurate transliterations of foreign sounds, both suggested by the Cabinet of Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/hakusho/nc/k19910628002/k19910628002.html|title=平成3年6月28日内閣告示第2号:外来語の表記|trans_title=Japanese cabinet order No.2 (June 28, 1991):The notation of loanword|author=Cabinet of Japan|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|accessdate=May 25, 2011|authorlink=Cabinet of Japan[/tpl] Katakana combinations with beige backgrounds are suggested by the American National Standards Institute and the British Standards Institution as possible uses. Ones with purple backgrounds appear on the 1974 version of the Hyōjun-shiki formatting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.halcat.com/roomazi/doc/hyouzyunC.html |title=■標準式ローマ字つづり―引用 |publisher=Halcat.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13[/tpl]
