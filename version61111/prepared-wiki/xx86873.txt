The Movement is the second solo studio album by Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck. A departure from Uncontrolled Substance's darker, soul-inspired sound, The Movement is more upbeat and expressive.  According to Inspectah Deck, "Uncontrolled Substance was just me as an ill lyricist wanting to put an album out. I just wanted to be heard. The Movement is like is me behind the scenes, behind everything. I'm doing ... everything. All the credits got Inspectah Deck on it this time. I was able to put my soul into it."Q&A with Inspectah Deck at Wu-Tang Clan fansite
