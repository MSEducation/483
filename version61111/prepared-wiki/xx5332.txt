===The Tonight Show===

Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host[tpl]cite news|title=Carson cuts appearances|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5008,192179&dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling|agency=Associated Press|work=Rome News-Tribune|location=Rome, Ga.|page=14|date=June 2, 1987|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl] amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting Late Night with David Letterman since 1982 (aired after The Tonight Show), and whom many had expected to be Carson's successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into a book and a movie. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on The Tonight Show.
In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with NBC which would keep him as host of The Tonight Show until 2009.[tpl]cite news|title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm |agency=Associated Press|work=USA Today|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl] Later in 2004, Conan O'Brien signed a contract with NBC under which O'Brien would become the host of The Tonight Show in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.[tpl]cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Conan O'Brien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&position= |work=The New York Times|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl]
During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for The Tonight Show. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/|title=LENO/WGA: WHAT'S THE REAL STORY?

In 1998, Leno competed in a tag-team match at the WCW's Road Wild pay-per-view. Since 2001, he has voiced The Crimson Chin, a recurring superhero in the Nickelodeon animated series The Fairly OddParents.
Leno said in 2008, that he was saving all of his income from The Tonight Show and living solely off his income from stand-up comedy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-07-16-leno-cover_N.htm|title=Jay Leno Gears up for Life After 'Tonight'|last=della Cava|first=Marco|date=July 17, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 25, 2009[/tpl]

====Michael Jackson trial====

During the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html|title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson|publisher=Court TV|date=May 24, 2005|author=Sweetingham, Lisa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html |archivedate= March 15, 2008[/tpl]
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to continue telling jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Show's opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller among others.[tpl]cite episode|accessdate=May 11, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html|title=Showbiz Tonight|publisher=CNN|airdate=March 8, 2005|first=Karyn|last=Bryant[/tpl]

===Succession by Conan O'Brien and The Jay Leno Show===

Because Leno's show continued to lead all late-night programming in the Nielsen ratings, the pending expiration of Leno's contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.[tpl]cite news|first=Frazier|last=Moore|title=NBC's Jay Leno-Conan O'Brien swap prompts rumors|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/nbc-s-jay-leno-conan-o-brien-swap-prompts-rumors-1.881678|agency=Associated Press|work=Newsday|date=May 14, 2008|accessdate=June 28, 2013[/tpl] Leno left The Tonight Show on Friday May 29, 2009,[tpl]cite news|first=Bill|last=Carter|title=Date Is Set for Leno's 'Tonight' Finale|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/arts/television/22late.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/T/Television|work=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/30/arts/television/30leno.html?em|title=Jay Leno Takes Final Bow on 'Tonight Show' |date=May 30, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 30, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter[/tpl] and Conan O'Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

Jay Leno's new show, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009.

First guests included Jerry Seinfeld, Oprah Winfrey (via satellite), and a short sit-down with Kanye West discussing his controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, which had occurred the night before.Jay Leno Reveals What To Expect From His New Primetime Show

===Timeslot conflict and return to The Tonight Show===

In their new roles, neither O'Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10pm weeknight time slot to 11:35pm, due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno's and O'Brien's poor ratings."Future For NBC's Tonight Show Up In The Air", Los Angeles Times, January 2010."Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options". Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the 2010 Winter Olympics between February 15 and 26. This would move The Tonight Show to 12:05am, a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history. O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty (a clause put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).Finke, Nikki (January 7, 2010).

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien. It was decided that O'Brien would leave The Tonight Show. The deal was made that O'Brien would receive a $33 million payout and that his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure.
