</ref> 31 March and 1 April 2006 Doherty was performing two surprising solo gigs, his first in mainland Europe, at the NonStop Kino pornographic cinema and venue in [[Graz]], Austria, after he failed to turn up for an earlier arrangement in January. For this occasion he produced, at the suggestion of Bettina Aichbauer, friend of Doherty and owner of the NonStop Kino, a film with the title ''Spew It Out Your Soul'' which he showed on screen during his performance.<ref name="Graz">

On 12 July 2008, Doherty played a solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was originally scheduled for 26 April, but had to be rescheduled to a later date due to Doherty being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April.[tpl]cite news| url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/live/story/0,,2290716,00.html |work=The Guardian  | location=London | title=Pete Doherty | first=Betty | last=Clarke | date=14 July 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl] The solo show did not get the best ratings but was all in all still well received. Jon Swaine of The Daily Telegraph criticised that "whole chunks of the set … passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to know quite how to behave" and that – without a full band – Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/14/bmpete114.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Pete Doherty's bloom lost in space | first=Jon | last=Swaine | date=14 July 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl] Betty Clarke of The Guardian described Doherty as "focused" and "on good form". Friend and collaborator Peter Wolfe had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed "For Lovers". Swaine stated Wolfe ruined the song with "some especially tuneless backing vocals". The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/44573/Pete-Doherty-Royal-Albert-Hall-Show-Hit-By-Stage-Invasion |title=Pete Doherty Royal Albert Hall Show Hit By Stage Invasion |first=Scott |last=Colothan |date=14 July 2008 |publisher=Gigwise |accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]
On 13 January 2009, NME.COM announced that Doherty's solo album, entitled Grace/Wastelands would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, "Last of the English Roses", on 9 March. The website also revealed the tracklisting of the album and credits. In 2009 Doherty was made an honorary patron of the University Philosophical Society.
Whilst performing a solo gig at the Grimsby Auditorium in March 2009, Doherty declared Grimsby a "shit-hole" mid-way through his set after being continuously pelted with coins and drinks by a harsh[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] crowd.

===Painting and writing===

In June 2006, Doherty announced that he had signed a deal with Orion Books to publish his journals, in which he had recorded poetry, drawings, and photos over the course of his career. Most of Doherty's journals are freely available on the internet.[ref]
</ref> The book, titled ''The Books of Albion: The Collected Writings of Peter Doherty'', was released on 21 June 2007.<ref>[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/HB-40521/Journals.htm |title=The Books of Albion-The Collected Writings of Peter Doherty by Peter Doherty – 9780752885919- Orion Books |accessdate=17 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070318071643/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/HB-40521/Journals.htm  |archivedate = 18 March 2007[/tpl]</ref>
On 15 May 2007, Doherty exhibited his paintings for the first time. The art exhibition took place at the London's Bankrobber Gallery, and was on show for one month. The collection featured 14 paintings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/05/16/pete_doherty_s_bloodworks_exhibition_ope |title=Pete Doherty's Bloodworks Exhibition Opens in London |date=16 May 2007 |publisher=Starpulse Entertainment News Blog |accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]
An exhibition of Doherty's paintings titled, "Art of the Albion", took place at the Gallerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/42662/pete-doherty-launches-new-blood-exhibition-in-paris |title=Pete Doherty Launches New Blood Exhibition in Paris |first=Jason |last=Gregory |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=Gigwise |accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl] The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty's own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamourising illegal substance abuse.[tpl]cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Personal_Finance/Art_/Art_exhibition_by_Doherty_causes_controversy/rssarticleshow/2987458.cms |work=The Times of India  | title=Art exhibition by Doherty causes controversy |date=27 April 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20090110230034/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Personal_Finance/Art_/Art_exhibition_by_Doherty_causes_controversy/rssarticleshow/2987458.cms | archivedate=10 January 2009[/tpl] Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London's Decima gallery, for example, slammed his work: "It's not got any artistic merit. He's using his blood to make them interesting, but when you look at them they're what any four-year-old can do."

===Modelling===

Following in the footsteps of model and ex-fiancée Kate Moss, Doherty became the face of Roberto Cavalli's Fall 2007/2008 fashion advertising campaign. The photos gained praise for depicting a much cleaner and more handsome Doherty. The '50s-style photographs have also been compared to images of Marlon Brando.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/25/nmoss125.xml |title=Doherty becomes fashion contender for Moss |accessdate=29 June 2007 |last=Alexander |first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Alexander |date=27 June 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph  | location=London[/tpl]

===Acting===

On 9 December 2010 it was reported that Doherty would be taking the lead role opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg in Confession of a Child of the Century, Sylvie Verheyde's film adaption of Alfred de Musset's autobiographical novel La Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/film-role-for-peter-doherty-2154999.html | location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Rob | last=Sharp | title=Film role for Peter Doherty | date=9 December 2010[/tpl] The film was screened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.Catherine Shoard, Cannes 2012: Confession of a Child of the Century at guardian.co.uk

==Influences==

In interviews, Doherty has listed his favourite books as George Orwell's 1984, Brighton Rock by Graham Greene, Our Lady of the Flowers by Jean Genet, Flowers of Evil by Charles Baudelaire and the complete works of Oscar Wilde. He has also mentioned Emily Dickinson and Tony Hancock as influences; Doherty and his father were once members of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society. Doherty mentions Hancock, and makes an allusion to his famous phrase 'Stone me!', in an early song entitled "You're My Waterloo". However, numerous literary and musical allusions occur throughout Doherty's ongoing Books of Albion. He places particular importance on the Romantic poets and on existential philosophers such as Albert Camus and Miguel de Unamuno. Doherty has also alluded to work by the Marquis de Sade and Thomas de Quincey. On the Babyshambles album Down in Albion, there is a track entitled "À rebours", which is significantly influenced by the novel of the same name by Joris-Karl Huysmans.[tpl]cite news|title=For Pete's sake|first=Janice|last=Turner|accessdate=12 May 2007|date=19 August 2006|work=Times Saturday Magazine|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27869-2319045.html|location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title='Emily Dickinson?

Doherty has supported up-and-coming British bands, such as indie bands The Paddingtons and The View.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-catch-all/2007/10/13/the-razz-doherty-view-on-rockers-86908-19944827|title=Pete Doherty Tells How He Gave The View Their Break|accessdate=2 November 2007|last=Lyons|first=Beverley|authorlink=Beverley Lyons|coauthors=Sutherland, Laura|date=13 October 2007|work=Daily Record|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071230015151/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-catch-all/2007/10/13/the-razz-doherty-view-on-rockers-86908-19944827|archivedate=30 December 2007[/tpl]
Doherty is also known to be a devoted follower of Queens Park Rangers football club. As a youth he wrote a fanzine, entitled "All Quiet on the Western Avenue".
A frequent lyrical theme for Doherty is Albion, the ancient name for Great Britain. Doherty also uses 'Albion' as the name of a ship sailing to a utopia called Arcadia, a place without rules or authority. Doherty and Barât shared a flat in London, at 112a Teesdale Street, Bethnal Green, affectionately known as 'The Albion Rooms', despite being rather run down. Doherty named his diaries, in which he writes poems and other thoughts, the Books of Albion.

==Drug abuse and legal problems==

Doherty has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences and those arising from drug use, such as driving under the influence, car theft,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-babyshambles|title=Grand Theft Auto: Babyshambles|work=Spin|accessdate=7 May 2008|date=28 February 2006[/tpl] and driving with a suspended licence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL2015065120070820|title=Pete Doherty arrested after V Festival|publisher=Reuters UK|accessdate=7 May 2008|date=20 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/pete-doherty-arrested-again|title=Pete Doherty Arrested, Again|work=Spin|accessdate=7 May 2008|date=7 May 2007[/tpl] He has pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine. His addictions have resulted in jail time and multiple trips to rehabilitation facilities. The influence of drugs on his life had already reached such an intensity at times, that in his younger days, Doherty worked as a drug dealer to pay for his drug habit, as he stated to author Peter Welsh in his biography.[tpl]cite book|last=Welsh|first=Peter|title=Kids in the Riot: High and Low with the Libertines|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84449-716-4[/tpl] Doherty stated that he had been a rent boy, and that during that time he robbed one of his male clients.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/doherty-i-was-a-gay-rent-boy-and-drug-dealer|title=Pete Doherty: I was a gay rent boy and drug dealer|date=17 April 2005|publisher=contactmusic.com|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl]
In 2003, while Doherty's first band The Libertines was performing in Japan without him, he broke into Carl Barât's flat and stole various items, including an old guitar and a laptop computer. On 7 September Doherty was sentenced by Judge Roger Davies to six months in prison, however the sentence was eventually shortened to two months on appeal with the judge commenting, "We feel that a custodial sentence was justified in this case but sufficient credit was not given for his timely plea of guilty which it should have been. We have reduced his sentence to two months which will allow for his almost immediate release." Doherty was released from jail on 8 October 2003.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3142801.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Musician admits burgling bandmate's flat|date=12 August 2003|accessdate=19 March 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/libertines/15033|work=NME|title=Pete Libertine Goes to Jail|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=28 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3149610.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Libertines singer's sentence cut|date=29 September 2003|accessdate=6 January 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&id=13717|publisher=xfm|title=Libertine Reunited with Liberated Pete|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=19 March 2007[/tpl]
On 2 February 2005, Doherty was arrested after an altercation with documentary filmmaker Max Carlish, who was making a rockumentary about the singer and sold photos of a heroin smoking Doherty to the tabloids. Doherty and his friend Alan Wass had been charged with robbery and blackmail. On 7 February, he was released on bail after his record company Rough Trade put up £150,000 in bonds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?b=news&id=65780|title=Pete Doherty Gets Conditional Bail|date=4 February 2005|publisher=xfm|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/05/feb/item18.shtml|title=Pete Doherty Released From Jail|date=8 February 2005|publisher=antimusic.com|accessdate=9 May 2011[/tpl] All charges against him were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service due to a lack of evidence.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/apr/12/arts.artsnews|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Pete Doherty's charges dropped|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=12 April 2005|accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl]
In late 2007, a photo was published in several newspapers of Doherty allegedly forcing his pet  cat to inhale from a crack pipe.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=20100|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Doherty 'Forced Cat to Smoke Crack'|date=7 September 2007|accessdate=11 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/07/pete-doherty-photographed_1_n_63409.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|title=Pete Doherty Photographed Allegedly Giving His Kitten Crack|date=9 September 2007|accessdate=11 March 2010[/tpl]
On 8 April 2008, Doherty was jailed for 14 weeks by a court for breaching a probation order after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences. On 18 April 2008, he was moved  to a private area of Wormwood Scrubs prison after learning that fellow inmates were planning to attack him, therefore making it safer for the singer. On 6 May  2008, he was released after his sentence was cut in half and further 18 days were remitted due to a government plan to reduce overcrowding. He also had another 2 days off for being in police custody (after serving just over 4 weeks of a 14-week sentence). He described prison life as "a lot of gangsters and Radio 4" and showed a certificate confirming he had passed a drugs test while inside.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641315053|title=Rocker Pete Doherty Freed From Prison|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=6 May 2008|publisher=Sky News[/tpl]
Doherty made another attempt to fight his drug addiction in September 2007, when he underwent rehab for six weeks at Clouds House.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7023339.stm|title=Doherty gets chance to kick drugs|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 September 2008|date=2 October 2007[/tpl] However, Doherty relapsed in November 2007 following his appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7082897.stm|title=Doherty owns up to drug  relapse|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 September 2008|date=7 November 2007[/tpl]

On 21 December, he was spared jail but was ordered to pay £2,050 in fines, and was banned from driving for 18 months, despite the court hearing Doherty had 21 previous drug offences and six motoring offences. Following his release from court, he was escorted by officers to the nearest police station and re-arrested for possession of a controlled substance,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6964514.ece|title=Pete Doherty rearrested after being convicted of driving and drug offences|first=Simon de|last=Bruxelles|work=The Times|accessdate=9 May 2011|date=22 December 2009|location=London[/tpl] later revealed to be heroin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Singer-Pete-Doherty-Charged-With-Possession-Of-Heroin-Following-His-Arrest-After-A-Court-Appearance/Article/200912415506340|first=Neal|last=Walker|publisher=Sky News Online|title=Doherty Drug Charge After Court Appearance|accessdate=22 December 2009|date=22 December 2009[/tpl] The following day, 22 December, it emerged that Doherty could be charged with offences linked to a hit-and-run incident, which left a pedestrian in a critical condition. His manager, Andrew Boyd, appeared in court charged with a number of offences relating to the incident. While Doherty was in Gloucester court on 21 December, heroin fell out of his coat pocket. He was arrested for possession and was convicted for this offence at the same court on 27 January 2010. He was fined £750 and ordered to pay £85 court costs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7083165/Pete-Doherty-fined-for-walking-into-court-with-heroin-in-pocket.html|title=Pete Doherty fined for walking into court with heroin in pocket|date=27 January 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 May 2011|location=London[/tpl]

==Family and personal life==

His mother, Jacqueline, is a nurse, who published a book about family life with Doherty and his drug problems, Pete Doherty: My  Prodigal Son. Doherty's father, Peter John Doherty, is a retired Army Officer (Major).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=121&title=before_they_were_famous_amy_winehouse_pe&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1|title=Before They Were Famous|first=Luke|last=Lewis|accessdate=1 September 2008|date=1 September 2008|work=NME[/tpl]
After numerous attempts to convince him to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided he was tired of broken promises and vowed not to see his son again until the latter was clean of drugs.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the BBC Two Arena documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty explained in an interview with the BBC Radio 4 show Front Row that he had briefly reconciled with his father after three years when his father visited him in rehab, but were estranged again over drugs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7042330.stm|title=Doherty 'at drugs turning point'|accessdate=2 November 2007|date=12 October 2007|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
