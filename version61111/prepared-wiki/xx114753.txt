Clynotis is a genus of the spider family Salticidae, or jumping spiders, contained within the subfamily Marpissinae. They are found across Australia and New Zealand, with some species occupying the Auckland Islands and one found exclusively on Snares Island.[tpl]cite journal | title=Geners Clynotis and Tora | author=Państwowe Wydawn. Naukowe | journal=Annales Zoologici | month=2005 | volume=40 | pages=439–440.[/tpl] There are eight species currently described within the genus, the earliest noted being the type species clynotis severus, first described in Queensland, New South Wales, Australia in 1879 by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch. The most recent was described in 1931 by Lucien Berland.[tpl]cite web | url=http://research.amnh.org/oonopidae/catalog/names.php?genus=Clynotis | title=Taxa where genus is 'Clynotis' | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | date=2014 | accessdate=24 March 2014 | author=Platnick, Norman I.[/tpl] Twoother species previously held within the genus were subsequently reclassified into the genus Tara.
As with most salticidae spiders, members of this genus are known for their ability to jump with agility, and for their strong vision.[tpl]cite journal | title=Salticidae | author=Richman, D.B., Edwards, G.B. & Cutler, B. | journal=American Arachnological Society | year=2005 | pages=205–216[/tpl] They are identifiable from the distinct shape of the cephalothorax and their eye patterns. Of their eight eyes, the front row of four feature a dramatically prominent anterior median pair, while the rear row of four eyes may be described as strongly bent, or as being rearranged into two rows, with two large posterior lateral eyes furthest back. These supply lateral vision, while the forward four are adapted to detailed, three-dimensional vision for purposes of estimating the range, direction, and nature of potential prey, permitting the spider to direct its attacking leaps with great precision.Crompton, J. (1954). The Life of the Spider. Mentor, p. 77.
Also in common with other salticidae, they use their silk for safety lines while jumping. They construct silken "pup tents", where they shelter from bad weather and sleep at night. They molt within these shelters, build and store egg cases within them, and also spend the winter in them.[tpl]cite book|title=Biology of Spiders|first=Rainer F.|last=Foelix|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|page=11|isbn=0-674-07431-9[/tpl]
