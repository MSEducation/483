It is known as the "Porcelain Capital" because it has been producing quality pottery for 1700 years. The city has a well-documented history that stretches back over 2000 years.

==History==

During the Han Dynasty, Jingdezhen was known as Xinping. Historical records show that it was during this time that it began to make porcelain.Translated from Chinese version of Jingdezhen in Wikipedia Xinping then was renamed Changnanzhen (Changnan Town) during the Tang Dynasty since it sits at the south bank of Chang river. And "china" is translated from "Changnan". In 1004 CE during the North Song Dynasty, it was renamed again as Jingdezhen, taking the era name of the emperor during whose reign its porcelain production first rose to fame.
In the Ming and Qing dynasties, Jingdezhen was named one of four famous towns in Chinese history, along with Foshan (Guangdong), Hankou (Hubei) and Zhuxianzhen (Henan).[tpl]cite web | language =Chinese  | publisher =Guangming Daily  | title =Great change of Four Famous Town In Ming and qing Dynasty| url =http://www.gmw.cn/content/2009-03/21/content_889111.htm  | author =  | date =  | accessdate =2009-08-29  [/tpl]
 "Allegedly, Jingdezhen gave birth to the English name of the country. The ancient name of the town is Changnan.... Way back in time, Changnan was synonymous with ceramics, and over time, foreign ceramics traders made the name sound like “china”. The rest is history."Wings of China 2011 No. 05, Vol. 198. p. 179. 
In the 19th century, Jingdezhen became a county. During the period of the People's Republic of China it became a provincial city but retained the Jingdezhen name.   Usually when a town is upgraded to a city, the designation of "city" replaces that of "town", but Jingdezhen retained its name to honor its history.
Jingdezhen was named one of top 24 national historical and cultural cities of the People's Republic of China on February 28, 1982.[tpl]cite web | language =  | publisher = Beijing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage  | title =List Of The First National historical and cultural city| url =http://www.bjww.gov.cn/2009/1-6/1231217145718.html| author =  | date =  | accessdate =2009-08-30  [/tpl]

Most Jingdezhen porcelain is valued by collectors of antique porcelain throughout the world. According to media reports, a blue and white porcelain jar produced in Jingdezhen during the Yuan Dynasty was auctioned for the equivalent of RMB 230,000,000 yuan in London, UK on July 12, 2005. This was the highest price achieved by a piece of porcelain in the history of all porcelain auctions of the world. The reason for the high price is experts believe that the blue and white Yuan Dynasty porcelain has a dominant position in the history of Chinese ceramics. It represents the pinnacle of the development of Chinese blue and white porcelain.[tpl]cite web | language =Chinese| publisher =CCTV video—100 forum | title =Ma Weidu-Ceramics deify | url =http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTY3MDk5ODQ=.html | author = | date = | accessdate =2009-08-30 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web | language =Chinese | publisher =CCTV video| title =Ma Weidu- the Legend Collector| url =http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjQzODkxNjQ=.htmll | author = | date = | accessdate =2009-09-03 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
