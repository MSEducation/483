[[Centrarchidae]]

CATEGORIES: Centrarchidae, Percoidei

The sunfish are a family (Centrarchidae) of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the order Perciformes. The type genus is Centrarchus (consisting solely of the flier, C. macropterus). The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to North Americans, including the rock bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and crappies. All are native only to North America.
Family members are distinguished by having at least three anal spines. The dorsal spines are five to 13 in number, but most species have 10â€“12. The pseudobranch is small and concealed. Sizes of most are in the [tpl]convert|20|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] range. However, some are much smaller, with the black-banded sunfish at just [tpl]convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, while the largemouth bass is reported to reach almost [tpl]convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in extreme cases.
The male of most species builds a nest by hollowing out a depression using his tail, then guards the eggs.[tpl]cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Johnson, G.D. & Gill, A.C.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 187|isbn= 0-12-547665-5[/tpl]
Most sunfish are valued for sports fishing, and have been introduced in many areas outside their original ranges, sometimes becoming invasive species.
