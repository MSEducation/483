In 1961, The Washington Ballet School premiered Day's The Nutcracker with the National Symphony Orchestra in Constitution Hall.  In 1976, Day started The Washington Ballet, a company providing a professional showcase for the students of The Washington School of Ballet.  Funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Day hired Peter Grigsby as the first administrative director who took advantage of the Department of Labor's Comprehensive Employment and Training Act to hire dancers. He was followed by Alton Miller as director who expanded the touring of the company. The Washington Ballet founding company members included Madelyn Berdes, Patricia Berrend, James Canfield, Sharon Caplan, Robin Conrad, Lynn Cote, Laurie Dameron, John Goding, Robin Hardy, Jon Jackson, Brian Jameson, Terry Lacy, Christine Matthews, Ricardo Mercado, Julie Miles, Patricia Miller, Philip Rosemond, Helen Sumerwell and Allison Zusi.

===Resident choreographer Goh===

The company's first season consisted of three works by an up-and-coming choreographer/dancer from the Dutch National Ballet, Choo San Goh, who became resident choreographer and later associate artistic director.  Goh's teaching and choreographic demands in his first two years in Washington DC moved the company from being described as "pre-professional" to solidly professional level, with Mikhail Baryshnikov showing interest in, and eventually dancing with, the company and Goh's choreography in 1979.[ref]
</ref>  During his time at The Washington Ballet until his death in November 1987, Goh choreographed 19 ballets for the company.
In 1980, 17-year-old company member Amanda McKerrow was chosen as one of nine dancers to compete on the official U.S. dance team at the Fourth International Ballet Competition in Moscow. She partnered with Simon Dow and won the gold medal, becoming the first United States citizen to win the competition. During the 1980s and 1990s, The Washington Ballet performed full seasons in Washington, D.C. and toured internationally to China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Spain, and South America.

===Post Goh years===

Mary Day stepped down as artistic director of the company in 1999 and retired as school director in 2003. She died in 2006.

==The Septime Webre years (1999-present)==

In 1999, Septime Webre, a Cuban-American, joined The Washington Ballet as the artistic director.  Works created for The Washington Ballet by Webre include Juanita y Alicia (2000), Carmen (2001), Journey Home (2002), Cinderella (2003), Oui/Non (2006), and State of Wonder (2006), as well as Carmina Burana, Fluctuating Hemlines, Where the Wild Things Are, and Peter Pan. The company has staged the works of such contemporary choreographers as George Balanchine, Twyla Tharp, Christopher Wheeldon, Mark Morris, Trey McIntyre, Edwaard Liang, and Nacho Duato, in addition to the more classical ballets, like Giselle, Copp√©lia, and La Sylphide.  In October 2000, Webre led The Washington Ballet on an historic tour of Havana, making it the first American ballet company to perform in Cuba since 1960.  In 2004, The Washington Ballet premiered Webre's The Nutcracker.  Webre created his takes on The Great Gatsby in 2006 and The Sun Also Rises in 2013.
Webre also initiated DanceDC, The Washington Ballet's outreach and education program that combines creative movement with an integrated language arts curriculum for D.C. public school children.  Classical pre-ballet technique is taught to interested DanceDC students through a unique scholarship program called EXCEL!  Nine boys and nine girls from the DanceDC schools are selected annually to receive on-site professional ballet technique training for an hour once a week at The Washington School of Ballet.  In 2005, the company began The Washington Ballet at the Town Hall Education, Arts and Recreation Campus (TWB@THEARC), a home to community programs by the company as well as a branch of the Washington School of Ballet east of the Anacostia River.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
