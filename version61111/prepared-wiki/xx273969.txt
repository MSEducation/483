The games were, in general, given a glowing review by members of the Australian Paralympic team. Although timing was tight, the entire program being run in just four days, events were well organised and the athletes were treated with a sense of legitimacy and professionalism that had so far been absent from disability sport. One Australian athlete recalls, ‘At the village we were halted by a magnificent entrance welcoming us with flags, banners and posters for the Paralympics. It was clear that Japan had decided to show their visitors the hospitality and efficiency that she had shown the Olympic Visitors’“With the Australian Paraplegic Team in Tokyo,”The Australian Paraplegic 3, no.4 (1964), 9
