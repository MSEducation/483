Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual performance.Erectile dysfunction glossary - MUSC Health A penile erection is the hydraulic effect of blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis. The process is often initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the penis. The most important organic causes are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma from prostatectomy surgery), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.
Psychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but often can be helped. Notably in psychological impotence, there is a strong response to placebo treatment. Erectile dysfunction can have severe psychological consequences as it can be tied to relationship difficulties and masculine self-image generally.
Besides treating the underlying causes such as potassium deficiency or arsenic contamination of drinking water, the first line treatment of erectile dysfunction consists of a trial of PDE5 inhibitor drugs (the first of which was sildenafil or Viagra). In some cases, treatment can involve prostaglandin tablets in the urethra, injections into the penis, a penile prosthesis, a penis pump or vascular reconstructive surgery.[tpl]cite journal |author=Montague DK |title=Chapter 1: The management of erectile dysfunction: an AUA update |journal=J.

The Latin term impotentia coeundi describes simple inability to insert the penis into the vagina; it is now mostly replaced by more precise terms, such as erectile dysfunction (ED). The study of erectile dysfunction within medicine is covered by andrology, a sub-field within urology. Research indicates that erectile dysfunction is common, and it is suggested that approximately 40% of males suffer from erectile dysfunction or impotence, at least occasionally.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20497307 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01849.x | volume=7 | issue=7 | title=Erectile dysfunction in the community: trends over time in incidence, prevalence, GP consultation and medication use—the Krimpen study: trends in ED |date=July 2010 | author=Schouten BW, Bohnen AM, Groeneveld FP, Dohle GR, Thomas S, Bosch JL | journal=J Sex Med | pages=2547–53[/tpl]

==Signs and symptoms==

Erectile dysfunction is characterized by the regular or repeated inability to obtain or maintain an erection. It is analyzed in several ways:

==Causes==

Surgical intervention for a number of conditions may remove anatomical structures necessary to erection, damage nerves, or impair blood supply. Erectile dysfunction is a common complication of treatments for prostate cancer, including prostatectomy and destruction of the prostate by external beam radiation, although the prostate gland itself is not necessary to achieve erection.
ED can also be associated with bicycling due to both neurological and vascular problems due to compression.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sommer|first=F|coauthors=Goldstein, I; Korda, JB|title=Bicycle riding and erectile dysfunction: a review.|journal=The journal of sexual medicine|date=July 2010|volume=7|issue=7|pages=2346–58|pmid=20102446|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01664.x[/tpl] The increase risk appears to be about 1.7 fold.[tpl]cite journal|last=Huang|first=V|coauthors=Munarriz, R; Goldstein, I|title=Bicycle riding and erectile dysfunction: an increase in interest (and concern).|journal=The journal of sexual medicine|date=September 2005|volume=2|issue=5|pages=596–604|pmid=16422816|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2005.00099.x[/tpl]

February 2011: Men who use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 3 times a day for more than 3 months are at a 22 percent increased risk of erectile dysfunction. A link between NSAID use and erectile dysfunction still existed for different age, race, ethnicity, smoker, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, coronary diasease and other health problems. But due to benefit of NSAID, it's too early for men to avoid NSAIDs based solely on the research stated at Journal of Urology.[tpl]cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011/03/New-study-links-pain-relievers-to-erectile-dysfunction/44363996/1?csp=34news&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+usatoday-NewsTopStories+%28News+-+Top+Stories%29 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=2011-03-01[/tpl]

==Pathophysiology==

Penile erection is managed by two mechanisms: the reflex erection, which is achieved by directly touching the penile shaft, and the psychogenic erection, which is achieved by erotic or emotional stimuli. The former uses the peripheral nerves and the lower parts of the spinal cord, whereas the latter uses the limbic system of the brain. In both conditions, an intact neural system is required for a successful and complete erection. Stimulation of the penile shaft by the nervous system leads to the secretion of nitric oxide (NO), which causes the relaxation of smooth muscles of corpora cavernosa (the main erectile tissue of penis), and subsequently penile erection.  Additionally, adequate levels of testosterone (produced by the testes) and an intact pituitary gland are required for the development of a healthy erectile system. As can be understood from the mechanisms of a normal erection, impotence may develop due to hormonal deficiency, disorders of the neural system, lack of adequate penile blood supply or psychological problems.  Restriction of blood flow can arise from impaired endothelial function due to the usual causes associated with coronary artery disease, but can also be caused by prolonged exposure to bright light.

==Diagnosis==

There are no formal tests to diagnose erectile dysfunction. Some blood tests are generally done to exclude underlying disease, such as hypogonadism and prolactinoma. Diabetes is considered a disorder, but is also a risk. Impotence is also related to generally poor physical health, poor dietary habits, obesity, and most specifically cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease.
A useful and simple way to distinguish between physiological and psychological impotence is to determine whether the patient ever has an erection. If never, the problem is likely to be physiological; if sometimes (however rarely), it could be physiological or psychological.  The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental diseases (DSM-IV) has included a listing for impotence.

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the cause.
Exercise, particularly aerobic exercise during midlife is an effective for preventing ED; exercise as a treatment is under investigation.[ref]Wespes E (chair), et al.

Oral pharmacotherapy and vacuum erection devices are first-line treatments,[tpl]rp|20,24[/tpl] followed by injections of drugs into the penis, and penile implants.[tpl]rp|25–26[/tpl]

===Oral medication===

The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases constitute a group of enzymes that destroy the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  Phosphodiesterases exist in different molecular forms and are unevenly distributed throughout the body.  One of the forms of phosphodiesterase is termed PDE5, and inhibiting PDE5 increases the amount of cGMP available in the blood supply to the penis, thus increasing blood flow. The prescription PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) and tadalafil (Cialis) are prescription drugs which are taken orally.[tpl]rp|20–21[/tpl]
Alprostadil in combination with the permeation enhancer DDAIP has been approved in Canada under the brand name Vitaros as a topical cream first line treatment for erectile dysfunction.[tpl]cite web|last=Bujdos|first=Brian|title=New Topical Erectile Dysfunction Drug Vitaros Approved in Canada; Approved Topical Drug Testim Proves Helpful for Erectile Dysfunction|url=http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/vitaros-testim-topical-drugs-treat-erectile-dysfunction-a1115|accessdate=15 April 2011[/tpl]

===Pumps===

The device helps draw blood into the penis by applying negative pressure. This type of device is sometimes referred to as penis pump and may be used just prior to sexual intercourse. Several types of FDA approved vacuum therapy devices are available with a doctor's prescription.  When pharmacological methods fail, a purpose-designed external vacuum pump can be used to attain erection, with a separate compression ring fitted to the penis to maintain it. These pumps should be distinguished from other penis pumps (supplied without compression rings) which, rather than being used for temporary treatment of impotence, are claimed to increase penis length if used frequently, or vibrate as an aid to masturbation. More drastically, inflatable or rigid penile implants may be fitted surgically.

===Injected medication===

Another treatment regimen is injection therapy.  One of the following drugs is injected into the penis: papaverine, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1.[tpl]rp|25[/tpl]

===Surgery===

Often, as a last resort if other treatments have failed, the most common procedure is prosthetic implants which involves the insertion of artificial rods into the penis.[tpl]rp|26[/tpl]

===Alternative medicine===

The FDA does not recommend alternative therapies (i.e. those that have not received FDA approval) to treat sexual dysfunction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/562177 |title=Dangers of Sexual Enhancement Supplements |work= |accessdate=[/tpl] Many products are advertised as "herbal viagra" or "natural" sexual enhancement products, but no clinical trials or scientific studies support the effectiveness of these products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, and synthetic chemical compounds similar to sildenafil have been found as adulterants in many of these products.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Gryniewicz | first1 = CM | last2 = Reepmeyer | first2 = JC | last3 = Kauffman | first3 = JF | last4 = Buhse | first4 = LF | title = Detection of undeclared erectile dysfunction drugs and analogues in dietary supplements by ion mobility spectrometry | journal = Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 601–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19150190 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2008.12.002 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Choi, Dong Mi; Park, Sangaeh; Yoon, Tae Hyung; Jeong, Hye Kyoung; Pyo, Jae Sung; Park, Janghyun; Kim, Deukjoon; Kwon, Sung Won | title = Determination of analogs of sildenafil and vardenafil in foods by column liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry | journal = Journal of AOAC International | year = 2008 | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 580–588 | pmid = 18567304[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2007.04.011 | author = Reepmeyer, John C.; Woodruff, Jeffrey T.  | title = Use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and a chemical cleavage reaction for the structure elucidation of a new sildenafil analogue detected as an adulterant in an herbal dietary supplement | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis | year = 2007 | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 887–893 | pmid = 17532168[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2006.11.037 | author = Reepmeyer, John C.; Woodruff, Jeffrey T.; 'Avignon, D.

==History==

During the late 16th and 17th centuries in France, male impotence was considered a crime, as well as legal grounds for a divorce. The practice, which involved inspection of the complainants by court experts, was declared obscene in 1677.[tpl]cite book|last=Roach|first=Mary|title=Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex|year=2009|publisher=W.W. Norton & Co|location=New York|isbn=9780393334791|pages=149–152[/tpl]
Dr. John R. Brinkley initiated a boom in male impotence cures in the US in the 1920s and 1930s. His radio programs recommended expensive goat gland implants and "mercurochrome" injections as the path to restored male virility, including operations by surgeon Serge Voronoff.
Modern drug therapy for ED made a significant advance in 1983, when British physiologist Giles Brindley, Ph.D. dropped his trousers and demonstrated to a shocked Urodynamics Society audience his papaverine-induced erection.[tpl]Cite journal  | last1 = Klotz | first1 = L. | title = How (not) to communicate new scientific information: a memoir of the famous Brindley lecture | journal = BJU Int | volume = 96 | issue = 7 | pages = 956–7 |date=Nov 2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05797.x | pmid = 16225508 [/tpl] The drug Brindley injected into his penis was a non-specific vasodilator, an alpha-blocking agent, and the mechanism of action was clearly corporal smooth muscle relaxation. The effect that Brindley discovered established the fundamentals for the later development of specific, safe, orally effective drug therapies.[tpl]cite journal | author = Brindley G | title = Cavernosal alpha-blockade: a new technique for investigating and treating erectile impotence | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 332–7 |date=October 1983 | pmid = 6626852 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.143.4.332 [/tpl][tpl]Better source|date=May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author=Helgason ÁR|title=Sexual desire, erection, orgasm and ejaculatory functions and their importance to elderly Swedish men: a population-based study|journal=Age Ageing|volume=25|issue=4|pages=285–291|year=1996|pmid=8831873|doi=10.1093/ageing/25.4.285|author-separator=,|author2=Adolfsson J|author3=Dickman P|display-authors=3|last4=Arver|first4=Stefan|last5=Fredrikson|first5=Mats|last6=Göthberg|first6=Marianne|last7=Steineck|first7=Gunnar[/tpl][tpl]Better source|date=May 2010[/tpl]
