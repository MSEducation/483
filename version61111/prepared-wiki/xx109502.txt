Acey Slade, (born Emil John Schmidt IV on December 15, 1974), is the lead singer and guitarist of the band Acey Slade & the Dark Party and current bassist in Joan Jett & the Blackhearts.

==Career==

Prior to the Murderdolls and Wednesday 13, Slade played bass, and later guitar, in the band Dope alongside guitarist Tripp Eisen who was also part of the Murderdolls. After Eisen left Dope, Slade was moved to guitar for the album Life. He later left Dope to join the Murderdolls, again replacing Eisen on guitar. Before joining the Murderdolls (alongside his Dope work), Slade also fronted a band known as the Vampire Love Dolls.
After Murderdolls were put on hiatus in 2004 Slade filled in on guitar for punk/metal crossover band, Amen for a tour of Japan.
Slade played rhythm guitar on the track "Tired 'N Lonely" on Roadrunner United for Roadrunner Records' 25-year anniversary. He collaborated on the song with Joey Jordison, who also played in the Murderdolls with Slade.
After the break-up of TrashLight Vision Slade filled in as guitarist for Wednesday 13 on his 2008 tour as well as taking time to produce records by His Mighty Robot (which remains unreleased) and Billy Liar.
