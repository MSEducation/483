The Tribute in Light is an art installation of 88 searchlights placed next to the site of the World Trade Center to create two vertical columns of light in remembrance of the September 11 attacks. It is produced annually by The Municipal Art Society of New York. It initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and was launched again in 2003 to mark the second anniversary of the attack. [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], it has been repeated every year on September 11. It had been announced that 2008 would be its final year,[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/will-the-tribute-in-light-go-dark-after-08/|publisher=New York Times|title=Will Tribute in Light Go Dark After ’08?|date=2007-09-11 | first=Sewell | last=Chan | accessdate=May 26, 2010[/tpl] but the tribute was continued in 2009.[tpl]cite news | publisher=NY1.com | title=September 11th Tribute Lights Up Again | url=http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/105290/september-11th-tribute-lights-up-again/Default.aspx"[/tpl] On December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through to the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but continued again in 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/tribute-in-light-will-keep-shining-this-year-and-the-next//|publisher=New York Times|title=‘Tribute in Light’ Will Keep Shining, This Year and the Next|date=2010-09-10 | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | accessdate=Sep 11, 2010[/tpl] As of July 23, 2012, plans are underway for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.[tpl]cite web|last=Mann|first=Ted|title='Tribute' Handover|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443437504577545520666491842.html|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=24 July 2012[/tpl]

==Development==

Those working on the project came up with the concept in the week following the attack. On September 13, 2001, the idea was presented to executives of Consolidated Edison, the electric utility company serving New York City, by John Englehart, then president of the brand innovation firm Arnell Group http://www.arnell.com Architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio distributed their "Project for the Immediate Reconstruction of Manhattan's Skyline". Artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, who before September 11 were working on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center north tower on a proposed light sculpture on the giant radio antenna with Creative Time, conceived of a project called "Phantom Towers". They were commissioned by The New York Times Magazine to create an image of the project for its September 23 cover.http://www.creativetime.org/programs/archive/2002/tribute/main.html
Richard Nash Gould, a New York architect, presented the concept to the Municipal Art Society. Gould was part of a firm whose SoHo office looked on the World Trade Center. Other projects by Gould include Howard, Darby & Levin in New York City and Polo Sport, Ralph Lauren in New York City. On September 19, Municipal Art Society chairman Philip K. Howard wrote to Mayor Rudy Giuliani, asking him "to consider placing two large searchlights near the disaster site, projecting their light straight up into the sky."http://mas.org/programs/tributeinlight/
After some consideration it was decided to contact lighting experts in the field of high intensity light displays. An Italian searchlight company named Space Cannon was chosen to help design the installation and to supply the 88 special fixtures that would be needed.http://archpaper.com/news/articles.asp?id=2775
The project was originally going to be named "Towers of Light", but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1857699.stm|title=Tribute in light to New York victims|accessdate=2008-04-27 | work=BBC News | date=March 6, 2002[/tpl]
On clear nights, the lights could be seen from over 60 miles away, visible in all of New York City and most of suburban Northern New Jersey and Long Island, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Westchester County, Orange County, New York and Rockland County, New York. The beams were clearly visible from the terrace at Century Country Club in Purchase, New York, from at least as far west as western Morris County, in Flanders, New Jersey, at least as far as the barrier beach of Fire Island in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island, and as far south near Trenton, New Jersey in nearby Hamilton.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035010/9-11-anniversary-Tribute-Light-rises-New-York.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Lee | last=Moran | title=Twinkling tribute to the Twin Towers: World Trade Center rises in poignant pillars of light as New York makes final preparations for 9/11 anniversary | date=September 8, 2011[/tpl]
Since 2008, the generators that power Tribute in Light have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants provided by Tri-State Biodiesel.

The lights have caused confusion for thousands of migrating birds, trapping them in the beams, and requiring that the lights be switched off for 20 minute periods to allow the birds to escape.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8005051/10000-birds-trapped-in-Twin-Towers-memorial-light.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|title=10000 birds trapped in Twin Towers memorial light|date=2010-09-15 | accessdate=Sep 15, 2010|location=London|first=Nick|last=Allen[/tpl] To ensure the lights do not affect migrating birds, the Municipal Art Society works with the New York City Audubon on the illumination.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110818/FREE/110819880|publisher=Crain's|title=Tribute in Light seeks funders|date=2011-08-18 | first=Emily | last=Laermer | accessdate=August 22, 2011[/tpl]
