The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion is a small society of evangelical churches, founded in 1783 by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon as a result of the Evangelical Revival.  For years it was strongly associated with the Calvinist Methodist movement of George Whitefield.[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Methodism[/tpl]
John Marrant (1755 – 1791), an ordained minister with the Connexion, was a noted evangelist amongst the Cherokee Native Americans and the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia, some of whom settled in Sierra Leone.
In the 1850s English-speaking Quebecer John Molson built a church for the group near his brewery in Montreal, but it was poorly attended and soon became a military barracks.http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VIkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=66UFAAAAIBAJ&dq=bishop-fulford&pg=4431%2C2334187
Today the church has 21 congregations in England and some in Sierra Leone. Of the UK churches six normally have full-time pastors — Eastbourne, Ely, Goring, St. Ives, Turners Hill and Ebley. Total attendance at all churches is approximately 1,000 adults and children.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cofhconnexion.org.uk/churches/todays-churches/ |title=Today's Churches |publisher=Countess Of Huntingdons Connexion |accessdate=28 January 2013[/tpl]
