==History==

Swadlincote's toponym is derived from the Old English "Swartlings Cottas", Swartling being a man's name and cottas meaning cottages.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Derbyshire/Swadlincote |title=Swadlincote |work=Key To English Place Names|publisher= English Place Name Society |accessdate=8 May 2012[/tpl] Past forms of the toponym include Sivardingescote and Swartlincote.Lysons & Lysons, 1817, pages 165–172 Swadlincote residents often shorten its name to "Swad". 
The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded Swadlincote as a small manor. It was part of the parish of Gresley (latterly Church Gresley) until the 19th century.Lewis, 1848, pages 280–283Lewis, 1848, pages 338–340
The first record of mineral extraction in the area is from the end of the 13th century, but the area remained rural until the industrialisation in the 18th century. The presence of coal and clay in the area led to urbanisation as colleries, brickworks and potteries came to dominate Swadlincote. These industries continued to expand until the Second World War.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.south-derbys.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/LocalHistoryHeritage/Swadlincote+-+A+Potted+History.htm |title=Swadlincote - a potted history |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=South Derbyshire District Council |accessdate= 14 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] In Alexandra Road one traditional bottle-shaped kiln survives.Pevsner & Williamson, 1978, page 336
The fireclay strata in the coal measures has a high alumina content. Swadlincote is one of only six places in Great Britain with clay deposits of such quality.  The high alumina content makes it particularly suitable for salt glazing, where common salt is thrown onto the kiln fire.  A chemical reaction results in a fused glaze that is highly resistant to corrosion.  The properties of the clay mean that it is easily formed into pipes that are resistant to sewage.  The Public Health Act 1875 created a huge demand for locally produced pipes.James Woodward Limited, Swadlincote; South Derbyshire District Council, 2003
Emmanuel Church of England parish church is a Gothic Revival building consecrated in 1846. It was designed by H. I. Stevens and completed in 1848. Swadlincote had a Wesleyan chapel by 1848. Today the town has also the Roman Catholic church of Saints Peter and Paul.
The town's first local government was formed in 1871 with the creation of Swadlincote District local board of health.[tpl]cite book |series=Kelly's Directory |title=Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire and Rutland |year=1895 |publisher= |location=London |page=355[/tpl] the board's district consisted of three civil parishes: Church Gresley, Sutton and Newhall and Swadlincote. Under the terms of the Local Government Act 1894, this became Swadlincote and District Urban District, renamed Swadlincote Urban District in 1951. In 1974 the urban district was merged with Repton Rural District and part of South East Derbyshire Rural District to form the present South Derbyshire District.[tpl]cite book |last=Youngs, Jr |first=Frederick A |authorlink= |title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England |volume= II: Northern England |year=1991 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn= |pages=658–660[/tpl]
The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1947. The design reflected the fact that Swadlincote was formed out of part of the ancient parish of Church Gresley. Around the edge of the shield was a bordure or border in a "vairy" pattern of red and ermine, from the arms of the Gresley family, who took their name from the parish. The dedication of Grespel parish church to Saint George and Saint Mary was represented by their symbols: a cross and fleur de lys respectively. The quartered ermine and red field of the shield was taken from the arms of the Stanhope family, Earls of Harrington. The Tudor roses were taken from the arms of Derbyshire County Council. Above the arms was a crest depicting a human arm holding a billet or: a yellow brick for the local brick making industry. The arm rose from flames, indicative of mining of fireclay and coal. The Latin motto adopted: E Terra Divitiæ ("From the earth, riches") also referred to the mineral industries of Swadlincote.[tpl]cite book |last=Scott-Giles |first=C.

==Transport==

Swadlincote is near the junction of the A514 (Derby to A444) and A511 (Burton-upon-Trent to Ashby-de-la-Zouch) roads.
In 1804 the Ashby Canal was opened. Its northern terminus was at Moira, Leicestershire and it built tramways to carry coal and ceramics from Swadlincote and elsewhere to the canal for shipment.
The Midland Railway opened its Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line through Gresley in 1845 and opened Gresley railway station to serve the area. The company later built a branch line through Swadlincote itself and neighbouring Woodville. In the 20th century passenger services were withdrawn from both lines, and British Railways closed Gresley station in 1964.
Today the nearest railway station is [tpl]rws|Burton-on-Trent[/tpl], about [tpl]convert|4|mi[/tpl] away. The Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line remains open for goods traffic and in the 1990s there was a plan to restart the passenger service as the second phase of Leicestershire's Ivanhoe Line.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.leics.gov.uk/index/your_council/council_plans_policies/structure_plan/panel_report/panel_report_chapter_7.htm |title=Chapter 7 - Accessibility and Transport |accessdate=17 July 2008 |work=Structure Plan |publisher=Leicestershire County Council |year=2001 [/tpl] However, the plan was discontinued after the privatisation of British Rail and has not been revived.

==Accent and dialect==

The area around Swadlincote has historically had a distinct dialect.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/articles/2005/08/18/voices05_derbyshire_accent_feature.shtml |title=Discovering the Derbyshire Accent |author=BBC Derby |date= |work= |publisher=BBC Online |accessdate=14 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.landshapes.org/index.php?fuseaction=viewreference.main&reference=9A77C7D8&type_id=5&z_id=&pe_id=11&from=text&page_no=5 |title=Swadlincote dialect |author= |date= |work=LANDshapes |publisher= |accessdate=14 December 2007[/tpl]
The accent, rather like that of Burton-upon-Trent, is akin to that of Derby, and the terms of endearment "Duck" and "Ay up me duck" (Hello, my dear) are in common use in the Swadlincote area, as they are throughout some parts of Derbyshire and much of north Staffordshire. For example, an inhabitant enquiring about your well-being may ask "How are you, (me) duck?". This can be likened to the Geordie use of "pet", which is interesting as both use the analogy of an animal. Although "duck" can be used to converse 'male to male', it is now more commonly used when talking to a member of the opposite sex.
The word "youth" (pronounced "yow-th") is commonly used to describe any person. Unlike "duck", however – which is always a term of endearment – the word is sometimes used for scorn as well as endearment.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
One example of the dialect is the pronunciation of the word "tree", which is pronounced as "tray", and "tray" – which is pronounced as "Tree". "Saturday" is "Satdee", "Tuesday" is "Toozdee" and "three" is "threy". "Mardy" means soft or crybaby and "jitty" is a passage or alley. "Ah" is "yes" and "can't/wouldn't/shan't" are "canna/wunna/shunna". "Something" is "summat".[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
Recently, people have been moving to the town from South Staffordshire e.g. Tamworth and Lichfield, who use Swadlincote as a dormitory site, working elsewhere. This dialect can be heard alongside the traditional one.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
