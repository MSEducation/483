Canada Day ([tpl]lang-fr|Fête du Canada[/tpl]) is the national day of Canada, a federal statutory holiday celebrating the anniversary of the July 1, 1867, enactment of the British North America Act, 1867 (today called the Constitution Act, 1867), which united three colonies into a single country called Canada within the British Empire.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www1.canadiana.org/citm/themes/constitution/constitution13_e.html| title=Canada in the Making > Constitutional History > 1867–1931: Becoming a Nation| publisher=Canadiana| accessdate=June 16, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/historical/territorialevolution/1867/1| last=Department of Natural Resources| authorlink=Natural Resources Canada| title=Natural Resources Canada > Atlas Home > Explore Our Maps > History > Territorial Evolution > Territorial Evolution, 1867| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=June 16, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gmgBsaRJbTQC&pg=PT215| last=Moore| first=Christopher| title=1867: How the Fathers Made a Deal| year=2011| page=215| publisher=McClelland & Stewart| isbn=978-1-55199-483-3| accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] Originally called Dominion Day ([tpl]lang-fr|Le Jour de la Confédération[/tpl]), the holiday was renamed in 1982, the year the Canada Act was passed. Canada Day observances take place throughout Canada as well as among Canadians internationally.

Most communities across the country will host organized celebrations for Canada Day, usually outdoor public events, such as parades, carnivals, festivals, barbecues, air and maritime shows, fireworks, and free musical concerts,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&DocIDCd=6NR110| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=British Columbia and Yukon invited to participate to "Celebrate Canada!"

Given the federal nature of the holiday, celebrating Canada Day can be a cause of friction in the province of Quebec, where the holiday is overshadowed by Quebec's National Holiday, on June 24.[tpl]Cite news| last=Fedio| first=Chloe| title=Canada Day Parade organizers bemoan lack of political support| newspaper=The Gazette| date=June 17, 2010| url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Canada+Parade+organizers+bemoan+lack+political+support/3164763/story.html| accessdate=July 1, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] For example, the federal government funds Canada Day events at the Old Port of Montreal—an area run by a federal Crown corporation—while the National Holiday parade is a grassroots effort that has been met with pressure to cease, even from federal officials.[tpl]Cite news| last=Hustake| first=Aalan| title=Proud Canadian, proud Quebecer who loved a parade| newspaper=The Gazette| date=May 25, 2008| url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/insight/story.html?id=069c09a6-3deb-4246-8e2e-a7d5324b8b26| accessdate=May 25, 2008[/tpl] The nature of the event has also been met with criticism outside of Quebec, such as that given by Ottawa Citizen columnist David Warren, who said in 2007: "The Canada of the government-funded paper flag-waving and painted faces—the 'new' Canada that is celebrated each year on what is now called 'Canada Day'—has nothing controversially Canadian about it. You could wave a different flag, and choose another face paint, and nothing would be lost."[tpl]Cite news| last=Warren| first=David| title=Sea to sea| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| date=July 1, 2007| url=http://www.davidwarrenonline.com/index.php?id=750[/tpl]
Canada Day also coincides with Quebec's Moving Day, when many fixed-lease apartment rental terms expire.

===International celebrations===

Canadian expatriates will organize Canada Day activities in their local area on or near the date of the holiday. For instance, since 2006, annual Canada Day celebrations have been held at Trafalgar Square—the location of Canada House—in London, England; originally initiated by the Canadian community, endorsed by the Canadian High Commission, and now produced by Canada Day International, the event features Canadian performers, visual artists, a street hockey tournament, among other activities.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.canadadaylondon.com/default.asp| last=| title=Canada Day in London| publisher=Canada Day London| accessdate=June 27, 2012[/tpl]  In 2013, Canada Day International expanded to New York City with a similar program of food, music, and street hockey in Central Park. They also announced that they planned to expand to more cities before Canada's sesquicentennial in 2017.  They are currently exploring expanding to cities such as; Hong Kong, Mumbai, Paris and Rio de Janeiro among others[tpl]full| date=July 2013[/tpl]

Detroit, Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, have, since the 1950s, celebrated both Dominion or Canada Day and the United States' Independence Day with the International Freedom Festival; a massive fireworks display over the Detroit River, the strait separating the two cities, is held annually with hundreds of thousands of spectators attending. A similar event occurs at the Friendship Festival, a joint celebration between Fort Erie, Ontario, and neighbouring Buffalo, New York, and towns and villages throughout Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec come together to celebrate both anniversaries together.

==History==

The enactment of the British North America Act, 1867 (today called the Constitution Act, 1867), which confederated Canada, was celebrated on July 1, 1867, with the ringing of the bells at the Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto and "bonfires, fireworks and illuminations, excursions, military displays and musical and other entertainments", as described in contemporary accounts.[tpl]cite news| url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/06/29/allan-levine-the-evolution-of-july-1/| last=Levine| first=Allan| title=The evolution of July 1| date=June 28, 2013| newspaper=National Post| accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] On June 20 of the following year, Governor General the Viscount Monck issued a royal proclamation asking for Canadians to celebrate the anniversary of Confederation,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/canada-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > Canada Day| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=June 16, 2011[/tpl] However, the holiday was not established statutorily until May 15, 1879,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1359126121678/1359126177433| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Dominion Day| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=July 30, 2013| accessdate=October 12, 2013[/tpl] when it was designated as Dominion Day, in reference to the designation of the country as a Dominion in the British North America Act.[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7_LHcv89nW4C&pg=PA45| last1=James| first1=Patrick| last2=Kasoff| first2=Mark J.| title=Canadian Studies in the New Millennium| publisher=University of Toronto Press| page=45| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8020-9468-1[/tpl] The holiday was initially not dominant in the national calendar; any celebrations were mounted by local communities and the governor general hosted a party at Rideau Hall. No official celebrations were therefore held until 1917 and then none again for a further decade—the golden and diamond anniversaries of Confederation, respectively.[tpl]cite news| last=Canadian Heritage| title=Canada Day Background/How we got our national holiday| publisher=Canoe| url=http://www.canoe.ca/Canadiana/canday.html| accessdate=July 1, 2009[/tpl]
In 1946, Philéas Côté, a Quebec member of the House of Commons, introduced a private member's bill to rename Dominion Day as Canada Day.[tpl]Cite news| last=Carnegie| first=R.K.| title=Drew Right: Provinces Have Say-So On Holidays| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=15| date=April 19, 1946| ref=harv| postscript=.[/tpl] His bill was passed quickly by the House of Commons but was stalled by the Senate, which returned the bill to the Commons with the recommendation that the holiday be renamed The National Holiday of Canada, an amendment that effectively killed the bill.[tpl]Cite news| last=Editorial Board| title=A New Low in Compromise| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=August 10, 1946[/tpl]
Beginning in 1958, the Canadian government began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations. That year, then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker requested that Secretary of State Ellen Fairclough put together appropriate events, with a budget of $14,000. Parliament was traditionally in session on July 1, but Fairclough persuaded Diefenbaker and the rest of the federal Cabinet to attend. Official celebrations thereafter consisted usually of Trooping the Colour ceremonies on Parliament Hill in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display, though Fairclough, who became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, later expanded the bills to include performing folk and ethnic groups and the day became more casual and family oriented. Canada's centennial in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian patriotism and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in Ottawa were added and the fête became known as Festival Canada. After 1980, the Canadian government began to promote celebrating Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.
Some Canadians were, by the early 1980s, informally referring to the holiday as Canada Day.[tpl]#tag:ref|Numerous references to the term Canada Day may be found in issues of The Globe and Mail published in the late 1970s.[tpl]Cite news| title=Across Canada/Pro-Canada sign painter has brush with law| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=12| date=November 19, 1977| ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Cherry| first=Zena| title=Protocol chiefs gather to discuss their trade| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=27| date=February 20, 1978[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Stevens| first=Geoffrey| title=With many tongues| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=March 2, 1978[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Federal support for new festival| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=16| date=March 30, 1978[/tpl]|group=n|name=Name[/tpl] However, this practice did cause some controversy: Numerous politicians, journalists, and authors, such as Robertson Davies, decried the change at the time and some continue to maintain that it was illegitimate and an unnecessary break with tradition. Proponents argued that the name Dominion Day was a holdover from the colonial era, an argument given some impetus by the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, and others asserted that an alternative was needed as the term does not translate well into French. Conversely, these arguments were disputed by those who claimed Dominion was widely misunderstood and conservatively inclined commenters saw the change as part of a much larger attempt by Liberals to "re-brand" or re-define Canadian history.[tpl]cite journal| last=Bentley| first=D.M.R.| title=Essay 11: Parading Past|journal=Mnemographia Canadensis| year=1999| volume=1| issue=Muse and Recall| url=http://www.uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/architexts/mnemographia_canadensis/index.htm| accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title=We should be celebrating Dominion Day| url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=26cb959a-54c2-46e9-9aa2-d5738fae183b&k=22894|accessdate=July 11, 2011|newspaper=National Post[/tpl] Columnist Andrew Cohen called Canada Day a term of "crushing banality" and criticized it as "a renunciation of the past and a misreading of history, laden with political correctness and historical ignorance".[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=glcBcaMC6doC&pg=PA90| last=Cohen| first=Andrew| title=The Unfinished Canadian: The People We Are| year=2008| publisher=McClelland & Stewart Limited| page=90| isbn=978-0-7710-2286-9[/tpl]
The holiday was officially renamed as a result of a private member's bill that, on July 9, 1982, two years after receiving first reading in the House of Commons, there received third reading when only twelve Members of Parliament were present. (This was actually eight members less than a quorum, but, according to parliamentary rules, the quorum is enforceable only at the start of a sitting or when a member calls attention to it.[tpl]Cite book| last=Marleau| first=Robert| last2=Montpetit| first2=Camille| title=House of Commons Procedure and Practice| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=January 2000| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch09&Seq=3&Language=E| chapter=9.

It met with stronger resistance in the Senate—some Senators objected to the change of name; Ernest Manning, who argued that the rationale for the change was based on a misperception of the name, and George McIlraith, who did not agree with the manner in which the bill had been passed and urged the government to proceed in a more "dignified way"—but finally passed.[tpl]cite news| last=Sibley| first=Robert| title=The death of 'Dominion Day'| url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=849548fc-39c5-4714-964f-089d6866cff4| date=September 1, 2006| newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl] With the granting of Royal Assent, the name was officially changed to Canada Day on October 27, 1982.
As the anniversary of Confederation, Dominion Day, and later Canada Day, was the date set for a number of important events, such as the first national radio network hookup by the Canadian National Railway (1927); the inauguration of the CBC's cross-country television broadcast, with Governor General Vincent Massey's Dominion Day speech from Parliament Hill (1958); the flooding of the Saint Lawrence Seaway (1958); the first colour television transmission in Canada (1966); the inauguration of the Order of Canada (1967); and the establishment of "O Canada" as the country's national anthem (1980).
