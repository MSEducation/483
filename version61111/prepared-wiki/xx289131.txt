Archaeological discoveries in the old city centre, and at Vittoria the buried ruins of a tower dating back to the later Middle Ages, resulted in a slowdown of the construction work in the area and some design changes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ansaldo-sts.com/sites/ansaldosts.message-asp.com/files/imce/metro_brescia_eng.pdf |title=Brescia Subway |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ansaldo STS SpA |quote= |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
