This architecture is preferred in [[Reduced instruction set computing|reduced instruction 
set computer]]s (RISC) as they use a simpler instruction set.
A controller that uses this approach can operate at high speed; however, it has little flexibility, and the complexity of the instruction set it can implement is limited. 
The hardwired approach has become less popular as computers have evolved. Previously, control units for CPUs used ad-hoc logic, and they were difficult to design.

==Microprogram control unit==

The idea of microprogramming was introduced by Maurice Wilkes in 1951 as an intermediate level to execute computer program instructions. Microprograms were organized as a sequence of microinstructions and stored in special control memory. The algorithm for the microprogram control unit is usually specified by flowchart description.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Barkalov | first1 = Alexander | title = Logic synthesis for FSM based control units / Alexander Barkalov and Larysa Titarenko | year = 2009 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | isbn = 978-3-642-04308-6 | pages =  [/tpl] The main advantage of the microprogram control unit is the simplicity of its structure. Outputs of the controller are organized in microinstructions and  they can be easily replaced.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Wiśniewski | first1 = Remigiusz | title = Synthesis of compositional microprogram control units for programmable devices   | year = 2009 | publisher = University of Zielona Góra | location = Zielona Góra | isbn = 978-83-7481-293-1 | pages = 153 [/tpl]
