[[Maya River]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of the Sakha Republic

Maya River ([tpl]lang-ru|Майя[/tpl], or Мая) is a river in Khabarovsk Krai and Sakha, Russia. It is a right tributary of the Aldan River of the Lena basin. The length of the river is 1053 km. The area of its basin 171,000 km². The Maya River freezes up in late October and stays under the ice until May. The Yudoma River is one of the biggest tributaries of the Maya. The river is navigable within 500 km from its mouth.
The Maya was part of the river route from Yakutsk to the Okhotsk Coast.  Its course is approximately "V"-shaped. The upper Maya runs about 125 miles southwest parallel to the coast between the Dzhugdzhur Mountains and the Yudoma Plateau. About 50 miles from its source the Mati River comes in from the south. From the Mati either the Lama Portage or the Alanchak Portage led to the Ulya River and the coast. Near the southernmost point was the settlement of Nelkan from which a track led over the mountains to Ayan. The Maya flows west for perhaps 40 miles and receives the Maimakan River from the southwest. From here the river flows basically north about 200 miles, receives the Yudoma River from the east and joins the Aldan River at Ust-Maya. From Ust-Maya there was a horse-track to Yakutsk. Eastbound boats that reached Ust-Maya from the Lena River were replaced by smaller boats to continue up the Maya.
