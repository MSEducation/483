CATEGORIES: Chicken dishes, Soups, Traditional medicine, Noodle dishes

Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta (e.g., noodles, although almost any form can be used), dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup has also acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and flus, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.
Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for broiling or roasting) are often used to make soup; soup hens or fowl are to be preferred when available.

==Preparation==

The chicken flavor of the soup is most potent when the chicken is simmered in water with salt and only a few vegetables, such as an mirepoix of onion, carrots, and celery.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat off the top of the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup. In substitution of a whole chicken, a low sodium chicken stock can be used instead.

==Terminology==

Several terms are used when referring to chicken soups:

==Medicinal properties==

Chicken soup has long been touted as a form of folk medicine to treat symptoms of the common cold and related conditions. In 2000, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha studied the effect of chicken soup on the inflammatory response in vitro. They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit neutrophil migration, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect that could hypothetically lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rennard BO, Ertl RF, Gossman GL, Robbins RA, Rennard SI |title=Chicken soup inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro |journal=Chest |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=1150–7 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11035691 |doi= 10.1378/chest.118.4.1150|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11035691[/tpl] However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup in vivo effect is debatable. The New York Times reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that "none of the research is conclusive, and it's not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms."Parker-Pope, Tara (2007), “The Science of Chicken Soup” (Oct 12 issue).
It has also been shown that chicken soup contains the Amino acid cysteine,[tpl]cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-01-10/entertainment/9601100333_1_chicken-soup-respiratory-infections-cold-symptoms | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Bob | last=Condor | title=Strategies To Help You Survive The Cold Season | date=1996-01-10[/tpl] which is very similar to acetylcysteine, which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections to help clear them.

Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the Jewish kitchen. The 12th-century rabbi and physician Maimonides touted the benefits of chicken soup to one's health.Article: Chicken Soup-Culinary Poetry
Ashkenazi Jews were often very poor, but chicken-raising required few resources. Most Jewish families would try to acquire at least one chicken for Shabbat and try to make the most of it, using as much of the chicken as they could. Dishes such as chopped liver, helzel (stuffed chicken neck), gribenes (crackling made from fat and skin), pupik (roasted gizzards), p'tcha (chicken feet) were born of poverty-driven necessity. Chicken fat was rendered into schmaltz and used for cooking. The remaining carcass was used to prepare the soup.
The soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, was often served with kneidlach (matzah balls), kreplach (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel) (soup "nuts").

===United States and Canada===

In the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of "chicken noodle soup."[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mePkn5BLjLIC&pg=PA94 | title=The Food Industry Wars | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Michman, Ronald D.; Mazze, Edward M. | year=1998 | pages=94 | isbn=1567201113[/tpl] The term may have been coined in a commercial for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a "chicken soup with noodles", but when it was advertised on the Amos 'n' Andy radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as "chicken noodle soup"; Campbell's was preparing to discontinue the soup due to low sales. After the broadcast, letters began pouring in asking for Chicken noodle soup. Campbell's then changed the name of its soup. Several variations on chicken noodle (usually with the pasta in various shapes such as "ABCs" or stars) have made it one of Campbell's best-selling products.
