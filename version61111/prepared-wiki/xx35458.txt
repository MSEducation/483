It was first sung in late June in the same year in the city of Brașov, on the streets of Șchei quarter.Vasile Oltean - Imnul Național Deșteaptă-te, române!, Ed. Salco, Brașov, 2005, ISBN 973-87502-1-0 It was immediately accepted as the revolutionary anthem and renamed "Deșteaptă-te, române".
Since then, this song, which contains a message of liberty and patriotism, has been sung during all major Romanian conflicts, including during the 1989 anti-Ceaușist revolution. After that revolution, it became the national anthem, replacing the communist-era national anthem "Trei culori" ("Three colors").

==History of the anthem==

Since the uprisings of 1848, "Deșteaptă-te române" has been the most enduring national anthem of Romania. In the days following the state coup of August 23, 1944, when Romania turned against Nazi Germany and participated in the war along with the Allies, the song received heavy radio broadcast.
After the seizure of power by the communists on December 30, 1947, "Deșteaptă-te române" and other patriotic songs closely associated with the previous regime were outlawed. Ceaușescu's government permitted the song to be played and sung in public, but it was not given state recognition as the national anthem.
The overall message of the anthem is a "call to action"; it proposes a "now or never" urge for change present in many national anthems like the French revolutionary Marseillaise. This is the reason why Nicolae Bălcescu called it the "Romanian Marseillaise".

==Another anthem==

Besides this anthem, the Romanians also have "Hora Unirii" ("The Unity Hora (dance)"), written in 1855 by the poet Vasile Alecsandri (1821–1890), which was sung a great deal on the occasion of the Union of the Principalities (1859) and on all occasions when the Romanians aspired to union and harmony among themselves. "Hora Unirii" is sung on the Romanian folk tune of a slow but energetic round dance joined by the whole attendance. The round dance (hora) is itself an ancient ritual, symbolizing spiritual communion, equality and the Romanians' wish for a common life.

==Original verses in Romanian==

Romania's national anthem has eleven stanzas, although only the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 11th are sung on official occasions, as established by Romanian law.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] At major events, such as the National Holiday, the full version is sung, accompanied by 21 gun salute[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] when the President is present at the event.
