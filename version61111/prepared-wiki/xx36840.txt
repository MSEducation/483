==History==

===Post release===

Danny Lilker and Scott Ian had been the original founders of the band, but Ian elected to fire Lilker shortly after the release of the album.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl] 
As his replacement, the band hired drummer Charlie Benante's nephew, Frank Bello, who has played on every Anthrax album since. Vocalist Neil Turbin had contributed song ideas, lyrics, titles and arrangements to the majority of songs on the debut album, i.e. "Metal Thrashing Mad", "Deathrider", "Panic", "Subjugator, "Death from Above", "Soldiers of Metal", "Anthrax", as well as Spreading the Disease songs "Armed and Dangerous", "Gung Ho" and "Raise Hell", but both Scott Ian and Charlie Benante, who played guitar in addition to drums, felt they needed tighter control on the songwriting.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jammagazineonline.com/mf201303-Anthrax-Interview-Charlie-Benante-discussing-the-highs-and-lows-of-one-of%20metals-big-four-vinny-cecolini.aspx |title=Charlie Benante Discusses The Highs And Lows Of One Of Metal’s Big Four; Once our original vocalist Neil Turbin was out of the band. |publisher=Jammmagazineonline.com |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2013-03-31[/tpl] Due to a songwriting partnership between Ian and Benante, with Ian writing all the lyrics and Benante writing the music, Turbin was released from the band. Eddie Trunk admits in his book Eddie Trunk’s Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal: “Early on, I told Johnny Z that what I didn’t like about Anthrax was singer Neil Turbin’s vocals.”[tpl]cite book | last1 = Trunk | first1 = Eddie | title = Eddie Trunk’s Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal | chapter = Anthrax | publisher = Abrams | date = 30 August 2011 | location = New York, US | pages = 240 | accessdate = 2011-09-11[/tpl] He admits in his writing to pressuring Johnny Zazula and Anthrax into firing Turbin from the band.
The term "thrash metal" was used for the first time in the music press by UK's Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome, while making a reference to the song "Metal Thrashing Mad".[tpl]cite book |last1=Dome |first1=Malcolm |title=Kerrang! |chapter=Anthrax 'Fistful Of Metal' |volume=62 |publisher=Spotlight Publications Ltd. |date=23 February 1984 |location=London, UK |pages=8 |accessdate=2012-03-10[/tpl]
