The Multiple Use - Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (or MUSYA) (Public Law 86-517) is a federal law passed by the United States Congress on June 12, 1960. This law authorizes and directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop and administer the renewable resources of timber, range, water, recreation and wildlife on the national forests for multiple use and sustained yield of the products and services.
This is the first law to have the five major uses of national forests contained in one law equally, with no use greater than any other.Godfrey, Anthony The Ever-Changing View-A History of the National Forests in California USDA Forest Service Publishers, 2005 p. 399
By the 1950s, the national forests no longer held enough resources to meet the  growing needs of an increasing population and expanding economy. The U.S. Forest Service had operated within broad authorities since Gifford Pinchot's time as Chief Forester. Now, for the first time the agency had a specific congressional directive which stipulated that economic return was not in all cases to be the limiting factor.Steen, Harold K. The United States Forest Service, A History University of Washington Press 1976 pp. 199-200
MUSYA defines the terms "multiple use" and "sustained yield" as follows:
In 1996, this law was amended by P.L. 104-333.
