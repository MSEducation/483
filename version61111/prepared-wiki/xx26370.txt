The Washington Wild Things are a professional baseball team based in the Pittsburgh suburb of Washington, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The Wild Things are a member of the East Division of the Frontier League, an independent baseball league which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. From the 2002 season to the present, the Wild Things have played their home games at Consol Energy Park.

==History==

From 1997 to 2001, the franchise played in Canton, Ohio, and was known as the Canton Crocodiles.  The Crocodiles won the Frontier League championship in their inaugural year of 1997, defeating the Evansville Otters in the Championship Series.  Canton broadcaster Tom Delamater authored a book about the championship season titled "Crocodiles Rock!"
In 2002, the Crocodiles were purchased and relocated to Washington, Pennsylvania.  Now playing as the Washington Wild Things, the Wild Things opened new Falconi Field with a bang as they established a League Record for wins in a single season and took the powerful East Division crown. The Wild Things would go on to reach the playoffs in each of their first six seasons, setting the Frontier League single-season win mark twice.
