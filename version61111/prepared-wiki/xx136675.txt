[[AOL search data leak]]

The AOL search data leak was the release of detailed search logs by AOL of a large number of AOL users. The release was intentional and intended for research purposes; however, the public release meant that the entire Internet could see the results, rather than a select number of academics.  AOL did not redact any information, causing privacy concerns since users could potentially be identified by their searches.

==Overview==

On August 4, 2006, AOL Research, headed by Dr. Abdur Chowdhury, released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by the 7th, but not before it had been mirrored and distributed on the Internet. 
AOL themselves did not identify users in the report; however,  personally identifiable information was present in many of the queries, and as the queries were attributed by AOL to particular user accounts, identified numerically, an individual could be identified and matched to their account and search history by such information.
The New York Times was able to locate an individual from the released and anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings.[ref]

Consequently, the ethical implications of using this data for research are under debate.
AOL acknowledged it was a mistake and removed the data.  However, the removal was too late; the data was redistributed by others, and can still be downloaded from mirror sites.[tpl]cite news|title=AOL apologizes for release of user search data|url=http://news.cnet.com/AOL-apologizes-for-release-of-user-search-data/2100-1030_3-6102793.html?tag=nefd.top|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=August 7, 2006|author=Dawn Kawamoto|author2=Elinor Mills[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=AOL search data mirrors|url=http://gregsadetsky.com/aol-data/|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl]

==Lawsuits==

In September 2006, a class action lawsuit was filed against AOL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

==Notable users==

Although the searchers were only identified by a numeric ID, some people's search results have become notable due to various reasons.

===Thelma Arnold===

Through clues revealed in the search queries, the New York Times successfully uncovered the identities of several searchers. With her permission, they exposed user #4417749 as Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow from Lilburn, Georgia.[tpl]cite web|title=A Face Is Exposed for AOL Searcher No. 4417749|url=http://search-logs.com/user/4417749-thelma_arnold|accessdate=August 12, 2013[/tpl] This privacy breach was widely reported, and led to the resignation of AOL's CTO, Maureen Govern, on August 21, 2006. The media quoted an insider as saying that two employees had been fired: the researcher who released the data, and his immediate supervisor, who reported to Govern.AOL executive quits after posting of search data - International Herald Tribune

===User 927===

One product of the AOL scandal was the proliferation of blog entries examining the exposed data.  Certain users' search logs were identified as humorous, disturbing, or even dangerous.[ref]

Consumer watchdog website The Consumerist posted a blog entry by editor Ben Popken identifying the anonymous user number 927AOL user #927 as having an especially bizarre and macabre search history.[ref]
</ref>
The blog posting has since been viewed nearly 4,000 times and referenced on a number of other high-profile sites.  In addition to sparking the interest of the Internet community, User 927 inspired a theatrical production, written by Katharine Clark Gray in Philadelphia. The play, also named User 927, has since been cited on several of the same blogs that originally discovered the real user's existence.[ref]
