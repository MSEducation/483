"When I Think Of You" is the third single released from ex-Blue member Lee Ryan's debut solo album, Lee Ryan. The song peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, but unlike his other singles, was a commercial failure. This led to the final single from the album, "Real Love", not being released in the UK.
