</ref> consisting of a partially evacuated glass tube containing three [[electrode]]s; a heated [[Electrical filament|filament]], a [[grid (electricity)|grid]], and a [[Plate electrode|plate]].<ref name="Godfrey" /> It is important in the [[history of technology]] because it was the first widely used tube which could [[amplifier|amplify]]; a small electrical signal applied to the grid could control a larger current flowing from the filament to plate.<ref name="Godfrey" /><ref name="Newnes" /> Unlike later [[vacuum tube]]s, the primitive Audion had a small amount of gas in the tube, thought to be necessary by De Forest, which limited the dynamic range and gave it nonlinear characteristics and erratic performance.<ref name="Okamura" /><ref name="Lee" /> Originally intended as a radio receiver [[detector (radio)|detector]]<ref name="De Forest" /> by adding a grid electrode to the [[Fleming valve]], it found little use until its amplifying ability was recognized and used in transcontinental telephony around 1912 by several researchers,<ref name="Lee" /><ref name="Nebeker">
