==Career==

===1980s===

Plimpton began her career as a model, securing an early 1980s campaign for Calvin Klein, making an impression as a sophisticated but tomboyish little girl. She made her screen debut in 1981, when at age 11 she had a small part in the film Rollover. In 1984, she appeared in the Deep South drama The River Rat opposite Tommy Lee Jones. Her breakthrough performance was as Stef Steinbrenner in the 1985  film The Goonies. She also appeared that year on the television sitcom Family Ties.
This began a trend of Plimpton being typecast in the role of a rebellious tomboy, beginning with her critically lauded performance as the Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory)'s daughter in the 1986 film The Mosquito Coast, starring Harrison Ford. The critically praised but commercially unsuccessful 1987 film Shy People (co-starred with Barbara Hershey and Jill Clayburgh) was followed by a performance in the 1988 ensemble comedy Stars and Bars. This was released shortly before Running on Empty, an Academy Award-nominated film starring River Phoenix, for which she was nominated for a Young Artist Award.
She began a career trend, making small independent film appearances with supporting roles in big-budget films. She appeared in the 1989 Woody Allen film Another Woman; that year, she co-starred with Jami Gertz as a cancer patient in the German film Zwei Frauen (released in America as Silence Like Glass). The film was nominated for Outstanding Feature Film at the German Film Awards. Plimpton shaved her head to play a cancer patient in Zwei Frauen, and her reputation for playing rebellious teenagers secured her the role of the indignant teenage daughter (who shaves her head) of Dianne Wiest in Parenthood.  Plimpton appeared with Joaquin Phoenix (then credited as Leaf Phoenix), who portrayed her brother. Parenthood grossed over $126 million and received two Academy Award nominations, her most successful movie appearance since The Goonies.

She appeared with Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the television film Daybreak and was a part of the largely improvised television film Chantilly Lace. She had a featured role in the big-budget films Josh and S.A.M. and played the lead in the critically blasted film adaptation of the Carolyn Chute novel The Beans of Egypt, Maine. Plimpton also appeared as herself in the independent film My Life's in Turnaround, a movie about filmmakers trying to make a movie.
Plimpton continued to appear in featured roles in both independent films and mainstream movies from 1994 through 1997, most notably as a close friend of radical feminist Valerie Solanas in the film I Shot Andy Warhol.
In 1997, the Showtime Network cast Plimpton as the female lead in the television film, The Defenders: Payback. This show was a retooling of the classic television show by the same name, and the characters were descendants of Lawrence Preston, a role reprised by actor E.G. Marshall. The intent was to spin the program off as a series akin to Law & Order, but Marshall died in 1998. Two more episodes (The Defenders: Choice of Evils and The Defenders: Taking the First) were aired that year. The decision was made to not continue production (despite high ratings and critical praise) due to Marshall's death. [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
