The City Island Bridge is a bridge in the New York City borough of the Bronx, connecting City Island and Rodman's Neck on the mainland. It opened for traffic in 1901.

==Existing bridge==

This bridge is of stone and steel construction, and spans [tpl]convert|950|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl].  Construction began in 1899 and completed in 1901, at a cost of $200,000.[tpl]cite news |title=The New City Island Bridge.

==Planned replacement bridge==

===Design===

The city plans to demolish the bridge, due to its deteriorated condition, and replace it with a cable-stayed bridge. The current design calls for a [tpl]convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high tower, [tpl]convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wide at the top, with a base of [tpl]convert|26|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Vertical clearance above high water would be [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite news |title=Here Comes the Bridge |first=Barbara |last=Dolensek |url=http://www.theislandcurrent.com/Island_Currents/12j-Is.%20Current%20April%202005.pdf |newspaper=The Island Current |location=City Island |date=April 2005 |accessdate=2009-09-11[/tpl] The new bridge would be located in the same footprint as the existing bridge, although it would be [tpl]convert|17|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] wider to accommodate three standard-width traffic lanes, a bicycle lane and a pedestrian walkway.

===Construction schedule and costs===

The original schedule was for the project to begin in 2007 with completion in 2010. The project was then postponed until June 2012.[tpl]rp|104-106[/tpl]NYCDOT (2004). "2003 Bridges and Tunnels Annual Condition Report." p. 36. Accessed 2009-09-11. Due to the project postponement, during 2010 repairs were made to the existing bridge deck, piers, and west abutment.[tpl]rp|140[/tpl] Due to a lack of funding the project was delayed once more until the city announced it would accept bids in late 2012, with Tutor Perini selected as general contractor in February 2013.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfvbj.com/news/2013/feb/21/hurricane-sandy-drives-tutor-perini-results/| title=Hurricane Sandy Drives Tutor Perini Results| work=San Fernando Valley Business Journal| author=Joel Russell| date=21 February 2013| accessdate=2013-06-14[/tpl]
As of 2005 the estimated cost of the project was $50 million.H. Perahia, L. King, K. Batra, S. Jarosz (2005). "City Island Cable-Stayed Bridge in New York City."

===Opposition===

Some residents oppose the design of the proposed bridge and feel that its tower would be out of character with the low-rise homes on City Island.[tpl]cite news |last=Bindley |first=Katherine |title=In the 'Nantucket of New York,' a Bridge to Agitation  |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 14, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/nyregion/thecity/16brid.html |accessdate=2009-08-15[/tpl] Opponents of the new bridge design filed a lawsuit against the city on November 6, 2013. A Bronx Supreme Court judge granted a temporary injunction on that date.[tpl]cite news |last=Slattery |first=Denis |date=2013-11-08 |title=City Island residents sue to block $102 million, 180-foot-tall bridge to mainland Bronx |url=http://nydn.us/1cJm2QJ |newspaper=New York Daily News[/tpl] In December 2013 the court lifted the injunction, but ruled that the city must conduct public hearings.[tpl]cite news |last=Slattery |first=Denis |date=2013-12-27 |title=City Islanders hail ruling on proposed bridge as minor victory over city |url=http://nydn.us/KaYE2j |newspaper=New York Daily News[/tpl] The city's prior consultations with the island community, which began during the early design stages, had been informal.
