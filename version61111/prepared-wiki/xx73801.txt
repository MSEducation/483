==Development and portrayals==

Takei recalled Gene Roddenberry wanted the character to represent all of Asia, which symbolized the peace of the Trek universe in spite of the numerous wars in the continent. Roddenberry did not want a nationally specific surname, so he looked at a map and saw the Sulu Sea. "He thought, 'Ah, the waters of that sea touch all shores'," the actor recalled, "and that's how my character came to have the name Sulu."Takei on how Sulu got his name (Archive of American Television 2004 interview)[tpl]cite news | author = Michael Simpson | title = John Cho Will Be a Great Sulu In 'Star Trek XI', Says George Takei | publisher = Cinema Spy | date = 2008-04-30 | url = http://www.cinemaspy.ca/article.php?id=871 | accessdate=2008-05-06[/tpl]George Takei, Mr. Sulu of Star Trek, Comes Out and Speaks Out
In the book Inside Star Trek: The Real Story, the character's name is noted as a pun on the name of vice president of Desilu Studios, Herb Solow.[tpl]cite book|last=Solow|first=Herbert|authorlink=Herbert Franklin Solow|coauthors=Robert Justman|title=Inside Star Trek The Real Story|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=June 1997|pages=78–79|isbn=0-671-00974-5[/tpl]
Novelist Vonda McIntyre first presents 'Hikaru' as the character's first name in the novel The Entropy Effect.[tpl]cite book|title=The Entropy Effect|last=McIntyre|first=Vonda N.|authorlink=Vonda McIntyre|isbn=0-671-83692-7|date=June 1981|publisher=Pocket Books[/tpl] McIntyre derived the character's first name from The Tale of Genji.  Although McIntyre was unaware at the time of any controversy surrounding her giving Sulu a first name, editor David Hartwell had to clear the name with Gene Roddenberry and Takei in order to supersede Paramount's objections.[tpl]cite news|url=http://io9.com/5574037/how-the-first-star-trek-novel-was-written|title=How One of the First Star Trek Novels Was Written|last=McIntyre|first=Vonda|date=2010-07-02|work=io9|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=2 July 2010[/tpl] However, the name did not become canon until its mention in Star Trek VI, and it was included only after Peter David, who authored the film's comic book adaptation, visited the set and persuaded director Nicholas Meyer to insert it.[tpl]cite journal|title=Comics Buyer's Guide|issue=1614|page=10|date=March 2006[/tpl]
The name 'Sulu' cannot be used in Japanese due to the language's lack of the "L" phoneme.  Sulu's family name was therefore changed to 'Kato' in the Japanese dub.

==Reception==

Robert Justman, co-producer of the original Star Trek series, noted that Takei had previously played bad guys, but through Star Trek had become one of the first Asian actors to portray an Asian character in a positive light. Justman described him as "the antithesis of the so-called expressionless-unemotional-inscrutable Asian".

===2009 film===

John Cho portrays a young Sulu for the 2009 film Star Trek. J. J. Abrams was concerned about casting a Korean-American as the character, but Takei explained to the director that Sulu was meant to represent all of Asia on the Enterprise, so Abrams went ahead with Cho.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/010921-Takei-2.html|title=From 'Trek' to 'Wars', Part 2: George Takei on Star Trek|author=Steve Fritz|work=Newsarama|date=2009-01-21|accessdate=2009-01-22[/tpl] Cho acknowledged being an Asian-American, "There are certain acting roles that you are never going to get, and one of them is playing a cowboy. Playing Sulu is a realization of that dream — going into space." He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training.[tpl]cite news | title = John Cho: Sulu Is A Badass | work = TrekMovie | date = 2007-12-16 | url = http://trekmovie.com/2007/12/16/john-cho-sulus-a-badass/ | accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl] Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, although a representative noted it was "no big deal".[tpl]cite news | author = Anthony Pascale | title = Cho Injured On Trek Set | work = TrekMovie | date = 2008-03-17 | url = http://trekmovie.com/2008/03/17/cho-injured-on-trek-set-talks-a-bit-of-trek/ | accessdate=2008-03-19[/tpl] James Kyson Lee was interested in the part, but because Zachary Quinto was cast as Spock, the producers of the TV show Heroes did not want to lose another cast member for three months.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Cho portrays a younger Sulu in the 2009 film, though he is actually older than Takei was when he portrayed the role in the original series; Cho was 36 while Takei was 29.
Cho also portrays Sulu in the 2013 sequel Star Trek Into Darkness, taking up the role of acting captain on the USS Enterprise when both Kirk and Spock were absent.
