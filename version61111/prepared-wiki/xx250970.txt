==History and origin==

The name Singiwala is derived from a combination of two Hindi words, the singi which refers to a conical brass pipe with a wide mouth and wala which means holder. The Singi  pipe is used to suck impure blood from wounds. They are divided into twelve and half exogamous clans, the main ones being the Sauda, Nakpulla, Pardesi, Dilwali, Savara, Kalandar, Gyarah Donbde, Teli, Mewadi and Radi. All the clans have equal status, and there is no concept of hypergamy. A section of the Singiwala emigrated to Haryana in the 18th Century and now form a distinct community known as Singikat.People of India Rajasthan Volume XXXVIII Part Two edited by B.K Lavania, D.
