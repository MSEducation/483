==History==

Kugahara Station was opened on June 20, 1960 as a station on the Japanese National Railways (JNR) Kihara Line. With the division and privatization of the Japan National Railways on April 1, 1987, the station was acquired by the East Japan Railway Company. On March 24, 1988, the Kihara Line became the Isumi Railroad Isumi Line. Since July 1, 2009 the station has been nicknamed Saniku Gakuin Kugahara after a local collage, and the station signage has been changed to reflect this.
