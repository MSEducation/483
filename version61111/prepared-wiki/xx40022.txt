==Biography==

===Early years & breakthrough (1991–2002)===

In 1991, Spider dropped out of art school, bought a cheap 4-track home studio and drum machine and recorded Much Evil with producer Lamar Lowder. Building on local success, Powerman 5000 was born. In 1993, longtime guitarist Adam 12 joined the band. In 1994 and 1995, Powerman released two independent records, True Force and The Blood-Splat Rating System.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200678/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Biography of Powerman 5000 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] Both albums were local successes. In 1996, they performed on the second stage of Ozzfest and appeared in an episode of Beverly Hills, 90210 where David and Donna filmed a music video for their song "Strike the Match".
In 1997, the band signed to Dreamworks Records and released a remastered edition of The Blood-Splat Rating System titled Mega!! Kung Fu Radio. The band toured, performing on the main stage at Ozzfest 1997 but have not appeared since. They released singles such as "Organizized" and "Tokyo Vigilante #1". In 1999, guitarist M.33 (Mike Tempesta) joined the band as they got their biggest break. Creating a strange fusion of science fiction and "Action Rock", they released Tonight the Stars Revolt!, which contained the hit singles "When Worlds Collide", "Nobody's Real", and "Supernova Goes Pop". The album sold over a million copies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://musicmight.com/artist/usa/powerman+5000 |title=Biography of Powerman 5000 |accessdate=2009-03-03 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=MusicMight[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
A follow-up album to Tonight the Stars Revolt! was released titled Anyone for Doomsday?. The album was recorded and a single, "Bombshell", had been released to radio stations. But the album was canceled just before its scheduled release. Anyone for Doomsday? was later released under Spider's own new label, Megatronic Records, but went out of print due to legal issues. Arguments exist as to whether the record was canceled due to the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the negative title, but the album was finished and scheduled to be released in August 2001, one full month before the attacks. Spider has said in interviews that the album was dropped because it sounded too much like the previous album and that he wanted to release something fresh and different instead of repeating himself. Conflicts thereafter caused longtime members Dorian 27 (Dorian Heartsong) and Al3 (Allen Pahanish) to leave the band. Ad7 (Adrian Ost) and Siggy Sjursen were brought in to replace them.
One of the greatest mainstream exposures to the band came from their original remake of the 1980s club hit "Relax", originally by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The recrafted version was featured prominently during the credit roll for the 2001 comedy film Zoolander, and helped spread the band's appeal.

===Transform & Destroy What You Enjoy (2003–2007)===

In 2003, the band released Transform, a more punk-fueled album, completely dropping the costumes that had been featured throughout the band's Tonight The Stars Revolt! era. Containing the hit singles "Free" and "Action", Transform relied less on industrial metal effects. After the album's release, Dreamworks Records was bought out by Interscope Records, and had stopped promoting the band in the middle of a tour and would not explain the surroundings of what was going on, Powerman 5000 was not asked to make the move to Interscope. Undeterred, Spider continued with his own offshoot label, Megatronic Records. In 2005 new music was released, under Spider's new label, in the form of a rarities album titled The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Vol. 1. In August 2005, Powerman 5000 performed at the 6th annual Gathering of the Juggalos on the main stage.
A new tour was also started, but M.33 had been kicked out of the band for starting fights and Adam 12, while present on the album, was not touring. Former Alien Ant Farm guitarist Terry Corso and former Halfcocked, (the first band on Spider's label), guitarist Johnny Rock Heatley were brought in to round out the live show. The band then signed to DRT Entertainment, who released the album entitled Destroy What You Enjoy on August 1, 2006. The song "Wild World" was the first single on the album. The band also filmed a music video for the single "Wild World".
In 2007, Evan Rodaniche, singer and guitarist of Los Angeles band Cage9 (originally from Panama City, Panama), joined the band through his acquaintance with Adrian Ost. He toured as the band's sole guitarist until later that year, when Dave Pino was added to the mix. Pino had just moved to Los Angeles and heard about the open slot through his friendship with Piggy D (bassist for Rob Zombie). Upon the departure of Siggy from the band in 2008, Gustavo Aued was brought in to replace him on bass, and later that year, drummer Gordon Heckaman joined the band (both originally from Cage9 as well), solidifying the lineup for the next album.

===Somewhere on the Other Side of Nowhere (2007–2011)===

On May 21, 2007, Powerman 5000 claimed via a MySpace blog post that they will be releasing a new studio album in 2007. The following is taken directly from said post: "Considering the bands track record of putting out cds once every three years it seems hard to believe that, yes we will put out a new disc in 2007!! It's all just beginning to develop and the wheres, whos and whats are to be determined but new rock is on the way!!" However, talk about the record soon simmered, and no new information was released.
