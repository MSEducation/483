Antoine de Rivarol (26 June 1753 – 11 April 1801) was a Royalist French writer during the Revolutionary era.
Rivarol was born in Bagnols, Languedoc. It appears that his father, an innkeeper, was a cultivated man. The son assumed the title of comte de Rivarol, asserting a connection with a noble Italian family, but his enemies said his name was really Riverot and that he was not of a noble family. After various vicissitudes, he went to Paris in 1777 and won some academic prizes. In 1784, his Discours sur l'universalité de la langue française and his translation of Dante's Inferno were favourably noted. The year before the French Revolution broke out, he and a certain Champcenetz published a lampoon, titled Petit Almanach de nos grands hommes pour 1788, that ridiculed without pity a number of writers of proven or future talent, along with a great many nobodies."Antoine de Rivarol," Nation 32.834 (23 June 1881): 438–439.
Rivarol was the foremost journalist, commentator and epigrammatist among that faction of aristocrats which was most uncompromisingly reactionary: he heaped scorn upon republicanism and defended the Ancien Régime.[tpl]Cite book |title=The French Revolution |last=Lefebvre |first=Georges |year=1962 |volume=1 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn= |page=141 |url= |accessdate= |quote= [/tpl]
Rivarol's writing was published in the Journal politique of Antoine Sabatier de Castres and the Actes des Apotres of Jean Gabriel Peltier. He left France in 1792, first settling in Brussels, then moving successively to London, Hamburg, and Berlin, where he died .
Rivarol's rivals in France – in sharp conversational sayings – included Alexis Piron and Nicolas Chamfort.
His brother, Claude François (1762–1848), was also an author. His works include a novel, Isman, ou le fatalisme (1795); a comedy, Le Véridique (1827); and the history Essai sur les causes de la révolution française (1827).
