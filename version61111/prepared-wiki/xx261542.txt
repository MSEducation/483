==Design and development==

The MB.36 was a parasol-wing monoplane flying-boat for use as either a bomber or commercial transport. It was powered by three [tpl]convert|420|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] Gnome-Rhône 9Ad Jupiter radial engines. The prototype, registered F-AKEJ, was a 10-seat commercial variant, designed in 1926 but did not fly until 15 May 1930 because of financial difficulties. By the time of the MB.36 first flight, the company had been taken over by the ANF Mureaux company. After the flying-boat lost a stabilizing float during official tests, and because of poor performance the project was abandoned and the MB.36 scrapped.
