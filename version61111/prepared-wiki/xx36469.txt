Her first kiss was with Fred Savage in an episode of The Wonder Years."Danica McKellar". Maxim. February 1, 2010. Retrieved July 19, 2013.

Her first book, Math Doesn't Suck: How to Survive Middle School Math without Losing Your Mind or Breaking a Nail, was a New York Times bestseller, and was favorably reviewed by Tara C. Smith, the founder of Iowa Citizens for Science and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Iowa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/danica_mckelllars_math_doesnt.php|title= Aetiology:Danica McKellar's "Math Doesn't Suck"|accessdate=2007-07-26|last=Smith|first=Tara|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=2007-07-24|work=Aetiology|publisher=ScienceBlogs[/tpl] The book also received a review from Anthony Jones, writing for the School Librarian journal, who described the book as "a trouble-shooting guide to help girls overcome their biggest maths challenges," noting what he described as "real-world examples of great mathematics in action." In an interview with Smith, McKellar said that she wrote the book "to show girls that math is accessible and relevant, and even a little glamorous" and to counteract "damaging social messages telling young girls that math and science aren't for them".[tpl]cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/07/interview_with_math_whiz_autho.php |title=Interview with math whiz, author, and actress Danica McKellar|accessdate=2007-07-26|last=Smith|first=Tara|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=2007-07-25|work=Aetiology |publisher=ScienceBlogs[/tpl]
