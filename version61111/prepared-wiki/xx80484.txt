In mathematics, the term mapping, usually shortened to map, refers to either
There are also a few, less common uses in logic and graph theory.

==Maps as functions==

In many branches of mathematics, the term map is used to mean a function, sometimes with a specific property of particular importance to that branch.  For instance, a "map" is a continuous function in topology, a linear transformation in linear algebra, etc. 
Some authors, such as Serge Lang,[tpl]citation|first=Serge|last=Lang|title=Linear Algebra|edition=2nd|year=1971|page=83|publisher=Addison-Wesley[/tpl] use "function" only to refer to maps in which the range is a set of numbers, i.e., the fields R or C, and the term mapping for more general functions.
Sets of maps of special kinds are the subjects of many important theories: see for instance Lie group, mapping class group, permutation group.
In the theory of dynamical systems, a map denotes an evolution function used to create discrete dynamical systems. See also Poincaré map.
A partial map is a partial function, and a total map is a total function.  Related terms like domain, codomain, injective, continuous, etc. can be applied equally to maps and functions, with the same meaning.  All these usages can be applied to "maps" as general functions or as functions with special properties.
In the communities surrounding programming languages that treat functions as first class citizens, a map often refers to the binary higher-order function that takes a function ƒ and a list v0,v1,...,vn as arguments and returns ƒ(v0),ƒ(v1),...,ƒ(vn), s.t. n ≥ 0.

==Maps as morphisms==

In category theory, "map" is often used as a synonym for morphism or arrow, thus for something more general than a function.[tpl]citation|title=An Introduction to Category Theory|first=H.|last=Simmons|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781139503327|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VOCQUC_uiWgC&pg=PA2[/tpl].

==Other uses==

===In logic===

In formal logic, the term is sometimes used for a functional predicate, whereas a function is a model of such a predicate in set theory.

===In graph theory===

In graph theory, a map is a drawing of a graph on a surface without overlapping edges (an embedding). If the surface is a plane then a map is a planar graph, similar to a political map.[tpl]citation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|title=Graph Theory and its applications|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-3982-0|page=294[/tpl]
