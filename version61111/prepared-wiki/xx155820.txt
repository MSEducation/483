CATEGORIES: Tai Po District, Populated places in Hong Kong

Sha Lan Tsuen (Chinese: 沙欄村) is a small village in Hong Kong, to the east of the Tai Po New Town. Its village mainly comprises the Lee family of the Hakka origin and they have been living there for more than a century.
It is a rural village of Hong Kong and is presently seeing major changes in construction of new flats and new roads. The village is based along the coastline of the New Territories district of Hong Kong and has a small beach. The area to which Sha Lan Tsuen belongs, Shuen Wan (船灣), due to being in the rural and having beautiful coastline scenery, has attracted many wealthy Estate Companies to build luxury flats that spans right across the whole area. One such projects is "The Beverly Hills" estate owned by the Henderson Land Development Group. The luxury flats boast a magnificent scenery and costs more than HK$10,000,000. Although socially upgrading the area, it has somewhat spoilt the natural landscape and overcrowded the whole area, according to local people living in the village.
