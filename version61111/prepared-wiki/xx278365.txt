===Escape===

Poparić escaped with Adrian Albrecht, a Swiss man accused of robbery, arson, and money laundering. The escape involved two accomplices outside of the prison who rammed the prison gate and subdued the guards by firing AK-47s. The guards were armed with "simple handguns", to which the AK-47s were superior.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2379097/Notorious-Pink-Panther-jewel-thief-escapes-prison-freed-raiders-armed-AK-47s.html | title=Notorious 'Pink Panther' jewel thief escapes from prison after being freed by raiders armed with AK-47s | work=Daily Mail | date=26 July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Mccan, Jaymi[/tpl] Poparić and Albrecht then climbed over the barbed wire with ladders brought by the accomplices,[tpl]cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/26/world/europe/switzerland-prison-break | title=[tpl]-'[/tpl]Pink Panther' escapes in armed Swiss prison break with fellow inmate | work=CNN | date=26 July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | author=Vandoorne, Saskya and Smith-Spark, Laura[/tpl] got into a van, and left.
