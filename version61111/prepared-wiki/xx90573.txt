Clarence Josef McLin Jr. (May 31, 1921 – December 28, 1988), known as C.J. McLin, was an American politician of the Ohio Democratic party. McLin's father was civic leader C. J. "Mac" McLin Sr.
McLin's family moved to Dayton, Ohio in 1931, where he attended Dunbar High School and worked at the family business, the McLin Funeral Home, founded by his father. As a youth, McLin filed a civil rights lawsuit against McCrory's, a dime store at Fourth and Main streets in Dayton, for the store's refusal to serve him because of his race. McLin was drafted by the U.S. Army and served for three years, until 1949. While in the army, McLin protested for equal treatment of African-American service members. 
Active in his community throughout his life, McLin decided to run for state representative in 1966 following race riots in the Dayton area and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He won, and was seated in 1967, in what would be the first of eleven consecutive terms.Democrats look to hold edge By 1986, his health was failing, and many contemplated his political future.Dayton's McLin back in House
