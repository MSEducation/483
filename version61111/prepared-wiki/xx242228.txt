The Calgary Roughnecks are a lacrosse team based in Calgary playing in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The 2010 season was the 9th in franchise history. 
Despite winning the Champion's Cup last season, the Roughnecks lost both their head coach and an assistant coach to the Toronto Rock. Former assistant coach Terry Sanderson resigned and was hired as the Rock's new GM, and Sanderson immediately persuaded his former boss in Calgary Troy Cordingley to take the job of head coach of the Rock. Assistant coach Dave Pym was named the new Roughnecks head coach.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/article.php?id=4014|title=Roughnecks Announce Coaching Changes|date=July 8, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-19|work=NLL.com[/tpl] In addition, former player Curt Malawsky announced his retirement from playing and was hired as both Assistant General Manager and Assistant Coach.
