==History==

The origins of Norwich trace to the establishment of the first permanent home in 1825. By the 1880s the area developed as an industrial village, with foundries and factories such as the Norwich Twine Mill and the Harris Hardwood Company. Annexed to Roanoke in 1919, the area since the 1960s has remained primarily residential in character, with some areas of industrial infill on the periphery. Most homes in the Norwich community were built in 1900.  Formed in 1996, the Norwich Neighborhood Alliance serves as the citizen advocacy group for the neighborhood.
