[[List of former Nazi Party members]]

CATEGORIES: Nazis, Lists of people by ideology, Nazi Germany, Nazi-related lists

The list of notable people who were at some point members of the Nazi Party, before it was declared illegal and disbanded upon the victory of the Allies. After 1945 many former party members had to go through a process of denazification and some were indicted and convicted at the Nuremberg Trials, or other trials, notably for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Many others evaded capture or managed to escape, in particular with the help of the ODESSA organization. In the mid-1950s, most people convicted during these trials were given amnesty and subsequently released.
Some former party members managed to obtain very important positions in West Germany after the war (e.g. Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor of West Germany from 1966 to 1969), others were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency after the war as part of the Gehlen Organization, predecessor of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). In East Germany, the Stasi, the GDR's intelligence service, was alleged to have employed several chief informers and agents who were former SS and Gestapo operatives.Book Claims Stasi Employed Nazis as Spies, ''Deutsche Welle, 31.10.2005
