The Alaotra Grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), also known as Delacour's Little Grebe or Rusty Grebe, is an extinct grebe that was endemic to Lake Alaotra and surrounding lakes in Madagascar.

==Description==

The grebe was about [tpl]convert|25|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite book|title=Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=40jA0MOWejIC&pg=PA649&dq=Alaotra+grebe&hl=en&ei=wH39S8H3M4XJcbHW0d8B&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Alaotra%20grebe&f=false|year=2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|isbn=0-7614-7194-4|page=649[/tpl] Its ability to fly long distances was restricted because of its small wings.

==History==

The species declined in the course of the 20th century, mainly because of habitat destruction, entanglement with monofilament gillnets and predation by the introduced snakehead murrel (Channa striata).Andrianandrasana, Herizo T.; Randriamahefasoa, Jonah; Durbin, Joanna; Lewis, Richard E. and Ratsimbazafy, Jonah H.

[tpl]DOI|10.1007/s10531-005-8413-y[/tpl] Also, the few remaining birds increasingly hybridized with Little Grebes which use the wetlands as a migration stopover site; as the species differed in several key aspects, the hybrid birds may have suffered from decreased fitness, to the detriment of the rufolavatus gene pool.Madagascar: Environment Profile[tpl]cite journal|author=Butchart SHM, AJ Stattersfield & TM Brooks|title=Going or gone: defining 'Possibly Extinct' species to give a truer picture of recent extinctions| journal=Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club|year=2006|volume=126A|pages=7–24|url=http://bi154.dhcp.ttu.edu/extinction/butchart+al06.pdf[/tpl]
The Madagascan Pochard, which also lived on Lake Alaotra, was thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in 2006.http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/11/madagascar_pochard_redisc.html Unlike this species, however, the grebe had poor powers of dispersal and was never found elsewhere.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

This extinction brought the number of confirmed bird extinctions since 1600 AD to 162. The previous confirmed extinction of a bird species was of the Liverpool Pigeon (Caloenas maculata) in 2008.
