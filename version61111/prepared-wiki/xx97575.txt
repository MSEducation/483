Dunking is a form of corporeal punishment used in the medieval and Early Modern period.

==As trial==

Ordeal by water was associated with the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries: an accused who sank was considered innocent, while floating indicated witchcraft. These tests came to be part of what is known as the Salem Witch Trials. Some argued that witches floated because they had renounced baptism when entering the Devil's service. King James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England) claimed in his Daemonologie that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty. 
The ordeal would normally be conducted with a rope holding the subject connected to assistants sitting in a boat or the like, so that the person being tested could be pulled up if he/she did not float; the notion that the ordeal was flatly devised as a situation without any possibility of live acquittal, even if the outcome was 'innocent', is a modern elaboration.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

==As punishments for scolds==

Francois Maximilian Misson, a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:[tpl]cite book|title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days|chapter=The Dunking Stool|author=Alice Morse Earle|year=1896|url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html|accessdate=18 January 2007[/tpl]
The dunking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of dunking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the dunking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and dunking the occupant.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia =Encyclopaedia Britannica|title = Dunking| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = London| edition = 11th| year = 1911|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Dunking|accessdate=18 January 2007[/tpl]
