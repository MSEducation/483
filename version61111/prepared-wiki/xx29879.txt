The college was founded in 1326, making it the second-oldest surviving college of the University after Peterhouse. Clare is famous for its chapel choir and for its gardens on "the Backs" (the back of the colleges that overlook the River Cam). The current Master is Tony Badger, Paul Mellon Professor of American History.
Clare is consistently one of the most popular Cambridge colleges amongst prospective applicants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/colleges.html |title=College applications and admissions statistics |publisher=Cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02[/tpl] As of 2012, it had an endowment of around £65m.Clare's Endowment (updated March 2012)

==History==

The college was founded in 1326 by the university's Chancellor, Richard Badew, and was originally named University Hall. Providing maintenance for only two fellows, it soon hit financial hardship. In 1338, the college was refounded as Clare Hall by an endowment from Elizabeth de Clare, a granddaughter of Edward I, which provided for twenty fellows and ten students.'The colleges and halls: Clare College', A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge (1959), pp. 340-346. Date Accessed: 2 June 2010 The college was known as Clare Hall until 1856, when it changed its name to "Clare College". (A new "Clare Hall" was founded by Clare College as an exclusively postgraduate institution in 1966.)
Clare's Old Court, a Grade I listed building, frames King's College Chapel as the left border of one of the most celebrated architectural vistas in England. It was built between 1638 and 1715, with a long interruption for the English Civil War. The period spans the arrival of true classicism into the mainstream of British architecture, such that its progress can be traced in the marked differences between the oldest wing to the north, which still has vaulting and other features in the unbroken tradition of English Gothic, and the final southern block, which shows a fully articulated classic style. The college's chapel was built in 1763 and designed by Sir James Burrough, the Master of neighbouring Caius College.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] Its altarpiece is Annunciation by Cipriani.
Clare has a much-photographed bridge over the river which is the oldest of Cambridge's current bridges. Fourteen stone balls decorate it, one of which has a missing section. A number of apocryphal stories circulate concerning this - the one most commonly cited by members of college is that the original builder of the bridge was not paid the full amount for his work and so removed the segment to balance the difference in payment. A more likely explanation is that a wedge of stone cemented into the ball as part of a repair job became loose and fell out into the river.
Clare's bridge connects Old Court to Memorial Court, which was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and dedicated in 1926. Memorial Court was extended in the 1950s by the construction of Thirkill Court, and was later divided into two parts when the College's Forbes Mellon Library was constructed in the center of Memorial Court; the new courtyard created in the west was renamed Ashby Court thereafter.http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/Memorial-Court/ A new court, Lerner Court, was opened in January 2008http://www.vhh.co.uk/projects/clare.htm and was designed by architects van Heyningen and Haward. It occupies the last piece of undeveloped land in the central area of the College next to Memorial Court and houses a lecture theatre, catering, fellows offices, residential accommodation and a student laundry.

==College life==

Clare is known as a liberal and progressive college. In 1972 it became one of the three male Cambridge colleges that led the way in admitting female undergraduates (the other two being Churchill and King's). Clare continues in this tradition and has won praise for the transparency of its admissions process.The pick of the bunch, EducationGuardian, 2005-12-20
Clare is known as one of the most musical colleges in Cambridge. Its choir is internationally recognised and has performed all over the world. Many Clare students play instruments, and the college music society (Clare College Music Society (CCMS)) is well known, particularly the orchestra. Like most Cambridge colleges, Clare allows students to have a piano in their college rooms.

===Clare Ents===

As well as popular jazz and comedy nights, Clare is renowned for Clare Ents, a student night held every Friday in term time. The night is popular with students across the university and in the past it has hosted such acts as Tinie Tempah, Bombay Bicycle Club, and Chase and Status.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clare-ents.com |title=Clare Ents |publisher=Clare Ents |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02[/tpl]

===Clareification===

Clare's student newspaper, Clareification, won "Best University College Paper" in "The Cambridge Student" in 2005. Published by the Union of Clare Students, it comprises satirical articles mocking Cambridge traditions, reports on silly student antics, and college gossip in the "Clareifornication" column. It is often the subject of criticism by some staff for risqué and tasteless content, and was described by the Master, Professor Badger, as "an unholy cross between the Sun and Private Eye". On 3 February 2007 the college cut its funding to the paper following the publication of the guest-edited 2 February edition, retitled "Crucification". In addition to the paper's usual satirical attacks on Christianity, this edition also featured several articles which mocked Islam, and a reproduction of the cartoon illustrations of the prophet Mohammed which provoked international protest when they first appeared in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. The current editors-in-chief are Euan Holmes, Morven Macaulay & Lizzie Walsh.

===Clare May Ball===

Clare holds an annual may ball on the Monday of May Week in the middle of June. It is one of the largest may balls in Cambridge and is well known for securing popular head-liners.

===Clare Boat Club===

Clare Boat Club is the rowing club for current members of Clare College. There is a separate club, De Burgh Boat Club for Alumni. In 2012, Clare Boat Club had the highest membership relative to the size of its student body of any College affiliated Boat Club in Cambridge fielding 6 men's VIIIs in the May Bumps competition.

Entrance into Clare College is very competitive. Overall, Clare has approximately 5 applicants per place. Yet the high quality of applicants means that many of them are awarded places at other colleges through the Winter Pool. Of applicants in 2007, 151 were given offers by Clare, and a further 75 applicants were made offers at other Cambridge colleges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/admissions/statistics.html|title=Clare Statistics|publisher=Clare College, Cambridge[/tpl]
