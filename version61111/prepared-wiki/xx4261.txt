Hook of Holland (Dutch: Image:Ltspkr.pngHoek van Holland, [tpl]IPA-nl|ˈɦuk fɑn ˈɦɔlɑnt|pron[/tpl] - literally "Corner of Holland"), also known as De Hoek, is a town in the western Netherlands. Its name refers to its geographical location in the southwestern "corner" of Holland proper, at the mouth of the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal into the North Sea. The town is administered by the municipality of Rotterdam as a district of that city. Its district covers an area of 16.7 km2 (of which 13.92 km2 is land). On 1 January 1999 it had an estimated population of 9,400.
Nearby towns include Monster, 's-Gravenzande, Naaldwijk and Delft to the northeast and Maassluis to the southeast. On the other side of the river is the Europoort and the Maasvlakte. The wide sandy beach, one section of which is designated for use by naturists, runs for approximately 18 kilometres to Scheveningen and for most of this distance is backed by extensive sand dunes through which there are foot and cycle paths.
On the north side of the Nieuwe Waterweg, to the west of the town, is a pier part of which is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.
The Berghaven is a small harbour on the Nieuwe Waterweg where the Rotterdam and Europort pilots are based. This small harbour is only for the use of the pilot service, government vessels and the Hoek van Holland lifeboat.
During World War II this was one of the most important places for the Germans to hold because of the harbour.

The ferry terminal is operated by Stena Line with the passenger terminal and access for passenger cars being next to Hoek van Holland Haven Station and the freight entrance being to the east of the town.
There has been a ferry service to eastern England operating from Hoek van Holland since 1893 with only the two World Wars interrupting the service. Currently two routes are being operated: one, a day and night freight and passenger service, to Harwich, Essex and the other, a night, freight only service to Killingholme, Lincolnshire. From 1 March 2009 the Harwich service will be departing at 2:30 pm and 10:45 pm and the Killingholme service at 9:15 pm.
A local ferry operated by RET links Hook of Holland with the Maasvlakte part of the Port of Rotterdam.
