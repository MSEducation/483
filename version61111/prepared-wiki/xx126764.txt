[[King Edward Avenue (Vancouver)]]

CATEGORIES: Streets in Vancouver

King Edward Avenue is a major east-west thoroughfare in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The road runs from Crown Street to the west, adjacent to the University Endowment Lands, to Kingsway to the east, in the Kensington-Cedar Cottage neighbourhood.  Ontario Street divides "West King Edward Avenue" from "East King Edward Avenue."  In the numbered avenue grid of Vancouver south of False Creek, King Edward would normally be styled 25th.  It is named in honour of King Edward VII, King of Canada from 1901 to 1910.  Major intersections include (from west to east) Dunbar Street, Macdonald Street, Arbutus Street, Granville Street, Oak Street, Cambie Street, Main Street, Fraser Street, Knight Street, and Kingsway.
The two and four lane road is characterised by a broad, grassy and treed median separating westbound and eastbound traffic, passing through diverse residential and commercial neighbourhoods.  It is primarily a 2-lane road until Granville Street, after which is remains a 4-lane thoroughfare until Main St, where it reverts to a 2-lane arterial.  The road widens at intersections on the 2-lane sections to 4 or 6 lane sections to allow for left turns and more efficient traffic movement.  Its intersection with Cambie Street is the site of King Edward Station of the Metro Vancouver's Canada Line rapid transit system.
