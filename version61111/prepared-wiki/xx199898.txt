Tomidahama Station was opened on July 1, 1907 as the Tomidahama Provisional Signal Stop on the Kansai Railway. Trains stopped here only during the summer season, when the nearby beaches we open for swimmers. The Kansai Railway was nationalized on October 1, 1907 becoming part of the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) and the word “Provisional” was removed from the name on July 1, 1908. It was elevated in status to a full station on March 1, 1928. The JGR became the Japan National Railways (JNR) after World War II. The station has been unattended since October 1, 1970. The station was absorbed into the JR Central network upon the privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987.
