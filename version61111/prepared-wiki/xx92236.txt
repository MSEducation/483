==History==

CKCK first signed on the air on July 28, 1954, as the first privately owned television station in Western Canada. It was originally owned by the Sifton family, which also owned the Regina Leader-Post and CKCK radio. It was originally a CBC Television affiliate. Shortly after signing on, it took a secondary affiliation with U.S. broadcast network CBS.Canadian Communications Foundation history of CKCK-TV In 1962, as part of a deal that allowed CTV to come to Saskatchewan, CKCK opened a rebroadcaster in Moose Jaw.  In return, Moose Jaw's original station, CHAB-TV, switched to CTV and opened a semi-satellite in Regina, CHRE-TV
The station swapped affiliations with CHAB/CHRE and joined CTV when the latter stations were purchased by the CBC. As a result of this deal, CHRE changed its call letters to CBKRT and became the main station; it is now CBKT.
In 1977, CKCK was sold to Harvard Developments, owned by Regina's Hill family. In 1985, Baton Broadcasting acquired a 90 percent stake in the station (the remaining 10 percent would soon follow), bringing it under common ownership with CTV's other Saskatchewan affiliates--CFQC in Saskatoon, CICC in Yorkton, and CIPA in Prince Albert.  In 1987, these stations and Baton's two privately owned CBC affiliates in Saskatchewan, CKOS in Yorkton and CKBI in Prince Albert, began branding as the "Saskatchewan Television Network," which linked up with Baton's Ontario stations as the Baton Broadcast System in 1994.  
Following Baton's acquisition of CTV in 1997, CKCK became a CTV owned-and-operated station. Local programming today is limited primarily to the station's popular newscasts.
From the 1970s through the late 1980s, CKCK branded itself as "CKTV", but its official call letters remained CKCK-TV. During this period, though, the station did acquire the CKTV calls for its Fort Qu'appelle retransmitter. That station is now CKCK-TV-7; "CKTV" is currently used the call sign for a Radio-Canada affiliate in Saguenay, Quebec. Nevertheless, while the station identifies itself only as CTV, many people in southern Saskatchewan still know it as "CKTV" or "CK".
In December 2008, CTVglobemedia applied to the CRTC to operate an HD feed of CKCK-TV, which would be delivered as a "satellite-to-cable" feed. The move would allow CKCK to operate a HD signal which could be substituted in place of American HD signals on local cable services, without actually operating an over-the-air digital television transmitter.
Regina does not observe daylight saving time, remaining on Central Standard Time year-round. CKCK runs its primetime programming from 7:00 p.m. to 10 p.m., and CTV's 7 p.m. ET programming at 10 p.m., in pattern with Winnipeg affiliate CKY-DT, to generally abide by the U.S. practice of airing primetime programming simultaneously or live with its counterparts in the Eastern Time Zone when DST is not in effect. However, when DST does take effect (and time in Regina matches that in Alberta), CKCK's scheduling does not change, meaning that its primetime programming is aired one hour behind CKY.
