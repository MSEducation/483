==Career==

===Early career===

Growing up in Alameda near Oakland, Willis rooted for the Oakland A's as a kid. His mother Joyce was a soft ball catcher for her high school team. Willis' favorite player was former Oakland A's pitcher, Dave Stewart. Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, California, where he played baseball for four years. He is the son of Clinton Ostah, a former minor league player in the 1970s. In Willis' senior year, he went 12–1 with a 0.83 earned run average in 70 innings. Scouts never doubted his talents, but rather his unusual pitching mechanics. One scout even called him a "Poor man's CC Sabathia." He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft.
In 2001, Willis was bumped up to the Boise Hawks of the Northwest League. He finished with 8 wins and a 2.98 ERA. Opposing hitters only batted .217 against Willis. In a Baseball America poll, several NWL managers called Willis Boise's best player.

===Florida Marlins===

On March 27, 2002, the Cubs traded Willis (then a minor leaguer), fellow pitchers Julián Tavárez and José Cueto, and catcher Ryan Jorgensen to the Florida Marlins, in exchange for pitchers Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca.
After being traded, Willis struggled early on. However, Willis started to get better as he got to low Class A ball. By the end of the season, he went 10-2 and finished the season with the Class-A Jupiter Hammerheads. In five starts, he went 2-0 with a 1.83 ERA, leading the Midwest League in ERA. For his performance, he was named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year.
In the 2003 Spring Training, Willis reported to Jupiter. The plan was to start him with the Class-AA Carolina Mudcats. The hope was that he would make the leap to AAA, and potentially be available for a spot start in Florida or a back-of-the-bullpen job late in the season. The Marlins then sent Willis down to Carolina to work on consistency and control. Willis would dominate at Carolina; he went 4–0 with a 1.49 ERA.

====2003 season====

On May 9, 2003, Willis made his Major League debut for the Florida Marlins. Against the Rockies, he pitched six innings, allowed seven hits and three earned runs, and got a no decision.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?id=230509128 |title=Colorado Rockies vs. Florida Marlins - Box Score - May 9, 2003 |work=Espn.com |date=June 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 9, 2013|agency=Associated Press[/tpl]
