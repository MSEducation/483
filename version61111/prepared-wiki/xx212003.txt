[[Hermaphrodite]]

CATEGORIES: Supernumerary body parts, Intersex, Sex, Reproduction

In biology, a hermaphrodite is an organism that has reproductive organs normally associated with both male and female sexes.Merriam-Webster Dictionary Retrieved 28 June 2011
Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/263151/hermaphroditism| title=hermaphroditism| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online| accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl] In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which both partners can act as the "female" or "male". For example, the great majority of pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.
Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word intersex has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word hermaphrodite is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,[tpl]cite web|title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite?|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl] as well as "scientifically specious and clinically problematic".[tpl]cite web|last=Herndon|first=April|title=Getting Rid of "Hermaphroditism" Once and For All|url=http://www.isna.org/node/979|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=2 October 2011[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The term derives from the [tpl]lang-lat|hermaphroditus[/tpl], from [tpl]lang-grc|ἑρμαφρόδιτος|hermaphroditos[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=Definition of hermaphroditus|publisher=Numen: The Latin Lexicon|url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=2025388|accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with the nymph Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes;Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV: The story of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis. according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus, he was born with a physical body combining both sexes.Diodorus Siculus — Book IV Chapters 1–7 The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edn, s.v. hermaphrodite, n. and adj.; [tpl]cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hermaphrodite|accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl]

===Sequential hermaphrodites===

Sequential hermaphrodites (dichogamy) occur in species in which the individual is born as one sex, but can later change into the opposite sex.[tpl]cite book |title=Animal behavior desk reference: a dictionary of animal behavior, ecology, and evolution |last=Barrows |first=Edward M.|authorlink= |edition=2nd |year=2001 |publisher=CRC Press |location= Boca Raton, Fla|isbn=0-8493-2005-4|oclc=299866547 |page= 317[/tpl] This contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites, in which an individual may possess fully functional male and female gonads.  Sequential hermaphroditism is common in fish (particularly teleost fish) and some jellyfish, many gastropods (such as the common slipper shell), and some flowering plants. While some sequential hermaphrodites can change sex multiple times, most can only change sex once.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]  Sequential hermaphroditism can best be understood in terms of behavioral ecology and evolutionary life history theory, as described in the size-advantage mode[tpl]cite journal|last=Warner|first=Robert R|title=Sex change and the size-advantage model|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|date=June 1988|volume=3|issue=6|pages=133–136|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(88)90176-0|pmid=21227182[/tpl] first proposed by Michael T. Ghiselin[tpl]cite journal|last=Ghiselin|first=Michael T.|title=The evolution of hermaphroditism among animals|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1969|volume=44|pages=189–208|doi=10.1086/406066|pmid=4901396|issue=2[/tpl] which states that if an individual of a certain sex could significantly increase its reproductive success after reaching a certain size, it would be to their advantage to switch to that sex.
Sequential hermaphrodites can be divided into three broad categories:
Dichogamy can have both conservation-related implications for humans, as mentioned above, as well as economic implications. For instance, groupers are favoured fish for eating in many Asian countries and are often aquacultured. Since the adults take several years to change from female to male, the broodstock are extremely valuable individuals.

===Simultaneous hermaphrodites===

A simultaneous (or synchronous) hermaphrodite (or homogamous) is an adult organism that has both male and female sexual organs at the same time. Usually, self-fertilization does not occur.

===Pseudohermaphroditism===

When spotted hyenas were first discovered by explorers, they were thought to be hermaphrodites. Early observations of spotted hyenas in the wild led researchers to believe that all spotted hyenas, male and female, were born with what appeared to be a penis. The apparent penis in female spotted hyenas is in fact an enlarged clitoris, which contains an external birth canal.The Painful Realities of Hyena SexGraphic depiction of female hyena's reproductive system It can be difficult to determine the sex of wild spotted hyenas until sexual maturity, when they may become pregnant. When a female spotted hyena gives birth, they pass the cub through the cervix internally, but then pass it out through the elongated clitoris.Hermaphrodite Hyenas? – Animal Life by Mary Ellen Schoeman

===Humans===

Aside from having an ambiguous-looking external genitalia, true hermaphroditism in humans differs from pseudohermaphroditism in that the person's karyotype has both XX and XY  chromosome pairs (47XXY, 46XX/46XY, 46XX/47XXY or 45X/XY mosaic) and having both testicular and ovarian tissue.
One possible pathophysiologic explanation of this rare phenomenon is a parthenogenetic division of a haploid ovum into two haploid ova. Upon fertilization of the two ova by two sperm cells (one carrying an X and the other carrying a Y chromosome), the two fertilized ova are then fused together resulting in a person having dual genitalial, gonadal (ovotestes) and genetic sex.
Another common cause of hermaphroditism is the crossing over of the SRY from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome during meiosis. The SRY is then activated in only certain areas, causing development of testes in some areas by beginning a series of events starting with the upregulation of SOX9, and in other areas not being active (causing the growth of ovarian tissues). Thus, testicular and ovarian tissues will both be present in the same individual.[tpl]cite pmid | 10602113[/tpl]
