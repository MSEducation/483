She has published to date 22 novels, two of which were converted into film.

Fielding sets most of her novels in American cities such as Boston and Chicago. She has said that she prefers to set her novels in "big American cities, the landscape seems best for her themes of urban alienation and loss of identity."

==Interview==

Fielding had an interview with the Vancouver Sun in 2007, just after her publication of Heartstopper. She enjoys catching readers off guard with the endings of her stories, but insists that "it isn't what her fiction is about",Wigod, Rebecca. "Plot-Meister Says That For Her, It's Mostly About Character." The Vancouver Sun 28 Apr 2007, final ed: C.9. Print. but rather more about the development of her characters.
Discussing her novels with the Toronto Star in 2008, she said "I might not write fiction in the literary sense.  But I write very well.  My characters are good. My dialog is good. And my stories are really involving. I'm writing exactly the kind of books I like to write.  And they're the kind of books I like to read. They're popular commercial fiction. That's what they are."

==Audience==

Fielding has been noted as a novelist who is more popular in the United States and foreign countries, rather than in her native Canada. For example, the novel Kiss Mommy Goodbye was more popular in the States, and See Jane Run in Germany. In addition, she had an American agent and publisher, although she has now switched to a Canadian publisher.
