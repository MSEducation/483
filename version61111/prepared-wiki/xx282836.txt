Brownlow North (6 January 1810 – 9 November 1875) was an English evangelist.
North was born in Winchester House, Chelsea. He was the grandson of Brownlow North, Bishop of Winchester. When he was born, he was in line to receive the earldom of Guilford, since the current earl, Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford, had no son, and neither did Brownlow's uncle, Francis North. However, due to Brownlow's "youthful extravagances", Francis remarried on the death of his wife, and did have a son, thus denying Brownlow the earldom.[tpl]cite book|last=Moody-Stuart|first=Kenneth|title=Brownlow North: His Life and Work|year=1961|publisher=Banner of Truth Trust|page=9[/tpl]
North was educated at Eton College. He lived for a while with his great uncle Frederick on Corfu, and fought with Dom Pedro's army in Portugal, before eventually settling in Scotland.Moody-Stuart, p. 10. North lived a life of pleasure, being fond of hunting and gambling, broken only by a period at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, when he considered taking holy orders.
North experienced a religious conversion in November 1854, and began to attend Elgin Free Church. He proceeded to engage in public preaching. In 1859, he was appointed as an evangelist by the Free Church of Scotland.[tpl]cite web|last=Hyndman|first=Knox|title=Brownlow North: A Zealous Preacher|url=http://www.banneroftruth.co.uk/pages/articles/article_detail.php?503|publisher=Banner of Truth|accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] Moody-Stuart suggests that he gained in this an "express recognition" for lay-effort "such as it had not obtained since the period immediately succeeding the Reformation."Moody-Stuart, p. 89.
North was a significant figure in the 1859 revival in Ireland. On one occasion he preached to 12,000 people at Newtonlimavady.[tpl]cite web|last=Brooks|first=Richard|title=Revival Snapshots – 1859 in Ulster|url=http://www.evangelical-times.org/archive/item/1456/Historical/Revival-Snapshots---1859-in-Ulster/|publisher=Evangelical Times|accessdate=20 August 2013[/tpl] Rabbi Duncan once remarked on seeing a photograph of him, "There is intellect in the brow, genius in the eye, and eloquence in the mouth."Moody-Stuart, p. 60.
