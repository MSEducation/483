He was also notable for wearing his plastic catcher's cap forward (similar to how a field player wears a normal baseball cap) under his mask; normally, catchers will turn the cap around to provide stability for their mask. In Boston, Cash wore the uniform number 36, except from August 16, 2008 to the end of the 2008 season, due to Paul Byrd's joining the Red Sox and wearing his customary number 36.
