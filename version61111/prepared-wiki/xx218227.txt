[[300 metre rifle prone]]

CATEGORIES: ISSF shooting events, Rifle shooting sports

300 metre rifle prone is an ISSF shooting event. It was added to the World Championship program in 1982, and was based on the English Match but shot with the same full-power rifle as in 300 metre rifle three positions. The course of fire, like in the small-bore 50 metre rifle prone, is 60 shots for both men and women.
300 metre rifle has been a declining event for many decades because of the considerable cost for competing in the event and the difficulty of creating ranges for it. 300 metre Rifle is still on the World and regional championships program, though.
