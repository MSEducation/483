"There's a Small Hotel" is a 1936 popular song composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart. Originally written for but dropped from the musical Billy Rose's Jumbo (1935), it was then used in On Your Toes (1936), where it was introduced by Ray Bolger and Doris Carson and also interpolated in the film version of Pal Joey (1957) with a fine Frank Sinatra-Nelson Riddle collaboration.
According to the biography of Lorenz Hart by Frederick Nolan (Lorenz Hart - A Poet on Broadway, 1994; Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-510289-4),[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1VFwDk20BnUC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=Lorenz+Hart+Stockton+Inn&source=web&ots=LeyEMfBEte&sig=W6FVRxonbHEyMC9sJFUQM_umvEs&hl=en |title=Lorenz Hart: A Poet on Broadway - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl] the song was inspired by a visit that Richard Rodgers made to the Stockton Inn,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stocktoninn.com/ |title=http://stockton-inn-restaurant-bar-fine-dining-historic.eggzack.com |publisher=Stocktoninn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26[/tpl]  in Stockton, NJ. Hart reputedly found the melody insistently cloying and often ad-libbed raunchy parody verses, much to Rodgers' chagrin.
Another claimant to be the inspiration for the song is the Montecito Inn, in Santa Barbara County, California.[tpl]cite book|last=Trzebinski|first=Errol|title=The Lives of Beryl Markham|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4sWVPxSuAC&pg=PA343|accessdate=10 October 2011|date=17 March 1995|publisher=W.
