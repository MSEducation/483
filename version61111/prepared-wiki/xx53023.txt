On May 9, 2012, President Obama announced in an interview with ABC News that after wrestling with the subject for many years, he had come to believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. In the same interview, he stated his belief that individual states should have the final say as to whether same-sex marriage is recognized. The announcement made Obama the first United States president to publicly declare his support of same-sex marriage while in office, and marked a departure from his previous stance on the issue.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18014102|title=Obama says same-sex couples should be able to marry|date=May 9, 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 20, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-09/news/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-obama-gaymarriagebre84818y-20120509_1_gay-marriage-civil-unions-lesbian-couples|title=Same-sex couples should be able to marry: Obama|first=Jeff|last=Mason|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=ElectionCenter2008|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/issues/issues.samesexmarriage.html|accessdate=October 3, 2009[/tpl] During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama had stated, "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.
