==Reasons for the merger==

The three-way merger was largely a result of market pressure during a period of rapid change in the Italian legal sector as international (mostly American and British) law firms such as Clifford Chance, and Shearman & Sterling actively sought to expand their existing operations, or open offices in Italy.[tpl]Citation |work=The Lawyer |year=1999 |title=Three top Italian firms merge to fight UK and US predators |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=98786 [/tpl]. The merger was essentially a flanking operation that forced foreign firms to concentrate their energies on mergers with smaller Italian firms or to acquire specific teams.
From the ninety lawyers that made up its firm, following the merger in 1999, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo has increased its number of lawyers to the present three hundred. This has permitted the Firm to offer its clients complete legal services and to advise on the most important transactions in Italy, which included the takeover of Telecom Italia by Olivetti in 1999, one of the largest hostile takeovers in Europe. Moreover, Bonelli Erede Pappalardo is considered a top ranking firm in almost all practice areas by the most important international Legal Directories.
The firm is managed by a Board of Directors that is made up of 6 partners, including the Managing Partner, Alberto Saravalle,‘Biography of Alberto Saravalle’ http://www.beplex.com/avvocati_associato.asp?lingua=eng&id=178The Lawyer (2007) 'Bonelli: Alberto Saravalle' http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=130015\ who was nominated in 2007.

==Charting its own course==

Bonelli enhanced its profitability with several high profile lateral hires from the Italian desks of the London offices of firms like Clifford Chance and Allen & Overy. In 2006, the firm exceeded 100 million Euro in annual revenues.[tpl]Citation |work=The Lawyer |year=2006 |title=Bonelli smashes EUR 100m revenue ceiling |url=http://www.thelawyer.com/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=119998 [/tpl].
