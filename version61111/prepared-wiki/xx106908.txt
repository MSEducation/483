The Sham Mirrors is the third studio album by Norwegian avant-garde metal band Arcturus. It was released on April 9, 2002.
The Sham Mirrors is a departure from the band's previous albums; it features a much more modern, "outer space"-influenced sound, as opposed to the classical music-inspired layered melodies of 1997's La Masquerade Infernale, and contains elements of trip-hop, ambient music and electronica in addition to the band's typical heavy and black metal sound. Lyrically, the album deals with abstract science fiction-themed subjects, a departure from the Satanic lyrics of earlier work. The album cover depicts a model drawing of the upper part of the Apollo spaceship.
