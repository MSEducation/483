The Greenstone Ridge Trail is a [tpl]convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long[/tpl] hiking trail on Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Michigan. All of the island is included in Isle Royale National Park, and hence the trail is also totally within park boundaries.  The trail extends from a harbor on the island's western end, Windigo, to a harbor and lodge on its eastern end, Rock Harbor. As there are no paved roads in this wilderness area and park, the trail doubles as the primary means of land transportation on the island.[ref]

The trail generally follows the top of Greenstone Ridge, a low ridge that forms the spine of the island, and surmounts Mount Desor, the highest point of Isle Royale.  Hikers appreciate the elevation, which to some extent separates them from assaults by mosquitoes that are found in great numbers in the island's lower-lying wetlands.  Hikers often look out for signs of the island's megafauna, moose and wolves; although scarce and shy, these animals live all about the scrubby woodlands that adjoin the trail.  
The Greenstone Ridge and its Trail are both named after chlorastrolite, a local semiprecious stone that is the state gem of the U.S. state of Michigan.  On Isle Royale this rock is known as "greenstone."
