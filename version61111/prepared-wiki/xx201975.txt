Ernest Wilson "Serious" Myers (October 7, 1906 â€“ March 25, 1991) was an American jazz double-bassist, best known for his contributions to New Orleans jazz.
Myers was born in Pennsylvania but began his professional career in the American South. He played drums with Bessie Smith in the middle of the 1920s, and also played guitar and banjo professionally in addition to bass. He played bass first with King Oliver, then with the Bechet-Ladnier New Orleans Footwarmers. In the 1930s he played in Europe in the bands of Lucky Millinder and Willie Lewis, and upon his return played in New York City and Philadelphia with Sidney Bechet and Mezz Mezzrow. He worked with the Spirits of Rhythm both in the 1930s and 1940s, and in the latter decade played with Jimmy Dorsey, Bob Mosley, Tiger Haynes, Rex Stewart, and Duke Ellington for a short time. He worked locally in Philadelphia into the 1970s, playing music in addition to working as a preacher.
