John Seddon is an occupational psychologist, researcher, professor, management thinker and leading global authority on change, specialising in the service industry. His prominence grew following attacks on current British management thinking including: the belief in economies of scale, quality standards such as ISO9000 Teaming Up With Local Teens, June 18, 2005, The Guardian.  Accessed 3 August 2007. and much of public sector reform including 'deliverology', the use of targets, inspection and centralised control of local services. The Daily Telegraph described him as a "reluctant management guru", with a background in occupational psychology."Bootcamp tactics won’t win the battle", Stefan Stern, Daily Telegraph, 16 February 2006.
He is critical of target-based management, and of basing decisions on economies of scale, rather than "economies of flow".Freedom from Command and Control: a better way to make the work work, John Seddon (2003), Vanguard Press. (ISBN 0-9546183-0-0)

==Debate about local government management==

His positions[tpl]which|date=March 2014[/tpl]  prompted discussion on the Local Government Chronicle (LGC) website with David Walker, Managing Director, Communications & Reporting, at the Audit Commission,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/finance-and-partnership/walker-v-seddon-the-debate-goes-on/5004313.article|title=Walker v Seddon - the debate goes on|publisher=Local Government Chronicle|last=Blackman|first=David|date=2009-07-22[/tpl] who responded strongly, writing "Mr Seddon is incontinent in his judgement. To say ‘economy of scale is a myth’ betrays what can best be called a religious rather than an empirical mind set."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/by-all-means-criticise-us-but-get-your-facts-straight/5004206.article|title=By all means criticise us, but get your facts straight|last=Walker|first=David|date=2009-07-20|publisher=Local Government Chronicle[/tpl] 
The debate was also covered in newspapers including The Times, which featured it on 31 July 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/publicsector/article1837437.ece|title='New way' thinker John Seddon aims at council targets|publisher=The Times|last=Ford|first=Emily|date=2009-07-31[/tpl]

==Campaign==

Seddon wrote an open letter dated 31 January 2011http://www.systemsthinking.co.uk/docs/Open%20Letter%20to%20Duncan%20Smith%20and%20Freud.pdf calling for the Rt. Hon Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Freud, the ministers responsible for Welfare Reform, to "halt the current programme of reorganisation associated with the Single Universal Credit and embark on a better course". In the letter, he says "This campaign is not about the concept of the Single Universal Credit as such. It is about the design and implementation of its delivery". He says the weakness in the proposals for online and call centre delivery of the new Single Universal Credit is the "continuing unquestioning faith in economies of scale". A petition was started on the Government e-petitions site Rethink the centralised, IT- dominated service design for Universal Credit - e-petitions. Epetitions.direct.gov.uk (2012-08-18). Retrieved on 2013-07-26. as part of the campaign on 18 August 2011. The petition calls for Iain Duncan Smith to rethink the centralised IT-dominated service design of Universal Credit.
