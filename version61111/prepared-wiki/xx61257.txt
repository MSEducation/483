Southern Polytechnic State University (also called Southern Poly; abbreviated SPSU) is a public, co-educational, state university in Marietta, Georgia, United States approximately [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] northwest of downtown Atlanta. It is part of the University System of Georgia and calls itself "Georgia's Technology University.""University Mission." Southern Polytechnic State University Marietta, Georgia. Retrieved 01 May 2012. http://www.spsu.edu/aboutus/univmission.htm.
The university was established in 1948 as The Technical Institute in Chamblee, Georgia. The first classes were held with 116 students. It was renamed the Southern Technical Institute in 1949 and moved to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia in 1962. It went through another name change in 1987 and became the Southern College of Technology. In the summer of 1996, the university adopted its current name. It is one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States that tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.[tpl]cite news|title=Points of Distinction |url=http://www.dsa.csupomona.edu/visitors/Distinction.asp |accessdate=20 September 2012|agency=Admissions & Outreach Office at Cal Poly Pomona[/tpl]
Today, the university's campus encompasses more than [tpl]convert|230|acres[/tpl] of land and owns 65 buildings. It is divided into five academic schools: Architecture and Construction Management, Computing and Software Engineering, Engineering Technology and Management, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering. It is unique in the region in that its bachelor degrees in Mechatronics Engineering, Surveying and Mapping, Construction Engineering, Technical Communication and its nationally accredited Bachelor of Architecture degree are the first and currently the only degrees of their kind in the University System of Georgia.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]

==History==

===Establishment===

After World War II, the need for technicians spiked due to a major economic shift in Georgia from being a largely agricultural state to one that is more industry heavy. The new industries required technicians to bridge the growing gap between engineers and craftsmen, effectively the gap between research/development and building/implementing. At the time, most technical institutes in the United States were in the northeastern states; thus the need for a technical institute in the south was great.
In response to the growing demand, the president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Colonel Blake R. Van Leer, sought to establish a technical institute program in Georgia. In 1945 he was approached by the Associated Industries of Georgia (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947 the authorization was granted. The location of the fledgling institute was a Naval Air Station in Chamblee, GA, the first director was to be Professor Lawrence V. Johnson, and it was going to open under the name of The Technical Institute.Bennett, Richard A. Southern Polytechnic State University: the History. Southern Polytechnic State University Foundation, 1998, p. 4. In March 1948 The Technical Institute held its first registration for a spring quarter and started with 116 students — all but 10 were World War II veterans — and a staff of 12.http://www.spsu.edu/aboutus/history.htm[tpl]better source|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===Progression===

In 1949, The Technical Institute became the Southern Technical Institute and was recognized as a college-level school by the U.S. Department of Education. Twelve years later, the college migrated to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia, which was previously part of Dobbins Air Reserve Base.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The General Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center (then known as Naval Air Station Atlanta) also moved to the opposite (south) end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base around the same time. In 1961, Hoyt McClure was named acting director and led the movement to build eight new buildings on [tpl]convert|120|acre[/tpl] of land. 
The Southern Technical Institute became accredited as a four-year college in 1970 and was one of the first colleges in the nation to offer the Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree. It also earned independence in the University System of Georgia, separating ties with Georgia Tech. In the summer of 1980, the college officially became the fourteenth senior college and the thirty-third independent unit of the University System of Georgia. The college's first president, Dr. Stephen R. Cheshier of Purdue University, was named in that same year. He saw the college through two name changes — Southern College of Technology (often called Southern Tech) in 1987 and Southern Polytechnic State University in the summer of 1996, when the school became a university. Dr. Cheshier retired as president of the university in June 1997. Dr. Daniel S. Papp served as interim president from July 1997 to August 1998, when the university welcomed Dr. Lisa Rossbacher, formerly of Dickinson College, as its president.
Currently, the university hosts a satellite campus for Georgia Highlands College.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]

==Campus==

Other buildings include the Lawrence V. Johnson Library (C Building), Mathematics Building (D Building), Crawford Lab Building (E Building), Engineering Lab Building (G Building), Civil Engineering Technology Building (L Building), W. Clair Harris Textile Center (M Building), Architecture Building (N Building), Housing Office (R10 Building), Recreation and Wellness Center (S1 Building), and Gymnasium (S2 Building). Southern Polytechnic State University has one off-campus facility, the Continuing Education Center.

===Student housing===

Southern Polytechnic State University features five on-campus housing facilities for its students. These facilities are Howell Hall, Hornet Village suites, University Commons apartments, University Courtyard apartments, and University Columns houses."SPSU Housing". Southern Polytechnic State University.http://www.spsu.edu/housing/ Retrieved 9 March 2012. The university hosts a satellite campus for Georgia Highlands College and offers housing for its students alongside Southern Polytechnic State University students.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
Howell Hall is a traditional dormitory building designed to house two residents per room and feature community bathrooms. Residence in this building is only available to freshman students. All building residents are required to subscribe to one of the university's dining services plans.
The Courtyard Apartments were built to hold 414 beds within 104 units.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] Construction was completed in 2004.[tpl]Chronology citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The construction of new residence halls and special interest housing began in 2009.[tpl]Chronology citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl] The residence halls, together called Hornet Village, consist of two buildings housing 600 new beds divided among ten buildings. The special interest housing provides on-campus housing for fraternities, sororities, and university-sanctioned student organizations in ten facilities called the University Columns.http://www.spsu.edu/housing/university_columns/index.htm

==Organization and administration==

Faculty at Southern Polytechnic State University are at a ratio of about 1 faculty member per 19 students. About 42.5% of students attend classes with fewer than 20 students.http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/southern-polytechnic-state-university-1570/academics The small class size promotes a greater attention to the students and lets the faculty become more involved in each student's education. The faculty centers their attention to provide a laboratory and/or professionally oriented education that caters to problem solving, ethical awareness, and a desire for lifelong learning. Every faculty member has to have experience in relevant work or research of a topic to be qualified to teach at the school.Southern Polytechnic State University, Petersons. Because the faculty is more involved, 75.5% of freshmen attend for a second year.
Since 2006, there has been a general 70% to 30% ratio of male to female professors. In 2007–2008 male professors made up to $7,000 more than female professors on average.http://www.spsu.edu/irpa/documents/EntireFactobook2007-08.pdf The gap between the difference in pay quickly decreased and by the 2009–2010 academic year the salary only differed by $300, $77,699 for males and $77,410 for females.http://www.spsu.edu/irpa/documents/FinalFactBook2009-10_000.pdf Of the 48 full-time professors in 2007, 52% of them had tenure. The number of professors dropped from 48 to 44 in 2008; with the drop of full-time professors, only 44% of full-time faculty had tenure.http://www.spsu.edu/irpa/documents/_FinalFactBook0809edition.pdf It was recorded in 2010, that the number of full-time professors dropped again to 39, but the tenure rate remained the same.
There are many awards given out at SPSU among the faculty including the Outstanding Faculty Award and the Employee Service Award.http://www.spsu.edu/pandp/830_01.html The university chooses a select group of faculty whose achievements have been noteworthy enough to receive the OFA. The OFA committee changes each year and is made up of the previous year's recipients. The Employee Service Award acknowledges the service and achievement of permanent employees at periodic intervals with appropriate ceremony and awards.http://www.spsu.edu/pandp/830_0.html A committee composed of representatives from the Staff Council and the Outstanding Faculty Awards Committee determine who receive the awards and the ceremony date. Both awards are given out at the same ceremony at the end of spring term.

===Bathtub Race===

In the 1960s one of the fraternities at Southern Polytechnic converted a cast-iron bath tub into a cooler for parties. When the tub became difficult to move they attached wheels to it. Some time after, other fraternities acquired their own cast-iron tubs, attached wheels, and the fraternities began to hold races around the perimeter of the school. In light of a growing liability risk the school ended the annual tub races in the early 1990s. In 2010 the SPSU alumni group resurrected the Bathtub Race, under the stipulation that the tubs be motorless.[tpl]cite news | title=Bathtub Races Return to Southern Poly | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/cobb/bathtub-races-return-to-396609.html | first=Laura | last=Diamond | newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=March 23, 2010 | accessdate=February 12, 2011[/tpl]
