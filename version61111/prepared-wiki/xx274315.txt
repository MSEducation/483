==Background==

Before the 1992 implementation of the Medicare fee schedule, physician payments were made under the "usual, customary and reasonable" payment model (a "charge-based" payment system). Physician services were largely considered to be misvalued under this system, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued.[tpl]cite web |title=Report to the Congress: Medicare Payment Policy |url=http://www.medpac.gov/documents/Mar06_EntireReport.pdf |work=Medicare Payment Advisory Commission |page=137 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=July 18, 2011[/tpl] Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated an improved model to replace the UCR fees, which had been associated with stark examples of specialists making significantly higher sums of money than primary care physicians.[tpl]cite book |title=Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance |last=Gawande |first=Atul |authorlink=Atul Gawande |year=2007 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-42765-4 |page=115 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-EUba-LKZ04C&pg=PT83&dq=in+the+mid-eighties,+doctors+who+spent+an+hour+making+a+complex+and+lifesaving+diagnosis+were+paid+forty+dollars&hl=en&ei=M047TsqOF-fk0QHzxo2zCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20mid-eighties%2C%20doctors%20who%20spent%20an%20hour%20making%20a%20complex%20and%20lifesaving%20diagnosis%20were%20paid%20forty%20dollars&f=false[/tpl]

However, RBRVS was never fully implemented, partially due to RUC.[tpl]Cite journal | author=Steven A.

==Workings==

RUC was established in 1991 by the American Medical Association (AMA) and medical specialist groups.[tpl]cite news |title=Physician Panel Prescribes the Fees Paid by Medicare |author=Anna Wilde Mathews and Tom McGinty |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=October 26, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704657304575540440173772102.html |accessdate=July 7, 2011[/tpl] The AMA sponsors RUC "both as an exercise of 'its First Amendment rights to petition the Federal Government' and for 'monitoring economic trends ... related to the CPT Procedures and Terminology development process".
RUC is highly influential because it de facto sets Medicare valuations of physician work relative value units (RVUs) of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.[tpl]cite journal| author=Moore KJ, Felger TA, Larimore WL, Mills TL| title=What every physician should know about the RUC | journal=Fam Pract Manag |date=February 2008 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 36–9 | pmid=18303653 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0200/p36.html[/tpl] (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the de jure work RVU determining body.) On average, physician work RVUs make up slightly more than half of the value in a Medicare payment. Historically, CMS has accepted RUC recommendations more than 90% of the time.see http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/5/965 Health economist Uwe Reinhardt characterized the CMS as slavishly accepting RUC recommendations. The physician work RVU values accepted by CMS also influence private health insurance reimbursement.[tpl]cite journal| author=Goodson JD| title=Unintended consequences of resource-based relative value scale reimbursement | journal=JAMA | date= November 21, 2007 | volume= 298 | issue= 19 | pages= 2308–10 | pmid=18029836 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.19.2308 | url = https://www.sgim.org/userfiles/file/RVU%20article%20from%20JAMA.pdf[/tpl]
In 2002, a RUC update of values raised concerns that the process, which was initiated by medical speciality groups, unfairly cut primary care physician pay.[tpl]cite journal| author=Ginsburg PB| title=Rapidly evolving physician-payment policy — more than the SGR | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2011 | volume= 364 | issue= 2 | pages= 172–6 | pmid=21142529 | doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028 | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028[/tpl]
In a 2010 Archives of Internal Medicine publication written before the major health care reform legislation passed Congress—the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)—Federman et al. wrote:
[tpl]quotation|Physician dissatisfaction with Medicare reimbursements and concerns about equity of reimbursements suggest that the role of the RUC in advising Medicare should be carefully evaluated. The Obama administration and health policy experts have called for the creation of an independent Medicare advisory committee ... Without an independent arbiter, physicians and physician groups are likely to continue having complaints about the equitability of reimbursements under Medicare.[tpl]cite journal| author=Federman AD, Woodward M, Keyhani S| title=Physicians' opinions about reforming reimbursement: results of a national survey | journal=Arch Intern Med | year= 2010 | volume= 170 | issue= 19 | pages= 1735–42 | pmid=20975020 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.369[/tpl][/tpl]
Critics have pointed out that many RUC members may have significant conflicts of interest because of their financial relationships.Conflicts of Interests Among The RUC’s Members
In 2013 a report in the Washington Post highlighted how time seemed to bend in the system of time values assigned to various procedures. A Florida practice performing an average twelve colonoscopies and four other procedures a day in 2012 would be considered to take the physically impossible 26 hours in a nine to 10 hour day. In other examples: In Florida and Pennsylvania surgery centers in some specialties, "more than one in five doctors would have to have been working more than 12 hours on average on a single day — much longer than the 10 hours or so a typical surgery center is open"; and "Florida records show 78 doctors — gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons and others — who performed at least 24 hours worth of procedures on an average workday". RUC chairperson Levy said in the report, “None of us believe the numbers are fine-tuned.... We do believe we get them right with respect to each other" while emphasizing that the "voting people around that table can be really harsh". Researcher Hsiao of the original Harvard study said the "current set of values 'seems to be distorted.... The AMA fought very hard to take over this updating process. I said this had to be done by an impartial group of people. This is highly political'". Looking at the time between 2003 and 2013, "the AMA and Medicare have increased the work values for 68 percent of the 5,700 codes analyzed by The Post, while decreasing them for only 10 percent" and while technology is argued, again with colonoscopies as an example, to be reducing actual time spent. Looked at another way, "Medicare spending on physician fees per patient grew 58 percent between 2001 and 2011, mostly because doctors increased the number of procedures performed but also because the price of those procedures rose". Finally, there was an indication in the report that the acceptance rate of the AMA’s values by Medicare "has fallen in recent years from 90 percent higher to about 70 percent" but the federal agency has far fewer people – "six to eight" – monitoring the process than the AMA has operating it.Whoriskey, Peter, and Dan Keating, "2How a secretive panel uses data that distort doctors’ pay", Washington Post, July 20, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-22.
The RUC bears the brunt of the inherent problems with regulation and government price-setting. In a follow-up to The Washington Post report, Bloomberg notes: "There is no system of payment-setting that will not ultimately rely on information from self-interested parties, just as there is no system of financial regulation that can be designed without talking to bankers, or a system of education reform that can be put in place without asking teachers and principals how things work now."

The Independent Payment Advisory Board passed in the PPACA. It could bypass RUC to cut payments to relatively highly compensated specialists, such as dermatologists.[tpl]cite news |title=Most health industry players would win under overhaul |author=Phil Galewitz |newspaper=Kaiser Health News |publisher=McClatchy Washington DC News Bureau |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/08/16/73802/most-health-industry-players-would.html |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ilya Petrou |date=March 2010 |title=Examining healthcare reform |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=3–5 |url= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=John Jesitus |date=April 2010 |title=Battling back |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1, 26 |url= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=John Jesitus |year=2010 |title=Weighing the impact |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=1, 22, 25–6 |url= [/tpl]
