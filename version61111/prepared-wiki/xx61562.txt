==History==

After 10,000 FN FNC rifles were bought for the Indonesian military, Pindad secured a license in 1984 from FN to manufacture the FNC. Indonesia adopted the SS1s into official service by 1991.
A recent seizure of Pindad SS1 rifles alongside P2 pistols in the Philippines has forced politicians to call on a special investigation on Pindad to whether weapon smuggling did take place according to Philippine customs officials.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DnOyv4B6|url=http://us.nasional.news.viva.co.id/news/read/86339-dpr__pemerintah_harus_usut_senjata_pindad|title=DPR: Pemerintah Harus Usut Senjata Pindad|publisher=VIVA News|accessdate=2013-01-19|archivedate=2013-01-19|date=2009-08-29|author=Ita Lismawati F.

==Design==

The external looks of the SS1s are strongly similar to the FN FNC, ranging from the pistol grip to the stock, receiver and barrel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=593|title=Pindad SS1 assault rifle (1991)|accessdate=2013-01-18|date=2012-02-20|publisher=Military Factory[/tpl] Optics can be mounted onto the SS1 rifles, but a special optic mount be installed first before any optic can be used.
The SS1s are designed by Pindad to allow for the use of their own indigenous SPG-1A underbarrel grenade launcher, inserted underneath the barrel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Infantry-Weapons/Pindad-SPG-1-and-SPG-1A-40-mm-grenade-launchers-Indonesia.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DnNPLz1L|title=Pindad SPG-1 and SPG-1A 40 mm grenade launchers (Indonesia), Light support weapons|accessdate=2013-01-19|publisher=Jane's|archivedate=2013-06-05[/tpl] Most SS1 rifle models, with the exception of the SBC-1, are made with selective fire modes that consist of single, three round and full auto firing modes.
