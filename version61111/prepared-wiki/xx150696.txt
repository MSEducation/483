North Carolina Highway 39 (NC 39) is a primary North Carolina state highway. It runs from the intersection of US 70, US 301, and NC 96 in Selma north along US 301/NC 96 through downtown Selma. It splits from US 301 and heads north via Louisburg and Henderson to the Virginia state line, where it continues as Rock Church Road (SR-719).

==History==

===North Carolina Highway 501===

North Carolina Highway 501 (NC 501) was established in 1929 as primary routing from Henderson to the Virginia Border. Virginia did not have any primary routing that continues into their state from the terminus of NC 501. In 1930 NC 501 was extended further south to Louisburg.  In late 1934, NC 501 was renumbered into NC 39, so it would not conflict with US 501.
