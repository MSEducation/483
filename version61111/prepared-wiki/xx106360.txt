==Career==

===Early career===

Allen started his F1 career with the Brabham team in [tpl]f1|1990[/tpl], and in [tpl]f1|1991[/tpl] worked with future TV colleagues Mark Blundell and Martin Brundle. He was news editor at Autosport magazine from 1992 to 1994 and in parallel worked as F1 pit lane reporter for American network ESPN from [tpl]f1|1993[/tpl] to [tpl]f1|1996[/tpl].

===ITV===

With Nigel Mansell's move to IndyCar in 1993, Allen was hired by ITV in 1994 to help present coverage of the season. When ITV gained the rights to broadcast the Formula One championship in [tpl]f1|1997[/tpl], he joined the team as pit lane reporter.
With Murray Walker unable to commentate at the 2000 French Grand Prix, Allen took over as one of the main commentators alongside Martin Brundle. Murray wound down his career the next year, missing five races, all of which Allen covered. ITV had considered trying a number of guest commentators to decide who would be best suited to replace Murray, but instead opted to keep Allen on board full-time. He took over permanently after the 2001 United States Grand Prix and commentated on every subsequent Grand Prix while the sport was broadcast on ITV. The 2007 Canadian Grand Prix was Allen's 100th as a commentator.[tpl]cite web | title = James Allen's 100th Grand Prix | publisher = F1Fanatic.co.uk | year = 2007 | url = http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/06/13/james-allens-100th-grand-prix/ | accessdate =2007-06-20[/tpl] Allen also wrote a "James Allen's Analysis" for the ITV website.[tpl]cite web | title = James Allen's Analysis | publisher = www.itv-f1.com | year = 2009 | url = http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=James_Allen | accessdate =2009-05-13[/tpl]
