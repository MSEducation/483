The film version of Tony Hawks' best selling book Playing the Moldovans at Tennis was filmed during May, June and July 2010 in Moldova, London, Belfast and Israel. It was released in 2012 and the Premiere took place at The Odeon West End, Leicester Square in June 2012 with a star packed audience that included Tony Hawks, many of the cast and crew, Sir Tim Rice, Judy Murray, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Miles Jupp, John Inverdale, Bruno Tonioli, Nick Hancock, Sandi Toksvig, Mark Steel, Marcus Brigstocke and David Baddiel.

==Plot==

The script sticks very closely to the original story when Tony, as he watched TV coverage of England beating Moldova 4-0 in September 1997, made a wager with his friend, the comedian Arthur Smith, (Steve in the film) that he could track down all 11 of the Moldovan players and beat them at tennis.
He attempted the unlikely feat by spending several weeks in Moldova and by also taking in Ireland and Israel, but his journey took many unexpected turns and changed from a lighthearted bet to a serious desire to prove to his host family that it is possible to complete surprising and unexpected tasks and to have a positive outlook on life.
It ends with one of them stripping naked and singing the Moldovan National Anthem in South London in front of a large crowd of their friends, which, like the rest of the film, is also true.
