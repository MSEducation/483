[[Navarro–Frenk–White profile]]

CATEGORIES: Dark matter

The Navarro–Frenk–White profile or NFW profile is a spatial mass distribution of dark matter fitted to dark matter haloes identified in N-body simulations by Julio Navarro, Carlos Frenk and Simon White.[tpl]cite journal|author=Navarro, Julio F.; Frenk, Carlos S.; White, Simon D.

==Density distribution==

In the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:
where ρ0 and the "scale radius", Rs, are parameters which vary from halo to halo.
The integrated mass inside of some radius Rmax is
The total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to
be the virial radius, Rvir ,
which is related to the "concentration parameter", c, and scale radius via
The value of c is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40
for halos of various sizes.
The integral of the squared density is
so that the mean squared density inside of Rmax is
which for the virial radius simplifies to
and the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply

==Dark matter simulations==

The NFW profile is an approximation to the equilibrium configuration of dark matter produced in simulations of collisionless dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists.[tpl]cite journal|author=Y. P. Jing|title=The Density Profile of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 May 2000|volume=535|issue=1|pages=30–36|bibcode=2000ApJ...535...30J|doi=10.1086/308809|arxiv=astro-ph/9901340[/tpl] Before the dark matter virializes, the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos. 
Alternative models, in particular the Einasto profile, have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile.[tpl]cite journal|author=Merritt, David; Graham, Alister; Moore, Benjamin; Diemand, Jurg; Terzić, Balsa|title=Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=20 December 2006|volume=132|issue=6|pages=2685–2700|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2685M|doi=10.1086/508988|arxiv=astro-ph/0509417|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132.2685M[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last1=Merritt|first1=David|authorlink1=David Merritt|last2=et al.|title=A Universal Density Profile for Dark and Luminous Matter?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=May 2005|volume=624|issue=2|pages=L85–L88|bibcode=2005ApJ...624L..85M|doi=10.1086/430636|arxiv=astro-ph/0502515|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...624L..85M[/tpl] The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.

==Observations of halos==

The observations of both the Milky Way and M31 may be compatible with the NFW profile for the dark matter halo.[tpl]cite journal|author=Klypin, Anatoly; Zhao, HongSheng; Somerville, Rachel S.|title=ΛCDM-based Models for the Milky Way and M31. I. Dynamical Models|date=10 July 2002|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=573|issue=2|pages=597–613|bibcode=2002ApJ...573..597K|doi=10.1086/340656|arxiv=astro-ph/0110390[/tpl]  The dark matter profile of smaller galaxies tend to have flatter distributions of dark matter in the central region, known as the Cuspy halo problem.
