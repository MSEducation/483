===Hurricane Alberto===

On June 1, a tropical depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category 1 hurricane, one of the earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970.[tpl]hurdat[/tpl] Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into a tropical storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto is an example of a storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.[tpl]hurdat[/tpl]
Though the storm never made landfall, 23 deaths were reported in Cuba from significant flooding, the worst in 32 years. Southern Florida experienced moderate rainfall, with a peak of [tpl]convert|16.47|in|mm[/tpl] occurring in Tavernier.David Roth (2009). Hurricane Alberto Rainfall Totals.

===Subtropical Storm One===

The first subtropical storm of the season formed in the east-central Gulf of Mexico on June 18, and moved northeast for its entire life cycle. It crossed the Florida peninsula that night, causing the issuance of numerous severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings. The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at [tpl]convert|10.72|in|mm[/tpl] eight miles (13 km) southwest of DeSoto City, Florida.David M. Roth (2009). Rainfall from Subtropical Storm One. Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Retrieved on May 23, 2009. The storm continued, crossing the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and retained its strength until June 20 when it became extratropical near Newfoundland. The cyclone caused three deaths in Florida, sank a fishing trawler off the coast of North Carolina, and caused $10 million in damage (1982 USD).Joseph Pelissier (1983).

===Tropical Storm Beryl===

A well-developed tropical wave exited Africa on August 27. The next day, it developed into a tropical depression, and shortly thereafter it intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. On August 29, it passed just south of Cape Verde as it continued intensifying on its west-northwest track. An eye feature appeared in the convection on August 31, suggesting winds of near hurricane status; since the feature was located on the western side of the deep convection and the storm was slightly asymmetric, the intensity was held just below hurricane status.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report, Page One|year=1983|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=November 1, 2008|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1982-prelim/beryl/prelim01.gif| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019231350/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1982-prelim/beryl/prelim01.gif| archivedate= 19 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Shortly after, strong wind shear caused the storm to deteriorate, leaving the low-level circulation exposed on the western side. Beryl weakened to a tropical depression the next day due to the lack of convection, and it continued westward without redevelopment. On September 5, a reconnaissance flight into the depression found winds of 65 mph (100 km/h); this was deemed unrepresentative of the actual intensity as it was recorded in a squall line. The depression became disorganized once more and by September 6, it was no longer identifiable on satellites.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Preliminary Report, Page Two|year=1983|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=November 1, 2008|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1982-prelim/beryl/prelim02.gif| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019231406/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1982-prelim/beryl/prelim02.gif| archivedate= 19 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Early in its duration, Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds on the Cape Verde island of Sal. The storm caused moderate damage across the archipelago, totaling $3 million (1982 USD).[tpl]cite web|author=EM-DAT: the International Disaster Database|year=2007|title=Disaster List for Cape Verde|publisher=Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters|accessdate=March 8, 2007|url=http://www.em-dat.net/index.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070205033058/http://www.em-dat.net/index.htm| archivedate= 5 February 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The passage of Beryl resulted in three casualties in Brava Island, as well as 122 injuries.Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (1992).

===Tropical Depression Three===

This system formed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 6 to the southeast of Tropical Storm Beryl in the tropical North Atlantic ocean. The depression moved northeast of the Leeward Islands during the afternoon of September 7 while experiencing southwest vertical wind shear, and moved into the southwest North Atlantic before dissipating east of the Bahamas on September 9.
 

===Tropical Storm Chris===

A surface low pressure area developed on September 8 in the Gulf of Mexico. It drifted westward, and the next day it organized into a subtropical depression. Under the influence of a trough of low pressure, the depression turned northward, and after steadily becoming better organized it transitioned into Tropical Storm Chris by late on September 10. The storm attained peak winds of [tpl]convert|65|mph|km/h[/tpl] before moving ashore near Sabine Pass in Texas. Chris continued inland until it dissipated over central Arkansas on September 13. Prior to making landfall, as many as 6,500 people evacuated from southern Louisiana, while offshore many oil workers were evacuated inland.
Chris produced moderate rainfall along its path, peaking at [tpl]convert|16|in|mm[/tpl] in Delhi, Louisiana, with totals of over [tpl]convert|10|in|mm[/tpl] in Mississippi and Tennessee. The rainfall caused locally severe flooding as far inland as Tennessee and Kentucky, with flooding of some rivers reported. The storm spawned nine tornadoes, of which four were F2 or stronger on the Fujita scale. Upon moving ashore, the hurricane produced a [tpl]convert|5|ft|m[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|6|ft|m[/tpl] storm tide, resulting in severe damage to several boats in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout its path, damage totaled $2 million (1982 USD).
 

===Hurricane Debby===

A tropical wave moved westward offshore the coast of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, brushing Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at [tpl]convert|130|mph|km/h[/tpl]. Hurricane Debby was the only known hurricane on record to reach category 4 north of 38°N latitude, at 38°8 North. Debby was also the second northernmost known category 4 hurricane Atlantic hurricane, behind Hurricane Ella of 1978. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed on September 18. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby merged with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.
The precursor disturbance to Debby dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at [tpl]convert|12.86|in|mm[/tpl] in the southwestern portion of the island.David Roth (2006).

===Tropical Storm Ernesto===

A tropical wave formed off the coast of Africa on September 23. The west side of the wave expanded and was declared as Tropical Depression Six on September 30. The depression intensified, making a sharp turn on October 1. An Air Force plane found [tpl]convert|40|mph|km/h[/tpl] winds with a pressure of [tpl]convert|1003|hPa|inHg[/tpl] and the depression was given the name Ernesto. A second Air Force plane on October 2 found [tpl]convert|71|mph|km/h[/tpl] winds with a pressure of [tpl]convert|997|mb|inHg[/tpl]. By October 3, Ernesto was not identifiable after merging with an extratropical low. Ernesto never approached land and caused no reported damage.Miles B. Lawrence (1983).

==Storm names==

The following names were used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1982. These names were used again in the 1988 season. This is the first time this name set was used since the post-1978 naming change, except for Florence and Helene which had been previously used in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1964. Names that were not assigned are marked in [tpl]tcname unused[/tpl].

===Retirement===
