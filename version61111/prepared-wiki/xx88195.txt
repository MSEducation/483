[[Emerald railway station]]

CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne

Emerald Station is situated on the Puffing Billy Railway in Victoria, Australia.  It was opened with the Railway on 18 December 1900 and comprised a platform track and a loop siding.  A passing loop was added between the two a few years later. There was also a spur siding off the Down end of No. 3 Road. Two standard 12 ft by 20Â ft timber portable station buildings with a Van Goods Shed between (all adjoining) were provided on the platform and a Goods Shed on the No. 3 Road loop siding. Other buildings included Tea Rooms, lamp room and toilets along with a cattle race and loading bank. The station building was later reduced in length by one of the portables which housed the General and Ladies' waiting rooms.

==Overview==

Emerald today remains very similar to the early days, but has had other Roads added into a Carriage Workshops, a turntable and storage sidings.  Also, a Signal and Telegraph Branch depot in the form of a large Goods Shed and a multi-purpose yard building in the form of a Locomotive Depot administration building have been added.  During 2009, the station building underwent stage one of an internal restoration to its former glory.
