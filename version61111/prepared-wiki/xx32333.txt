</ref> In return, as an example of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], the corals shelter the zooxanthellae, averaging one million for every cubic centimeter of coral, and provide a constant supply of the [[carbon dioxide]] they need for photosynthesis.
Corals also absorb nutrients, including inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, directly from water. Many corals extend their tentacles at night to catch zooplankton that brush them when the water is agitated. Zooplankton provide the polyp with nitrogen, and the polyp shares some of the nitrogen with the zooxanthellae, which also require this element.Castro, Peter and Huber, Michael (2000) Marine Biology. 3rd ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill. The varying pigments in different species of zooxanthellae give them an overall brown or golden-brown appearance, and give brown corals their colors. Other pigments such as reds, blues, greens, etc. come from colored proteins made by the coral animals. Coral which loses a large fraction of its zooxanthellae becomes white (or sometimes pastel shades in corals that are richly pigmented with their own colorful proteins) and is said to be bleached, a condition which, unless corrected, can kill the coral.
Sponges are another key: they live in crevices in the coral reefs. They are efficient filter feeders, and in the Red Sea they consume about 60% of the phytoplankton that drifts by. The sponges eventually excrete nutrients in a form the corals can use.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/11/1107_keyholecoral.html |title=Rich Coral Reefs in Nutrient-Poor Water: Paradox Explained? |first=John |last=Roach |publisher=National Geographic News |date=November 7, 2001 |accessdate=April 5, 2011[/tpl]
The roughness of coral surfaces is the key to coral survival in agitated waters. Normally, a boundary layer of still water surrounds a submerged object, which acts as a barrier. Waves breaking on the extremely rough edges of corals disrupt the boundary layer, allowing the corals access to passing nutrients. Turbulent water thereby promotes reef growth and branching. Without the nutritional gains brought by rough coral surfaces, even the most effective recycling would leave corals wanting in nutrients.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523612.100-corals-play-rough-over-darwins-paradox.html |title=Corals play rough over Darwin's paradox |first=Rachel |last2=Nowak |issue=2361 |journal=New Scientist date=21 September 2002 [/tpl]

Similarly, as internal waves and bores move vertically, surface-dwelling larval organisms are carried toward the shore.

Coral reefs also often depend on surrounding habitats, such as seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, for nutrients. Seagrass and mangroves supply dead plants and animals which are rich in nitrogen and also serve to feed fish and animals from the reef by supplying wood and vegetation. Reefs, in turn, protect mangroves and seagrass from waves and produce sediment in which the mangroves and seagrass can root.[tpl]cite book |title=Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs |first1=Sue |last1=Wells |first2=Nick |last2=Hanna | publisher=Sterling Publishing Company |year=1992 | isbn=0-8069-8795-2 [/tpl]

==Biodiversity==

Coral reefs form some of the world's most productive ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine habitats that support a wide range of other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals, which, for example, may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.[tpl]cite book | author=Hatcher, B.G. Johannes, R.E.; Robertson, A.J.| chapter=Conservation of Shallow-water Marine Ecosystems | title=Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review | volume=27 | publisher=Routledge | year=1989 | isbn=0-08-037718-1 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=XpmNqFaDZ7cC&pg=PA320 | page=320[/tpl]
Reefs are home to a large variety of animals, including fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods), echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, mammals are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception. A few of these varied species feed directly on corals, while others graze on algae on the reef. Reef biomass is positively related to species diversity.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110405130347.htm | title=World's Reef Fishes Tussling With Human Overpopulation | journal=ScienceDaily | date=Apr 5, 2011[/tpl]
The same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at different times of day. Nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day, while damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses and parrotfish hide from eels and sharks.[tpl]rp|49[/tpl]

===Algae===

Reefs are chronically at risk of algal encroachment. Overfishing and excess nutrient supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.coral.noaa.gov/component/content/article/138.html |title=Coral Reef Biology |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=April 6, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Glynn |first=P.W. |year=1990 |title=Ecosystems of the World v. 25-Coral Reefs |editor-first=Z. |editor-last=Dubinsky |publisher=Elsevier Science |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-444-87392-7[/tpl] In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Algae-Dominated Reefs | first1=Peter S. | last1=Vroom| first2=Kimberly N. | last2=Page | first3=Jean C. | last3=Kenyon | first4=Russell E. |last4=Brainard | journal=American Scientist | year=2006 | volume=94 | issue=5 | pages=430–437|doi=10.1511/2006.61.1004[/tpl] The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macroalgae.

===Sponges===

Sponges are essential for the functioning of the coral reef's ecosystem.  Algae and corals in coral reefs produce organic material. This is filtered through sponges which convert this organic material into small particles which in turn are absorbed by algae and corals.[tpl]cite journal |title=How the sponge stays slim |year=2009 |author=Kaplan, Matt |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/news.2009.1088[/tpl]

===Fish===

Over 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs. The reasons for this diversity remain controversial. Hypotheses include the "lottery", in which the first (lucky winner) recruit to a territory is typically able to defend it against latecomers, "competition", in which adults compete for territory, and less-competitive species must be able to survive in poorer habitat, and "predation", in which population size is a function of postsettlement piscivore mortality.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.marinebiology.org/fishecology.htm |first= Jason |last=Buchheim |publisher=marinebiology.org |title=Coral Reef Fish Ecology |accessdate=April 5, 2011[/tpl] Healthy reefs can produce up to 35 tons of fish per square kilometer each year, but damaged reefs produce much less.

===Invertebrates===

Sea urchins, Dotidae and sea slugs eat seaweed. Some species of sea urchins, such as Diadema antillarum, can play a pivotal part in preventing algae from overrunning reefs.[ref]
