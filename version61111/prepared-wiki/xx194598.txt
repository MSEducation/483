CATEGORIES: Wildlife rehabilitation, Zambezi basin, Rhodesia

Operation Noah was a wildlife rescue operation in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) lasting from 1958 to 1964, caused by the creation of Lake Kariba on the Zambezi by the Kariba Dam.  In the late 1950s, North and South Rhodesia (present-day Zambia and Zimbabwe) became home to the world’s largest man-made dam - a hydroelectric power station built across the Zambezi River, about 400 km from Victoria Falls. It provided power for most of the country, but in the process form Lake Kariba and flood the Zambezi Valley – home to thousands of native animals. In a wildlife rescue operation lasting 5 years, over 6000 animals were rescued and relocated to the mainland.Operation Noah
