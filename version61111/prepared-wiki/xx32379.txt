The North Slope Borough is the largest county-level political subdivision in the United States by area, with a larger land area than that of the state of Utah (itself the 13th largest state in the nation). Although the adjacent Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area is larger in area, it has no borough-level government. The borough is also the third-least densely populated county-level entity in the United States (after the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area and the Lake and Peninsula Borough).
