CATEGORIES: Saints Row, Action-adventure games, Open world video games, Video game franchises

Saints Row is a video game series created by Volition, Inc. and published by Deep Silver, that tells the story of a gang called the Third Street Saints, the title comes from the name of the district of the gangs home territory. Typically, gameplay is presented in an open world format; because of the mixture of nonlinear gameplay with action-adventure and racing sequences, the series is referred to as being a Grand Theft Auto clone. The series is well known for its comedic elements, the games' stories are written as comedies that feature popular culture homages and parodies, as well as self-referential humor. The series takes place in the same universe as the Red Faction series also created by Volition, with many themes and plots crossing-over between the two franchises.
After completing Red Faction II in late 2002, developer Volition began work on the original Saints Row game in mid-2003. The game was released in 2006 to critical acclaim and commercial success. The sequel, Saints Row 2, was released in 2008 to similar acclaim but greater commercial success. The series' third entry, Saints Row: The Third was released on November 15, 2011. The series' most recent entry, Saints Row IV was released on August 20, 2013. As of September 2013, the series has had unit sales in excess of thirteen million, making it a best-selling video game franchise.

===Saints Row===

Saints Row was the first installment in the series as a whole, having begun development in mid-2003 as a PlayStation 2 title under the name Bling Bling.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/717127p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #2 |last=Lawrance |first=Alan |date=7 July 2006 |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl] The game was first announced at E3 2005 for the Xbox 360. As the first sandbox style video game to be released for the Xbox 360, Saints Row was widely anticipated; its pre-beta demo build set records after being downloaded nearly 400,000 times within a week.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/xbox360/action/saintsrow/news.html?sid=6156122&mode=all |title=Saints Row demo sets record |last=Surette |first=Tim |date=21 August 2006 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl] It had sales in excess of 500,000 during its September 2006 release month, and was critically acclaimed.

The game is set in the fictional city Stilwater, located in the state of Michigan. The player character is inducted into the 3rd Street Saints gang after they save his life, and assists the Saints in eliminating three rival gangs that control the city. After the gangs have been eliminated, police chief Monroe kidnaps the Saints founder Julius Little and offers the player to exchange the gang leader's freedom for mayor Marshall Winslow's life. After Winslow is assassinated, Monroe is murdered by the Saints, and Julius is freed. The other Saints members look towards the player character, considering him their new leader. The new mayor Richard Hughes invites the player character aboard his private yacht and Julius betrays the player by blowing the yacht up and killing everyone but the protagonist on board. The game was renowned for being the first seventh-generation sandbox game, and introduces new features which have since become staples to the genre. It introduces online multiplayer, an in-game mobile phone, GPS navigation, and elaborate character and vehicle customization.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/649/649707p1.html |title=Saints Row Hands-On |last=Onyett |first=Chales |date=9 September 2005 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=22 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/705/705933p1.html |title=E3 2006: Saints Row Hands-On |last=Miller |first=Johnathan |date=9 May 2006 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=23 July 2010[/tpl]

===Saints Row 2===

Saints Row 2 began development in mid-2006, a few months before the Xbox 360 release of Saints Row.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/368501/feeding-your-id-in-saints-row-2 | title= Feeding your ID in Saints' Row 2 |last=Wilson |first=Mark |date=17 March 2008 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=17 March 2008 [/tpl] While a PlayStation 3 port of Saints Row was in development, it was cancelled when Saints Row 2 was first officially confirmed in May 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/saints-row-ps3-canned-sequel-confirmed |title=Saints Row PS3 Canned, Sequel Confirmed |publisher=Next Generation Magazine |first=Kris |last=Graft |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2007[/tpl] A Microsoft Windows port, announced in June 2008, eventually released in the early months of 2009. Three downloadable content packs were developed and launched in mid-2009 (for console only), including Ultor Exposed and Corporate Warfare.
Saints Row 2 is set five years[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] after Saints Row; the player character awakes from a coma in a prison hospital having survived the yacht explosion. After escaping the prison, the player character saves Johnny Gat before his execution and together they begin to revive the 3rd Street Saints along with Carlos, Shaundi, and Pierce. Through a course of events, reclaim Stilwater from three new gangs(The Sons of Samedi, The Ronin, and The Brotherhood) that have had the city under their control. The Ultor Corporation, responsible for the redevelopment of the Saint's Row district, attempt to extinguish the Saints. However, a press conference held by Ultor's CEO Dane Vogel is interrupted when the Saints assault it, culminating in Vogel's assassination via the player shooting him and him falling out of the Ultor building, and the game's conclusion, in which the Saints now run Stilwater once more. The game builds upon the fundamentals of Saints Row by improving the respect system, adding more varied activities, increasing the extent to which the player can customize their character, gang, and vehicles, and adding a number of new vehicle models. It expands the Stilwater setting and adds new gameplay features and content.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/895/895367p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 UK Hands-on |last=Robinson |first =Martin |date=31 July 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=31 July 2008[/tpl]

===Saints Row: The Third===

Saints Row: The Third was officially announced in March 2011. It was released in North America on 15 November 2011, then in Europe on 18 November 2011, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows platforms.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2011/03/03/thq-formally-announces-saints-row-the-third/ | title = THQ formally announces Saints Row: The Third | first = Johnny | last = Cullen | date = 3 March 2011 | accessdate = 2 March 2011 | publisher = VG247 [/tpl] The game began early development at Volition in September 2008, a month before Saints Row 2 was due to release.[tpl]cite web |url=http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ |title=Dan Sutton on Saints Row 2 |last=Guttridge |first=Luke |date=25 September 2008 |publisher=Play.tm |accessdate=25 July 2009[/tpl] The player again controls the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, who have grown from their humble roots as a street gang into a worldwide crime group. The story centers around the conflict between the Saints and the Syndicate, a rival crime group who seek to take advantage of the Saints' influence. Though the first two Saints Row games were set in the fictional city of Stilwater, Saints Row: The Third is set in a new city named Steelport.  Steelport is run by three gangs, much like Stilwater was in Saints Row and Saints Row 2, yet these gangs—Morning Star, the Deckers and  the Luchadores—are all under the control of the Syndicate. Later on in the game, a Division of the Military known as S.T.A.G. is called to Steelport by authorities in an attempt to eradicate all of the gangs in the city.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archivce/2011/03/02/april-cover-saints-third789.aspx | title=April Cover Reveal - Saints Row: The Third | last=Ryckert | first=Dan | date=2 March 2011 | publisher=Game Informer | accessdate=2 March 2011 [/tpl]

===Saints Row IV===

Saints Row IV was officially unveiled in March 2013 and released in North America on August 20, 2013 and worldwide shortly after on August 23. The game is set four years after the events of Saints Row: The Third. After the Saints stop a terrorist attack by Cyrus Temple on the United States, the Saints leader has been elected president. Soon after, an alien invasion occurs and the earth is overrun.[tpl]cite web|author=Daniel Nye Griffiths|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/03/15/saints-row-4-august-launch-announced/|title=Saints Row 4: August Launch Announced|publisher=Forbes|date=2013-03-15|accessdate=2013-03-18[/tpl] The majority of the game is set in a simulation of Steelport created by the aliens to break the Saints' wills. In this simulation the Saints must fight against the enemy gangs of their past and their own worst fears.

===Fifth game===

On July 5, 2013, Volition's Scott Phillips spoke to Gamereactor and stated that a fifth Saints Row game would "probably continue series in a different direction." In a preview for Saints Row IV with Rev3Games, after being asked where the series can possibly go after IV and if Volition feels if they "have painted themselves into a corner", Volition lead systems designer Dave Bianchi responded by saying "people said that a lot after Saints Row: The Third, 'where could you possibly go from Saints Row: The Third?'"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJWsP-OEAdY
In December 2013, comedian Jay Mohr, who voices Dane Vogel, revealed that he is doing voice work for the next Saints Row game.http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/23/comedian-jay-mohr-joins-star-studded-saints-row-cast/

==Gameplay==

The Saints Row series is part of a genre known as sandbox games. The series combines elements of action, adventure and vehicular gameplay. The player can freely roam the virtual world on foot or by use of vehicles and make use of an array of weapon and mêlée based combat. Illegal activity such as engaging computer-controlled civilians and police officers will instigate a proactive and potentially lethal response from authoritative figures. In the instance of death or arrest, the player will respawn at a nearby hospital or police station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617784p1.html |title=E3 2005: Saints Row First Look |last=Perry |first=Douglas |date=20 May 2005 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=19 July 2009[/tpl]
An emphasis is put on urban warfare; the player character is affiliated with a hip-hop cultured street gang known as the 3rd Street Saints. Game missions are structurally divided into separate mission arcs. These mission arcs do not intertwine but can be played through altogether at once or separately by the player. Missions are unlocked by accruing respect points; respect is game currency earned by playing non-story mini-games known as activities and diversions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/368501/feeding-your-id-in-saints-row-2 |title=Feeding your ID in Saints Row 2 |last=Wilson |first=Mark |date=17 March 2008 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=18 March 2008[/tpl] Customization also constitutes a large portion of gameplay. The player has the ability to customize their character's appearance and clothing, can take certain vehicles to chop shops for modification and in Saints Row 2 is able to decorate the interior of in-game safehouses and refine the behaviour of the Third Street Saints gang.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/856/856491p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 First Look |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |date=23 March 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=23 March 2008[/tpl]

==Setting==

The setting of both Saints Row and Saints Row 2 is the fictional city of Stilwater, located in the mid-western state of Michigan, USA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Saints-Row/feature-8822.html |title=Saint's Row Q&A Feature |last=Leyton |first=Chris |date=2 July 2006 |publisher= TotalVideoGames |accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] Stilwater is primarily based on the real-world American cities Chicago and Detroit. During the early development process of Saints Row, the city was designed before the script was assembled and was more than four times the size of its final revision but was cropped to a smaller revision because development resources could not support a city of that size.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/715237p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #1 |last=Stockman |first=Christopher |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] During its development phase the city went through consistent expansion and cropping; examples such as the shopping mall and trailer park districts in Saints Row 2[tpl]'[/tpl]s city revision were originally included in early designs of Saints Row[tpl]'[/tpl]s city revision. A design challenge was creating the city without load-screen interferences and as such the engine was designed to stream around the player's location in individual chunks of the city. The city was designed to feel diverse and have a variance of districts; Saints Row product art director Matt Flegel commented that "We wanted the city to cover all styles, from the towering sky scrapers of downtown to the gritty industrial feel of the factory district. We want the player to feel the changes between the districts, rather than just noticing the visual difference."[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/723425p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #5 |last=Flegel |first=Matt |date=4 August 2006 |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=27 July 2009[/tpl] The districts were also designed to feel relevant to the gangs that controlled them.
The Stilwater of Saints Row 2 is significantly different from its original rendition; the city is 45% bigger than its older counterpart.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/863/863027p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 Details |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |date=28 March 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=28 March 2008[/tpl] Much of the city from Saints Row is redeveloped in Saints Row 2, albeit becoming more "alive" and full of depth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://community.saintsrow.com/blogs/?p=245 |title=Developer Blog - "Creating the Dynamic City of Stilwater" |date=7 October 2008 |last=Claflin |first=Chris |publisher=Saints Row Community |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl] Saints Row 2 lead producer Greg Donovan said that "Stilwater in Saints Row 2 is very different from Saints Row. In fact, every detail has been touched to some degree or another. ... I think that what will end up happening is that people who played Saints Row or are fans of the franchise are going to have a great time exploring the city and looking for new things. Also, people that are new to Saints Row 2 are just going to be presented with a huge, very dispersive and very different looking environment, it's very well polished and detailed."[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/882586/saints-row-2/videos/saints2.html |title=Saints Row 2 Xbox 360 Interview |author= IGN Xbox 360 |date=5 April 2008 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=16 August 2009[/tpl]  There are no in-game load screens in Saints Row 2,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.game-over.com/reviews/ps3/Saints_Row_2.html |title= Saints Row 2 Review |last= Garbutt |first=Russell |date=27 October 2008 |publisher=GameOver Online |accessdate=16 August 2009[/tpl] a notable feat as the game allows for seamless co-operative play.

The game Saints Row: The Third is set in the sister city of Steelport, a city that flourished in the 1800s and has since succumbed to economic failure. Steelport's districts are almost distinctly the same, and the city size is smaller than Stilwater but has larger buildings. Steelport's most memorable feature is the large statue on Magarac Island, south-east of downtown Steelport. The statue is that of steel worker Joe Magarac and is a parody of the real-life Statue of Liberty. The overall design and look of Steelport can be changed via progressing through the story. At certain points the player is allowed to choose whether to do one thing over the other, which will change how Steelport's skyline appears. Some of these choices include deciding whether to keep or blow up the Syndicate Tower. A large military ship named the Thermopylae will be located south-east of Steelport after completing the first STAG mission, "Gang Bang".
Saints Row IV is once again set in Steelport, however the city is set in a simulation under control of Zinyak, the game's main villain. Zinyak has changed Steelport to fit his likeness removing all signs of the Saints from the city and replacing them with images of himself, and alien technology can be seen heavily throughout the city. The city of Stilwater returns for one mission of the game.
