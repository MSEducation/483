The Chiefdoms of Sierra Leone are the third-level units of administration in Sierra Leone. The paramount chiefs and the ruling families in the chiefdoms were recognized and empowered by the British colonial administration when it organized the Protectorate of Sierra Leone in 1896.Tristan Reed and James A. Robinson, The Chiefdoms of Sierra Leone, Scholar, Harvard University, 15 July 2013, Document available online, accessed 30 April 2014 Typically, chiefs have the power to "raise taxes, control the judicial system, and allocate land, the most important resource in rural areas."
The hereditary paramount chiefs and their sub-chiefs have effectively been the sole local government in Sierra Leone until 2004, when the World Bank sponsored creation of elected local councils. Local notables, known as the Tribal Authority, elect paramount chiefs for life from among the ruling families in each chieftaincy recognized by the British administration in 1896. Some chieftaincies have several ruling families, and the differences among them in terms of economic progress has been subject to study in 2013.Daron Acemoglu, Tristan Reed. and James A. Robinson. "Chiefs: Economic Development and Elite Control of Civil Society in Sierra Leone", Stanford University, 29 August 2013, accessed 30 April 2014 They found there was a positive relationship between the number of ruling families in a chieftaincy and educational, health and economic outcomes in terms of human capital.Acemoglu et al. (2013), "Chiefs: Economic Development", p. 4
