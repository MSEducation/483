TLC is an American girl group whose repertoire spans R&B, hip hop, soul, funk and new jack swing. TLC originally comprised singer Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins, rapper Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes and singer Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas. The group was very successful in the 1990s and early 2000s in spite of numerous spats with the law, each other, and the group's record label.
TLCs debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip, sold 6 million copies worldwide and spawned the hit singles "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", "Baby-Baby-Baby" and "What About Your Friends".[tpl]cite news|title=TLC Reveal Title and Track-listing For New Collection Inspired By Upcoming VH1 Biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story|url=http://www.sony.com/SCA/company-news/press-releases/epic-records/2013/tlc-reveal-title-and-track-listing-for-new-collect.shtml|accessdate=February 21, 2014|newspaper=Sony|date=September 23, 2013|agency=PR Newswire[/tpl] This success was surpassed by their second album, CrazySexyCool, which was certified diamond by the RIAA — a first for a female group. Buoyed by the top 5 singles "Creep", "Red Light Special", "Diggin' on You", and '"Waterfalls", it eventually sold 23 million copies worldwide. Five years later, in 1999, the group released their third album FanMail which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart and sold more than 11 million copies worldwide with the hit singles "No Scrubs" and "Unpretty". The subsequent tour became the highest grossing tour of all time by a female band. In 2002, Lopes died in a car accident in Honduras. Seven months later, T-Boz and Chilli released the group's fourth album 3D, which sold 2 million copies worldwide, scored the Top 20 hit "Girl Talk", and earned two Grammy Awards nominations. It featured previously unreleased vocals from Left Eye.
Billboard magazine ranked TLC as one of the greatest musical trios.[tpl]cite web |title=Billboard Greatest Trios of All Time|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/tlc.jsp|work=Billboard |accessdate=2008-05-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430084126/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/greatesttrios/2006/tlc.jsp  |archivedate = April 30, 2008[/tpl] Between 1990 and 2002, the band had ten top ten singles, four number one singles, four multi-platinum albums, and won five Grammy Awards. At the end of 1999, TLC was ranked as the seventh most successful act of the 1990s by Billboard. In 2008, the group was inducted into the All Time Hot 100 Artist Hall of Fame by the same magazine, at 56th place. That year it was also listed as the #25 R&B/hip-hop artist of the preceding 25 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-60.shtml|title=The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-11-17[/tpl] According to the RIAA, TLC has sold more than 23 million albums and 6.5 million singles in the United States alone.http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=TLC&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 Worldwide they have sold more than 65 million records[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-tlc-plans-first-album-in-10-years-20121105,0,4416635.story|title=TLC Plans First Album in 10 Years|first=Gerrick|last=Kennedy|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=2012-11-05[/tpl] and are ranked as the best-selling American female group of all time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1683858/left-eye-tlc-death.jhtml|title=TLC’s Left Eye Remembered: 10 Years Later|first=Rebecca|last=Thomas|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)|date=2012-04-25|accessdate=2012-07-11[/tpl] In 2012, TLC ranked 12th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and as the number-one all-girl group.[tpl]cite web|last=Graham |first=Mark |url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-02-13/vh1s-100-greatest-women-in-music-complete-list/ |title=The 100 Greatest Women In Music | VH1 Tuner |publisher=Vh1.com |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2013-05-31[/tpl]

==History==

In 1990, Atlanta, Georgia–based record producer Ian Burke and one of his clients, a teenager named Crystal Jones, came up with a concept for a girl group with a tomboyish, hip-hop image, similar to the blend of contemporary R&B and hip-hop music of new jack swing act Bell Biv DeVoe. Jones put out a call for two more girls to join her in this trio. Her request was eventually answered by Tionne Watkins, a native of Des Moines, Iowa, who moved to Atlanta with her family at an early age, and Lisa Lopes, a rapper who had just moved to the city from her native Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with only a keyboard and US$750 ($[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|750|1990|r=0[/tpl][/tpl] today). Calling the group "2nd Nature", Jones, Watkins, and Lopes began working with producers Jermaine Dupri and Rico Wade on demo tape material.Hood, Danni (Producer).

Retrieved 11-02-2013. the group eventually managed to arrange an audition with singer Perri "Pebbles" Reid, who had started her own management and production company, Pebbitone. Impressed by the girls, Reid renamed the group "TLC-Skee" (with "TLC" being an acronym of each of their names) and arranged an audition for them with local record label LaFace Records, run by Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds and Perri Reid's then-husband, Antonio "L.A." Reid. The latter Reid saw potential in Watkins and Lopes but felt that Jones should be replaced. According to Jones, she decided to leave the act after not being allowed to take home the contracts Pebbitone had drafted for the group for review;  Watkins' recollection is that both she and Lopes asked Jones to leave the group before their initial contracts were negotiated.
On February 28, 1991, Watkins and Lopes signed production, management, and publishing deals with Pebbitone,Tionne WATKINS (T’Boz), Lisa Lopes (Left Eye), Rozonda Thomas (Chilli), Debtors. v. LaFace Records, Pebbitone, Inc., Peri Reid d/b/a Pebbitone Music, Movants (In re Watkins), 390 210 BR 394 (Bankr.

As they looked for a replacement for Jones, the two-member TLC-Skee made its first on-record appearance on a track for LaFace act Damian Dame's self-titled 1991 LP.Heyliger, Cass (06-05-2013). Time: Damian Dame, “Right Down to It”. Pop Dose. Retrieved 11-02-2013. The group found its missing third member in Rozonda Thomas, one of Damian Dame's part-time backup dancers.
Thomas was signed to the act in April 1991, at about which time the group's name was shortened to "TLC". To keep the meaning behind the TLC name being an acronym for the girls' names, Thomas was christened with the nickname "Chilli", while Watkins became "T-Boz" and Lopes was named "Left Eye". The girls were signed to LaFace in May 1991 through a production deal with Pebbitone and immediately went into the studio with producers Reid and Edmonds, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Marl to produce their first album.

===1991–94: Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip===

The first TLC album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC tip, was released on February 25, 1992, by LaFace. The songs on the album are a blend of funk (Watkins), hip-hop (Lopes), and R&B (Thomas), similar to the "new jack swing" sound popularized by producer Teddy Riley in the late 1980s (and TLC's sound was sometimes cited as an example of the "new jack swing" genre).[tpl]cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy |title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=2008|page=473|isbn=1-55652-754-3[/tpl] The album was a critical and commercial success, being certified quadruple-platinum within a year and launching a number of US Hot 100 top-ten singles with "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", "What About Your Friends", and "Baby-Baby-Baby" which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100.
TLC's lyrics, chiefly written by Lopes and Dallas Austin, were playful, female-empowering anthems characterized by Lopes's quirky, nasal-toned raps, Watkins's low-voiced lead vocals, and Thomas's powerful vocals and harmonization. The musical formula was augmented by the girls' brightly colored videos and curious costuming: each girl wore wrapped condoms on their clothing (Lopes also wore one over her left eye in a pair of glasses).
During TLC's first national tour, as MC Hammer's opening act, Lopes and Thomas discovered that Watkins had sickle-cell disease, an ailment which she kept a closely guarded secret until she became ill while TLC was touring the Southwest US. Watkins continued to battle her condition and eventually became a spokesperson for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America in the late 1990s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131161,00.html|title=T-Boz: Singer |date=2000-05-08|publisher=people.com|accessdate=2008-10-26[/tpl] She was hospitalized, Lopes and Thomas stayed with her and did not perform as the opening act for a few shows. At the conclusion of the tour, TLC decided to take more control of their careers and thus informed Perri Reid that they no longer wished her to be their manager. Reid released the group from its management deal, but they remained signed to Pebbitone, and Reid continued to receive a share of their earnings. Also in 1994, TLC played the musical group "Sex as a Weapon" in the New Line Cinema feature film House Party 3, starring Kid 'n Play.

===1993–96: CrazySexyCool===

Lopes began dating Atlanta Falcons American football player Andre Rison shortly after the release of Oooohhh... On the TLC Tip, and by 1994 the two were living together in Rison's upscale double-story home. Their relationship was allegedly filled with violent moments, and Lopes filed an assault charge against Rison on September 2, 1993. Rison denied battering her. Lopes was also battling alcoholism at the time. She had been a heavy drinker since the age of fifteen. After another fight between the couple in the early morning hours of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison's newly purchased shoes into a bathtub, doused them with lighter fluid, and lit them on fire. The plexiglas bathtub quickly melted and set the structural frame of the house on fire. Lopes was arrested and indicted on charges of first-degree arson; she was sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. Rison eventually reconciled with Lopes, and they continued dating on and off for seven years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/print_friendly.php?id=3970|title=Over the Waterfall|last=Jones|first=Solomon |publisher=philadelphiaweekly.com|accessdate=2008-10-27[/tpl]
During early 1994, TLC re-entered the studio with Dallas Austin, Tim & Bob, Arnold Hennings, Jermaine Dupri, Babyface, Jon-John Robinson, Organized Noize, and Sean "Puffy" Combs to record their second album, CrazySexyCool. Lopes was released from rehab to attend the recording sessions, but the finished album featured significantly less of her raps and vocals. The album instead focused more on the contributions from Watkins and Thomas, and had a smoother, more fluid sound, similar to the most successful single from the first album, the US #2 hit "Baby-Baby-Baby".[tpl]cite web|url=[tpl]BillboardURLbyName|artist=tlc|chart=all[/tpl]|title=Artist Chart History – TLC|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=2008-10-27[/tpl] All four singles from CrazySexyCool reached the top 5 of the US Hot 100, while "Creep" and "Waterfalls" peaked at no. 1, while Red Light Special reached no. 2 and "Diggin' on You" reached no. 5. "Waterfalls", an Organized Noise-produced song that featured an old-school soul-based musical arrangement, socially conscious lyrics criticizing drug dealing and unsafe sex, and an introspective rap from Lopes, became TLC's biggest hit, and its million-dollar music video was an MTV staple for many months. Also in 1994, TLC recorded the theme song to Nickelodeon's popular sketch comedy All That which was produced and co-written by Arnold Hennings which ran for ten seasons.
CrazySexyCool eventually sold over 11 million copies in the US, and became one of the first albums to ever receive a diamond certification from the RIAA, and won a 1996 Grammy Award for Best R&B Album and a 1996 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group for "Creep".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=TLC&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=TLC Grammy Award Wins|publisher=grammy.com|accessdate=2009-01-27[/tpl] However, in the midst of their apparent success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mbhs.bergtraum.k12.ny.us/cybereng/nyt/rapper01.htm |title=Does Going 'Broke' Mean Artist Really Doesn't Have Any Money? |author=Henriques, Diana B. and Samuels, Anita M. |date=February 5, 1996 |publisher=New York Times |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041010081842/http://mbhs.bergtraum.k12.ny.us/cybereng/nyt/rapper01.htm |archivedate = October 10, 2004[/tpl]

===Bankruptcy===

They declared debts totaling $3.5 million, much of it because of Lopes' insurance payments arising from the arson incident and Watkins' medical bills, but the primary reason being that each member of the group was taking home less than $35,000 a year after paying managers, producers, expenses, and taxes. They sought to renegotiate their 1991 contract with LaFace, under which they only received a maximum of eight percent of the revenues from their album sales—considerably less than most major recording contracts—and to dissolve their association with Pebbitone. Most record companies would re-negotiating record contracts when the artist achieved significant record sales, but LaFace Records refused to meet the demands of TLC, thus prompting the filing of the bankruptcy petition.http://www.meiea.org/Journal/html_ver/Vol01_No01/Vol_1_No_1_A6.html  Both Pebbitone and LaFace countered that TLC simply wanted more money and were in no real financial danger, resulting in two years of legal debates before the cases were finally settled in late 1996. TLC's contract was renegotiated and their production deal with Pebbitone and Perri Reid (who had separated from her husband by this time) was rescinded.
The group appeared on the Waiting to Exhale soundtrack with "This Is How It Works" (a song written by Babyface and Lopes) and was set to re-enter the recording studio the following year after signing a new contract with LaFace/Arista.

===1997–00: FanMail===

Preliminary work on TLC's third album, FanMail, was delayed when friction arose between the group and their main producer Dallas Austin, who was by this time dating Thomas and helping to raise their young son Tron. Austin wanted $4.2 million and creative control to work on the project, resulting in a stand-off between the producer and the artists. During this period, Thomas appeared in the independent film HavPlenty, and Watkins co-starred in Hype Williams (who later directed the "No Scrubs" video)' 1998 film Belly with rappers Nas and DMX. Watkins made a solo song a year earlier called "Touch Myself". Lopes started her own Production Company Left-Eye Productions artist development company and signed Blaque, a TLC-like female R&B trio. She also appeared on the "Not Tonight" remix with fellow female rappers Lil' Kim, Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott, Da Brat and Angie Martinez, which garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo, Band, or Group in 1998. She also hosted the short-lived MTV talent series The Cut which featured then-unknown recording artists Anastacia and a little-known R&B artist Ne-Yo.
TLC eventually began working with other producers for the FanMail album, until finally negotiating with Austin, who produced the bulk of FanMail and gave the album a futuristic, more pop-based feel. FanMail was released in February 1999. The album was another success for TLC, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart and selling over 6 million copies in the U.S. The album featured the number-one hit "No Scrubs", produced by Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs, and the single "Unpretty", an alternative rock-styled song about self-love written by Watkins and Dallas Austin (another version of it sampled Dennis Edwards' 1984 hit "Don't Look Any Further"), that also reached #1 on the Billboard chart. At the Lady of Soul Awards the group was honored with the Aretha Franklin Entertainer of the Year Award.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.soultrain.com/stlos/library.html|title=1998–4th Annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards|publisher=soultrain.com|accessdate=2009-05-11[/tpl]
The videos for both songs were heavily featured on MTV and BET, and three more singles received decent radio play: "Silly Ho", "I'm Good at Being Bad", and Edmonds-written ballad, "Dear Lie". At the 42nd Grammy Awards, FanMail received eight Grammy Award nominations, and won three, one for Best R&B Album and two for the global hit number-one lead single, "No Scrubs" for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The group went on a worldwide tour simply named FanMail Tour. While the first leg of the tour sold poorly and caused the group to lose $500,000 dollars, most of the second leg of the tour was sold out. The group had a PayPerView special of their tour which at the time became PayPerView's highest grossing televised special. The tour went on to gross more than $72.8 million according to Billboard, which became the highest grossing tour by a female group.
During and after the release of FanMail, Lopes made it known to the press on multiple occasions that she felt that she was unable to fully express herself working with TLC and Austin. Her contributions to the songs had been reduced to periodic eight-bar raps, and studio session singers such as Debra Killings often took her place on the background vocals for the group's songs. In its November 28, 1999 issue, Entertainment Weekly ran a letter from Lopes that challenged her group mates to record solo albums and let the fans judge which of the three was the most talented:
 "I challenge Tionne Watkins (T-boz) and Rozonda Thomas (Chilli) to an album entitled The Challenge... a 3-CD set that contains three solo albums. Each (album)... will be due to the record label by October 1, 2000... I also challenge producer Dallas Austin to produce all of the material and do it at a fraction of his normal rate. As I think about it, I'm sure LaFace would not mind throwing in a $1.5 million dollar prize for the winner."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271844,00.html|title=Three To Tangle |last=Sinclair|first=Tom|date=1999-11-26|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=2009-05-11[/tpl] 
The ladies eventually settled the feud, and The Challenge was never followed through. After the conclusion of the successful FanMail tour, the ladies, however, took some time off and pursued personal interests. Lopes was the first to begin recording her solo album, Supernova. In 2000, Spice Girl Melanie C released a single co-written with Lopes in the UK and Europe, called "Never Be the Same Again"; it became a hit reaching #1 in many countries.

===2001–04: 3D and the death of Left Eye===

Before the recording of their fourth album, 3D, Lopes originally wanted to withdraw from the group in order to see if they could duplicate their prior success without her contributions. Lopes eventually pursued solo stardom and recorded her first album Supernova, however it underperformed overseas and was never officially released in the United States. Before her second solo album was completed, Lopes died in a car crash while filming a documentary in Honduras, which would later be released as The Last Days of Left Eye in 2007 on VH1.
Returning from yet another hiatus after Lopes' death, Watkins, Thomas and Austin decided that they would complete the remainder of their fourth album, to be called 3D, which also featured production from Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, Raphael Saadiq, Missy Elliott and Timbaland. The decision was also made that TLC would retire after the release and promotion of 3D, rather than replace Lopes and continue. Lopes had already completed her vocals for four songs and the remainder were performed by the remaining group members alone, who eulogized Lopes on a number of the tracks. "3D" was released on November 12, 2002.
The first single for 3D was "Girl Talk", the video for which featured Watkins and Thomas alone in live-action segments and Lopes in animated segments. Its follow-up, "Hands Up", featured only Watkins and Thomas in its video, but took place in a nightclub named Club Lopes (Lopes' production company's "eye" logo was a prominent feature on the club's walls). The album sold two million copies in its first year of release, and "Girl Talk" was the only single to reach the U.S. top forty with a peak position of number 12; "Hands Up" never charted, and a third single, "Damaged", reached number 53. However, the singles enjoyed a bit more success in Europe and Asia. 3D went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in the US alone.
In June 2003, more than a year since the death of Left Eye, at Zootopia, an annual concert hosted by New York radio station Z100 held at Giants Stadium, TLC appeared in what was announced to be their last performance. The group, introduced by Carson Daly, showed a video montage dedicated to Lopes, and went on to perform songs against video footage of Lopes performing the same songs, and wearing the same outfits, that were appearing onstage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472227/20030602/tlc.jhtml|title=TLC Say Goodbye, Beleaguered Ja Rule Basks In Limelight At Zootopia Show|last=Reid|first=Shaheem |date=2003-06-02|publisher=mtv.com|accessdate=2009-05-11[/tpl]

===2003–08: Now & Forever: The Hits & Crazy Sexy Hits: The Very Best of TLC===

In 2004, LaFace had scheduled the release of Now and Forever: The Hits, a TLC greatest hits album with a new song, "Come Get Some", featuring Lil Jon and Sean P of the YoungBloodZ. However, the compilation was not released domestically until June 2005, although versions of the compilation were released internationally in 2004 and the album was also available as a legal download from the iTunes Store in November 2004. On June 21, 2005, Now and Forever: The Hits was quietly released in the United States; the album debuted at number 53 with 20,000 copies sold.
On June 25, 2004, Watkins and Thomas announced that they were pitching a reality television show that was eventually picked up for development by UPN. R U the Girl with Watkins and Thomas debuted on UPN on July 27, 2005. Despite media speculation that the winner of the series was to become a new, permanent member of TLC, Watkins and Thomas have vowed to never replace Lopes with a new member. The winner of the show would record with them on a new single and perform the track with them in a live concert finale in Atlanta. Roughly 4.1 million viewers tuned in for the season finale of R U The Girl on September 20, 2005, with 20-year-old Tiffany "O'so Krispie" Baker as the winner.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20050922upn03|title=O'SO KRISPIE IS CHOSEN AS THE GIRL IN "R U THE GIRL WITH T-BOZ & CHILLI" |date=2005-02-09|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2009-05-10[/tpl]
On October 4, 2005, "I Bet" was released to radio and iTunes, credited to "R U The Girl with Watkins & Thomas" with no mention of the TLC name on the package. The song was also appended to pressings of Now and Forever: The Hits released after October 11, 2005. "I Bet" failed to chart in America and Europe, ending reports that Watkins and Thomas were putting the finishing touches on a repackaged Greatest Hits album.
"I Bet", the first new TLC single released after the finale of their competition show R U the Girl, was also appended to pressings of Now and Forever: The Hits, released after October 2005. A collection of music videos, Now and Forever: The Video Hits was released in the United States on May 11, 2007, after over four years of delayed release dates.
On August 20, 2007, a new greatest hits album was released in the UK called Crazy Sexy Hits: The Very Best of TLC, a play on the group's best selling album title Crazy Sexy Cool. Now and Forever: The Video Hits was also released in the UK for the first time on the same date. The album fared better than previous compilation Now and Forever: The Hits, peaking at #57 on the UK album chart (Now and Forever: The Hits made #86).
On June 24, 2008, Watkins and Thomas made a special appearance on the BET Awards. They, along with the original members of En Vogue and SWV, performed in Alicia Keys' tribute to girl groups. Watkins, Thomas, and Keys performed "Waterfalls".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/Specials/BETAwards08/beta_ontv_showrecap.htm|title=Proven Hotness|last=Goodson|first=Dave |publisher=bet.com|accessdate=2009-05-11[/tpl] Watkins and Thomas were also presenters at the BETJ Virtual Awards on November 25, 2008.
