Esneux is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Liège. On January 1, 2006 Esneux had a total population of 13,072. The total area is [tpl]convert|34.05|km²|2|abbr=on[/tpl] which gives a population density of 384 inhabitants per km².
Esneux is constituted of a series of villages : Esneux, Mery Hony and Tilff. They are all to be found in the valley of the Ourthe river south of Liège. A railway line links the 4 villages (and then continues further south to Luxembourg).
Esneux and Tilff have seem to interests tourists, mainly for the local restaurants, the Esneux and Tilff castle, the bee-museum, and several parks. Most of these only have a local interest.
Tilff has a traffic problem, as the highway exit links to a round-about with a lot of traffic coming from both the south (Esneux) and the west (Boncelles, Angleur, ...). The local socialist parti (PS) wanted to solve this problem by a new stretch of road and a new bridge over the Ourthe river. Many inhabitants however feared that this project is of too large a scale and that the local atmosphere might change. The village now has fierce defenders of the 'new bridge', and an equally determined action committee against the plans. This last group wants the present bridge over the Ourthe river to be replaced, but without any new large scale infrastructure. These controversies might have a led to a change of coalition after the 2006 municipal elections : the PS lost some votes, the Christian democrats gained some and the liberals and the green party Ecolo where stable.
In Esneux the largest giant sequoia of Belgium can be found.Giant sequoia on the domaine du Rond Chêne
