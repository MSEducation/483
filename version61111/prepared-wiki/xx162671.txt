Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium is a college baseball stadium in Tucson, Arizona, on the campus of the University of Arizona.  Until 2011, it was the home field of the Arizona Wildcats of the Pac-10 Conference.
Opened in 1967 and originally called "Wildcat Field," the stadium was named after Frank Sancet (head coach from 1950–72) in 1986, and was renamed in 2004 to include former head coach Jerry Kindall. Beginning in the 2012 season, the Wildcat baseball team plays at Hi Corbett Field, a former spring training facility located about three miles southeast of campus;http://www.arizonawildcats.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/081011aac.html the Wildcat football program has been using Jerry Kindall Field as a football practice facility since the 2012 preseason, and the 2013 football spring game was held there, due to renovations at Arizona Stadium.

==Changes to Sancet Stadium==

The field was first modernized in 1975. In 1988, a $160,000 scoreboard, complete with a computerized message center, was purchased through advertising contracts with Gatorade and The Arizona Daily Star. Larger dugouts were added in 1990, and the stadium got its own "Green Monster" in 1995 with the installation of a wall designed to block traffic lights from adjacent Sixth Street during night games. A new, expanded press box was completed in 1997. Changes made in time for the 2006 season included an 11 x 20 ft videoboard, new batting cages and a lawn seating area (similar to those featured in some minor league, and major league spring training, ballparks); the protective wall in right field was turned into the "College World Series" wall, commemorating the Wildcat baseball program's fifteen appearances (to that date) in the CWS in Omaha, including three national championship titles in 1976, 1980, and 1986, all coached by Jerry Kindall. The Wildcats also won in 2012, their first year not at Sancet Stadium.
