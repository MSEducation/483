His recordings are available through SILENZIO distribuzione, notably the first co-titled LP records, "Musiche Sole" (with Roberto Barbanti and Letizia Bolognesi) released by Electronikaruna. The second solo output, "Mansions" was originally released (1999) as a co-production Silenzio Edizioni/Electronikaruna as a cassette tape and is now re-released with two more tracks in the CD format by ants.
