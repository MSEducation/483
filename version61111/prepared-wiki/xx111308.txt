==Reception==

The album was fairly well-received critically. Allmusic gave the album a four star rating, noting similarities to the bands Pavement and Weezer, and described it as "a fairly brilliant album, combining a warm, earnest, and rustic feel with sometimes goofy experimentation". CMJ New Music Monthly described it as "an eccentric psych-pop collection".[tpl]cite journal |author=Richard A.

Front-man Jason Lytle's vocal performance was also praised, Jason Josephes of "Pitchfork" said: "If the lonely vocals of "Lineage" and "Collective Dreamwish of Upperclass Elegance" don't strike you there, you have no soul".
According to Steve Taylor, in his book The A to X of Alternative Music, "Laughing Stock" is the album's standout track.Taylor, Steve (2004) The A to X of Alternative Music, Continuum, ISBN 0-8264-7396-2, p. 119 The track features guitars fed back on themselves building as the track progresses.
