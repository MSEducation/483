The Galaxy series is a family of communications satellites originally developed and operated by Hughes Communications. It has since merged with PanAmSat and is now owned and operated by Intelsat. As one of the earliest geostationary satellites, Galaxy 1 was launched on June 28, 1983. The latest, Galaxy 19, was launched on September 9, 2008. Subsequent satellites were renamed from satellites formerly known under the Intelsat Americas brands.
