Humphrey Sims Moore (1909-1995) was the founder of Peace News, the British pacifist magazine. 
Moore was a Quaker who had been born in Samoa where his father had been teaching. He joined the No More War Movement and embraced various socialist causes, while working as a journalist. In 1933 he became editor of the National Peace Council's publications. 
Working with a peace group in Wood Green, London, Moore and his wife, Kathleen (playing the role of business manager),Harry Mister “Kathleen Moore 1907-1996” Peace News No. 2402 launched Peace News with a free trial issue in June 1936. [ref]Caroline Moorehead,

Within six weeks, Dick Sheppard,  founder of the Peace Pledge Union proposed to Moore that Peace News should become the PPU’s paper.Harry Mister “Humphrey Moore 1909-1995” Peace News No. 2395 Early contributors to this new organ of the PPU included Gandhi, George Lansbury, and cartoonist Arthur Wragg.
Sales of Peace News peaked at around 40,000 during the so-called Phoney War following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and before major land battles in Europe. 
In May 1940, in the face of demands in parliament for the banning of the paper, the printer and distributors stopped working with Peace News. However, together with the typographer Eric Gill, Hugh Brock and his brother Ashley, and many others, Moore continued to publish Peace News and arrange for distribution around the UK. At more or less the same time Moore faced a conscientious objector's tribunal at which he was exempted from war service.
Humphrey Moore’s emphasis on Peace News having a single-minded anti-war policy was increasingly being challenged as the war went on. Others wanted greater emphasis on building a peaceful society once hostilities ended. In 1940 the PPU appointed John Middleton Murry to edit the paper, asking Moore to stay on as assistant editor. Moore eventually resigned in 1944 to join the News Chronicle. Later, he worked on newspapers in Birmingham .
