Haji Master Hanif
Ex- Headmaster 
Mamyan Middle School
Haji Hanif or Master Hanif as he is affectionately known as by the whole generation of the people of Mamyan.
Master Hanif worked tirelessly to make the school from a primary school to a middle school back in the mid 70's.
This provided valuable education for local Mamyan children and meant they no longer had to go to Chotlla or Chakri to continue their middle school education.
The middle school also benefitted many other surrounding villages because they started sending their kids from Jagta, Chak Mehmda, Alang etc. to Mamyan because Mamyan was a lot closer.
