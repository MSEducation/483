[[(The Same Thing Happens with) The Birds and the Bees]]

"(The Same Thing Happens with) The Birds and the Bees" is a popular song, written by Harry Warren (music) and Mack David (lyrics) and published in 1956. It was written for the musical film, The Birds and the Bees (where it was performed by George Gobel and Mitzi Gaynor) and has been recorded by a number of singers, including Barbara Lyon.
Alma Cogan had a #25 hit with this song in the UK: as her 1956 version credited the song as "The Birds and the Bees" and was the flip side of a cover of "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" (#22) it's often misreported that Alma's hit was a cover of Jewel Akens' #3 United States hit "The Birds and the Bees". Akens' hit song in fact only dates from 1965: at that time Cogan did indeed cover it but without a UK release.
