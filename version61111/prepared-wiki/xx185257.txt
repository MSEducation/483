Bergen Cathedral ([tpl]lang-no|Bergen domkirke[/tpl]) is the seat of the Diocese of Bjørgvin in the Church of Norway. Located in the city centre of Bergen, Norway, the first recorded reference to it is dated 1181. It retains its ancient dedication to St Olaf ([tpl]lang-no|S Olav[/tpl]).See, for example, 2011 edition of the cathedral tourist guide leaflet: "Welcome to Bergen Cathedral - St Olav's Church".
During the reign of king Haakon IV of Norway, a Franciscan friary was established near the church, then known as  Olavskirken, or the church of Saint Olaf, which was incorporated in it. The church burned down in 1248 and again in 1270, but was reconstructed after both fires. In 1463, it burned down again, but this time it was not reconstructed until the 1550s, despite being declared the cathedral in 1537.
After the fires of 1623 and 1640, Bergen Cathedral received its current general appearance. The steeple on the nave was torn down, and the current tower was built. During the renovation in the 1880s by architect Christian Christie, the Rococo interior was replaced to give the interiors back their former medieval appearance.
A cannonball from the 1665 Battle of Vågen between the English and Dutch fleets remains embedded in the cathedral's exterior wall.
The present organ at Bergen Cathedral, by Rieger Orgelbau, is from 1997. The organ is the fifth one in the cathedral's history; the first known organ was installed in 1549.[tpl]cite book |title=Bergen kulturguide |last=Skreien |first=Norvall |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location= |isbn=82-573-0989-3 |page=22 |pages= |url= |accessdate=[/tpl] The cathedral is used regularly for concerts.
