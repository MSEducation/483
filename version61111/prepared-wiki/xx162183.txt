What Became of the Likely Lads is a US-only 7 track EP released by British band The Libertines in 2005, following their split the year before. The record consists of an alternative version of "What Became of the Likely Lads" to the one released as a single from The Libertines album in 2004. It also contains said album version, without the hidden track known as "France" that can be heard after a period of silence following the end of the song on the 2004 album, and an alternative version of "Don't Look Back into the Sun". The remaining tracks are live recordings from the band's gig at London's Brixton Academy in March 2004.
