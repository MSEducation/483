CATEGORIES: American cheeses, Processed cheese

Processed cheese (a.k.a., process cheese; cheese slice; prepared cheese; cheese product; cheese singles; or, cheese food) is a food product made from a normal cheese (and sometimes other, unfermented, dairy by-product ingredients); plus emulsifiers, saturated vegetable oils, extra salt, food colorings, and/or whey or sugar. As a result, many flavors, colors, and textures of processed cheese exist.
In the United States, the most recognizable variety of processed cheese is sold under the name American cheese. American cheese is pre-processed at mechanized factories and usually bought pre-sliced and pre-packaged at a supermarket. The name American cheese has a legal definition as a specific type of pasteurized, processed cheese, under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 (Food and Drugs), Article 133, Section 169 (Pasteurized process cheese), the allowed usage of the term "American Cheese" for certain types of "Pasteurized process cheese" is detailed.  Specifically, in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of section 133.169, it states In case it is made of cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, or granular cheese or any mixture of two or more of these, it may be designated "Pasteurized process American cheese"; or when cheddar cheese, washed curd cheese, colby cheese, granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these is combined with other varieties of cheese in the cheese ingredient, any of such cheeses or such mixture may be designated as "American cheese.[ref]"

Although the invention of processed cheese is credited to Walter Gerber of Thun, Switzerland in 1911, it was James L. Kraft who first applied for a U.S. patent for his method of making processed cheese, in 1916.[ref]
