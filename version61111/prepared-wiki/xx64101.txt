==Career==

===Early years===

Ramis began writing parodic plays in college, saying years later, "In my heart, I felt I was a combination of Groucho and Harpo Marx, of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpo’s antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy — he grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it". He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical.[tpl]cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brett |date=July 2009 |title=Harold Ramis Gets the Last Laugh |journal=GQ |volume= |issue= |pages=64–67, 124–25 |id= |url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=5 |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |quote=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes.Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S.

ISBN 1-58115-062-8, ISBN 978-1-58115-062-9 He also became associated with the guerrilla television collective TVTV, headed by his college friend Michael Shamberg, and wrote freelance for the Chicago Daily News. "Michael Shamberg right out of college had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, 'Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that'. I wrote a spec piece and submitted it to the Chicago Daily News, the Arts & Leisure section, and they started giving me assignments for entertainment features."Lovece, Frank, "Ramis's realm: Comedy creator surveys career from Second City to 'Year One'", Film Journal International online, June 12, 2009 Additionally, Ramis had begun studying and performing with Chicago's Second City improvisational comedy troupe.Patinkin, Sheldon.

Ramis' newspaper writing led to his becoming joke editor at Playboy magazine. "I called ... just cold and said I had written several pieces freelance and did they have any openings. And they happened to have their entry-level job, party jokes editor, open. He liked my stuff and he gave me a stack of jokes that readers had sent in and asked me to rewrite them. I had been in Second City in the workshops already and Michael Shamberg and I had written comedy shows in college". Ramis was eventually promoted to associate editor.[tpl]cite news|author=Martin, Douglas|date=February 24, 2014|title=Harold Ramis, 69, Dies; Alchemist of the Hilarious|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/movies/harold-ramis-who-helped-redefine-what-makes-us-laugh-on-screen-dies-at-69.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 25, 2014[/tpl]

===National Lampoon and SCTV===

After leaving Second City for a time and returning in 1972, having been replaced in the main cast by John Belushi, Ramis worked his way back as Belushi's deadpan foil. In 1974, Belushi brought Ramis and other Second City performers, including Ramis's frequent future collaborator Bill Murray, to New York City to work on  The National Lampoon Radio Hour.
During this time, Ramis, Belushi, Murray, Joe Flaherty, Christopher Guest, and Gilda Radner starred in the revue The National Lampoon Show, the successor to National Lampoon's Lemmings.[tpl]Cite book |last=Karp |first=Josh |title=A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever |location= |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2006 |page=219 |isbn=1-55652-602-4 |postscript= [/tpl] Later, Ramis became a performer on, and head writer of, the late-night sketch-comedy television series SCTV during its first three years (1976–1979).Caldwell, Kielson, p. 77 He was soon offered work as a writer at Saturday Night Live but chose to continue with SCTV. Characterizations by Ramis on SCTV include corrupt Dialing for Dollars host/SCTV station manager Maurice "Moe" Green, amiable cop Officer Friendly, exercise guru Swami Bananananda, board chairman Allan "Crazy Legs" Hirschman and home dentist Mort Finkel. His celebrity impressions on SCTV included Kenneth Clark and Leonard Nimoy.

===Film career===

Ramis left SCTV to pursue a film career and wrote a script with National Lampoon magazine's Douglas Kenney which would eventually become National Lampoon's Animal House. They were later joined by a third collaborator, Chris Miller.  The 1978 film followed the struggle between a rowdy college fraternity house and the college dean. The film's humor was raunchy for its time. Animal House "broke all box-office records for comedies" and earned $141 million.
Ramis next co-wrote the comedy Meatballs, starring Bill Murray. The movie was a commercial success and became the first of six film collaborations between Murray and Ramis. His third film and his directorial debut was Caddyshack, which he wrote with Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray.  It starred Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Like Ramis's previous two films, Caddyshack was also a commercial success.
In 1982, Ramis was attached to direct the film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.  The film was to star John Belushi and Richard Pryor, but the project was aborted.Saito, Stephen  "20 Movies Not Coming Soon to a Theater Near You", Section: "A Confederacy of Dunces", Premiere, no date In 1984, Ramis collaborated with Dan Aykroyd on the screenplay for Ghostbusters, which became one of the biggest comedy hits of the summer, in which he also starred as Dr. Egon Spengler,[tpl]cite web|title='Ghostbusters 3' in Theaters by Christmas 2012!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20170/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting[/tpl] a role he reprised for the 1989 sequel, Ghostbusters II (which he also co-wrote with Aykroyd). His later film Groundhog Day has been called his "masterpiece".[tpl]cite news | last=Friend | first=Tad | authorlink=Tad Friend | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/19/040419fa_fact3?currentPage=all| title= Comedy First: How Harold Ramis’s movies have stayed funny for twenty-five years | work=The New Yorker | date= April 19, 2004|accessdate=August 28, 2007[/tpl]
He also had a role in the 1997 film As Good As It Gets as Helen Hunt's son's doctor.
His films have been noted for attacking "the smugness of institutional life ... with an impish good will that is unmistakably American". They are also noted for "Ramis's signature tongue-in-cheek pep talks”. Sloppiness and improv are also important aspects of his work. Ramis frequently depicts the qualities of "anger, curiosity, laziness, and woolly idealism" in "a hyper-articulate voice".
In 2004, Ramis turned down the opportunity to direct the Bernie Mac-Ashton Kutcher film Guess Who, then under the working title "The Dinner Party", because he considered it poorly written.  That same year, he began filming the low-budget The Ice Harvest, "his first attempt to make a comic film noir".  Ramis spent six weeks trying to get the film greenlit because he had difficulty reaching an agreement about stars John Cusack's and Billy Bob Thornton's salaries. The film received mixed reviews. As of 2004, Ramis's typical directing fee was $5 million.
In an interview in the documentary American Storytellers, Ramis said he hoped to make a film about Emma Goldman (even pitching Disney with the idea of having Bette Midler star)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2004/04/14/sunday_am/10048008.txt |title=An 'exceedingly dangerous woman':Emma Goldman's story | first=  L.

Ramis said in 2009 he planned to make a third Ghostbusters film for release either in mid-2011[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/2471 | title = Ramis on 'Ghostbusters 3': 'Plans to Shoot Next Summer and Release in 2011' | first=Brian |last=Abrams | work = Heeb | date= December 28, 2009 | accessdate = February 24, 2014[/tpl] or for Christmas 2012.Ramis interview, WABC-TV, via [tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18543 | title = Harold Ramis Says 'Ghostbusters 3' in 2011! | publisher=BloodyDisgustng.com | date= December 30, 2009 | accessdate= 2014-02-24[/tpl]
