[[Jacobean embroidery]]

CATEGORIES: Embroidery

Jacobean embroidery refers to embroidery styles that flourished in the reign of King James I of England in first quarter of the 17th century.
The term is usually used today to describe a form of crewel embroidery used for furnishing characterized by fanciful plant and animal shapes worked in a variety of stitches with two-ply wool yarn on linen.  Popular motifs in Jacobean embroidery, especially curtains for bed hangings, are the Tree of Life and stylized forests, usually rendered as exotic plants arising from a landscape or terra firma with birds, stags, squirrels, and other familiar animals.Christie, Grace: Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving, London 1912

==Origins==

Early Jacobean embroidery often featured scrolling floral patterns worked in colored silks on linen, a fashion that arose in the earlier Elizabethan era.  Embroidered jackets were fashionable for both men and women in the period 1600-1620, and several of these jackets have survived.

==Legacy==

Jacobean embroidery was carried by British colonists to Colonial America, where it flourished.  The Deerfield embroidery movement of the 1890s revived interest in colonial and Jacobean styles of embroidery.
