[[Science in the medieval Islamic world]]

CATEGORIES: History of Islamic science, Islamic Golden Age

Science in the medieval Islamic world (also known, less accurately, as Islamic science or Arabic science) is the science developed and practised in the Islamic world during the Islamic Golden Age([tpl]c.|750 CE[/tpl] – [tpl]nowrap|c. 1258 CE[/tpl]). During this time, Indian, Asyriac, Iranian and Greek knowledge was translated into Arabic. These translations became a wellspring for scientific advances, by scientists from the Islamic civilization, during the Middle Ages.[tpl]cite book |last=Robinson (editor) |first=Francis |authorlink=Francis Robinson |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=228–229[/tpl]

==Science in the context of Islamic civilization==

The term Islam refers either to the religion of Islam or to the Islamic civilization that formed around it.[tpl]Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Brenard|title=The Jews of Islam|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1987|pages=5–6[/tpl] Islamic civilization is composed of many faiths and cultures, although the proportion of Muslims among its population has increased over time.[tpl]Cite book|last=Courbage|first=Youssef|last2=Fargues|first2=Phillipe|title=Christians and Jews under Islam|publisher=London: I.B.

The religion of Islam was founded during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.  After his death in 632, Islam continued to expand under the leadership of its Muslim rulers, known as Caliphs.  Struggles for leadership of the growing religious community began at this time, and continue today.  The early periods of Islamic history after the death of Muhammad can be referred to as the  Umayyad Caliphates.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 234.
During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Islamic empire began to consolidate its territorial gains.  Arabic became the language of administration.  The Arabs became a ruling class assimilated into their new surroundings across the empire, rather than occupiers of conquered territories.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 230.

===The crystallization of Islamic thought and civilization===

Through the Umayyad and, in particular, the succeeding Abbasid Caliphate's early phase, lies the period of Islamic history known as the High Caliphate.  This era can be identified as the years between 692 and 945, and ended when the caliphate was marginalized by local Muslim rulers in Baghdad – its traditional seat of power.  From 945 onward until the sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, the Caliph continued on as a figurehead, with power devolving more to local amirs.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 233.
During the High Caliphate, stable political structures were established and trade flourished.  The Chinese were undergoing a revolution in commerce, and the trade routes between the lands of Islam and China boomed both overland and along the coastal routes between the two civilizations.  Islamic civilization continued to be primarily based upon agriculture, but commerce began to play a more important role as the caliphate secured peace within the empire.  The wars and cultural divisions that had separated peoples before the Arab conquests gradually gave way to a new civilization encompassing diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds. This new Islamic civilization used the Arabic language as transmitters of culture and Arabic increasingly became the language of commerce and government.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 235.
Over time, the great religious and cultural works of the empire were translated into Arabic, the population increasingly understood Arabic, and they increasingly professed Islam as their religion.  The cultural heritages of the area included strong Hellenic, Indic, Asyrian and Persian influences. The Greek intellectual traditions were recognized, translated and studied broadly.  Through this process, the population of the lands of Islam gained access to all the important works of all the cultures of the empire, and a new common civilization formed in this area of the world, based on the religion of Islam.  A new era of high culture and innovation ensued, where these diverse influences were recognized and given their respective places in the social consciousness.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 236–238.

===Domains of thought and culture in the High Caliphate===

The pious scholars of Islam, men and women collectively known as the ulama, were the most influential element of society in the fields of Sharia law, speculative thought and theology.  Their pronouncements defined the external practice of Islam, including prayer, as well as the details of the Islamic way of life.  They held strong influence over government, and especially the laws of commerce.  They were not rulers themselves, but rather keepers and upholders of the rule of law.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 238.
Conversely, among the religious, there were inheritors of the more charismatic expressions of Christianity and Buddhism, in the Sufi orders.  These Muslims had a more informal and varied approach to their religion.  Islam also expressed itself in other, more esoteric forms that could have significant influence over public discourse during times of social unrest.Marshall Hodgson, The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 1. The University of Chicago, 1974, pg. 238–239.
Among the more worldly, adab – polite, worldly culture — permeated the lives of the professional, the courtly and genteel classes.  Art, literature, poetry, music and even some aspects of religion were among the areas widely appreciated by those of a more refined taste among Muslim and non-Muslim alike.  New trends and new topics flowed from the center of the Baghdad courts, to be adopted both quickly and widely across the lands of Islam.
Apart from these other traditions stood falsafa; Greek philosophy, inclusive of the sciences as well as the philosophy of the ancients.  This science had been widely known across Mesopotamia and Iran since before the advent of Islam.  These "sciences" were in many ways contrary to the teachings of Islam and the ways of the adab, but were nonetheless highly regarded in society.  The ulama tolerated these outlooks and practices with reservation.  Some faylasufs made a good living in the practices of astrology and medicine.

===Notable fields of inquiry===

The roots of Islamic science drew primarily upon Arab, Persian, Indian and Greek learning. The extent of Islamic scientific achievement is not as yet fully understood, but it is extremely vast.
These achievements encompass a wide range of subject areas; most notably
Other notable areas, and specialized subjects, of scientific inquiry include

===Notable scientists===

In medieval Islam, the sciences, which included philosophy, were viewed holistically. The individual scientific disciplines were approached in terms of their relationships to each other and the whole, as if they were branches of a tree. In this regard, the most important scientists of Islamic civilization have been the polymaths, known as hakim or sages. Their role in the transmission of the sciences was central.[tpl]Cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=Science and Civilization in Islam|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1968|page=41[/tpl]
The hakim was most often a poet and a writer, skilled in the practice of medicine as well as astronomy and mathematics. These multi-talented sages, the central figures in Islamic science, elaborated and personified the unity of the sciences. They orchestrated scientific development through their insights, and excelled in their explorations as well.

==The views of historians and scholars==

===On the impact of medieval Islamic science===

There are several different views on Islamic science among historians of science.

===On the historiography of medieval Islamic science===

The history of science in the Islamic  world, like all history, is filled with questions of interpretation.
Historians of science generally consider that the study of science in the Islamic world, like all history, must be seen within the particular circumstances of time and place.
Some scholars avoid such local historical approaches and seek to identify essential relations between Islam and science that apply at all times and places.
Some historians of science, however, question the value of drawing boundaries that label the sciences, and the scientists who practice them, in specific cultural, civilizational, or linguistic terms.

==Role of Christians==

Christians especially Nestorian contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayads and the Abbasids by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic.Hill, Donald. Islamic Science and Engineering. 1993. Edinburgh Univ. Press. ISBN 0-7486-0455-3, p.4 They also excelled in philosophy, science ( such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, Qusta ibn Luqa, Masawaiyh, Patriarch Eutychius, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu etc) and theology ( such as Tatian, Bar Daisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, Toma bar Yacoub etc.) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrian Christians such as the long serving Bukhtishu dynasty.Rémi Brague, Assyrians contributions to the Islamic civilizationBritannica, Nestorian

==Role of Persians==

As Ibn Khaldun, the fourteenth-century Arab historiographer and sociologist suggests, it is a remarkable fact that with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars in the intellectual sciences were Ajams ("Persians"):
