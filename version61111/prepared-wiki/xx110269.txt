The Gnathiidae are a family of isopod crustaceans. They occur in a wide range of depths, from the littoral zone to the deep sea. The adults are associated with sponges and may not feed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=4176 |title=Suborder Gnathiidae sic |author= Richard Brusca, Vania R. Coelho & Stefano Taiti |work=Guide to the Coastal Marine Isopods of California |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |publisher=Tree of Life Web Project |year=2001[/tpl] The juvenile form is known as a 'praniza' larva, and it is a temporary parasite of marine fish.

The family contains 182 species,[tpl]cite journal |author=Jörundar Svavarsson |year=2006 |title=New species of Gnathiidae (Crustacea, Isopoda, Cymothoida) from seamounts off northern New Zealand |journal=Zootaxa |volume=1173 |pages=39–56 |url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2006f/zt01173p056.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] divided among the following genera:[tpl]cite web |author=WoRMS |year=2010 |title=Gnathiidae |editor=M.
