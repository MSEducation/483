The Quebec general election of 1935 was held on November 25, 1935 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau was re-elected, defeating the Action libérale nationale, led by  Paul Gouin, and the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Maurice Duplessis.
It was the fourth and final general election victory in a row for Taschereau, who had held office since 1920.  He would resign less than seven months later due to a scandal.
The Action libérale nationale (ALN) was a newly formed party led by the son of former Liberal premier Lomer Gouin. It was established by former Liberals who had become dissatisfied with the party.  The ALN and Conservatives formed an alliance, the Union Nationale,  to contest this election, and after the election merged to formed the Union Nationale as a fully-fledged party, which soon became a dominant political force.
