==Route description==

PA 316 begins at the Maryland border in Washington Township, heading north on two-lane undivided Wayne Highway. The road continues south into Maryland as MD 60. From the state line, the route heads through a mix of farms and woods with some homes, making a turn to the northeast. PA 316 continues through open farmland before entering Waynesboro, where it becomes Potomac Street and passes homes and businesses. In the downtown area of Waynesboro, PA 316 intersects PA 16 and turns northwest to form a brief concurrency with that route on Main Street. PA 316 splits from PA 16 by heading north on Grant Street, where it is lined with residences. The route makes a curve to the northwest and leaves Waynesboro for Washington Township, becoming Wayne Highway again as it heads into agricultural areas with scattered development. The road continues into Quincy Township. Here, PA 316 reaches the community of Five Forks and turns to the north, continuing through more farmland as it passes through Elbrook. The road crosses a CSX railroad line and passes through Jugtown and Altenwald, running a short distance to the west of the railroad tracks.
The route heads farther from the CSX line as it turns northwest into Guilford Township and becomes Wayne Road, passing through a mix of farms, woods, and homes. PA 316 curves to the north as it comes to the PA 914 junction and passes through the residential community of New Franklin. The road comes to a bridge over the CSX line and passes more farms before heading into commercial areas and widening into a four-lane divided highway as it interchanges with I-81. After this, the road enters Chambersburg and becomes Wayne Avenue, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes more businesses. Farther northwest, PA 316 narrows into a two-lane road that passes homes. The route comes to a bridge over a Norfolk Southern railroad line and passes near industrial establishments before heading north near more homes on 2nd Street and ending at US 11.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=PA+316+and+MD+60&daddr=garfield+street+and+2nd+street&geocode=FagVXgIdatZf-ylBe3aG1JXJiTERt5JL7HMzFw%3BFbU9YQIdNPte-ymPhKHtLpzJiTGqQfsXRR7ndg&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=39.925256,-77.657547&sspn=0.011568,0.01929&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=11|title=overview of PA 316 |accessdate=March 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite map|publisher=PennDOT|title=Franklin County, Pennsylvania Highway Map|url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/franklin_GHSN.PDF|year=2011|accessdate=March 8, 2011[/tpl]
