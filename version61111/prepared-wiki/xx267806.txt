==Band members==

The original three members of the band were Mike Mantione on vocals and guitar, Dan Horowitz on bass guitar, and Mike Palmatier on drums.  In 1989, Palmatier's right leg was crushed in a work-related accident at the Armstrong and Dobbs lumberyard in Athens.  His was temporarily replaced by Patrick Ferguson, the drummer for the LaBrea Stompers and Angle Lakeâ€”a band which also included Vic Chesnutt.  Palmatier returned to the Boston area.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Ferguson rejoined the band and was Five Eight's full-time drummer until 1998.  After the release of 'I Learned Shut Up,' guitarist Sean Dunn joined the band and was a full-time member for the recording of 'The Angriest Man' EP.  Between 1992 and 1998, Five Eight toured extensively as a four-piece in the United States and Canada, and played 200 shows or more a year.  Ferguson left the band in 1998, and was soon followed by Dunn.  Ferguson was briefly replaced by former Bughummer, Little Red Rocket and The Runs drummer Scott Sosebee.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] Drummer Mike Rizzi joined Five Eight in 1999 and remained until mid-2007.  The band went on hiatus when Rizzi moved to Southern California to join Ghost Hounds.  Ferguson rejoined the band to play "a few shows" near the end of 2007, and is again the full-time drummer for the group.
