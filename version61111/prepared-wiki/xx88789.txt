Amoco Cadiz was a very large crude carrier (VLCC) under the Liberian flag of convenience owned by Amoco. On 16 March 1978, she ran aground on Portsall Rocks, [tpl]convert|5|km|abbr=on|0[/tpl] from the coast of Brittany, France; and ultimately split in three and sank, resulting in the largest oil spill of its kind in history to that date.[tpl]cite web |first=Auke |last=Visser |title=Amoco Cadiz |url= http://www.aukevisser.nl/supertankers/part-1/id532.htm |publisher=International Super Tankers |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2010[/tpl]
