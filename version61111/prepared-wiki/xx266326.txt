==Music==

On 24 September 2010 she issued her debut single, "What Do I Do", which is the theme tune for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV series, Crownies (from July to December 2011).http://www.abc.net.au/tv/crownies/ Lane was working as a florist to raise finances for her debut album, To the Horses. She recorded most of the album in February 2011. In August she added the lately written track, "(Oh Well) That's What You Get (Falling in Love with a Cowboy)". According to Lane the track is a result of somniloquy, "I woke up one morning and my boyfriend said, 'You said the weirdest thing in your sleep last night'. He told me and said you'd better write a song about it. I wrote the song and he said, 'Well, that's one side of the story'".[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/entertainment/rockabilly-and-rocknroll-with-lanie-lane/2424745.aspx?storypage=0 | title = Rockabilly and rock'n'roll with Lanie Lane | last = Tarala | first = Kate | work = The Newcastle Herald | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 19 January 2012 | accessdate = 31 May 2012 [/tpl] The album was self-produced for Ivy League Records.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158203769 | title = To the Horses / Lanie Lane | publisher = Trove. National Library of Australia | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | quote = Adding sass to the smoky, sultry sounds of a bygone era, Lanie Lane (pronounced "Lannie") is an undeniable talent who draws on the past and plants it very firmly in the here and now. Imbued with the spirit of Muddy Waters, and channeling the grit of Billie Holiday, Lanie Lane wraps the sounds of a golden age around a voice that is as rich and warm as it is sweet. Her debut album is To the Horses, a collection of 11 songs that duck and weave through a heady mix of early rock 'n' roll, blues, and rockabilly, serving up fantastic tales of love, lust, heartbreak and the importance of a good guitar - all delivered by one of the most undeniably distinctive voices and charming characters in Australian music. Recorded and mixed over a grand total of four days with her band at a studio in Sydney, the self-produced To the Horses showcases Lanie's irrepressible talent for crafting songs that are as raw and gritty as they are warm and inviting.

To celebrate this Universal Music is releasing a brand new 7 song EP, Are You ready Yet?, also making this EP available in a very limited edition 2CD set with Clare's most recent album Modern Day Addiction. 'Sometimes, songwriting needs to be scary in order to be good. With this in mind, I decided in February that I would turn my hand to co-writing with some of my favourite Australian artists. I wanted the songs to sound glorious to the ear, and leave people feeling uplifted, rather than analytical. The Are You Ready Yet EP is a taste of where this experiment took me: into the homes of people like Gotye and Lanie Lane, and then straight into the studio to lay down the things we had written together'.
