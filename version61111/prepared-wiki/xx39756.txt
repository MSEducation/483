MPlayer is a free software and open source media player. The program is available for all major operating systems, including Linux and other Unix-like systems, Microsoft Windows and [tpl]nowrap|Mac OS X[/tpl]. Versions for OS/2, Syllable, AmigaOS, MorphOS and AROS Research Operating System are also available. The Windows version also works, with some minor problems, in DOS using HX DOS Extender. A port for DOS using DJGPP is also available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/util/user/mplayer/ |title=Index of /pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/util/user/mplayer |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl] Versions for the Wii Homebrew Channel[tpl]cite web |author=Erant |url=http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/ |title=libdi and the DVDX installer |publisher=Hackmii.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl] and Amazon Kindle[tpl]cite web |url=http://gitorious.org/kindlebrew |title=kindlebrew |publisher=Gitorious |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl] have also emerged.

==Capabilities and classification==

MPlayer can play a wide variety of media formats[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html |title=Codec Status Table |publisher=Mplayerhq.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl] and can also save all streamed content to a file.
A companion program, MEncoder, can take an input stream or file and transcode it into several different output formats, optionally applying various transforms along the way.

==History==

Development of MPlayer began in 2000. The original author, Hungarian Árpád Gereöffy, started the project because he was unable to find any satisfactory video players for Linux after XAnim stopped development in 1999.[tpl]cite web |url=http://xanim.polter.net/ |title=The XAnim Home Page |publisher=Xanim.polter.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl] The first version was titled mpg12play v0.1 and was hacked together in a half hour using libmpeg3 from http://www.heroinewarrior.com/. After mpg12play v0.95pre5, the code was merged with an AVI player based on avifile's Win32 DLL loader to form MPlayer v0.3 in November 2000.History 
Gereöffy was soon joined by many other programmers, in the beginning mostly from Hungary, but now located worldwide.
Alex Beregszászi has maintained MPlayer since 2003 when Gereöffy left MPlayer development to begin work on a second generation MPlayer. The MPlayer G2 project is currently abandoned, and all the development effort is put on MPlayer 1.0.[tpl]cite web |title=MPlayer - The Movie Player |url=http://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html |accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl]
MPlayer was previously called "MPlayer - The Movie Player for Linux" by its developers but this was later shortened to "MPlayer - The Movie Player" after it became commonly used on other operating systems.

==Media formats==

MPlayer can play many formats, including:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/info.html |title=MPlayer Features |publisher=Mplayerhq.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01[/tpl]
MPlayer can also use a variety of output driver protocols to display video, including VDPAU, the X video extension, OpenGL, DirectX, Direct3D, Quartz Compositor, VESA, Framebuffer, SDL and rarer ones such as ASCII art (using AAlib and libcaca) and Blinkenlights. It can also be used to display TV from a TV card using the device [tpl]not a typo|tv[/tpl]://channel, or play and capture radio channels via radio://channel|frequency.
Since version 1.0RC1, Mplayer can decode subtitles in ASS/SSA subtitle format, using libass.

===Available plugins===

==[tpl]Anchor|Gnome MPlayer|gMplayer|UMPlayer|[/tpl]Graphical front-ends==

Like GStreamer, MPlayer is a command-line application and there are a couple of front-ends available, which use GUI widgets of GTK+, Qt or some other widget library.

==Forks==

==Legal issues==

MPlayer interprets most video and audio formats natively through the libavcodec library of the FFmpeg project. For those formats where no open source decoder has been made yet MPlayer relies on binary codecs. It can use Windows DLLs directly with the help of a DLL loader forked from avifile (which itself forked its loader from the Wine project).
The combination of CSS decryption software and use of formats covered by software patents places a fully functional MPlayer in the legal bind shared by most open source multimedia players. In the past, MPlayer used to include OpenDivX, a GPL-incompatible decoder library. This has since been removed, making MPlayer use only GPL-like or BSD-like licenses. Usage of patented codecs in free software however is a still pending potential problem affecting FFmpeg, MPlayer and similar software when used in countries where software patents apply.
In January 2004, the MPlayer website was updated with an allegation that the Danish DVD player manufacturer, KISS Technology, were marketing DVD players with firmware that included parts of MPlayer's GPL-licensed code. The implication was that KISS was violating the GPL, since KISS did not release its firmware under the GPL license. The response from the managing director of KISS, Peter Wilmar Christensen, countered that the similarities between the two pieces of code indicate that the MPlayer team had in fact used code from KISS's firmware.[tpl]cite web |title=MPlayer - The Movie Player |date=2004-01-10 |url=http://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news-archive.html#kiss05 |accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl] However, the KISS DVD player, released in 2003, used a subtitle file format that is specific to MPlayer, which was designed by an MPlayer developer in 2001.
