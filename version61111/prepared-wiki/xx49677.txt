[[List of oil fields]]

CATEGORIES: Geology-related lists, Oil fields, Peak oil, Energy-related lists

This list of oil fields includes some major oil fields of the past and present.
The list is incomplete; there are more than 65,000 oil and gas fields of all sizes in the world.Li Guoyu (2011), World Atlas of Oil and Gas Basins (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell), p. 20. However, 94% of known oil is concentrated in fewer than 1500 giant and major fields.Ivanhoe, L. F, and G G. Leckie, -"Global oil, gas fields, sizes tallied, analyzed," Oil and Gas Journal. Feb. 15, 1993, pp. 87-91 Most of the world's largest oilfields are located in the Middle East, but there are also supergiant (>10 billion bbls) oilfields in India, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Russia.
Amounts listed below, in billions of barrels, are the estimated ultimate recoverable petroleum resources (proved reserves plus cumulative production), given historical production and current extraction technology. Oil shale reserves (perhaps [tpl]convert|3|Toilbbl|m3[/tpl]) and Coal reserves, both of which can be converted to liquid petroleum, are not included in this chart. Other non-conventional liquid fuel sources are similarly excluded in this list.
