Florida Gym opened in 1949 as a 7,000-seat multi-purpose arena that was home to the Florida Gators men's basketball team until it was replaced by the Stephen C. O'Connell Center as the university's indoor sports area in 1980.  While serving as the home court of the Gators basketball team, it was also known as "Alligator Alley."Kevin M. McCarthy and Murray D.

Florida Gymnasium was adapted to other uses after the O'Connell Center was completed  In the mid-1990s, the last remains of the original seating sections were removed and replaced with classrooms for the College of Health and Human Performance during a major renovation of the facility.  The playing surface remains, and is used for student recreation and other purposes.
