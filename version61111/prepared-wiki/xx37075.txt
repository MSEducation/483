CATEGORIES: Units of information

The tebibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.  It is a member of the set of units with binary prefixes defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).[tpl]cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html|title=Prefixes for binary multiples|date=2007|publisher=NIST|accessdate=10 August 2007[/tpl] Its unit symbol is TiB.
The prefix tebi (symbol Ti) represents multiplication by 10244, therefore:
The tebibyte is closely related to the terabyte (TB), which is defined as 1012 bytes = [tpl]gaps|1|000|000|000|000|bytes[/tpl], but the terabyte has been used as a synonym for tebibyte in some contexts (see binary prefix).  1 TiB â‰ˆ 1.100 TB
