Matchedash Bay is a bay and Ramsar wetland in Simcoe County in Central Ontario, Canada.[tpl]cite cgndb|id= FCDYF|title= Matchedash Bay|accessdate= 2011-11-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map?mapsize=750%20666&mapxy=1224315.91068%20-328565.460328&scale=500000&feature_na=Matchedash%20Bay&searchstring=Matchedash%20Bay&layers=fapfeature%20fapfeature%20north_arrow%20other_features%20million_grid%20t50k_grid%20grid_50k_3%20roads%20hydrography%20boundary%20builtup%20vegetation%20populated_places%20railway%20power_network%20manmade_features%20designated_areas%20water_features%20water_saturated_soils%20relief%20contours%20toponymy%20contour%20nodata_ntdb_50k&map_layer%5bnortharrow%5d_class%5b0%5d_style%5b0%5d=ANGLE%20-13.933022079419999&urlappend=%26unique_key%3D0c48cc9c849c20c3874e2c28623ce2ae%26map.layer%5Btextzoom03%5D%3DFEATURE+POINTS+1223920.59091+-328228.04732+END+TEXT+%22Matchedash+Bay%22+END%26map.layer%5Btextzoom46%5D%3DFEATURE+POINTS+1223920.59091+-328228.04732+END+TEXT+%22Matchedash+Bay%22+END%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom0%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom1%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom2%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom0outline%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom1outline%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Bpolygonresultzoom2outline%5D%3DDATA+fap_bays%26map.layer%5Barrowzoom03%5D%3DFEATURE+POINTS+1223920.59091+-328228.04732+END+END |title= Matchedash Bay|work= Atlas of Canada|publisher= Natural Resources Canada|accessdate= 2011-11-05[/tpl] Shows area of the bay highlighted on a map.

Wetland habitats in Matchedash Bay are varied, and include swamps, fens, cattail marshes, wet meadows and beaver ponds.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/profile/profiles_canada.htm|title=The Annotated Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance - CANADA|publisher=Ramsar Convention Bureau|accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715195356/http://www.ramsar.org/profile/profiles_canada.htm  |archivedate = 2007-07-15[/tpl] Other features include "permanent freshwater lakes; upland hardwood forest, agricultural lands, native grass meadows and a unique, coniferous wetland forest".
A great diversity of species are indigenous to Matchedash Bay, including over 550 species of vascular plants, 34 species of fish, 28 species of mammal and 17 species of reptiles and amphibian, and it supports "one of the greatest diversities of herpeto fauna in Canada". Of the 170 species of birds that nest or breed in Matchedash Bay, some are provincially rare. It is also an important spring and autumn migratory staging area in the province.
Water levels in Matchedash Bay fluctuate constantly in tandem with Lake Huron and the tributary North River and Coldwater River. These water level fluctuations are a natural part of the ecology of Great Lakes wetlands, and are necessary for maintaining the area and diversity of this wetland.Keddy, P.A. and A. A.

Ducks Unlimited has purchased small portions of the site, for example an [tpl]convert|18|ha|acre|0|adj=on[/tpl] purchase in 1996, "to ensure permanent protection" of the area.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/key_ducks_report97.htm|title=Ducks Unlimited's Conservation Activities on Ramsar Wetlands from March 1996 to February 1997|publisher=Ducks Unlimited|accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070715045044/http://www.ramsar.org/key_ducks_report97.htm  |archivedate = 2007-07-15[/tpl] However, Matchedash Bay is a popular recreational area with cottages and marinas. Urban growth in the surrounding areas is expected to negatively affect the site and its water quality.
