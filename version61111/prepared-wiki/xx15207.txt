East Malaysia, also known as Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan (Sabah , Sarawak dan Labuan)The term "Sabah , Sarawak dan Labuan" (Sabah , Sarawak dan Labuan) is more commonly used in Malaysia to avoid the connotation of "East Malaysia" and "West Malaysia" (Peninsular Malaysia) being two separate countries, as in former East Germany and West Germany. or Malaysian Borneo,[tpl]Cite news|title=Malaysia urged to scrap coal plant in eco-sensitive Borneo|date=7 July 2010|publisher=AFP|accessdate=8 July 2010|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j8XrzbzMEHI_Mb5D1IHsGoveMMeA[/tpl] is the part of Malaysia located on the island of Borneo. It consists of the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, and the Federal Territory of Labuan.http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:354:0019:0028:EN:PDF It lies to the east of Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.malaysiatravel.org.uk/geography.html|title=Location|publisher=Malaysia Travel.org.uk|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl] which is located on the Malay Peninsula. The two are separated by the South China Sea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Malay+Peninsula|title=Malay Peninsula|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|accessdate=7 July 2010[/tpl] While East Malaysia is less populated and less developed than West Malaysia, its land mass is larger and it has notably more natural resources, chiefly oil and gas reserves.

==Physical geography==

The landscape of East Malaysia is mostly lowland rain forests with areas of mountain rain forest towards the interior regions.
The total area of East Malaysia is 200,565 km2, representing approximately 61% of the total land area of Malaysia and 27% of the total area of Borneo.
East Malaysia contains the five highest mountains in Malaysia, the highest being Mount Kinabalu at 4095 m, which is also the highest mountain in Borneo and the 10th highest mountain peak in Southeast Asia. It also contains the two longest rivers in Malaysia – Rajang River and Kinabatangan River.[tpl]Citation|title=Geography|url=http://www.malaysiahistorical.com.my/geography.html|date=|accessdate=16 July 2010|publisher=Malaysiahistorical.com.my[/tpl]
Banggi Island in Sabah and Betruit Island in Sarawak are the two largest islands that are located entirely within Malaysia. The largest island is Borneo, which is shared with Indonesia and Brunei.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asianbiketour.com/Motorcycle_tour_Asia_BORNEO_East_Malaysia_Tour_6.htm|title=Motorcycle tour description and itinerary for the Borneo-East Malaysia motorcycle tour.|publisher=Asian Bike Tour|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl] The second largest island is Sebatik Island, in Sabah, which is shared with Indonesia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.borneotourgigant.com/Kakaban.html|title=Dive The Kakaban Island|publisher=De 'Gigant Tours|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.exroyalmarinesbandsmen.net/NOTICEBOARD/wright.htm|title=Sebatik Island off Sabah, Malaysia 1965|publisher=The Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl]
Sarawak contains the Mulu Caves within Gunung Mulu National Park. Its Sarawak Chamber is the largest known cave chamber in the world. The Gunung Mulu National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in November 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1013|title=Gunung Mulu National Park|publisher=UNESCO.org|accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl]

==History==

Some parts of present-day East Malaysia, especially the coastal regions, were once part of the thalassocracy of the Sultanate of Brunei.[tpl]citation |title=A History of Brunei |page=45 |publisher=RoutlegdeCurzon |year=2002 |author=Saunders, Graham E. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=ong+sum+ping#v=onepage&q=ong%20sum%20ping&f=false |accessdate=5 October 2009[/tpl] However, most parts of the interior region consisted of independent tribal societies.
In 1658, the northern and eastern coasts of Sabah were ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu while the west coast of Sabah and most of Sarawak remained part of Brunei. Beginning in the mid 19th century, both Sabah and Sarawak became British protectorates, and, in 1946, both became separate British colonies.

==Federation==

Both Sabah (formerly British North Borneo) and Sarawak were separate British colonies from Malaya, and did not become part of the Federation of Malaya in 1957. However, both voted to become part of the new Federation of Malaysia along with the Federation of Malaya and Singapore in 1963. Previously, there were efforts to unite Brunei, Sabah, and Sarawak under the North Borneo Federation but that failed after the Brunei Revolt occurred.
Sabah and Sarawak retained a higher degree of local government and legislative autonomy when compared to other states in West Malaysia. For example, both states have separate immigration controls, requiring Malaysian citizens from West Malaysia to carry passports or identity cards when visiting East Malaysia.
The island of Labuan once are part of North Borneo (later Sabah) in 1946 before becoming a Federal Territory in Malaysia on 1984. It was used to establish a centre for offshore finance in 1990.
Since 2010, there has been some speculation and discussion, at least on the ground level, about the possibility of secession from the Federation of MalaysiaPush for Sabah, S'wak's independence: Next stop UN.

==Administration==

It has been a source of debate whether the states of Sabah and Sarawak joined the Federation of Malaysia as equal partners with Malaya and Singapore or whether they became merely equal partners of the states of Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=72641|title='Know Federal System' advice|publisher=Daily Express|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010[/tpl] The consensus seems to be that Sabah and Sarawak are merely states of the federation with a slightly higher degree of autonomy compared to states in Peninsular Malaysia. For example, the East Malaysian states have separate laws regulating the entry of citizens from other states in Malaysia (including the other East Malaysian state), whereas, in Peninsular Malaysia, there are no restrictions on interstate travel or migration, including visitors from East Malaysia. There are also separate land laws governing Sabah and Sarawak, as opposed to the National Land Code, which governs Peninsular Malaysia.
With regard to the administration of justice, the courts in East Malaysia are part of the federal court system in Malaysia. The Constitution of Malaysia provides that there shall be two High Courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction – The High Court in Malaya and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak (formerly the High Court in Borneo). The current Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak is Richard Malanjum from Sabah. His office is the fourth highest in the Malaysian judicial system (behind the Chief Judge of Malaya, President of the Court of Appeal, and Chief Justice of Malaysia).

==Population==

The total population of East Malaysia in 2010 was 5.77 million (3.21 million in Sabah, 2.47 million in Sarawak, and 0.09 million in Labuan), which represents 20.4% of the population of Malaysia. A significant part of the population of East Malaysia today reside in towns and cities. The largest city and urban center is Kuching, which is also the capital of Sarawak and has a population of over 600,000 people. Kota Kinabalu is the second largest, and one of the most important cities in East Malaysia. Kuching, Kota Kinabalu, and Miri are the only three places with city status in East Malaysia. Other important towns include Sandakan and Tawau in Sabah, Sibu and Bintulu in Sarawak, and Victoria in Labuan.
The earliest inhabitants of East Malaysia are the Dayak people and other related ethnic groups such as the Dusun people. These indigenous people form a significant portion, but not the majority, of the population. For hundreds of years, there has been significant migration into East Malaysia and Borneo from many parts of the Malay Archipelago, including Java, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi, and Sulu. More recently, there has been immigration from India and China.
The indigenous inhabitants were originally animists. Islamic influence began as early as the 15th century, while Christian influence started in the 19th century.
The indigenous inhabitants are generally partisan and maintain culturally distinct dialects of the Malay language, in addition to their own ethnic languages. Approximately 13% of the population of Sabah, and 26% of the population of Sarawak, is composed of ethnic Chinese Malaysians.

==Transport==

The Pan Borneo Highway connects Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei. There are frequent air flights by carriers including Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and AirAsia between East Malaysia and Peninsular Malaysia. MAS also operates international flights to major cities in East Malaysia. The major airports in East Malaysia are Kuching International Airport, Labuan International Airport and Kota Kinabalu International Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.borneo-hotels.com/info/gettingthere.htm|title=Getting To Borneo By Air, By Car, By Train|publisher=Asia Web Direct|accessdate=15 July 2010[/tpl]
The rural areas in Borneo can only be accessed by air or river boat. River transport is especially prevalent in Sarawak because there are many large and long rivers, with Rajang River being the most used. Rivers are used by boats and ferries for communications (i.e. mail) and passenger transport between inland areas and coastal towns. Timber is also transported via vessels and log carriers down the rivers of Sarawak.
For Labuan Island, Labuan Ferry is provided in mainland of Sabah and Brunei via boat express or ferry vehicle. The ferry has overtaken the airport as the chief transportation mode for the island.

==Geology==

Several oil and gas fields have been discovered offshore, including the Samarang oil field (1972) offshore Sabah, the Baronia oil field (1967) offshore Sarawak, and the Central Luconia natural gas fields (1968), also offshore Sarawak.Scherer, F.C., 1980, Exploration in East Malaysia Over the Past Decade, in Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, AAPG Memoir 30, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa, American Association of Petroleum Geologists, ISBN 0891813063, p. 424  The Baronia Field is a domal structural trap between two east-west growth faults, which produces from late Miocene sandstones interbedded with siltstones and clays at 2 km depth in 75 m of water.[tpl]rp|431[/tpl]  The Samarang Field produces from late Miocene sandtones in an alternating sequence of sandstones, siltstones and clays in an anticline at a depth of about 3 km in water 9–45 m.[tpl]rp|431[/tpl]  The Central Luconia Gas Fields produce from middle to late Miocene carbonate platform and pinnacle reefs from 1.25-3.76 km deep and water depths 60-100m.[tpl]rp|436–437[/tpl]
