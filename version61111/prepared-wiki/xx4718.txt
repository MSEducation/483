For more than two decades there have been plans for building a metro system in Baghdad. It is possible that part of the tunnels have been built, but that they are now used militarily for sheltering, hiding and escaping purposes. U.N. inspectors have heard of the tunnels for years, but have not found their entrances. http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/21/60minutes/main541565.shtml?cmp=EM8707 map http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/declassdocs/dia/19961031/961031_950719_22010825_93a.html http://english.pravda.ru/world/2003/01/27/42583.html  In November, 2008, an overground service dubbed the Baghdad Metro began service. Local government in Baghdad is arranging feasibility studies for the construction of two new underground lines
A 37 km monorail is planned in Najaf, which would link three Shi'ite holy sites.
The first Iraqi Republic Railways train to Basra since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime arrived on 26 April 2003.  British troops hope to use the 68 km long railway to transport much-needed aid supplies from the port town of Umm Qasr to Basra.
In June 2011, it was announced that planning had begun for a new high-speed rail line between Baghdad and Basra, with a memorandum of understanding with Alstom having been signed.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13909905 | title=Iraq: France's Alstom signs high-speed rail line deal | publisher=BBC News Online | date=24 June 2011 | accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zlPy9qp9 | archivedate=27 June 2011[/tpl]
