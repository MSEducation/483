==Incident==

On 25 October 2004, a demonstration of around 1,500 people gathered in front of a police station in Tak Bai to protest the detention of six men. Several hours into the protest, the crowd attempted to cross the police barrier into the station. Police responded with tear gas and water cannon, and the crowd responded by throwing rocks. Police fired into the air and then into the crowd at head height, killing seven.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA39/001/2006/en/08ee0ded-d46f-11dd-8743-d305bea2b2c7/asa390012006en.html |title='If You Want Peace, Work for Justice'|date=2006 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=1 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/29/1099028209065.html?from=storylhs |title=Deadly demo puts Thais on tightrope |date=30 October 2004 |work=The Age |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BqrSuMZO |deadurl=no[/tpl]
Almost 1,300 protesters were detained at the scene; they were ordered to strip, lie on their bellies, and crawl to nearby trucks that would transport them to another site.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4017551.stm |title=Thailand's smile fades |author=Farish A.

The detainees were then stacked atop one another in trucks and transported to Inkayut Military Camp in Pattani Province. The drive took five hours, and by the time the trucks arrived at the destination, 78 detainees had died from suffocation or organ collapse.

==Retaliation==

On November 2, 2004, Jaran Torae, a Buddhist deputy police chief, was found beheaded in Narathiwat province. A handwritten note described the murder as retaliation for the deaths at Tak Bai.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/news/03iht-thai_ed3_.html?_r=0 |title=Note calls beheading revenge for deaths of Muslim Thais |author=Nick Cumming-Bruce |date=3 November 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BqsFHsK7 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Several other killings of Buddhist village leaders and police officials were attributed to revenge for the incident.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/opinion/17iht-a6_13.html |title=Thailand : Behind the Muslim 'insurgency' |author=David Fullbrook |date=17 December 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BqsMrOMh |deadurl=no[/tpl]
