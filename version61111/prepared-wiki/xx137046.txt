==Career==

King started his career with Oxford United making his debut on, 1 May 2001 against Port Vale in the last competitive match to be played at The Manor Ground. Overall he only played four games for Oxford United before he signed for Barnet in 2003.
He has won three caps for the England non-league team, scoring the winning goal on his debut against Italy in 2005.
King was transfer listed by Barnet at the end of the 2006–07 season, for which he was named player of the year, to avoid him leaving on a free transfer a year later. He was signed by Gillingham for £200,000 on a three-year deal in June 2007. This fee could however rise to £250,000, depending on appearances and whether Gillingham achieve promotion to the Football League Championship. He made his debut on the first day of the season against Cheltenham Town, but was on the wrong end of a 1–0 defeat. He was named Gillingham's Player of the Year for the 2008–09 seasonKing voted Player of the Year as well as being voted into the Professional Footballers' Association League Two team of the year.
On 3 July 2009, King signed a new three-year contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2012. However during a pre-season friendly against Bromley, King suffered an ankle injury which kept him out of the entire 2009–10 season. The injury also carried over to the beginning of the 2010–11 season. King finally returned to training on 1 November 2010 after 18 months out, with the last professional game he played in having been the 2009 Football League Two play-off Final.
The return from injury for King was short lived however, after suffering a setback during training which caused the length on the sidelines to be extended for a few weeks. On 8 February 2011, King finally made his return to football after 18 months without playing after replacing Matthew Lawrence in the 25th minute in the 3–1 home win against Rotherham United. He joined Plymouth Argyle on loan for one month on 31 August 2011,[tpl]cite web|last=Cawdell|first=Luke|title=Simon King makes loan switch from Gillingham to Plymouth Argyle|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/sport/2011/august/31/simon_king.aspx|publisher=Kent Online|accessdate=31 August 2011|date=31 August 2011[/tpl] and made his debut in a 2–1 defeat at Burton Albion on 3 September.
