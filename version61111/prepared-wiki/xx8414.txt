North Korea ([tpl]audio|En-us-North Korea.ogg|listen|help=no[/tpl]), officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; Chosŏn'gŭl: [tpl]lang|ko|조선민주주의인민공화국[/tpl]; Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The name Korea is derived from Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. The capital and largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China to the north and north-west, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers. A small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea's short border with Russia to the northeast.[tpl]cite news |title=Manchurian Trivia |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/manchurian-trivia/ |accessdate=27 August 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 February 2012 |author=Frank Jacobs |format=blog by expert[/tpl] The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula.
The Korean Peninsula was governed by the Korean Empire from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, until it was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule ceased. The Korean Peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in 1945, with the northern part of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern portion by the United States. A United Nations-supervised election held in 1948 led to the creation of separate Korean governments for the two occupation zones: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War in 1950. An armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was never signed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528320,00.html|title=U.S.: N.

==History==

===Ancient kingdoms===

According to legend, Gojoseon was the first Korean kingdom founded in the north of the peninsula, in 2333 BC by Dangun.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|title=Korea's History|publisher=Asian Shravan|accessdate=17 February 2009[/tpl] Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and some parts of Manchuria. Gojoseon was first mentioned in Chinese records in the early 7th century BC, and around the 4th century BC, its capital moved to Pyongyang.
After many conflicts with the Chinese Han Dynasty, Gojoseon disintegrated. A number of small states emerged in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, leading to the Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea period. This saw the kingdoms of Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and the Samhan confederacy occupying the peninsula and southern Manchuria. Of the various states, Goguryeo in the north, and Baekje and Silla in the south, grew to control the peninsula as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Goguryeo was the first Korean kingdom to adopt Buddhism as the state religion in 372.
The kingdom reached its zenith in the 5th century AD, when it controlled central Korea, including the present-day Seoul area. Goguryeo fought numerous wars with China and repulsed a number of Chinese invasions. However, the kingdom fell into decline in the 7th century and after internal power struggles, it was conquered by allied Silla-Tang forces. The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the North South States Period, in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Silla. The kingdom of Balhae controlled northern areas of Korea and parts of Manchuria between the 7th and 10th centuries.
Under the rule of Unified Silla, relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful. Silla weakened under internal strife, and eventually was defeated by King Taejo of Goryeo of the Goryeo Dynasty in 935.
Goryeo, with its capital at Gaegyeong in present day North Korea, gradually came to rule the whole Korean peninsula. The Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened Goryeo. Goryeo became a dependency of the Mongol Empire and was forced to pay tribute. After the Mongol Empire collapsed, Korea experienced political strife and the Goryeo Dynasty was replaced in 1388 by the long-lasting Joseon Dynasty (named in honor of the ancient Gojoseon kingdom).

====Middle Ages====

The capital was moved south to Hanyang (modern-day Seoul) in 1394. Joseon accepted the nominal suzerainty of China. Internal conflicts within the royal court and civil unrest plagued the kingdom in the years that followed, a situation made worse by the depredations of Japanese pirates.
After a largely peaceful 15th century, central authority declined and Korea was plagued again by coastal raids by Japanese pirates. Two Japanese attempts to conquer Korea were repulsed in 1592–1598. In the early 17th century Korea became involved in wars against the rising Manchus on the northern borders.
The 17th to 19th centuries were marked by increasing Joseon self-isolation from the outside world, dependence on China for external affairs and occasional internal faction fighting. The Joseon Dynasty tried to isolate from sea traders by closing itself to all nations except China. Slaves, nobi, are estimated to have accounted for about one third of the population of Joseon Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 | work =Encyclopædia Britannica | title = Slavery |publisher=Britannica | accessdate = 2009-11-03[/tpl] By the mid-19th century the Joseon court followed a cautious policy of slow exchange with the West. In 1866, an American-owned armed merchant ship, attempted to open Korea to trade. The ship sailed upriver and became stranded near Pyongyang.
After being ordered to leave by Korean officials, American crewmen killed four Korean inhabitants, kidnapped a military officer and engaged in sporadic fighting.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] The ship was finally set aflame by Korean fireships. In 1871, a US force killed 243 Korean troops on Ganghwa island. This incident is called the Sinmiyangyo in Korea. Five years later, Korea signed a trade treaty with Japan, and in 1882 signed a treaty with the United States, ending centuries of isolationism of the "Hermit Kingdom".

====Japanese occupation (1895–1945)====

As a result of the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki stipulated the end of traditional Joseon dependency on China. In 1897, Joseon was renamed the Korean Empire. Russian influence was strong until the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), after which Korea became a protectorate of Japan. Korea was then annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910, leading to 35 years of military rule.
After the annexation, Japan tried to suppress Korean traditions and culture and ran the economy primarily for the Japanese benefit. Anti-Japanese, pro-liberation rallies took place nationwide on 1 March 1919 (the 1 March Movement). About 7,000 people were killed during the suppression of this movement. Continued anti-Japanese uprisings, such as the nationwide uprising of students in 1929, led to the strengthening of military rule in 1931. After the outbreaks of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and World War II Japan stepped up efforts to extinguish Korean culture.
The Korean language was banned and Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names. Worship at Japanese Shinto shrines was made compulsory. The school curriculum was radically modified to eliminate teaching in the Korean language and history. Numerous Korean cultural artifacts were destroyed or taken to Japan. Resistance groups known as Dongnipgun (Liberation Army) operated along the Sino-Korean border, fighting guerrilla warfare against Japanese forces. Some of them took part in allied action in China and parts of South East Asia.
During World War II, Koreans at home were forced to support the Japanese war effort. Tens of thousands of men were conscripted into Japan's military. Around 200,000 girls and women, many from Korea, were forced to engage in sexual services, with the euphemism "comfort women".

===Division of Korea (1945)===

After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule was brought to an end. The Korean peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in 1945 along the 38th parallel, with the northern half of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet Union and the southern half by the United States, in accordance with a prior arrangement between the two world powers, where United Nations–supervised elections were intended to be held for the entire peninsula shortly after the war. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated in exile since 1919, was ignored, mainly because of the American perception that it was too communist-aligned.
In August 1945, the Soviet Army established a Soviet Civil Authority in the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula. The Provisional People's Committee for North Korea was set up in February 1946, headed by Kim Il-sung. He introduced sweeping land reforms and nationalized key industries. Talks on the future of Korea were held in Moscow and Seoul but without result. Initial hopes for a unified, independent Korea evaporated as the politics of the Cold War resulted in the establishment of two separate nations with diametrically opposed political, economic, and social systems.
There was sporadic unrest in the South. In September 1946, South Korean citizens had risen up against the Allied Military Government. In April 1948, an uprising of the Jeju islanders was violently crushed. The South declared its statehood in May 1948 and two months later the ardent anti-Communist Syngman Rhee became its ruler. The People's Republic of Korea was established in the North on 9 September 1948.
The Rhee regime consolidated itself through harsh persecution of all suspected opponents. It conducted a number of military campaigns against left-wing insurgents during which 30,000 to 100,000 people lost their lives. In October 1948, the Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion occurred and on 24 December 1949, the South Korean Army massacred Mungyeong citizens who were suspected communist sympathizers and affixed the blame on communists.
Soviet forces withdrew from the North in 1948 and most American forces withdrew from the South the following year. This dramatically weakened the Southern regime and encouraged Kim Il-sung to consider an invasion plan against the South.Bruce Cummings, The Origins of the Korean War, Vol. 1: Liberation and the Emergence of Separate Regimes, 1945–1947, Princeton University Press War proposals were rejected several times by Joseph Stalin, but along with the development of Soviet nuclear weapons, Mao Zedong's victory in China, and the Chinese indication that it would send troops and other support to North Korea, Stalin approved the invasion which led to the start of the Korean War in June 1950.[tpl]Cite book| last = Martin | first = Bradley K. | title = Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty | publisher = Thomas Dunne Books + | year = 2004 | location = New York, NY | pages = 66–67 | isbn = 0-312-32322-0[/tpl] The Korean War broke out when North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel to invade the South.

===Korean War (1950–1953)===

After Korea was divided by the UN, the two Korean powers both tried to control the whole peninsula under their respective governments. This led to escalating border conflicts on the 38th parallel and attempts to negotiate elections for the whole of Korea.[tpl]Cite book| last =Hermes, Jr. | first =Walter | title =Truce Tent and Fighting Front | publisher = United States Army Center of Military History |year=1992| origyear = 1966| id = CMH Pub 20-3-1 | pages =2, 6, 9 | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/truce/fm.htm[/tpl] These attempts ended when the military of North Korea invaded the South on 25 June 1950, leading to a full-scale war. With endorsement from the United Nations, countries allied with the United States intervened on behalf of South Korea.
After rapid advances in a South Korean counterattack, North-allied Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war. Fighting ended on 27 July 1953, with an armistice that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea. More than one million civilians and soldiers were killed in the war.
Although some have referred to the conflict as a civil war, other important factors were involved.[tpl]Cite book| chapter = The Korean War, 1950–1953 | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/ | chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/chapter8.htm | title = American Military History, Volume 2 | year = 2005 | accessdate = 20 August 2007 | publisher = United States Army Center of Military History| editor = Richard W. Stewart | id = CMH Pub 30-22[/tpl] The Korean War was also the first armed confrontation of the Cold War and set the standard for many later conflicts. It is often viewed as an example of the proxy war, where the two superpowers would fight in another country, forcing the people in that country to suffer most of the destruction and death involved in a war between such large nations. The superpowers avoided descending into an all-out war against one another, as well as the mutual use of nuclear weapons. It also expanded the Cold War, which to that point had mostly been concerned with Europe. A heavily guarded demilitarized zone on the 38th parallel still divides the peninsula, and an anti-Communist and anti-North Korea sentiment remains in South Korea.
Since the Armistice in 1953, relations between the North Korean government and South Korea, the European Union, Canada, the United States, and Japan have remained tense, and hostile incidents occur often.Casey, Steven (2008).

===Late 20th century===

The relative peace between the South and the North following the armistice was interrupted by border skirmishes and assassination attempts. The North failed in several assassination attempts on South Korean leaders, most notably in 1968, 1974 and the Rangoon bombing in 1983; tunnels were frequently found under the DMZ and war nearly broke out over the Axe Murder Incident at Panmunjeom in 1976.Kirkbride, Wayne (1984). DMZ, a story of the Panmunjom axe murder. Hollym International Corp. In 1973, extremely secret, high-level contacts began to be conducted through the offices of the Red Cross, but ended after the Panmunjeom incident with little progress having been made and the idea that the two Koreas would join international organizations separately.Doug Bandow and Ted Galen Carpenter (1992). The U.S.-South Korean alliance: time for a change. Transaction Publishers. pp. 98–99. ISBN 978-1-56000-583-4.
North Korea remained closely aligned to China and the Soviet Union until the mid-1960s. Recovery from the war was quick – by 1957 industrial production reached 1949 levels. The last Chinese troops withdrew from the country in October 1958.[tpl]Sfn|Country Study|2009|p=XV[/tpl] Until the 1960s, economic growth was higher than in South Korea, and North Korean GDP per capita was equal to that of its southern neighbor as late as 1976.[tpl]Sfn|Country Study|2009|pp=XXXII, 46[/tpl] However, by the 1980s the economy had begun to stagnate, and almost completely collapsed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Flooding in the mid-1990s exacerbated the economic crisis and led to widespread famine which the government proved incapable of curtailing.
In the late 1990s, with the South having transitioned to liberal democracy, the success of the Nordpolitik policy, and power in the North having been taken up by Kim Il-sung's son Kim Jong-il, the two nations began to engage publicly for the first time, with the South declaring its Sunshine Policy.Kwak, Tae-Hwan; Joo, Seung-Ho (2003).

===Early 21st century===

By the beginning of the 21st century, the worst of the devastating famine had passed, but North Korea continues to rely heavily on foreign aid for its food supply. In January 2002, U.S. president George W. Bush labeled North Korea part of an "axis of evil" and an "outpost of tyranny". The highest-level contact the government has had with the United States was with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who made a visit to Pyongyang in 2000,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/interviews/albright.html |title=Interview – Madeleine Albright |accessdate=11 August 2007 |author=Chris Bury|date=November 2000 |work=Nightline Frontline, on PBS.org[/tpl] but the two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html#Econ |title=Korea, North |accessdate=17 May 2010 |year=2009 | work=The World Factbook[/tpl] By 2006, approximately 37,000 American soldiers remained in South Korea, although by June 2009 this number had fallen to around 30,000.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/5397767/South-Korea-and-US-troops-raise-alert-level-over-North-Korean-threat.html |title=South Korean and US Troops raise alert level over North Korean Threat |accessdate=6 July 2009 |author=Malcolm Moore |date=28 May 2009|work=Telegraph Online | location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200501/13/eng20050113_170566.html |title=S.

Four missile launches were conducted on May 18 and 19, 2013—according to South Korea's defense ministry, three short-range guided missiles landed into the waters off the Korean peninsula on May 18, followed by a fourth on May 19. The missiles did not put any neighboring nations at risk and Pyongyang's actions were widely viewed as an exercise in fear creation to prompt other countries to consider security and aid concessions. The launches occurred during a period when relations were strained between the North and the South, as Pyongyang refused to participate in talks over the closed Kaesong plant.[tpl]cite news|title=North Korea Fires Missiles|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323463704578492844202791354.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTTopStories|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=19 May 2013|author=KYONG-AE CHOI|author2=ALASTAIR GALE[/tpl]

==Geography==

North Korea occupies the northern portion of the Korean Peninsula, lying between latitudes 37° and 43°N, and longitudes 124° and 131°E. It covers an area of [tpl]convert|120540|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl]. North Korea shares land borders with China and Russia to the north, and borders South Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone.
To its west are the Yellow Sea and Korea Bay, and to its east lies Japan across the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea). The highest point in North Korea is Baekdu Mountain at [tpl]convert|2744|m|ft|0[/tpl]. The longest river is the Amnok (Yalu) River which flows for [tpl]convert|790|km|mi|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Jta/Kr/KrGEO0.htm |title=Korea Geography |accessdate=1 August 2007 |author= Bill Caraway|year=2007 |work=The Korean History Project[/tpl]
The capital and largest city is Pyongyang; other major cities include Kaesong in the south, Sinuiju in the northwest, Wonsan and Hamhung in the east and Chongjin in the northeast.
In 2013, internet users were encouraged to participate in a community based event on Google Maps. These users could use Google Map Maker along with Cartography and Telemetry skills that eventually led to a virtual map of Pyongyang.[tpl]cite news|title=A New Target for Google Maps: The Streets of North Korea|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/world/asia/google-maps-new-target-secretive-north-korea.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 January 2013|first1=Choe|last1=Sang-Hun[/tpl] In addition, the Google Map of North Korea includes political prison camp locations such as Camp 22.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=10862319 |title=Google maps out North Korea – Technology – NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl]

===Topography===

Early European visitors to Korea remarked that the country resembled "a sea in a heavy gale" because of the many successive mountain ranges that crisscross the peninsula.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0030)|title=Topography and Drainage|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=17 August 2009|date=1 June 1993[/tpl] Some 80% of North Korea is composed of mountains and uplands, separated by deep and narrow valleys. All of the peninsula's mountains with elevations of [tpl]convert|2000|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] or more are located in North Korea. The coastal plains are wide in the west and discontinuous in the east. A great majority of the population lives in the plains and lowlands.
The highest point in North Korea is Baekdu Mountain which is a volcanic mountain which forms part of the Chinese/North Korean border with basalt lava plateau with elevations between [tpl]convert|1400|and|2744|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level. The Hamgyong Range, located in the extreme northeastern part of the peninsula, has many high peaks including Kwanmobong at approximately [tpl]convert|2541|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
Other major ranges include the Rangrim Mountains, which are located in the north-central part of North Korea and run in a north-south direction, making communication between the eastern and western parts of the country rather difficult; and the Kangnam Range, which runs along the North Korea–China border. Mount Kumgang, or Diamond Mountain, (approximately [tpl]convert|1638|m|ft|disp=or[/tpl]) in the Taebaek Range, which extends into South Korea, is famous for its scenic beauty.
For the most part, the plains are small. The most extensive are the Pyongyang and Chaeryong plains, each covering about [tpl]convert|500|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl]. Because the mountains on the east coast drop abruptly to the sea, the plains are even smaller there than on the west coast. Unlike neighboring Japan or northern China, North Korea experiences few severe earthquakes.

===Climate===

North Korea has a continental climate with four distinct seasons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0031) |title=North Korea Country Studies. Climate |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl] Long winters bring bitter cold and clear weather interspersed with snow storms as a result of northern and northwestern winds that blow from Siberia. Average snowfall is 37 days during the winter. The weather is likely to be particularly harsh in the northern, mountainous regions.
Summer tends to be short, hot, humid, and rainy because of the southern and southeastern monsoon winds that bring moist air from the Pacific Ocean. Typhoons affect the peninsula on an average of at least once every summer. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons marked by mild temperatures and variable winds and bring the most pleasant weather. Natural hazards include late spring droughts which often are followed by severe flooding. There are occasional typhoons during the early fall.
North Korea's climate is relatively temperate. Most of the country is classified as type Dwa in the Köppen climate classification scheme, with warm summers and cold, dry winters. In summer there is a short rainy season called changma.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/21.htm |title=North Korea – Climate |accessdate=1 August 2007 |author=Federal Research Division of the US Library of Congress |year=2007 |work=Country Studies[/tpl] On 7 August 2007, the most devastating floods in 40 years caused the North Korean government to ask for international help. NGOs, such as the Red Cross, asked people to raise funds because they feared a humanitarian catastrophe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/Docs/News/pr07/4607.asp |title="Emergency appeal for DPRK flood survivors", website of the Red Cross |publisher=Ifrc.org |date=20 August 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl]

===Controls on political expression===

Political expression is tightly controlled in North Korea. Supporters of the government who deviate from the government line are subject to reeducation in sections of labor camps set aside for that purpose. Those who are successfully rehabilitated may reassume responsible government positions on their release."Report on political prisoners in North soon" article by Han Yeong-ik in Korea Joongang Daily 30 April 2012
Troublesome political dissidents, factionalists and class enemies, who are considered irredeemable are incarcerated together with any close family members or children born in the camp in "Total Control Zones" for a life of hard labor. Labor camps in North Korea are actually areas of the country set aside for that purpose, Camp 22 (also known as Kwan-li-so No.22 Haengyong) is 31 miles by 25 miles with a population of about 50,000. Those who attempt to escape or violate camp rules are executed or sent to a separate prison within the camp. The labor camps are reserved for political prisoners; common criminals are incarcerated in a separate system."Outside World Turns Blind Eye to N.

===Foreign relations===

North Korea has long maintained close relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. The fall of communism in eastern Europe in 1989, and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, resulted in a devastating drop in aid to North Korea from Russia, although China continues to provide substantial assistance. North Korea continues to have strong ties with its socialist southeast Asian allies in Vietnam and Laos, as well as with Cambodia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/165th_issue/2001072510.htm |title=Kim Yong Nam Visits 3 ASEAN Nations To Strengthen Traditional Ties |accessdate=1 August 2007 |year=2001 |work=The People's Korea[/tpl]

===Personality cult===

The North Korean government exercises control over many aspects of the nation's culture, and this control is used to perpetuate a cult of personality surrounding Kim Il-sung,[tpl]Sfn|Myers|2011|p= 100[/tpl] and, to a lesser extent, Kim Jong-il.[tpl]Sfn|Myers|2011|p= 113[/tpl] While visiting North Korea in 1979, journalist Bradley Martin noted that nearly all music, art, and sculpture that he observed glorified "Great Leader" Kim Il-sung, whose personality cult was then being extended to his son, "Dear Leader" Kim Jong-il.Bradley K. Martin. Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty. ISBN 0-312-32322-0 Bradley Martin also reported that there is even widespread belief that Kim Il-sung "created the world", and Kim Jong-il could "control the weather".
Such reports are contested by North Korea researcher Brian R. Myers: "divine powers have never been attributed to either of the two Kims. In fact, the propaganda apparatus in Pyongyang has generally been careful not to make claims that run directly counter to citizens’ experience or common sense."[tpl]Sfn|Myers|2011|p=7[/tpl] He further explains that the state propaganda painted Kim Jong-il as someone whose expertise lay in military matters and that the famine of the 1990s was partially caused by natural disasters out of Kim Jong-il's control.[tpl]Sfn|Myers|2011|pp=114, 116[/tpl]
The song "No Motherland Without You" (당신이없으면 조국도없다), sung by the North Korean Army Choir, was created especially for Kim Jong-il and is one of the most popular tunes in the country. Kim Il-sung is still officially revered as the nation's "Eternal President". Several landmarks in North Korea are named for Kim Il-sung, including Kim Il-sung University, Kim Il-sung Stadium, and Kim Il-sung Square. Defectors have been quoted as saying that North Korean schools deify both father and son.Chol-hwan Kang and Pierre Rigoulot (2005). The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01104-7 Kim Il-sung rejected the notion that he had created a cult around himself, and accused those who suggested this of "factionalism". Following the death of Kim Il-Sung, North Koreans were prostrating and weeping to a bronze statue of him in an organized event;[tpl]cite news | title=DEATH OF A LEADER: THE SCENE; In Pyongyang, Crowds of Mourners Gather at Kim Statue| work=The New York Times| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E5D9143FF933A25754C0A962958260| accessdate=19 November 2007 | date=10 July 1994[/tpl] similar scenes were broadcast by state television following the death of Kim Jong-il.
Critics maintain this Kim Jong-il personality cult was inherited from his father, Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-il was often the center of attention throughout ordinary life in the DPRK. His birthday is one of the most important public holidays in the country. On his 60th birthday (based on his official date of birth), mass celebrations occurred throughout the country.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1823713.stm|title=North Korea marks leader's birthday|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2002|accessdate=18 December 2007[/tpl] Kim Jong-il's personality cult, although significant, was not as extensive as his father's. One point of view is that Kim Jong-il's cult of personality was solely out of respect for Kim Il-sung or out of fear of punishment for failure to pay homage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/publications/books/dprkbb/negotiating/dprk-briefing-book-korean-monarch-kim-jong-il-technocrat-ruler-of-the-hermit-kingdom-facing-the-challenge-of-modernity/|title=Korean Monarch Kim Jong Il: Technocrat Ruler of the Hermit Kingdom Facing the Challenge of Modernity|publisher= The Nautilus Institute|accessdate=18 December 2007|last=Mansourov|first=Alexandre[/tpl] Media and government sources from outside of North Korea generally support this view,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6368203.stm|title=Nuclear deal fuels Kim's celebrations|publisher=BBC|date=16 February 2007|accessdate=18 December 2007|last=Scanlon|first=Charles[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1916374.ece|title=Kim Jong Il, the tyrant with a passion for wine, women and the bomb|publisher=The Independent|date=21 October 2006|accessdate=18 December 2007|last=Coonan|first=Clifford | location=London[/tpl]Richard Lloyd Parry.

===Korean reunification===

North Korea's policy is to seek reunification without what it sees as outside interference, through a federal structure retaining each side's leadership and systems. In 2000, both North and South Korea signed the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration in which both sides made promises to seek out a peaceful reunification. The Democratic Federal Republic of Korea is a proposed state first mentioned by then North Korean president Kim Il-sung on 10 October 1980, proposing a federation between North and South Korea in which the respective political systems would initially remain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.songunpoliticsstudygroup.org/Oct102008/W-801010.HTM|title=REPORT TO THE SIXTH CONGRESS OF THE WORKERS’ PARTY OF KOREA ON THE WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE|last=Kim|first=Il Sung|date=10 October 1980|publisher=Songun Politics Study Group (USA)|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

==Economy==

The economy of North Korea operates under the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and issues the North Korean won. North Korea has an industrialized,  highly centralized command economy with a high priority on self-sufficiency and independence. North Korea and Cuba are the only two states with an almost entirely government-planned, state-owned economy.

Tourism in North Korea is organized by the state-owned Korea International Travel Company. All tourists/visitors are constantly accompanied by one or two guides, who usually speak the tourist's native language. While tourism has increased over the last few years, tourists from Western countries remain few.
Most visitors come from China, Russia, and Japan. For citizens of South Korea, it is almost impossible to get a visa to North Korea; they can get entry permits to special tourist areas designated for South Koreans, such as Kaesong. United States citizens were also subject to visa restrictions, allowed to visit only during the yearly Arirang Festival; these restrictions were lifted in January 2010.

===Famine===

In the 1990s North Korea faced significant economic disruptions, including a series of natural disasters, economic mismanagement and serious resource shortages after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. These resulted in a shortfall of staple grain output of more than 1 million tons from what the country needs to meet internationally accepted minimum dietary requirements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/49.htm |title=North Korea – Agriculture |accessdate=1 August 2007 |author=Federal Research Division of the US Library of Congress |year=2007 |work=Country Studies[/tpl] The North Korean famine known as the "Arduous March" resulted in the deaths of between 300,000 and 800,000 North Koreans per year during the three-year famine, peaking in 1997.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/19/nkorea.famine/ |title=Famine may have killed 2 million in North Korea |accessdate=1 August 2007 |author=May Lee|date=19 August 1998 |work=CNN | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209071653/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9808/19/nkorea.famine/| archivedate = 9 February 2007[/tpl] The deaths were most likely caused by famine-related illnesses such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea rather than starvation.
In 2006, Amnesty International reported that a national nutrition survey conducted by the North Korean government, the World Food Programme, and UNICEF found that 7% of children were severely malnourished; 37% were chronically malnourished; 23.4% were underweight; and one in three mothers was malnourished and anemic as the result of the lingering effect of the famine. The inflation caused by some of the 2002 economic reforms, including the Songun or "Military-first" policy, was cited for creating the increased price of basic foods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/prk-summary-eng |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529223004/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/prk-summary-eng |archivedate=2007-05-29 |title=Asia-Pacific : North Korea |accessdate=1 August 2007 |year=2007 |work=Amnesty International[/tpl]
The history of Japanese assistance to North Korea has been marked with challenges; from a large pro-Pyongyang community of Koreans in Japan to public outrage over the 1998 North Korean missile launch and revelations regarding the abduction of Japanese citizens.Haggard Stephan; Marcus Noland (2007). Ch6 The political economy of aid: Famine in North Korea. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 137. In June 1995, an agreement was reached that the two countries would act jointly. South Korea would provide 150,000 tons of grain in unmarked bags, and Japan would provide 150,000 tons free and another 150,000 tons on concessional terms. In October 1995 and January 1996, North Korea again approached Japan for assistance. On these two occasions, both of which came at crucial moments in the evolution of the famine, opposition from both South Korea and domestic political sources quashed the deals.
Beginning in 1997, the U.S. began shipping food aid to North Korea through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to combat the famine. Shipments peaked in 1999 at nearly 700,000 tons making the U.S. the largest foreign aid donor to the country at the time.Mark E.

The Ministry of People's Security maintains all law enforcement activities at the local level, which includes police and other initiatives. There is also a State Security Department that operates in a similar way to an "Office of the Interior" located in other countries.

==Media and telecommunications==

===Media===

North Korean media are under some of the strictest government control in the world. The North Korean constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, but the government prohibits the exercise of these rights in practice. In its 2013 report, Reporters without Borders ranked freedom of the press in North Korea as 177th out of 178, above only that of Eritrea.Annual Press Freedom Index. Retrieved 4 November 2010.[tpl]cite web|work=Reporters Without Borders|title=PRESS FREEDOM INDEX 2013|url=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2013,1054.html[/tpl] Only news that favors the regime is permitted, while news that covers the economic and political problems in the country, and foreign criticism of the government, are not allowed."Meagre media for North Korea", BBC, 10 October 2006. The media upholds the personality cult of Kim Jong-un, regularly reporting on his daily activities. The main news provider to media in the DPRK is the Korean Central News Agency.
North Korea has 12 principal newspapers and 20 major periodicals, all of varying periodicity and all published in Pyongyang.Larinda B. Pervis (2007).

A study commissioned by the U. S. State Department shows that, despite extremely strict regulations and draconian penalties, North Koreans, particularly elite elements, have increasing access to news and other media outside the state-controlled media authorized by the government.

===Radio===

It has been reported that North Korea uses "radio jamming" techniques in order to prevent access to non-nationalist broadcasts. However, a group by the name of Free North Korea Radio conducts numerous activities that focus on providing a free radio station to North Koreans. The broadcasts often include instructions on methods to leave the country and their faction has contact with underground reporters within North Korea. The group primarily consists of numerous North Korean refugees and defectors.[tpl]cite book|author=Melanie Kirkpatrick |title=Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia's Underground Railroad |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yMizWCJ6hTYC&pg=PA286 |year=2012 |publisher=Encounter Books |isbn=978-1-59403-646-0 |pages=286–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Karin Deutsch Karlekar |author2=Sarah Gibbard Cook |title=Freedom of the Press 2008: A Global Survey of Media Independence |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fEKw8ZIUbh8C&pg=PA250 |year=2009 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-6309-4 |pages=250–[/tpl]

===Telephones and mobiles===

In North Korea, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications maintains the phone systems within the country and oversees the Postal Service. North Korea has an adequate telephone system, with 1.18 million fixed lines available in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html?countryName=Korea,North&countryCode=kn&regionCode=eas&rank=70#kn | title=Country Comparison: Telephones – main lines in use | publisher=CIA | work=The World Factbook[/tpl] However, most phones are only installed for senior government officials.

The computers primarily use Red Star OS as an operating system.

==Transportation==

Two of the few ways to enter North Korea are over the Sino-Korea Friendship Bridge or via Panmunjeom, the former crossing the Amnok River (Yalu) and the latter crossing the Demilitarized Zone.
On 13 October 2011 a train from the Russian border settlement of Khasan made an inaugural run to Rajin in North Korea.

People traveling from the capital Pyongyang to other regions in North Korea typically travel by rail. However, in order to travel out of Pyongyang, people need an official travel certificate, ID, and a purchased ticket in advance. Because of lack of maintenance on the rail infrastructure and vehicles, the travel time by rail is increasing. It has been reported that the [tpl]convert|120|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] trip from Pyongyang to Kaesong can take up to 6 hours.Paul French (2007).

Except for the Yalu and Taedong rivers, most of the inland waterways, totaling [tpl]convert|2253|km|mi|sp=us[/tpl], are navigable only by small boats. Coastal traffic is heaviest on the eastern seaboard, whose deeper waters can accommodate larger vessels. The major ports are Nampho on the west coast and Rajin, Chongjin, Wonsan, and Hamhung on the east coast.

==Demographics==

North Korea's population of roughly 24 million is one of the most ethnically and linguistically homogeneous in the world, with very small numbers of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, South Korean, and European expatriate minorities.
According to the CIA World Factbook, North Korea's life expectancy was 63.8 years in 2009, a figure roughly equivalent to that of Pakistan and Burma and slightly lower than Russia.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Country Comparison :: Life expectancy at birth|year=2009|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl] Infant mortality stood at a high level of 51.3, which is 2.5 times higher than that of China, 5 times that of Russia, and 12 times that of South Korea.[tpl]cite web| title=Infant mortality rate | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html | work=The World Factbook – Country Comparisons | publisher=CIA |year=2009 | accessdate=1 May 2009[/tpl]

===Language===

North Korea shares the Korean language with South Korea. There are dialect differences within both Koreas, but the border between North and South does not represent a major linguistic boundary. Both Koreas share the phonetic writing system called Chosongul in the north and Hangul south of the DMZ. The official Romanization differs in the two countries, with North Korea using a slightly modified McCune-Reischauer system, and the South using the Revised Romanization of Korean. While prevalent in the South, the adoption of modern terms from foreign languages has been limited in North Korea. Hanja (Chinese characters) are no longer used in North Korea (ever since 1949), although still occasionally used in South Korea. The move toward prohibiting both Roman and Chinese-based characters in North Korea has led to the creation of a number of words and phrases not common in the southern half of the peninsula or in Korean communities abroad.

===Religion===

Both Koreas share a Buddhist and Confucian heritage and a recent history of Christian and Cheondoism ("religion of the Heavenly Way") movements. The North Korean constitution states that freedom of religion is permitted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.korea-np.co.jp/pk/061st_issue/98091708.htm|title=DPRK's Socialist Constitution (Full Text)|accessdate=4 July 2009|publisher=The People's Korea|year=1998[/tpl]; see Chapter 5, Article 68 According to the Western standards of religion, the majority of the North Korean population could be characterized as non-religious.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] However, the cultural influence of such traditional religions as Buddhism and Confucianism still have an effect on North Korean spiritual life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/North-Korea.html|title=Culture of North Korea – Alternative name, History and ethnic relations|work=Countries and Their Cultures|publisher=Advameg Inc.|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html#People |title=CIA The World Factbook – North Korea |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=3 November 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2792.htm|title=Background Note: North Korea|author=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs|date=2009-2|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=4 July 2009[/tpl]
Nevertheless, Buddhists in North Korea reportedly fare better than other religious groups, particularly Christians, who are said to face persecution by the authorities. Buddhists are given limited funding by the government to promote the religion, because Buddhism played an integral role in traditional Korean culture.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/02/world/fg-temple2|title=Buddhist Temple Being Restored in N.

Two notable universities in the DPRK are the Kim Il-sung University and Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, both in Pyongyang. The former, founded in October 1946, is an elite institution whose enrollment of 16,000 full- and part-time students in the early 1990s occupies, in the words of one observer, the "pinnacle of the North Korean educational and social system."[tpl]cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+kp0059) |title=North Korea – Higher education. |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |accessdate=23 June 2010[/tpl] There is also a University called the Kim Chaek University of Technology that specializes in information technology and nuclear research.Kim Chaek University of Technology | Facilities.

North Korea employs artists to produce art for export at the Mansudae Art Studio in Pyongyang. Over 1,000 artists are employed. Products include water colors, ink drawings, posters, mosaics and embroidery.

Traditional Korean designs and themes are present most often in the embroidery. The artistic and technical quality of the works produced is very high but other than a few wealthy South Korean collectors there is a limited market because of public taste and reluctance of states and collectors to financially support the regime.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nknews.org/2011/02/pyongyang%E2%80%99s-idealistic-art-impresses-the-realist-minded-moscow/|title=Pyongyang’s Idealistic Art Impresses the Realist-minded Moscow|author=Leonid Petrov|date=3 February 2011|publisher=NK News|accessdate=3 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski gained access to North Korea's film industry through British filmmaker Nick Bonner, who facilitated meetings between Broinowski and prominent North Korean filmmakers to assist Broinowski with the production of Aim High in Creation!, a film project based on Kim Jong Il's manifesto. Broinowski explained in July 2013, prior to the screening of the film at the Melbourne International Film Festival:
 
 A friend gave me Kim Jong Il's manifesto on how to make the 'perfect socialist film', The Cinema and Directing (1987). I was immediately fascinated by his often counter-intuitive (for a Westerner at least) filmmaking rules. And I began to wonder: what would a film by Westerners, strictly adhering to Kim Jong Il's rules, be like? Could it have the same power over western audiences that North Korean films have over Kim Jong Il's 23 million citizens? ... I wanted to humanise the North Koreans in the minds of viewers constantly bombarded by the mainstream Western media's depiction of North Koreans as victimised, brainwashed automatons.
A version of Broinowski's work was screened in Pyongyang, but the director believes that the documentary version of the film will not be allowed into the country.
