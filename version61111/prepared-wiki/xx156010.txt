Cyrus Prindle (April 11, 1800 â€“ December 1, 1885) was an American abolitionist and one of the founders of the Wesleyan church of America.  He was born in Canaan, Conn., and entered the New York conference in 1821.  An Abolitionist in principle, he was removed from important appointments to the poorest, and in 1843 with others he seceded from the Methodist Episcopal church and founded the Wesleyan church.  When the movement had accomplished its purpose, with about 100 others of his ministerial associates, he returned to the Methodist church.  He died in Cleveland, Ohio.
