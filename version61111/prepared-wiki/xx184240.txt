[[Faroese grammar]]

CATEGORIES: Faroese language, Grammars of specific languages

Faroese grammar is related and very similar to that of Icelandic and, to less extent, Elfdalian. Faroese is an inflected language with three grammatical genders and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive.

==Noun inflection==

Below is a representation of three grammatical genders, two numbers and four cases in the nominal inflection.  This is just an overview to give a general idea of how the grammar works. Faroese actually has even more declensions. In modern Faroese the genitive has a very limited use (and possession is mostly expressed with various prepositional phrases instead). For most native speakers, the Genitive is a learned and somewhat stilted form as opposed to the other cases which are learned naturally in regular colloquial situations.

In the plural you will see that even the numeral tvey (2) is inflected.
If the noun is definite, the adjective inflects weak, and the noun gets a suffix article as in any Scandinavian language (although Icelandic does not generally need a pre-posed definite article in this construction).
The interrogative pronoun is the same as above. In the plural, the plural form of the definite article is used.
