[[Psalm 9 (album)]]

CATEGORIES: Trouble albums, 1984 debut albums, Metal Blade Records albums

Psalm 9 is the debut album by the American doom metal band Trouble, released in 1984. The album was originally released eponymously and was renamed to Psalm 9 after the release of their fourth album, which was their 1990 self-titled release. Along with the Saint Vitus eponymous debut album which was also released in 1984, this album is considered by many to be one of the first doom metal albums to be released.
The cover of Cream's "Tales of Brave Ulysses" was a b-side to the only single taken from the album.
The album has been released for CD on three occasions: in 1991 by Metal Blade, a year after the release of then-current album Trouble; remastered using the original master tapes and reissued again by Metal Blade in 1994, commemorating the tenth anniversary of its release; and again remastered and reissued by Escapi Music in October 2006, with a bonus DVD.
