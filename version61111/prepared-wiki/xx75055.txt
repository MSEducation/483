The Summits of the Americas (SOA) is a series of international summit meetings bringing together the leaders of countries in North America, Central America, South America and the Caribbean;  however, no representative from Cuba has participated.Prieto, Alfredo. "Everybody But Cuba," Havana Times. April 15, 2009.  The meetings provide an opportunity for discussions about a variety of issues and topics.
