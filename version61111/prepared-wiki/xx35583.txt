Torndirrup National Park is a national park in the Great Southern region of Western Australia (Australia), [tpl]convert|400|km|mi|0[/tpl] southeast of Perth and [tpl]convert|10|km|abbr=on[/tpl] south of Albany. Torndirrup National Park has many impressive rock formations on the coast. These include the Gap, Natural Bridge and the Blowholes all shaped from the local granite. The park is along the coast on the west side of King George Sound and consists of a range of cliffs, gullies, blowholes, beaches and promontories.

==History==

The area is composed of three major rock type, one of these being gneiss. The oldest of these was formed 1300-1600 million years ago. This rock type can be seen along the cliff walls of the Gap. The granites were formed later as the Australian Plate collided with the Antarctic Plate 1160 million years ago as molten rock rose to the surface. These granites are visible in the tors atop Stony Hill.
The park was gazetted in 1918, one of the first in Western Australia. It was later named in 1969 taking the name of the Indigenous Australian clan that lived in the area. The first ranger was appointed in 1973.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/component/option,com_hotproperty/task,view/id,103/|title=Department of Environment and Conservation -Park Finder - Torndirrup National Park |year=2008|accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl]
