[[Macrocell]]

CATEGORIES: Mobile technology

A macrocell is a cell in a mobile phone network that provides radio coverage served by a high power cellular base station (tower). Generally, macrocells provide coverage larger than microcell. The antennae for macrocells are mounted on ground-based masts, rooftops and other existing structures, at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain. Macrocell base stations have power outputs of typically tens of watts. Mobile Phones: Jargon Explained

==Scale==

The term macrocell is used to describe the widest range of cell sizes. Macrocells are found in rural areas or along highways. Over a smaller cell area, a microcell is used in a densely populated urban area.  Picocells are used for areas even smaller than microcells. An example of usage would be a large office, a mall, or train station. Currently the smallest area of coverage that can be implemented with a femtocell is a home or small office.
