==Production==

El puntero is a political drama set in an Argentine Villa miseria. It is produced by Pol-Ka for the TV channel El Trece. Although El Trece is part of the Grupo Clarín, which had several conflicts with the government of Cristina Kirchner, the lead actor Julio Chávez clarified that the tone of the miniseries is generic, and not a criticism of the Kirchner's administration.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2011/05/14/noticia_0004.html|title= Julio Chávez: será "El Puntero", pero no militante|trans_title= Julio Chávez: he will be "puntero" but not militant|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 14, 2011|work= |publisher= Perfil|accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl] In fact, he conditioned his work in the program on the absence of specific political bias. Chávez did not even know about political clientelism, and investigated about the topic before accepting to work in the program. 
The opening of the program uses the song "Fuego" by Bomba Estéreo, and mixes images of the history of Argentina with images of Chávez characterized as a political puntero. For this purpose he grew his sideburns, used hair extensions, 1970s shirts and chains.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1373756-el-puntero-pudo-mucho-mas-que-cqc|title= El puntero pudo mucho más que CQC|trans_title= El Puntero got much more than CQC|language= Spanish|author= Julieta Nassau|date= May 16, 2011|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 15, 2013[/tpl]
