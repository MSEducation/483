[[New World porcupine]]

CATEGORIES: Erethizontidae

The New World porcupines, family Erethizontidae, are large arboreal rodents, distinguished by their spiny coverings from which they take their name. They inhabit forests and wooded regions across North America, and into northern South America. Although both the New World and Old World porcupine families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.

==Characteristics==

New World porcupines are stout animals, with blunt, rounded heads, fleshy, mobile snouts, and coats of thick, cylindrical or flattened spines ("quills"). The spines are mixed with long, soft hairs. They vary in size from the relatively small prehensile-tailed porcupines, which are around [tpl]convert|30|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and weigh about [tpl]convert|900|g|abbr=on[/tpl], to the much larger North American porcupine, which has a body length of [tpl]convert|86|cm|abbr=on[/tpl], and weighs up to [tpl]convert|18|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Woods, Charles|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 686â€“689|isbn= 0-87196-871-1[/tpl]
They are distinguished from the Old World porcupines in that they have rooted molars, complete collar bones, entire upper lips, tuberculated soles, no trace of first front toes, and four teats. 
They are less strictly nocturnal than Old World species in their habits, and some types live entirely in trees, while others have dens on the ground. Their long and powerful prehensile tails help them balance when they are in the tree tops. Their diets consist mainly of bark, leaves, and conifer needles, but can also include roots, stems, berries, fruits, seeds, nuts, grasses, and flowers. Some species also eat insects and small reptiles.[ref]
