Gregory James "Greg" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is a former professional road racing cyclist, entrepreneur, and anti-doping advocate. Lemond won the World Championship twice and the Tour de France three times. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range,Moore p. 54 near Carson City, NV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/685944/Greg-LeMond|title=Greg LeMond|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122493/2/index.htm|title=Climbing Clear Up To The Heights|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. |date=September 3, 1984|page=2[/tpl] He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meathsports.ie/news/article/article/cycling-legend-greg-lemond-comes-to-meath.html?tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2012&tx_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=09&tx_ttnews%5Bday%5D=07&cHash=7ea35b30cd2b8d842eeefd06d6e57773|title=Cycling legend Greg LeMond comes to Meath!|accessdate=November 27, 2012|work=Meath Local Sports Partnership|publisher=Meath Local Sports Partnership|date=September 7, 2012[/tpl]
In 1986, LeMond became the first non-European professional cyclist to win the Tour de France. LeMond is the only American to officially win the Tour—following Floyd Landis' and  Lance Armstrong's disqualifications for doping.[tpl]#tag:ref|Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour's title in 2007, and Lance Armstrong was stripped of all seven of his Tour titles (1999–2005) in 2012.|group=N[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069271/1/index.htm|title=Le Grand LeMond|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc.|author=E.M.

He was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996.
During his career, LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling, including the introduction of aerodynamic "triathlon" handlebars and carbon fiber bicycle frames,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|title=A Meeting of Minds|last=Walsh|first=Matt|work=Cycle Sport|date= [/tpl] which he later marketed through his company LeMond Bicycles.

LeMond is a vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use, and at times his commercial ventures have suffered for his anti-doping stance—as in 2001, when he first accused Lance Armstrong of doping and sparked a conflict that led eventually to the dissolution of his Lemond Bikes brand in 2008, which was licensed by Armstrong's primary sponsor Trek Bicycles.[tpl]cite web|last=Epstein|first=David|title=Kathy LeMond: Armstrong embarrassed, not truly sorry|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/news/20130118/lance-armstrong-admission-kathy-lemond-reaction/?sct=hp_t2_a6&|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=May 16, 2013|date=January 18, 2013[/tpl] As the lone American winner of cycling's most prestigious race, LeMond has not enjoyed the public stature that might be expected of such a figure, but he continues to campaign publicly against doping and ineffective leadership by the UCI, the International Federation for Cycling. In December 2012, LeMond even articulated a willingness to replace the UCI president on an interim basis if called to do so.[tpl]cite web|title=McQuaid dismisses LeMond's claim to lead UCI|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/cycling/story/McQuaid-dismisses-LeMonds-claim-to-lead-UCI-51378313|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=December 13, 2012[/tpl] In December 2013, the LeMond brand was revived, licensed by Time sports.[tpl]cite web|last=Lindsey|first=Joe|title=LeMond Bikes Return for 2014|url=http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/new-bike-gear-previews/lemond-bikes-return-2014|publisher=Bicycling.com|accessdate=March 13, 2014|date=December 13, 2013[/tpl]

==Early life and amateur career==

Greg LeMond was born in Lakewood, California and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Carson City, NV.  His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha (d. 2006), and he has two sisters, Kathy and Karen. He attended Wooster High School in Reno, NV.
LeMond's introduction to cycling came in 1975 thanks to freestyle skiing pioneer Wayne Wong, who recommended the bike as an ideal off-season training aid.[tpl]cite book|last1=LeMond|first1=Greg|last2=Gordis|first2=Kent|title=Greg LeMond's complete book of bicycling|year=1987|publisher=Putnam Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=0-399-13229-5|page=352|edition=1st|page=16[/tpl] LeMond started competing in 1976, and after dominating the Intermediate category (13-15) and winning the first 11 races he entered, he received permission to ride against older, more seasoned competitors in the Junior (16-19) category.LeMond p. 20
In 1977, while still only 15, LeMond finished second in the Tour of Fresno to John Howard, then America's top road cyclist and the 1971 Pan American Games champion. LeMond caught the attention of Eddie Borysewicz, the US Cycling Federation's national team coach, who described LeMond as "a diamond, a clear diamond."Nye LeMond represented the United States at the 1978 Junior World Championships in Washington, D.C., where he finished ninth in the road race,LeMond p. 22 and again in the 1979 Junior World Championships in Argentina, where he won gold, silver and bronze medals—the highlight being his victory in the road race. At age 18, LeMond was selected for the 1980 U.S. Olympic cycling team, the youngest ever to make the U.S. team; however, the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow prevented him from competing there.
Borysewicz, whom LeMond described as his "first real coach,"LeMond p. 24 wanted to retain his protégé through the next Olympic cycle and discouraged him from turning pro, but LeMond was determined. Nevertheless, while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980, LeMond received no professional offers, and so in the spring 1980, he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a 6-week European racing campaign. There, he finished third overall in the Circuit des Ardennes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=112429|title=Circuit des Ardennes 1980|publisher=Cyclingarchvies.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012[/tpl] before winning the 1980 Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in France,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingfever.com/editie.html?editie_id=8129|title=Circuit Cycliste Sarthe — Pays de la Loire 1980|publisher=CyclingFever.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012[/tpl] thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality "in the history of the sport to win a major pro-am cycling event Europe."LeMond p. 25 That victory, and the subsequent press coverage, raised LeMond's profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event (the Ruban Granitier Breton stage race) by French cycling coach and Renault-Elf-Gitane directeur sportif Cyrille Guimard. Guimard said he was impressed with LeMond's spirit, and told him, "You have the fire to be a great champion," before offering him a professional contract for 1981 with Renault.LeMond p. 26 After he returned to the United States, LeMond won the 1980 Nevada City Classic, considered to be one of the most historic and challenging professional cycling races in America.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cbs13.com/local/lance.armstrong.nevada.2.1054073.html|title=Lance Armstrong Wins Nevada City Classic|date=June 21, 2009|work=CBS 13|accessdate=November 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/ritfiche.php?ritid=89479|title=Nevada City Classic 1980|publisher=Cyclingarchives.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012[/tpl] Despite eventually receiving several other offers to turn professional besides Guimard's, LeMond did not consider them seriously, and he signed with Renault in Paris on the day the 1980 Tour de France finished.LeMond p. 27

==Professional career==

LeMond was a standout amateur rider "of superlative quality" and "exceptionally gifted,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2005/09/news/inside-cycling-with-john-wilcocksonthe-exceptionally-gifted-lemond_8954|last=Wilcockson|first=John|title=Inside Cycling with John Wilcockson:The exceptionally gifted LeMond|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=September 23, 2005[/tpl] who quickly established himself as one of the most talented cyclists on the professional circuit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|title=Cycling Legend: Gearing Up – 70's- 80's|publisher=GregLeMond.com[/tpl] Respected cycling journalist John Wilcockson, who reported the Tour de France for more than 40 years, described LeMond as a rider who was fuoriclasse.[tpl]#tag:ref|Quote: Fuoriclasse means much more than being gifted. In cycling, it is someone who has a slow pulse, large lungs, perfectly proportioned limbs, lean muscles, and, above all, the brain and mindset to utilize all those attributes to win the world's toughest races at the youngest possible age.|group=N[/tpl]

===1981–1983: Early years===

LeMond's first professional victory came three months into his 1981 debut when he won a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion.  The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third.  The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was accessed a 10 minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race to have been a "major steppingstone" in his career.  Said LeMond: "It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races."LeMond p.28 LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122493/1/index.htm|title=Climbing Clear Up To The Heights|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. |date=September 3, 1984|page=1[/tpl]
LeMond broke his collarbone on April 11, 1982 while racing the cycling classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège.Blumenthal p. 34 The injury forced LeMond to ride a reduced schedule before entering the World Championships, which were in Goodwood, England that year. In the men's road race competition LeMond broke for the line but was out-sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni.Blumenthal p. 34 Following the race LeMond's American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters. Saronni was very strong at the end of the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond, winning by 5 seconds over LeMond, with another 5 seconds back to Kelly. Boyer placed tenth.Cyclisme - Championnats de Monde 1982 Bronze medalist Sean Kelly, a favorite to win the race, was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go, but he could not hold his wheel. Said Kelly: "I don't think that Boyer was fading...He got quite a good gap. Nobody wanted to go after him...Yes, LeMond chased down Boyer. Boyer was the only man up the road."
LeMond was supported by his teammate George Mount, who observed, "What's LeMond going to do? Throw his bike down in front of everybody because Boyer is such a good buddy of everyone?...Hell no—he's going to start sprinting because it's less than 200 meters to go and the sprint's already been going for a couple hundred meters. LeMond made a good move and a good sprint...Boyer was not going to win that race. The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place."Blumenthal p. 35
LeMond did not apologize. The U.S. team was not set up as the European teams, and did not have an independent race to determine the national champion. Instead the highest finisher at the World's was considered the national champion. LeMond had argued for the team to compete as the European teams did, but team management and Boyer voted against him. Thus unlike the other teams at the world championship, the US riders were competing against each other.Moore pp.67-69[tpl]#tag:ref|Quote LeMond:"After the 1980 world championship, Jock had himself declared national champion because he was the best placed American in the world championships. The whole year he got to race in a star-spangled jersey, just like the American flag, as national champion. I had made it clear before going to Prague that I was not going to race the world championship as the national championship and have myself competing against other Americans instead of us all working together. The Dutch team didn't enter the race riding against each other to see who would become national champion. That's the spirit I wanted."  US team officials called for a vote.  Two riders sided with Boyer, two with LeMond. An official cast the deciding vote in favor of deciding the national champion as the highest placed American finisher at the world championship race.  Said LeMond "Fine, but you race without me.  If you want me to race, I'm racing for the world championship."Moore p. 69|group=N[/tpl] At 21 LeMond was the first American pro to win a medal at the World's since Frank Kramer took silver in 1912. Said LeMond: "I'm racing for Renault and I'm racing for myself. It's a business and it's my living. To me, that second place was almost as good as winning, especially at my age."Blumenthal p. 31 
Two weeks later, on September 20, 1982, LeMond won the 12-day, 837-mile Tour de l'Avenir, including a tour through the French Alps, by a world-record 10 minutes, 18 seconds. The victory, and the time advantage LeMond held at the end, stunned Europe and provided broad confirmation that LeMond was indeed fuoriclasse.
The following year, 1983, LeMond won the World Championship outright, becoming the first American rider to do so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|title=Cycling Legend: Europe – Pro World Championship|publisher=GregLeMond.com[/tpl] LeMond's cycling talent—his overall strength, climbing ability, ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the most demanding Grand Tours.McGann p. 146

===1984–1986: Grand Tours===

LeMond rode his first Tour de France in 1984, finishing third in support of team leader Laurent Fignon, and winning the white jersey of the Best Young Rider classification. The following year he was brought across to La Vie Claire to ride in support of team captain Bernard Hinault who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/lemond-remembers-fignon|last=Farrand|first=Stephen|work=Cycling News|title=LeMond Remembers Fignon|date=August 31, 2010[/tpl] French businessman and team owner Bernard Tapie signed LeMond with a $1 million contract over three years.Moore p. 132  In the race Hinault led through the early mountain stages, but suffered a crash and came into difficulty.  At this point it was clear that LeMond was an elite rider capable of winning the Tour in his own right.McGann p. 153 LeMond possessed a natural talent for riding the Grand Tours, and got stronger over the course of a three-week race.  The injured Hinault was vulnerable, and his competitors knew it.Moore p. 148 Stage 17 included three major climbs in the Pyrenees.  On the second, the Col du Tourmalet, LeMond followed Stephen Roche in an attack, but was not given permission to help build on the gap over the field.Moore p. 149 The managers of his La Vie Claire team ordered the 24-year-old LeMond not to ride with Roche, but to sit on his wheel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|title=Cycling Legend: Controversy – Feud 1985|publisher=GregLeMond.com[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|Said Stephen Roche:"Greg was getting orders to attack me and not to ride.  The main order was not to ride.  That was frustrating.  I think he felt he was stronger then me, and if he knew he had a better chance of beating me at the finish and in the time trial than why not ride?  If we'd ridden at that point I think we'd have finished first and second in that Tour. Of course the team car was playing it down for Hinault.  He was further back than they were letting on.  They knew if we worked together Hinault wouldn't get back on, and LeMond would have won.  They were looking after French interests.|group=N[/tpl] The pace Roche could put out by himself eventually slowed, and other riders came up to join the two men.  Hinault recovered as well, though he did not regain the lead group.  At the end of the stage LeMond was frustrated to the point of tears.McGann p. 161 He later revealed that team management and his own coach Paul Koechli had misled him as to how far back Hinault had dropped during the crucial Stage 17 mountain stage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roble.net/marquis/coaching/lemond98.html|last=Malessa|first=Bryan|title=Once Was King: An interview with Greg LeMond|publisher=Roble Systems, Inc.|year=1998|accessdate=December 15, 2012[/tpl] Hinault won the 1985 Tour, with LeMond finishing second, 1:42 behind.  LeMond had ridden as the dutiful lieutenant, and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour.[tpl]#tag:ref|The term "dutiful lieutenant" is a cycling term for a teammate who sacrifices his own placing in a race to support his team leader.|group=N[/tpl]  In repayment for his sacrifice Hinault promised to help LeMond win the Tour the following year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065079/index.htm|title=An American Takes Paris|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. | date=August 4, 1986|accessdate=June 6, 2013|page=1|last=Swift|first=E.M.[/tpl]
For the 1986 Tour, LeMond was a co-leader of the La Vie Claire team alongside Hinault.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/oct05/top25-19.html|title=Top 25 All Time Tours #19: 1986 – LeMond Wins After Hinault's Betrayal|work=CyclingRevealed|publisher=CyclingRevealed|last=Boyce|first=Barry|date=October 2005|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl] Hinault's support seemed less certain the closer the race approached.Moore p. 192  An unspoken condition was that his help would be contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider.[tpl]#tag:ref|In a pre-race story featured in L'Equipe, Hinault stressed it is not Hinault, but the race that will decide the outcome, saying "The strongest rider will win".Moore p. 181|group=N[/tpl] Hinault was in superb form, and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour. Hinault chose to let the Stage 9 individual time trial be the decider for which rider would receive the full support of team La Vie Claire.[tpl]#tag:ref|Said LeMond: "His attitude seemed to be 'We'll see after the first time trial.  We'll let that decide who is leading the team.' ... which was not the deal we cut."|group=N[/tpl] Hinault won the Stage 9 time trial, finishing 44 seconds in front of LeMond.  LeMond had bad luck during the stage, having suffered a punctured tire requiring a wheel change, and later in the stage a bicycle change was required when he broke a wheel. He was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function for the remainder of the race. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders.McGann p.165[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1986.html|title=1986 Tour De France|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl] He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond.Moore pp. 202–203[tpl]#tag:ref|Said Hampsten about the first climb of Stage 12: "It was superhot, and early on Hinault was working really hard to drive a group clear, and I thought, That's a little weird.  There was a long way to go.  I asked Greg, 'Why's Hinault doing this?  Did he talk to you?' And Greg said, 'No.' He had no idea why Hinult was riding so hard; it was like he was on a mission."Moore p. 201|group=N[/tpl] He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never placed in difficulty, except by his own teammate.[tpl]cite news|author=Trip Gabriel|title=Tour De Force|work=Rolling Stone Magazine|page=82|date=October 9, 1986[/tpl] The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-21/sports/sp-26494_1_yellow-jersey|title=Tour de France: LeMond Takes Lead, Yellow Jersey|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|agency=Reuters|location=Serre-Chevalier, France| date=July 21, 1986|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl]  The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The La Vie Claire team leaders were both excellent descenders. As they ascended up the next col they continued to pull away from the field, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted Alpe d'Huez. They pressed on through the crowd, ascending the twenty-one switchbacks of Alpe d'Huez and reaching the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity,[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1065079/2/index.htm|title=An American Takes Paris|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc.|date=August 4, 1986|page=2|accessdate=June 6, 2013|last=Swift|first=E.M.[/tpl] but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andy Hampsten and Steve Bauer.Moore p. 252[tpl]#tag:ref|Said Hampsten:"It's the only time I ever chased a teammate in my life.  It felt weird; I felt sick doing it.  I'm chasing my hero, who also happens to be my teammate, but you know what?  I'm thinking 'This isn't cool.  Greg has the jersey.' I knew it was the right thing to do. I was pissed, sick of the whole situation. Steve and I needed to support Greg."|group=N[/tpl] Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile:
 "He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him."[tpl]cite AV media |people= Ligget, Phil and Paul Sherwen (Narrators), Rodney Taylor (Producer)|year=1986 |title=1986 Tour De France |medium=Video DVD |publisher=World Cycling Productions[/tpl] 
LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/8590177/Bernard-Hinault-and-Greg-LeMonds-classic-1986-Tour-de-France-duel-relived-in-Slaying-the-Badger.html|title=Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond's classic 1986 Tour de France duel relived in Slaying the Badger|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl] LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership.

===1987–1988: Shooting accident and recovery===

LeMond had planned to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but was unable to participate. Early that year, he was riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico, an early spring tune-up race, when he fell, suffering a fracture to his left wrist.  He returned to the United States to recover from the injury.  The week before returning to Europe he went turkey hunting near his family home in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law.[tpl]cite web|url=http://greglemond.com/cycling-legend/|last=LeMond|first=Greg|title=Cycling Legend – The Blast|work=LeMond|publisher=Greg Lemond|accessdate=November 30, 2012[/tpl] The camouflaged hunters were at a ranch co-owned by Louis Barber, the father of LeMond's uncle, and Bob LeMond, Greg's father.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&dat=19870421&id=5sUlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iPwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5856,988494|title=LeMond shot in back while hunting|accessdate=November 30, 2012|newspaper=Gettysburg Times|date=April 21, 1987|page=14|location=Sacramento, California|agency=Associated Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19870421&id=vhAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oHIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2224,5201373|title=LeMond Accidentally Shot While Hunting|publisher=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=November 30, 2012|page=27|date=April 21, 1987[/tpl]  The trio had become separated when Blades heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush.

Fortunately a police helicopter was available nearby, and was used to make a 15-minute life-flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis.  LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-21/sports/8701250625_1_patrick-blades-dr-sandy-beal-hunting|work=SunSentinel|author=United Press International|title=Cyclist LeMond Stable After Hunting Accident|date=April 21, 1987[/tpl] A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death.Abt p.113  The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/cycling/1998/tourdefrance/tourdefrancearchive/tour2.html|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. |last=Swift|first=E.M.|title=Le Grand LeMond|accessdate=November 30, 2012|date=December 25, 1989[/tpl]  He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions.

He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, but the rest of the story was left somewhat vague.Robin Williams interview, 2000 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRpP_Sitk0  The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-10-28/sports/8702020230_1_100-mile-circuit-race-greg-lemond-point-to-point|last=Robb|first=Sharon|title=Lemond Slowly Working Way Back |accessdate=December 18, 2012|newspaper=The Sun Sentinel|date=October 28, 1987[/tpl]
With 35 shotgun pellets still in his body, including three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery.  He missed the Tour for the second year running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium.  The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/special_features/Philly_History/Philly1989.html|title=Coors Light Fired the Silver Bullet|work=CyclingRevealed|publisher=CyclingRevealed|last=Boyce|first=Barry|date=June 18, 1989|accessdate=June 6, 2013|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[/tpl] The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/30/sports/lemond-outdistancing-pack-on-the-financial-front-too.html|last=Abt|first=Samuel|title=LeMond Outdistancing Pack On the Financial Front, Too|accessdate=January 3, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 30, 1989[/tpl]  Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/giro/giro1989.html|title=1989 Giro d'Italia|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl]

===1989: Return to elite level===

After struggling in the 1989 Paris–Nice early-season race and failing to improve his condition, LeMond informed his wife Kathy that he intended to retire from professional cycling after the 1989 Tour de France.  He had some flashes of form in the two day Criterium International, sharing an escape with Fignon, Indurain, Mottet, Roche and Madiot and finishing 5th overall. He started the 1989 Giro d'Italia in May as preparation for the Tour to follow, but struggled in the mountains and was not in contention for any of the leaders' jerseys before the final 53 km individual time trial into Florence. LeMond placed a surpising second there, more than a minute ahead of overall winner Laurent Fignon.[tpl]#tag:ref|Quote Fignon: On the evening after I won the Giro Guimard came to have a word with me.  All I was thinking about was celebrating my triumph. Guimard was already concerned about July and looked me straight in the eyes: 'LeMond will be up there at the Tour'. I could not hide my amazement.Fignon p. 209|group=N[/tpl] Some of his improvement he attributed to an anti-anemia treatment he received twice during the race.
Coming into the 1989 Tour de France LeMond was not considered a contender for the General Classification (GC).[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068628/1/index.htm|title=Vive Lemond!|work=Sports Illustrated |publisher=Time Inc. |author=Franz Lidz|date= July 31, 1989 |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=23|title=Cycling Hall of Fame: Greg Lemond[/tpl][tpl]#tag:ref|General Classification tracks overall times for bicycle riders in multi-stage bicycle races.

Without the weight of expectation and other pressures of being a Tour favorite, LeMond surprised observers with a strong ride in the 7.8 km prologue in Luxembourg, finishing fourth out of 198 riders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1989.html|title=1989 Tour De France|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl] Buoyed by the result, LeMond continued to ride well over the opening flat stages, winning the 73 km stage 5 individual time trial, and gaining the yellow jersey of race leader for the first time in three years.McGann p. 187  LeMond seemed to ride himself into better condition during the first week's flat stages, and he was coming into peak form by the time the Tour reached the mountains.  LeMond remained at the front of the race in the Pyrénées, but lost the lead to his former teammate and rival Laurent Fignon on stage 10 in Superbagnères.  Five days later LeMond reclaimed yellow in the Alps, after the 39 km stage 15 mountain time trial from Gap to Orcières-Merlette.  The see-saw battle continued, and when Fignon attacked on the upper slopes of Alpe d'Huez LeMond was unable to go with him, placing the yellow jersey back on the shoulders of Fignon.  Fignon held a 50-second advantage over LeMond going into the 21st and final stage, a rare 24.5 km individual time trial from Versailles to the Champs-Élysées in Paris.McGann p. 189
Fignon had won the Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a very capable time trialist. It seemed improbable that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short 24.5 kilometer course.  This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer against one of the fastest chrono-specialists in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/news/2010-tour-de-france/moment-1-1989-lemonds-8-second|title=30 Greatest Moments of the Tour de France|publisher=Bicycling.com[/tpl]  LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a  rear disc wheel, a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win.  Holding his time trialing position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 58 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.
The final margin of victory of eight seconds was the closest in the Tour's history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.letour.fr/2009/TDF/COURSE/us/histoire_statistiques.html#zone2|title=Le Tour en Chiffres (Statistics)|publisher=LeTour.fr[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/346450/the-closest-tours-in-history.html|title=The closest Tours in history|work=Cycling Weekly|publisher=IPC Media Limited|last=Birnie|first=Lionel|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=June 5, 2013[/tpl] LeMond's 54.545 km/h average speed for the stage 21 time trial was the fastest ever ridden in Tour history.

===1990: A third tour win===

LeMond parlayed the success of his 1989 season into the richest contract in the sport's history, signing a $5.5 million deal for three years with Z-Tomasso of France. He entered the 1990 Tour de France as defending champion and a pre-race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger Z-Tomasso team. At "Z" his team mates included Robert Millar, Eric Boyer and Ronan Pensec, all of whom already had finishes in the top six of the Tour de France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingfever.com/team.html?team_idd=MTYzNQ==|title=Z - 1990 Team Information[/tpl] This unified roster of strong riders appeared capable of supporting LeMond in the mountains and controlling the race on the flats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1990.html|title=1990 Tour de France|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl]
The squad's tactical plan was upset on the first day, when a breakaway that included LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/sports/lemond-breaks-free-to-close-gap.html|last=Abt|first=Samuel|title=LeMond Breaks Free to Close Gap|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1990[/tpl] LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the yellow jersey left the shoulders of teammate Ronan Pensec.  LeMond closed in on race leader Claudio Chiappucci, finally overtaking him in the final individual time trial on stage 20, where he finished over two minutes ahead of the unheralded Italian.  LeMond at last had the yellow jersey, wearing it the following day as the Tour rode into Paris.McGann p. 196 LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking any of the individual stages. He remains the last rider to win the Tour while wearing the world champion jersey. Over the course of the 1990 Tour the perceived strength of the Z team was confirmed, as they led the team classification through most of the race, adding the team title to LeMond's yellow jersey.
In September, LeMond attempted to defend his title at the 1990 UCI Road World Championships, but finished fourth, eight seconds behind the winner, his former teammate Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56017728.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS&date=Sep+4%2C+1990&author=James+Raia&pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=02.C&desc=CYCLING%3BLeMond+finishes+fourth+in+World|last=Raia|first=James|title=CYCLING; LeMond finishes fourth in World|accessdate=December 18, 2012|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|agency=Associated Press|date=September 4, 1990|location=McLean, VA|page=02.C[/tpl]

===1991–1994: Change in the peloton and retirement===

LeMond felt confident before the 1991 Tour de France. He was the defending champion, trained well and had a solid team to support him. LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 individual time trial, and he finished second to the Spaniard Miguel Indurain. LeMond felt he was riding extremely well, and though his TT-effort had propelled him into the yellow jersey, losing eight seconds to Indurain shook his confidence. He held the yellow jersey for the next four days until Stage 12, a challenging 192 km mountain stage.  LeMond experienced difficulty on the first climb and he cracked on the Col de Tourmalet, losing significant time to Claudio Chiappucci, and eventual winner Indurain.   He continued to race, but was unable to seriously challenge for the lead thereafter, finishing the 1991 Tour seventh overall.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1991.html|title=1991 Tour de France|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl]
In 1992, LeMond won the Tour DuPont.  It would be the last major win of his career.  In the 1992 Tour de France he had to abandon in the mountains, the same day that his compatriot and former domestique Andy Hampsten won atop Alpe d'Huez.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf1992.html|title=1992 Tour de France|work= Bike Race Info |publisher=Dog Ear Publishing |last1=McGann |first1=Bill |last2=McGann |first2=Carol |accessdate= June 5, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/blogs/greg-lemond/the-art-of-peaking-for-the-tour-de-france-1|last=LeMond|first=Greg|title=The art of peaking for the Tour de France|work=Cycling News |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=December 14, 2012|date=July 2, 2010[/tpl] and he said he quit the race because of a serious saddle sore, but before he abandoned, LeMond admitted, "My climbing is not like usual.

LeMond did extensive endurance training on the road the following winter, but his performances the following spring failed to improve.

The following year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found he was unable to race effectively.  He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages.  That December he announced his retirement.  At the time the reasons for LeMond's increasing difficulties were not entirely known.  At a loss, he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders."Greg LeMond Ending Career," Samuel Abt, International Herald Tribune, December 3, 1994[tpl]#tag:ref|Mitochondrial myopathy is a rare condition in which the body's cellular energy system breaks down.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/mitochondrial_myopathy/mitochondrial_myopathy.htm |title=Mitochondrial Myopathies Information Page|work=National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke[/tpl]|group=N[/tpl] In 2007, however, LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all, and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible, the effects of which were increased by heavy training.Procycling, January 2008, appeared December 2007[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0627/1224249651626.html|title=Even Relentless Fighter Now Sees Cycling as a Lost Cause |author=Ian O'Riordon|date=June 6, 2009 |work=The Irish Times[/tpl]
Since 2010 LeMond acknowledged that the increasing prevalence of doping contributed to his lack of competitiveness.  Said LeMond:  "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, became more and more demanding, more and more concerned ..." He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.mensjournal.com/greg-lemond-vs-the-world|last=Gifford|first=Bill|title=Greg LeMond vs. The World|work=Men's Journal|publisher=Men's Journal LLC |accessdate=December 15, 2012|date=June 30, 2008[/tpl] LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: "I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident," three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/sports/19iht-lemond.2.t.html|last=Abt|first=Sam|title=LeMond Glances Backward From the Top of Alpe d'Huez|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=December 19, 2012|date=July 19, 1999[/tpl]
In a wide-ranging interview with American novelist Bryan Malessa in 1998, LeMond was asked if his career had not been interrupted by the hunting accident, how did he feel he would compare to five time Tour winners such as Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain.  LeMond responded: "Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours."

Two years after his retirement LeMond was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in a ceremony at Rodale Park in Trexlertown, PA.  The event was held on June 8, 1996, during the U.S. Olympic Cycling Team Trials.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1996-06-09/news/3087790_1_greg-lemond-fame-board-member-world-sprint-championship|last1=Wittman|first1=Bob|last2=Wogenrich|first2=Mark|title=Lemond Inducted Into Hall Of Fame|work=The Morning Call|publisher=Tribune Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=December 18, 2012|date=June 9, 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1996/LeMond-Inducted-Into-Cycling-Hall-of-Fame/id-bf0f5fc92a74f349dc732d0d9ee60977|last=Stapleton|first=Arnie|title=LeMond Inducted Into Cycling Hall of Fame|work=Associated Press|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=December 18, 2012|date=June 8, 1996[/tpl]

In 1990, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop robotic machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter's advanced composites technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.calfeedesign.com/history/|work=Calfee Design|publisher=|title=Our History|accessdate=December 10, 2012[/tpl] While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced "Greg LeMond" bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on "under-capitalization" and poor management by his father.Interview in Rouleur, Guy Andrews, issue five, p. 26 Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles "parted amiably two years later." In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the "LeMond Bicycles" brand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/04/news/trek-announces-an-end-to-deal-with-greg-lemond_74387|last=Frothingham |first=Steve|title=Trek announces an end to deal with Greg LeMond|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|date=April 8, 2008|accessdate=December 10, 2012[/tpl] LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek "destroyed" his relationship with his father. The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of $100,000,000 USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2009-11-07/sports/17940067_1_greg-lemond-trek-cycling|last=Vinton|first=Nathaniel|title=Greg LeMond's lawsuit against Trek is about more than broken promises – it's about Lance, too|work=New York Daily News|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=September 7, 2009|page=1[/tpl]
The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. "When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated," LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong. "If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud."[tpl]cite web|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2001/08/news/armstrong-lemond-comments-disappointing_1319|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|title=Armstrong: LeMond comments 'disappointing'|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=August 3, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2008/04/10/LeMond_Sues_Trek_Citing_Feud_With_Lance.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Service|last=Kahn|first=Robert|title=LeMond Sues Trek, Citing Feud With Lance|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=April 10, 2008[/tpl]
Trek's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, "Greg's public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand."[tpl]cite web|last=Kimmage |first=Paul|title=Cycle of abuse|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/cycling/article67355.ece|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=March 9, 2013|date=July 1, 2007[/tpl] Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, "As a contractual partner, he LeMond could criticize doping only generally – not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company's main cash cow."
In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a "best efforts" attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004. His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular.
As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand. After nearly two years of litigation, in February 2010, LeMond reached an out-of-court settlement with Trek in their breach-of-contract dispute, the terms of which were confidential.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/2966/Trek-and-LeMond-settle-lawsuit.aspx|title=Trek and LeMond settle lawsuit|work=VeloNation|publisher=VeloNation LLC|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=February 1, 2010[/tpl] The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning, "neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit." And although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of $200,000 USD to the 1in6.org charity, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors.[tpl]cite web|author=VeloNation Press|url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/13087/Trek-follows-suit-with-other-big-names-drops-sponsorship-of-Lance-Armstrong.aspx|title=Trek follows suit with other big names, drops sponsorship of Lance Armstrong|work=VeloNation |publisher=VeloNation LLC |accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=October 17, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/02/01/2010-02-01_tour_de_france_legend_greg_lemond_trek_bicycle_corporation_reach_outofcourt_sett.html|last=Vinton|first=Nathaniel|title=Tour de France legend Greg LeMond, Trek Bicycle reach settlement|work=New York Daily News|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=December 10, 2012|date=February 1, 2010|page=1[/tpl]

He also formed LeMond LLC to introduce a suite of brands in late 2013, early 2014.

===LeMond and Time===

At the Interbike trade show in September 2013 LeMond announced that he was returning to the business of bicycle manufacture and sales by partnering with French company Time. The new line began with a series of commemorative designed bicycles, to be followed with road, cyclocross, and gravel-road models. LeMond purchased Time Sport USA, the US distributor for the company.  He will be responsible for US distribution of the company’s line of frames, bikes, and components. Said LeMond: “I’m really excited to be back in the bike industry.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/new-bike-gear-previews/lemond-bikes-return-2014|last=Lindsey|first=Joe|title=LeMond Bikes Return for 2014|work=Bicycling|date=September 21, 2013[/tpl]

===Real estate===

In 2002 LeMond joined with his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson to invest in the exclusive Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375 million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209 million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16 billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6 million for their one-percent shares."LeMond claims he was swindled on Montana's millionaire mountain," Bloomberg News, October 27, 2006  In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39 million;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-15-3268195309_x.htm|last=Brown|first=Matthew|title=Greg LeMond's lawsuit with exclusive club settled|date=August 15, 2008|accessdate=November 27, 2012|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20 million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million),[tpl]cite web|title=Greg LeMond and family put a lien on a development compound to secure a $20 million debt|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2008/02/news/greg-lemond-and-family-put-a-lien-on-a-development-compound-to-secure-a-20-million-debt_72650|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=May 27, 2013|date=February 22, 2008[/tpl]  followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009."LeMond continues long legal fight with Yellowstone Club," New West, November 21, 2008

Explaining the origin of the concept, LeMond said, "Kathy and I have eaten at the finest establishments in France, Italy and Belgium. Our favorites have always been small places, family-owned."[tpl]cite web|last=Castro|first=Peter|title=A New Cycle|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118515,00.html|work=Chatter|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=December 19, 2012|date=August 20, 1990[/tpl]
LeMond also partnered in several Bruegger's bagel bakery-café franchises.

Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price."

On July 16, 2007, LeMond rode the L'Étape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, and found it to be a defining moment in his post-competition life. "I had the time of my life", he said, despite getting "650th place" and being "impressed that I even finished". LeMond continued, "I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody."[tpl]YouTube|wDy5NLVkliU|Greg LeMond – 'Cycling is dying through Drugs' at Play the Game Conference[/tpl], 27:00 and 44:00 Play the Game Conference, Coventry University, 2009 Jun 12, retr 2012 10 14 At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day.[tpl]cite web|last=Sumner|first=Jason|title=LeMond drops bombshell at Landis hearing|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2007/05/news/lemond-drops-bombshell-at-landis-hearing_12271|work=VeloNews|publisher=Competitor Group, Inc|accessdate=December 11, 2012|date=May 17, 2007[/tpl] Undeterred, LeMond took the stand and testified, before admitting to the world that he had been molested.
Several weeks later, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to Paul Kimmage of The Sunday Times. LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that Trek, the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.
In September 2007, Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization 1in6.org, whose mission is "to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives".1in6.org
