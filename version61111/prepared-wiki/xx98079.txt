==History==

In 1925, Sears, Roebuck & Co. held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success  in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/allstate.htm|title=Allstate: 1996-1995 (Sears' divestment)|date=2006-10-31|publisher=Sears|accessdate=2010-07-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100808201656/http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/allstate.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/The_Allstate_Corp.aspx|title=Encyclopedia- Allstate Corp.|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Allstate-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=Funding Universe- The Allstate Corporation- Company History|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/channels/History-and-Timeline/pages/history-timeline|title=Allstate Insurance Company Digital Newsroom - History and Timeline|publisher=Allstate|accessdate=2011-02-17[/tpl]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York state passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-7-buildings-make-citys-most-endangered-list-20130312,0,2255252.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=7 buildings make Preservation Chicago most endangered list | date=2013-03-13[/tpl]  The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition.  The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction.  This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis.  At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957.  Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964. (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s. In 1991, the company went public before becoming completely independent in 1995.
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 20 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/478/89905199000014/filing-main.htm |title=Allstate, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Oct 12, 1999 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 4, 2013[/tpl] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[tpl]cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2855/91205700048494/filing-main.htm |title=Allstate, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Nov 13, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =Jan 4, 2013[/tpl]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[tpl]cite web|url=http://drivesteady.com/the-most-popular-car-insurance-spokespeople-mascots|title=The Most Popular Car Insurance Spokespeople & Mascots|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.

==Advertising==

Allstate’s ad campaigns span across television, print, radio, outdoor, and throughout the internet branded with the tagline: "Are you in Good Hands?" or “You’re in Good Hands.”
The Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis. The phrase was used by a doctor who was taking care of his ailing child.  Later that year, Ellis and a marketing team were in a brainstorming session to develop a slogan for the company's first major national advertising campaign. When the group was about to give up for the day, Ellis remembered the reassuring remarks. It has been the slogan ever since.[tpl]cite news |title='You're in Good Hands' Celebrates 50th Anniversary |date=2000-12-20 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/youre-in-good-hands-celebrates-50th-anniversary-76284627.html |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl]
In the 1960s and 1970s, “You’re in Good Hands” became a recognizable advertising campaign to many Americans. The TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers.  Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture.  For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[tpl]cite news |title=Ed Reimers dies at 96; Allstate placed ad campaign in his hands |date=2008-08-18 | last = McLellan | first = Dennis |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/18/local/me-ed-reimers18 |accessdate=2012-02-29 |work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl]
In 2001, Allstate changed its slogan to "The Right Hands Make All the Difference." The campaign that accompanied the new slogan featured the hands of people whose special qualities allowed them to make a difference in their world. The ads featured the hands of Jerry Rice, Joe Montana and Ann Lai, inventor and winner of multiple science awards. In 2002, Allstate introduced a national advertising campaign leveraging the popularity of The Beatles.  The ad campaign featured the song, "When I'm Sixty-Four," performed by Julian Lennon, son of Beatle John Lennon.  Allstate is one of only a handful of companies to ever gain the rights to use a Beatles song for commercial purposes. 
A study by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America. This slogan is the oldest surviving tagline for a paid campaign.[tpl]cite news |title=2000 Advertising Slogan Hall of Fame |year=2000 |url=http://www.adslogans.co.uk/site/pages/gallery/youre-in-good-hands-with-allstate.8355.php |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl]
Allstate’s Stand
Beginning in 2003, many of Allstate’s television commercials starred or are narrated by spokesman Dennis Haysbert.  The ads are straightforward and tell a story. Haysbert encourages the audience to consider whether they were in “good hands”—and positioned Allstate as taking a stand on the side of the consumer. Haysbert closed commercials during the 2010 Winter Olympics that invoked the 1933 inaugural address of Roosevelt by declaring, “Uncertainty will not rule our lives when we put our lives in good hands." The "Our Stand" campaign was created by Leo Burnett. Haysbert has appeared in over 30 commercials since 2003.[tpl]cite news |title=Presidential Allstate ads counter the gecko |date=2004-08-15 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-08-15-allstate_x.htm |accessdate=2012-02-29 |work=USA Today |first1=Theresa |last1=Howard[/tpl]
In 2004 and 2005, Allstate extended the campaign to reach a broader audience with specific TV, print, radio, cinema, out of home and online advertising aimed at Hispanic American consumers. The tagline for these was ‘‘Así piensa Allstate’’ (That’s what Allstate believes).[tpl]cite news |title=Allstate Launches "Asi Piensa Allstate" Hispanic Advertising Series Featuring Actor Esai Morales |date=2004-05-18 |url=http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/releases/b91808ef-6c9f-4679-8c49-6ce26dcf09d5 |accessdate=2012-02-29[/tpl]
Mayhem
Beginning in July 2010, Allstate launched a new advertising campaign focused on the “mayhem” that can occur in day to day life. Dean Winters (Oz, 30 Rock) portrays “Mayhem,” personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, which can befall drivers and homeowners. The ads feature Winters causing “mayhem” upon cars and homes and ends with Haysbert asking “Are You In Good Hands?” Dean Winters has appeared in over 20 spots for Allstate. The Mayhem campaign has been recognized with a spot on the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame.[tpl]cite news |title=Allstate Adds Villain, With Car Insurance as the Hero |year=2000 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/business/media/21adco.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=2012-02-29 |work=The New York Times |first=Stuart |last=Elliott[/tpl] Spanish networks use the Hispanic Mayhem (known as "La Mala Suerte") after the success of Mayhem.

==Criticism==

In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers.  This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. “Allstate ducks, bobs and weaves to avoid paying claims to increase its profits.”[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/07/09/allstate-gets-a-spanking/ | first =  Erik | last = Wemple | date = 9 July 2008 | publisher = Washington City Paper | title = Allstate Gets a Spanking |accessdate=2010-07-21 [/tpl] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." Phoenix Business Journal: "American Association of Justice ranks Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers" In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[tpl]cite news| url = http://money.cnn.com/2009/05/19/news/companies/allstate_tarp.reut/index.htm | title = Allstate: No thanks to TARP money | date = May 19, 2009 | publisher = money.cnn.com |accessdate=2010-07-21[/tpl]

===Auto insurance claims===

An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/09/insurance.hardball/index.html |title=Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims |publisher=CNN |date=2007-02-09[/tpl]  Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://autoinsurancetips.com/good-deal-auto-insurance-how-find-best-affordable-coverage|title=A Good Deal on Auto Insurance: How to Find the Best Affordable Coverage|publisher=AutoInsuranceTips.com[/tpl]

===Catastrophe exposure management===

Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16744640.htm |title=Date set for insurance rate filings; Insurers can resume policy cancellations as soon as they file required rate reductions in mid-March |author=Garcia, Beatrice E. |publisher=The Miami Herald |date=2007-02-21[/tpl] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[tpl]cite news |title=Ruling: Insurers can drop policies |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=2007-02-20 | last = Zucco | first = Tom | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/20/Business/Ruling__Insurers_can_.shtml[/tpl]

===From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves===

This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[tpl]cite book | title = From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves: How Allstate Changed Casualty Insurance in America | last = David | first = Berardinelli | first2 =  Michael | last2 = Freeman | publisher = Trial Guides | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-9743248-9-2 [/tpl]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [tpl]cite web | url = http://www.newsinferno.com/archives/1674 |title=Allstate, State Farm, Other Bad Faith Insurance Companies Rack up Record Profits by Cheating Customers |publisher=Newsinferno.com |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2010-07-21[/tpl]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm |title= In Tough Hands At Allstate  |publisher=Business Week |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2010-07-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100714054219/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  According to that article, Allstate responded to Bertinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'"  While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.

===Use of Colossus===

Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims.  In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used.  It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.Allstate Will Pay $10 Million, The Buffalo News(Buffalo, NY:October 19, 2010) http://www.buffalonews.com/business/article224099.ece
