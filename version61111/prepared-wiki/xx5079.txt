The Jacksonville Jaguars are a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida. They are members of the South Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Jaguars, along with the Carolina Panthers, joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1995.
The club plays all of their home games at EverBank Field, located near the St. Johns River in downtown Jacksonville. The team headquarters is also located in the stadium. The Jaguars hold training camp and practice during the season in the stadium and on adjoining practice fields. They are the only team in the "big four" sports leagues to play in the city of Jacksonville. Since their inception the Jaguars have won two division championships and have made six playoff appearances.

==Franchise history==

===Pre-franchise period (before 1993)===

====College football in Jacksonville====

Since 1933, Jacksonville has been the site of the annual Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic, a major college football rivalry game between the University of Florida Gators and the University of Georgia Bulldogs, and since 1946, the city has hosted the Gator Bowl, one of the oldest annual college football bowl games. Until 1994, these games were played in the Gator Bowl Stadium, a structure originally built in 1927. Over the years, the stadium was expanded several times to accommodate larger crowds.

====Startup pro-leagues====

With a football-hungry population, Jacksonville's civic leaders craved something more than just two games a year for their large stadium. The city hosted the American Football League All Star Game in 1967 and 1968, but after the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, Jacksonville was shut out.  When new professional leagues started up to challenge the NFL's post-merger monopoly on professional football, Jacksonville was ready to join.  First, in the 1970s, there were the Jacksonville Sharks of the World Football League.  Then, in the 1980s, the Jacksonville Bulls of the United States Football League took the field.  The USFL Bulls were one of that league's more well-attended teams, benefiting from the Gator Bowl's last expansion in 1982.  The success of the Bulls reinforced the belief that the city could support an NFL franchise.

====Luring the NFL====

Jacksonville attempted to lure the Baltimore Colts in 1979; Colts owner Robert Irsay famously landed a helicopter in the stadium as thousands of Jacksonville citizens urged him to move the team there.
The city was also courted by the New Orleans Saints, but the team was purchased by Tom Benson who kept the team in New Orleans.
In the late 1980s, city leaders put on a more concerted effort to convince Houston Oilers owner Bud Adams to move to Jacksonville.  Jacksonville mayor Tommy Hazouri offered Adams a city-backed guarantee that the "Jacksonville Oilers" would sell out every game in the 82,000 seat Gator Bowl for the first ten years.The Tuscaloosa News - Google News Archive Search
The St. Louis Cardinals called on Jacksonville (as well as Baltimore and Phoenix) when they needed to pressure St. Louis to build them a new stadium. Owner Bill Bidwell eventually moved the Cardinals to Arizona.
The Atlanta Falcons also came calling on Jacksonville when owner Rankin Smith was upset with delays by Atlanta to approve the building of the new Georgia Dome stadium.
In 1989, the prospective ownership group Touchdown Jacksonville! was organized. The group initially included future Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Jacksonville developer Tom Petway, and came to be led by shoe magnate Wayne Weaver, founder of Nine West. In 1991, the NFL announced plans to add two expansion teams in 1994 (later delayed until 1995), its first expansion since the 1976 addition of the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Touchdown Jacksonville! announced its bid for a team, and Jacksonville was ultimately chosen as one of five finalists, along with Charlotte, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Memphis.[tpl]cite news |title= PRO FOOTBALL; N.F.L.

====1995 NFL expansion====

Jacksonville was considered the least likely expansion candidate for several reasons.  The Jacksonville metropolitan area and television market were smaller than those of nearly every team in the league.  Although Jacksonville was the 15th largest city in the nation at the time (It has since grown to become the 11th-largest), it has always been a medium-sized market because the surrounding suburbs and rural areas are far smaller than the city itself.  There were 635,000 people in Jacksonville proper according to the 1990 census, but only 900,000 people in the metropolitan area.http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t3/tables/tab01.txthttp://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab22.txt Additionally, the Gator Bowl was outdated, and the ownership group struggled to negotiate a lease with the city. The troubled negotiations over the Gator Bowl lease led the ownership group to withdraw from the NFL expansion bidding in July 1993.
However, Jacksonville had other assets and a number of powerful supporters. It had a very strong regional football culture, evidenced by the high level of support for the Florida State University Seminoles and University of Florida Gators college football teams, as well as a solid ownership group and a location in the growing and attractive Southeast region. Supporters of Jacksonville's bid included NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, President Neil Austrian, Vice President Roger Goodell, Bud Adams of the Houston Oilers, Rankin Smith of the Atlanta Falcons,  and Ken Hofmann of the Seattle Seahawks. Encouraged by Tagliabue, Jacksonville interests revisited the issue, and the city agreed to fund $121 million in renovations for the Gator Bowl including sky boxes and club seats. The stadium's 10,000 preferred seats were sold in just 10 days, and Jacksonville officially returned to the bidding.
Charlotte was awarded the first franchise – the Carolina Panthers – in October 1993. Surprisingly, the naming of the second expansion city was delayed a month. Most pundits speculated that the delay was made to allow St. Louis to shore up its bid. At the time, St. Louis was considered the favorite for the second franchise, with Baltimore's three bids also considered strong. However, in a surprising move, the NFL owners voted 26–2 in favor of awarding the 30th franchise to Jacksonville.
After the Gator Bowl game on December 31, 1993, the old stadium was essentially demolished and replaced with a reinforced concrete superstructure. All that remained of the old stadium was the west upper concourse and a portion of the ramping system. To accommodate construction, the 1994 and 1995 games of "The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party" were split between the home fields of Florida and Georgia, and the 1994 Gator Bowl was played at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville. The new stadium (now referred to by its long unused but official name of Jacksonville Municipal Stadium) opened on August 18, 1995, with a preseason game against the St. Louis Rams.
New owner Wayne Weaver originally announced that he and team president David Seldin would look for a general manager and a head coach simultaneously.  Much speculation centered on Jimmy Johnson, then the coach of the Dallas Cowboys, who was rumored to be feuding with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.  There were reports that Weaver and/or Seldin had met secretly with Johnson in South Florida (one report placing the meeting on a boat in the Everglades), and the NFL officially warned the Jaguars front office[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1994_1183027/johnson-off-limits-jaguars-told.html |title=Johnson off-limits, Jaguars told 02/11/1994 | Archives | Chron.com – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl] that contact with Johnson would be forbidden without Jerry Jones' permission, which Jones refused to give.
Weaver ultimately narrowed his choices down to three:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thepigskinreport.com/2011/12/jacksonville-jaguars-owner-wayne-weaver-admits-he-fired-tom-coughlin-too-soon/ |title=Jacksonville Jaguars Owner Wayne Weaver Admits He Fired Tom Coughlin Too Soon | The Pigskin Report |publisher=Thepigskinreport.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl]  Mike Shanahan, an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Tony Dungy, defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, and Tom Coughlin, head coach for Boston College.  All three men would go on to be Super Bowl-winning head coaches, but not for Jacksonville.

===Tom Coughlin era (1995–2002)===

Ultimately, Weaver made his choice based upon the "intensity" of the candidates and in January 1994, Tom Coughlin was hired as the first-ever head coach of the Jaguars.[tpl]cite book|last=Didinger|first=Ray|title=Game Plans For Success|year=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0809231719|page=256|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bezktUvNTZYC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=Tom+Coughlin+hired+as+first+coach+of+expansion+Jaguars&source=bl&ots=Xa_ZIoyQbo&sig=WLaHY3bIYeNKWaDR6Rktywm3aXk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=j_0RT-_0OoeXtwfj-fCZAg&ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Tom%20Coughlin%20hired%20as%20first%20coach%20of%20expansion%20Jaguars&f=false[/tpl] While he had previously had great success with Boston College, many at the time believed his hiring was a risky move. Coughlin had worked in the NFL as a position coach, but he had been neither a head coach nor a coordinator in the NFL.
The Jaguars' hiring of Coughlin contrasted with the hiring moves made by their fellow expansion team.  The same month that Weaver hired Coughlin as his head coach, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson went a more conventional route and hired a general manager, Bill Polian (the Panthers' head coach, Dom Capers, would not be hired until a full year after Coughlin). As it emerged that Weaver had no intention of hiring a general manager, it became apparent that Coughlin would have most of the authority regarding hiring decisions. Coughlin spent his year as "head coach without a team" preparing for the personnel moves that would come from the expansion draft, free agency, and the rookie draft in the spring of 1995.

====1995: A year of firsts====

Along with the Carolina Panthers, the Jacksonville Jaguars entered the NFL as the first expansion teams in almost 20 years. Both teams participated in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft, with the Jaguars taking Steve Beuerlein with the first pick. Beuerlein quickly lost his starting job to former Green Bay Packer backup Mark Brunell. The Jaguars finished their inaugural season with a record of 4–12. Both the Jaguars and the Panthers (7–9) broke the previous record for most wins by an expansion team (3) set by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. The inaugural season featured many of the players who would lead Jacksonville into the playoffs in the team's next four seasons, including quarterback Mark Brunell (acquired in a draft day trade from Green Bay), offensive lineman Tony Boselli (drafted with the 2nd pick overall in the 1995 NFL Draft) running back James Stewart (also drafted in 1995), and wide receiver Jimmy Smith (signed as a free agent).
The team played its first regular season game at home before a crowd of 72,363Jacksonville Jaguars on September 3, 1995, a 10–3 loss against the Houston Oilers.  The team picked up its first win in Week 4 as the Jaguars defeated the Oilers 17–16 on October 1 in Houston.  The next week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Jaguars earned their first home win by defeating the eventual AFC Champions 20–16.  The team's other two wins came in a season sweep of the Cleveland Browns including a Week 17 24–21 victory sealed by a Mike Hollis 34-yard field goalNew York Times in the Browns' final game before the team relocated to Baltimore and was renamed the Ravens.

====1996: "Jacksonville, do you believe in miracles?"====

Jacksonville's 1996 season was a marked success as they won six of their last seven games of the season and finished with a record of 9–7. Quarterback Mark Brunell threw for over 4,000 yards and wide receivers Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith each accumulated over 1,000 receiving yards. In the team's final game of the regular season against the Atlanta Falcons, needing a win to earn a playoff berth, the Jaguars caught a bit of luck when Morten Andersen, one of the most accomplished kickers in NFL history, missed a 30-yard field goal with less than a minute remaining that would have given the Falcons the lead.[tpl]cite news|last = AP| first = |title = Andersen's Miss Puts Jaguars in Postseason|work = Chicago Sun-Times|date = December 23, 1996| url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4356188.html|accessdate = 2007-11-05[/tpl] The Jaguars clinched the fifth seed in the AFC playoffs.
The Jaguars visited the Buffalo Bills in their first playoff game in franchise history. Despite being a heavy underdog, the Jaguars won 30–27, and knocked Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly out of what would turn out to be the last game of his career. Their next game was on the road against the Denver Broncos, who had earned the AFC's top seed with a 13–3 record and were widely regarded as the best team in the AFC, if not the NFL. While the Broncos scored two touchdowns early in the game, after the first quarter, the Jaguars largely dominated. In what is often regarded as one of the three biggest upsets in NFL playoff history,[tpl]cite web|last=Allan |first=Scott |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ycn-7431168 |title=Biggest playoff upsets in NFL history – NFL – Yahoo!

Upon their return home, the Jags were greeted by an estimated 40,000 fans at the stadium. Many of these fans had watched the game on the stadium JumboTron displays and had stayed into the early hours of the morning when the team arrived. In the AFC Championship Game, the Jaguars miracle season came to an end, as they lost 20–6 to the New England Patriots, in Foxboro. Their fellow second-year NFC expansion team, the Carolina Panthers, also got to their conference championship game, where they lost 30–13 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers.

====1997–99: An age of excellence====

In 1997, the franchise's third season, the Jaguars and the Steelers both finished the season with an 11–5 record, tops in the AFC Central Division.  Pittsburgh won the division in a tiebreaker as a result of having higher net in division games than Jacksonville.1997 NFL season  As a result, the Jaguars settled for 2nd place in the division, a Wild Card berth and the 5th seed in the AFC playoffs.  The Jags postseason would end quickly as they fell in their first game, a 42–17 defeat against the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium.  The Broncos, led by Terrell Davis, ran at will against the Jaguars, rushing for 5 touchdowns and over 300 yards.Pro-Football-Reference.com – Pro Football Statistics and History
In 1998, the Jaguars again finished 11–5 and won their first AFC Central Division title.  The team became the first NFL expansion team to make the playoffs three times in its first four seasons of play. In the wild card round, the Jaguars hosted their first home playoff game, a 25–10 win over the New England Patriots. The team's season ended the next week in the Divisional Round as the New York Jets defeated the Jaguars 34–24.
In 1999, the Jaguars compiled a league best 14–2 regular season record, the best record in franchise history. The team's two losses were to the Tennessee Titans. The Jaguars won the AFC Central Division for the second straight year and clinched the #1 seed in the AFC.  The Jaguars hosted the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Divisional playoffs, a 62–7 victory in what would be Dan Marino and Jimmy Johnson's last NFL game. Jacksonville's 62 points and 55-point margin are the second most ever in NFL playoff history, and Fred Taylor's 90-yard run in the first quarter is the longest ever in an NFL playoff game.CNN.com  
The Jaguars' bid for a Super Bowl title came to an end the next week in the AFC championship game.  The Jags fell at home to the Titans 33–14 in a game that the Jaguars led 14–10 at halftime, before allowing 23 unanswered points in the 2nd half. The Jaguars finished the 1999 season 15–3, with all three of their losses coming against the Titans. The loss marked the end of an era that saw the Jaguars make the playoffs in four of the team's first five years and would be the team's last playoff appearance until the 2005 season.

====2000–02: End of a run for coach and quarterback====

The Jaguars struggled during this period, due in part to salary cap problems.[tpl]cite web|last=Marvez|first=Alex|title=Salary Cap Will Just Exacerbate Jags' Problems|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-12-17/sports/0012180263_1_jacksonville-coach-jaguars-player-mark-brunell|work=Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=18 January 2013[/tpl]  In the 2000 season, veteran quarterback Mark Brunell and young running back Fred Taylor led the squad through a painful 7–9 season. The Jaguars finished with records of 6–10 in both the 2001 and 2002 seasons. After the 2002 season, head coach Tom Coughlin was fired after eight seasons, leading the Jaguars to a total record of 68–60 and four trips to the playoffs. The 2002 season also marked the last full season for Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, who was benched in the third game of 2003 in favor of Byron Leftwich. Brunell piled up over 25,000 yards as a Jaguar and earned three trips to the Pro Bowl.
In 2002 the NFL split up the two conferences into four divisions, sending the Jacksonville Jaguars to the AFC South. This put them in the same division as Indianapolis, Tennessee and Houston.

===Jack Del Rio era (2003–2011)===

====2003–05: Return to the playoffs====

In 2003, the Jaguars hired Jack Del Rio as head coach. Del Rio was a linebacker during the late 80s and early 90s before retiring. He was formerly the Carolina Panthers' defensive coordinator, bringing the team's defensive ranking from 30th to second.  Prior to that, Del Rio was the Baltimore Ravens linebackers coach, participating in that capacity on the Ravens' record setting championship 2000 defense. The Jaguars selected quarterback Byron Leftwich with the seventh pick of the NFL draft. The Jaguars had high hopes for their new quarterback. The team had many failures and heartbreaking moments, ending the 2003 season at 5–11 and missing the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. Despite resolving their salary cap problems, the team's rebuilding was clearly taking longer than expected.
The 2004 season, the tenth season of the Jaguars franchise, resulted in a winning record of 9–7 with road victories against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field and the Indianapolis Colts at the RCA Dome. The Jaguars' defense was a strong suit, as it included two Pro Bowl players, defensive tackles Marcus Stroud and John Henderson. Byron Leftwich enjoyed a solid year in 2004, helped by strong performances from holdovers Fred Taylor and Jimmy Smith. Unfortunately, Taylor sustained a season-ending injury at Green Bay. The very next week the Jaguars fell to the Houston Texans, which would ultimately eliminate them from playoff contention. This denied them an opportunity to play the Super Bowl at their home stadium. In 2004, the Jaguars became the first NFL team to have three African-American quarterbacks on their roster. The quarterbacks were Byron Leftwich, David Garrard, and Quinn Gray.
The 2005 Jaguars hoped to challenge the Colts for the division title. However, due to their scintillating 13–0 start, including two victories against the Jaguars, the Colts easily clinched the AFC South title. With a 12–4 record, the Jaguars earned a wild card and their first playoff appearance since 1999. While the Jaguars managed to win key games in 2005, nine of their final ten games were against opponents with losing records. Though these games were wins, key players Byron Leftwich, Mike Peterson, Akin Ayodele, Paul Spicer, and Rashean Mathis were hurt during this stretch. The Jaguars ended the season losing 28–3 to the two-time defending champion New England Patriots on January 7, 2006 in the AFC wild card playoff round.

====2006: Rookie running back becomes a star====

Jacksonville looked like a team on the rise coming off of their 12–4 season, and was considered a playoff contender entering the season. But injuries plagued the team. Reggie Hayward, Greg Jones, Donovin Darius, Byron Leftwich, and Mike Peterson all suffered season-ending injuries. Marcus Stroud, Matt Jones, Paul Spicer, and Fred Taylor also faced injuries during the season. The team started off 2–0, defeating the Dallas Cowboys (earning the NFL's highest winning percentage on opening days at .750 with a record of 9–3), and shutting out the defending champs Pittsburgh Steelers. But the team lost its next two games, and suffered embarrassing losses to the Houston Texans over the course of the season (Jacksonville has struggled against the Texans since Houston entered the league in 2002). They missed the playoffs with an 8–8 record, but there were some positives.
Maurice Jones-Drew, the Jaguars' second round draft pick, was one of the more surprising rookies in the NFL. He averaged 5.7 yards a carry, the highest in the league, and tied for third in the NFL with 16 touchdowns. This season was also the first year the team played without their standout wide receiver Jimmy Smith as he decided to retire. His production at the wide receiver position is still missed as the Jaguars struggle to find an adequate replacement.

====2007: Quarterback change leads to playoff run====

In the 2007 NFL Draft, the Jaguars used their first-round pick (21st overall) to select Florida safety Reggie Nelson. On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the team's final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated New England Patriots; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 22 of 24 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars' defense only once, on the first play.  This game, more than any other, gave the Jaguars' front office a strong desire to upgrade the pass rush during the offseason.
The team's offense in 2007 was largely a run-first offense, with Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor each putting up a lot of yards. David Garrard, however showed to be an efficient passer in 2007, throwing only 3 interceptions.

====2008: Disappointing season====

The 2008 season began with high expectations for the Jaguars. The team acquired free agent wide receiver Jerry Porter and rookie defensive ends Quentin Groves of Auburn and Derrick Harvey of Florida to address the team's most glaring needs. (Porter was released the following year and Groves was traded to Oakland in 2010.) Journalists including ESPN.com's Kevin Seifert predicted the Jaguars were poised to make a Super Bowl run.GO.com
However, the Jaguars failed to live up to those expectations, struggling to a 5–11 finish, the franchise's worst record since 2003.  The team's struggles were in part, the result of a rash of injuries to the team's offensive line.  The Jaguars lost starting guards Vince Manuwai and Maurice Williams for the season within the first quarter of the opening game. Tackle Richard Collier's career ended in early September when he was brutally attacked and shot 14 times.News 4 Jax  Center Brad Meester missed the first two months of the season and guard Chris Naeole, signed to the roster mid-season in response to these injuries, was injured in pregame warmups before playing a single snap.
The 2008 season marked the end of running back Fred Taylor's eleven-year career as a Jaguar. Taylor, who is considered to be one of the greatest Jaguars in the history of the franchise, rushed for over 10,000 yards during his tenure with Jacksonville and earned one trip to the Pro Bowl. In 2009, he signed with the New England Patriots. Taylor's departure opened up the door for Maurice Jones-Drew to become the team's feature running back. In 2011, Taylor signed a one-day contract so he could retire as a Jaguar.[tpl]cite web|title=Fred Taylor Retires as a Member of the Jacksonville Jaguars|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/rss/article/217049/3/1998-Video-When-the-Jaguars-Drafted-Fred-Taylor|accessdate=5 January 2012[/tpl]

====2009–2010: New GM begins rebuilding phase====

The Jaguars hoped to begin a new era in 2009 under general manager Gene Smith. Smith made his mark early on in the 2009 NFL Draft by acquiring talent such as Eugene Monroe, Terrance Knighton, Derek Cox, Eben Britton and Mike Thomas, who all made significant contributions in their rookie years. The Jaguars finished off this season 7–9 and did not manage to make the playoffs. In the offseason, the Jaguars parted ways with veteran players John Henderson and Reggie Hayward as part of the team's "youth movement".
However, 2009 also saw the team's attendance numbers plummet, leading to television blackouts and speculation that the team could eventually be moved or sold.[tpl]cite news |title= Jaguars singing the small-market blues in Jacksonville|first= Sam|last= Farmer|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= December 8, 2009|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/08/sports/la-sp-farmer-jaguars8-2009dec08|accessdate=September 12, 2010[/tpl] 2009 marked a low point, with the team's attendance averaging around 50,000,[tpl]cite web|title=2009 NFL Football Attendance|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/attendance/_/year/2009|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=22 January 2012[/tpl] causing seven of the eight home games to be blacked out, and leading NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to address the issue with owner Wayne Weaver.[tpl]cite news |title= Goodell: Jaguars Attendance A Concern|author= |url= http://www.news4jax.com/sports/22477762/detail.html|newspaper= news4jax.com |date= February 5, 2010|agency= Associated Press |accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl] Contributing to this decline in ticket sales is the fact that Jacksonville is one of the league's smallest markets, though its stadium is relatively large; since 2005 the team has covered nearly 10,000 of the stadium's 73,000 total seats with tarp in order to lower the stadium's official capacity to a more typical size and reduce blackouts.[tpl]cite news|last=Anderson|first=Les|title=A Solution, or Merely a Cover?|publisher=Washington Post|date=September 27, 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/26/AR2006092601629.html|accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl]  73,000 total seats still ranks as one of the largest in the NFL. From 2008 the team further suffered from the late-2000s recession, which hit Florida particularly hard, and structural changes within the NFL that disadvantage teams in smaller markets. As such, various commentators speculated that the team may relocate in the future, perhaps to Los Angeles, California, or even London.
To address this issue, in 2010 the team and the City of Jacksonville undertook several measures aimed at ensuring the franchise's continued viability in Jacksonville. Supporters began the "Team Teal" drive to drum up ticket sales.[tpl]cite news |title= Jaguars Notebook: Mayor John Peyton encourages fans to buy more tickets|first= Vito|last= Stellino|newspaper= The Florida Times-Union|date= August 5, 2010|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-08-05/story/jaguars-notebook-mayor-john-peyton-encourages-fans-buy-more|accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= NFL commissioner Roger Goodell still has high hopes for Jaguars' future|first= Vito|last= Stellino|newspaper= The Florida Times-Union|date= August 2, 2010|url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-08-02/story/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-still-has-high-hopes-jaguars|accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl] The city negotiated a five-year, $16.6 million naming rights deal with Jacksonville-based EverBank to rename the stadium EverBank Field.[tpl]cite news |title= Jaguars now have EverBank Field — and the city's $4 million|first= Tia|last= Mitchell|newspaper= The Florida Times-Union|date= August 10, 2010|url= http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2010-08-10/story/jaguars-now-have-everbank-field-%E2%80%94-and-citys-4-million|accessdate=September 12, 2010[/tpl] As a result the Jaguars' attendance increased dramatically in 2010. While attendance figures were stagnant for most of the NFL, Jacksonville saw an increase of 36.5%, by far the highest in the league, and had none of their home games blacked out.[tpl]cite web |url= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/12/01/jaguars-see-dramatic-spike-in-attendance/|title= Jaguars see dramatic spike in attendance|author= Mike Florio|date= December 1, 2010|work= profootballtalk.nbcsports.com|publisher= |accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Jaguars Avoid NFL Blackout, Bills Face Third |author=Jason Notte|newspaper= TheStreet.com|date= December 10, 2010 |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10944366/1/jaguars-avoid-nfl-blackout-bills-face-third.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN |accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl]
The 2010 season proved a big year for the Jaguars on the field as well. Running back Maurice Jones-Drew emerged as second in the league in rushing yards and David Garrard threw for 23 touchdowns, a franchise record. Marcedes Lewis went to his first pro bowl and the Jags had one of the best young defensive tackle duo with Terrance Knighton and rookie Tyson Alualu.[tpl]cite web|last=|first=|title=Indianapolis vs. Jacksonville|publisher=cbssports.com|year=2010|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/gametracker/preview/NFL_20101219_JAC@IND/jaguarscolts-preview|accessdate=December 16, 2010[/tpl] Heading into December, Jacksonville was at the top of the AFC South and in playoff contention. In Week 15, they lost to Indianapolis, 34–24, which placed the Colts back atop the AFC South. The Jaguars lost their last two games, placing themselves out of playoff contention. They finished the season with disappointing record of 8–8.

====2011: A year of major changes====

In the 2011 NFL draft, the Jaguars traded a first and a second round pick in order to move up to the 10th pick and select Missouri quarterback Blaine Gabbert.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/draft-2011/tracker/draft_analysis/1.html?eref=sihp|title=NFL Draft 2011|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=August 29, 2011[/tpl]
On September 6, 2011, quarterback David Garrard was cut from the team just days before the start of the season; Luke McCown was named starter. The move was similar to the one that named Garrard himself the starter over Byron Leftwich in 2007. McCown started two games until he threw four interceptions in a lopsided loss to the New York Jets and Blaine Gabbert was named the starter the following week. The Jaguars offense would continue to struggle under the rookie quarterback, losing the next 4 games in a row, until an upset victory over the Baltimore Ravens at home on Monday Night Football.
On November 29, 2011, owner Wayne Weaver announced the firing of head coach Jack Del Rio, whose record had been 3–8 through the first 12 weeks of the season and 68–71 over his nine-year tenure. Del Rio was succeeded by defensive coordinator Mel Tucker on an interim basis. Weaver also announced that General Manager Gene Smith had been given a three-year extension of his contract.

===Ownership change (2012)===

Immediately following the announcement of Del Rio being fired, Weaver also announced that the team would be sold to Illinois businessman Shahid Khan.[tpl]cite web |url= http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/29/del-rio-out-in-jacksonville/|title= Del Rio out in Jacksonville|author= Mike Florio |date= November 29, 2011|work= profootballtalk.nbcsports.com|publisher= NBC Sports|accessdate=November 29, 2011[/tpl]  Khan's assumption of ownership was approved a couple of weeks later by the NFL owners, and Khan took over full ownership on January 4, 2012.

On February 13, 2012, the Jaguars hired MetLife Stadium president and CEO Mark Lamping as team president. Lamping also spent 13 years as the president of the St. Louis Cardinals. Lamping is the second team president in franchise history and the first since 1997, when David Seldin left that position.[tpl]cite web|last=Ganguli |first=Tania |url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2012-02-13/story/jaguars-hire-mark-lamping-team-president |title=Jaguars hire Mark Lamping as team president |publisher=jacksonville.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl]

====2012: Worst record in team history under Mularkey====

On January 10, 2012, former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey was named head coach of the Jaguars. On January 13, it was announced that interim head coach Mel Tucker would remain on the staff as defensive coordinator/assistant head coach and that former Falcons quarterbacks coach Bob Bratkowski would become offensive coordinator.[tpl]cite web|last=Oesher|first=John|title=Tucker, Bratkowski named coordinators|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-1/Tucker-Bratkowski-named-coordinators/41149979-810f-418c-9a38-708849f04aa4|accessdate=14 January 2012[/tpl] On January 20, 2012, the team hired John Bonamego as special teams coordinator.
The Jaguars began the 2012 season with a new coaching staff and a new owner. One of the main priorities of the new leadership was to improve the team's struggling receiving corps and see improvement from quarterback Blaine Gabbert after a disappointing rookie season. To do this, the team selected wide receiver Justin Blackmon in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft and acquired Laurent Robinson in free agency. Despite the changes, the team struggled mightily on both sides of the ball. The team finished with a 2–14 record, the worst in franchise history. Both general manager Gene Smith and head coach Mike Mularkey were fired shortly after the end of the season.

====New General Manager hired====

On January 8, 2013, former Atlanta Falcons Director of Player Personnel David Caldwell was hired as the second full-time General Manager in Jaguars history.[tpl]cite web|last=Oehser|first=John|title=Caldwell named Jaguars General Manager|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/Caldwell-named-Jaguars-General-Manager/9d080586-d3af-4f72-86dd-9acd09fada22|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] He formerly served as a scout for the Indianapolis Colts for 10 years from 1998–2007. His first task with the team was to lead the interview process for a new head coach.

====NFL International Series====

On August 21, 2012, the Jaguars announced they had finalized a deal to play one regular season home game each year between 2013 and 2016 at London's historic Wembley Stadium as part of the NFL International Series.[tpl]cite web |url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8286397/report-jacksonville-jaguars-play-multiple-home-games-london-starting-2013|title= Report: Jags to play games in London |author= |date= August 21, 2012 |work= espn.com |publisher= ESPN |agency= Associated Press |accessdate=August 21, 2012[/tpl] The first of these games was against the San Francisco 49ers on October 27, 2013.[tpl]cite web |url= http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8489558/49ers-play-jaguars-london-oct-27-2013|title= Report: 49ers to play Jaguars in London |author= |date= October 11, 2013 |work= espn.com |publisher= ESPN |agency= Associated Press |accessdate=October 11, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=330880 |title=NFL to hold three games in London in 2014 |publisher=firstcoastnews.com |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-21[/tpl] The Jaguars were defeated 42–10 in front of 83,559 fans.
In 2014, the Jaguars will play the Dallas Cowboys in London on November 9.

===Gus Bradley era (2013–present)===

On January 17, 2013, former Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Gus Bradley was named head coach of the Jaguars.[tpl]cite web|title=Gus Bradley named head coach of Jaguars|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-PressRelease/Gus-Bradley-named-head-coach-of-Jaguars/e33feac9-f079-4880-84eb-b8ee6ff378da|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=18 January 2013[/tpl] The Jaguars struggled early on in 2013 and went into the bye week with an 0–8 record. Bradley got his first win as a head coach on November 10 with a 29–27 victory over the Tennessee Titans. This was followed by a respectable showing against the Arizona Cardinals, despite a 27-14 loss, and the Jaguars' second and third victory of the season against the Houston Texans and the Cleveland Browns.

==Team colors and logos==

===Logos===

The day after the NFL awarded the expansion team to Jacksonville, a triumphant Wayne Weaver held up the Jaguars' proposed silver helmet and teal jersey at the NFL owners' meeting in Chicago. The team's colors were to be teal, gold, and silver with black accents. However, this jersey and helmet design, with a gold leaping jaguar, created controversy. Ford Motor Company, then-parent of the automaker Jaguar, believed that the Jaguars' logo bore too much resemblance to the automaker's logo. Though no lawsuit was brought to trial, lawyers from the team and the auto maker negotiated an ultimately amicable agreement  whereby Jaguar would be named the official car of the Jaguars, and the Jaguars would redesign their uniforms.
The new logo was a snarling jaguar head with a teal tongue, which Weaver said was his wife's touch. He also claimed that the teal tongue came from "feeding Panthers to our Jaguars" — an obvious jab at their expansion brethren. During the Jaguars' first ever preseason game teal-colored candies were handed out to all the fans who attended, turning their tongues a teal color just like on the logo. Additionally, raspberry lollipops were handed out by the "Candy Man" in section 142 to also turn the home fans' tongues teal.
In 2009, Weaver announced that he wanted to 'clean up' the team's image. This meant the elimination of the full-body crawling Jaguar logo, the clawing Jaguar, and the two previous wordmarks which bent the text around these logos.
In February 2013, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, who had acquired the team in late 2011, introduced a new brand identity for the team that included a new logo, wordmark, and secondary logo. The new Jaguar head logo was intended to be "fiercer" and more realistic.[tpl]cite web|last=Oehser|first=John|title=A new logo for a new era|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/A-new-logo-for-a-new-era/ea5b16d4-9a1b-41af-b512-81bc19779eae|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl] The secondary logo incorporated the new Jaguar head logo along with the first official usage of the team's popular nickname "Jags". The two images were incased in a shield-style shape, designed to be a tribute to Jacksonville's military community.[tpl]cite web|title=Jaguars introduce new brand identity and campaign|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/Jaguars-introduce-new-brand-identity-and-campaign/20afabbe-70ee-4582-8d2c-28a325e3d13d|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl]
Beginning in 2013, the Jaguars began to feature gold more prominently than in the past. In fact, from 2009–2012 gold had only been used in the team logo and as a minor accent color.

===Uniforms===

For most of their history, the Jaguars have done what many other NFL teams located in subtropical climates traditionally practice: wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season — forcing opponents to wear their dark ones under the sweltering autumns in Jacksonville. The only exceptions were in 2004 and 2008–2010, when the Jaguars chose to wear teal for all home games. In the preseason, the Jaguars typically wear teal at home since these games are played at night when there is very little advantage with the heat.

====1995–2001====

Following the logo change, the redesigned uniforms featured an all-black helmet, white pants with teal, black, and gold stripes, and numbers with gold inner trim and black outer trim.  The home jersey was teal with white numbers and the away jersey was white with teal numbers. Both jerseys had a black collar and no sleeve stripes.
A prowling jaguar on each sleeve replaced the leaping jaguar going across both shoulders in the original design. The Jaguars in 1995 were the first NFL team to have 2-tone borders on their numbers and lettering, and the first NFL team to show a complex logo (the crawling Jaguar) on the sleeve.
Minor modifications were introduced to the Jaguars uniform during this time, most notably the font of the jersey numbers, replacing the original block numbers with a unique font. Two stripes were also added to the end of the sleeves below the prowling jaguar.

====2002–2008====

During this period, the Jaguars made minor changes to their uniform, each time adding more black to the look.
The team introduced an alternate black jersey in 2002. During that same year, the team also introduced alternate black pants, worn with either the white or the teal jersey. After the black pants were introduced, the white pants would only be seen for the first few games of the year, presumably due to the heat. The black pants originally included two teal stripes down each side. The fan reaction to the extra black in the alternate jersey and alternate pants was positive, so in 2004 the Jaguars went through a formal uniform change, which teams are only allowed to do once every five years. These changes were mostly to the away look. Before 2004, the white away jerseys had teal numbers with black and gold trim, but after, the white jerseys had black numbers with teal and gold trim. The black pants were also changed. The teal stripes were replaced with the Jaguar logo on each hip. Teal almost disappeared from the away uniform.
The stripes on the white pants were altered in 2008 so that the center, thickest stripe was black, and its accents were teal. The black jersey was not used in 2008. In the 2008 year, the gold in the uniforms noticeably shifted from a bright yellow metallic appearance to more beige.

====2009–2011====

The Jaguars unveiled new uniforms for the 2009 season.Bleacher ReportJacksonville Jaguars Team owner Wayne Weaver reportedly wanted to "clean up" the look, feeling that the team had too many uniform styles. The new uniforms were introduced in a press conference on April 22.[tpl]cite web |last=Ketchman |first=Vic |title=Another Fred Taylor? |publisher=Jaguars.com |date=04-09-2009 |url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article.aspx?id=7757 |accessdate=04-09-2009 [/tpl]  At this press conference, Weaver elaborated that different people had taken different liberties with the Jaguars' image over the years, singling out the 'All Black' look which the team wore for every prime-time home game from 2003 to 2007 as a point of regret.  He also said that the team would wear their teal jerseys at home even on hot days, saying that the practice of choosing to wear white on hot days had also diluted the team's image. The new uniform reflected a simpler look overall. The collar and sleeve ends are the same color as the rest of the jersey. The crawling jaguar was removed. The numbers on the jerseys were changed to a simpler, block font with a thicker, single color border. After all of these subtractions, two features were added. The first was a "JAGUARS" wordmark underneath the NFL insignia on the chest. The second was two thin 'stripes' of off-color fabric which were added to each midseam of the jersey, curling up to the neckline on the front and below the number on the back. The stripe on the home jersey is a white line next to a black line, matching the color of the numbers, and the stripe on the away jersey is a black line next to a teal line, again matching the numbers. The pants have similar stripes, both for the home and away uniform. The away uniforms were still black pants and numbers on a white jersey, but they now used teal as the only accent color as opposed to using gold in previous years.
The Jaguars' identity, in terms of colors, beginning in 2009 is exclusively teal and black, with gold only being used in the logo.
The final change made to the Jaguars' uniforms in 2009 was to the helmet. The new helmet and facemask are black just like the old ones, but when light hits the new ones a certain way, both the helmet and face mask will sparkle with a shiny teal appearance. These are the first helmets in professional football which change color with different angles of light. The logo and number decals also incorporate this effect.

====2012====

Prior to the 2012 season, new Jaguars owner Shahid Khan announced that the team would once again use a black jersey, something they had not done since 2007. In September of that year, the team announced that it would use the black jersey and black pants as their primary uniform combination. The teal jersey was retained as an alternate.[tpl]cite web|title=Teal to become Jaguars' alternate jersey|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/Teal-to-become-Jaguars-alternate-jersey/24d0a35a-db33-4dec-9f71-db920207b68b|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=29 September 2012[/tpl]

====2013====

On April 23, 2013, the Jaguars unveiled new uniforms designed by Nike. The primary home jersey is black with white numerals outlined in teal and gold. The road jersey is white with teal numerals outlined in black and gold, marking the first time since 2003 that the team has used teal numbers on their road jersey. The alternate jersey is teal with black numerals outlined in white and gold. The team had never before used black numbers on their teal jersey. All three jerseys feature a contrasting stripe that bends around the neck, and semi-glossy patches on the shoulders meant to resemble claw marks. The team added their new shield logo onto a patch just above the player's heart, meant to pay tribute to Jacksonville's military heritage.[tpl]cite web|title=Jacksonville Jaguars and NIKE Unveil New Uniform Design for 2013|url=http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-PressRelease/Jacksonville-Jaguars-and-NIKE-Unveil-New-Uniform-Design-for-2013/1f70f3e8-89ea-48d7-981a-4dabd3246977|work=Jaguars.com|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl]

===Mascot===

Since his introduction in 1996, Jaxson de Ville has served as the Jaguars' mascot.  Jaxson entertains the crowd before and during games with his antics.  The mascot has established a reputation for making dramatic entrances including bungee jumping off the stadium lights, sliding down a rope from the scoreboard and parachuting into the stadium.
Jaxson's antics got him into trouble in 1998 and stemmed the changing of the NFL's mascot rules, and also caused him to calm down.[tpl]cite web | author=Jacksonville.com | title=Jaxson De Villain | publisher=Jacksonville.com | year= 1999 | url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/100199/spb_09_30_n2.html | accessdate=2007-09-29[/tpl] However, Jaxson was still seen, by some, as a mascot that gets in the way during the game.
