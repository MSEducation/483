The IBM Rome Software Lab (formerly known as IBM Tivoli Rome Laboratory) is one of the largest software development laboratory in Italy, and one of the largest IBM Software Group Labs in Europe.
Founded in 1978, the Rome Lab (located in Rome) now has more than 550 professionals among software developers, project managers, IT specialists, and IT architects. The main mission of the Rome Lab is focused on IBM Tivoli development, including Tivoli Configuration Manager, Tivoli Remote Control, Tivoli Workload Scheduler, and Tivoli Monitoring. 
In 2004, the laboratory focused on the adoption of the IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP) in Tivoli and in the wider Software Group inside IBM.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://www-01.ibm.com/software/success/cssdb.nsf/cs/WJBN-6UNNX5?OpenDocument&Site=rational| title= IBM Software Rome Laboratory Increases Productivity and Improves Quality with IBM Rational Software Development Platform| date=2006-10-17| publisher=IBM[/tpl] In 2007, IBM opened the "Rome SOA Leadership Center" hosted by and formed with a team of experts on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) coming from the IBM Rome Software Laboratory.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://soa.sys-con.com/read/407089.htm | title= A New IBM SOA Leadership Center Opens in Rome | date=2007-07-25| publisher=SOA World Magazine[/tpl] The Rome laboratory constantly collaborates with Italian Universities and Research Centers.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://cclii.dis.uniroma1.it/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=82 | title= EMEA Best Student Recognition Event | date=2006-07-05| publisher=Rome University[/tpl][tpl]Cite web| url= https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/sites/roma/index.shtml | title= IBM Center for Advanced Studies in Rome | date=April 2005| publisher=IBM[/tpl]
