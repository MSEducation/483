Robert Bernstein (May 23, 1919 â€“ December 19, 1988),Social Security Death Index for "Bernstein. Robert" (no middle initial), Social Security Number 084-14-9274. Accessed March 27, 2011 sometimes credited as R. Berns, was an American comic book writer, playwright and concert impresario, notable as the founder of the Island Concert Hall recital series which ran for 15 years on Long Island.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/22/obituaries/robert-bernstein-69-founded-music-series.html|title= Robert Bernstein, 69; Founded Music Series|date= December 22, 1988|publisher= The New York Times|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6JItdPzzr|archivedate= September 1, 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl]
His presentations spanned three decades. In 1951, when he co-founded the Roslyn Music Group, presenting chamber-music ensembles and soloists on Long Island, his concert career as an impresario was underway. Because Long Island had "an omnivorous appetite for the arts", as he phrased it, Bernstein launched the nonprofit Concert Hall subscription series in 1964, offering 30 annual performances of classical, jazz, dance and theater, including Broadway road company shows and New York Philharmonic concerts. The popular events were staged at Long Island University's C. W. Post Center, the Nassau Coliseum and other Long Island auditoriums.
Bernstein's one-act plays received a posthumous performance in 1993 at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, Long Island.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/nyregion/theater-review-ethnic-look-at-love-in-three-one-acters.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTheater|title= Theater Review; Ethnic Look at Love in Three One-Acters|first= Leah D.|last= Frank|date= September 19, 1993|publisher= The New York Times|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6JItOlcbG|archivedate= September 1, 2013|deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Comic books==

As a writer, he is best known for his EC Comics tales and his Superman stories for DC Comics, where he also established the origin and mythos of Aquaman. With various artists, Bernstein co-created DC's Congorilla, Aqualad and Aquagirl, and also Archie Comics' the Jaguar.
Like most comics professionals of this time, Bernstein went largely uncredited, often receiving credit belatedly in modern-day reprints of his work. His first confirmable credit is the signed, six-page story "Ghouls' Gold" in publisher Lev Gleason's Crime Does Not Pay #43 (Jan. 1946). Other early work includes a five-page story in Spark Publications' Golden Lad #4, featuring the character Swift Arrow, plus includes text fillers for DC Comics and Fawcett Comics, and a 1947 Green Lantern story.Robert Bernstein at the Grand Comics Database
For Marvel Comics' 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, Bernstein wrote for the war comics series War Comics, as well as several stories of the masked Western character Black Rider. Also during this decade, he wrote for DC's All-American Men of War, G.I. Combat, Our Army at War, Our Fighting Forces, and Star Spangled War Stories; psychological drama in EC's Psychoanalysis and Shock Illustrated; and superhero stories, working with artist Jack Kirby on at least one Green Arrow tale, in World's Finest Comics #99 (Feb. 1959).
With artist Howard Sherman, Bernstein adapted the long-running "Congo Bill" jungle-adventure feature into the body-switching superhero feature "Congorilla", beginning in Action Comics #248 (Jan. 1959).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/congoril.htm|title= Congorilla|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2009|publisher= Don Markstein's Toonopedia|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5lhtihKAi|archivedate= December 1, 2009|deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Irvine|first= Alex|authorlink = Alexander C.
