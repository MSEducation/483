State Route 210 (SR 210), also known as the Barraza-Aviation Parkway, is a state highway located in Tucson, Arizona alongside the Union Pacific railroad. Most of it was opened around 1998.

==Route description==

Between its western terminus at Broadway Boulevard and Kino Parkway, SR 210 is a controlled-access expressway; further east, it is a limited-access highway with at-grade intersections and traffic lights until its eastern terminus at Golf Links Road (at the western edge of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.
SR 210 currently does not intersect any other state or national routes, but may intersect Interstate 10 in the future.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=4478192542616931001,32.220120,-110.961830%3B4025343395108052114,32.190146,-110.904756&saddr=AZ-210+E+%4032.220120,+-110.961830&daddr=E+Barraza-Aviation+Pkwy+%4032.190146,+-110.904756&doflg=ptm&jsv=107&sll=32.20509,-110.933295&sspn=0.050039,0.079994&ie=UTF8&z=14 |title=overview map of SR 210 |accessdate=April 14, 2008[/tpl]

==History==

The initial section of SR 210 has a very long history in Tucson.  Called the Barraza-Aviation Highway, all but the last few miles were completed in the 1990s.
The official history of the extension from the Downtown Links website history link states:
Four Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) meetings and two public meetings were held between January 1 – June 30, 2008, where alignment options and issues were studied and commented upon. On June 23, 2008 the CAC voted to endorse the Curved 6th Street Alignment 3.d. to the Mayor and Council. And, on July 8, the Mayor and Council voted 6–0 to approve Alignment 3.d.Downtown Links History[tpl]cite web|url=http://downtownlinks.info/Documents/MeetingMinutes/Minutes_2008_01_14.pdf |title=January 14, 2008 Citizens’ Advisory Council Meeting Minutes |format=PDF |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl]
What the statement on that page does not make clear is that the local neighborhoods and CAC initially approved another alignment, 3.c in December 2006, that ran along existing 6th St and 6th Ave routes after being shown several alignment options that did not include the ultimately approved Alignment 3.d.  After the CAC approval of alignment 3.c, the Southern Pacific railroad decided it wanted more room for a temporary track, known as a "shoofly", and the optional addition of a third set of rails.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/ss/business_headlines/84684.php |title=Tucson Citizen Article "New Sixth Street route plan angers some" |publisher=Tucsoncitizen.com |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl] The new alignment option 3.d was presented by Andrew Singelakis as item No. 6 "Review/Refinement of Sixth Street Alignments and Drainage" to the CAC on January 14, 2008, but no decision was requested.http://downtownlinks.info/Documents/MeetingMinutes/Minutes_2008_01_14.pdf[tpl]cite web |url=http://downtownlinks.info/Documents/CAC/Workshop_2008_03_11.pdf |title=Downtown Links Route photo/map |accessdate=October 7, 2008[/tpl]
The mayor and council approved the "thread the needle alignment" in 2007. That alignment received the Common Ground Award by the Metro Pima Alliance. It was rejected in January and replaced with a radically different plan.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] All previous CAC before January 14, 2008 and all public meetings were only shown alignment options that did not include the ultimately approved Alignment 3.d.  On March 11, 2008, city planners held what they called a "Character Workshop".  At that meeting, they presented only the new 3.d alignmenthttp://downtownlinks.info/Documents/CAC/Workshop_2008_03_11.pdf to the public, declaring that there would be no "additional" public input because this was the only choice to be reviewed at that meeting.  Many members of the public thought that this meant that the choice had already been made, which may have been the informal case.  No other alignments were presented or public meetings about other alignments were announced until public protest threatened to halt the meeting.  The meeting organizers refused to discuss any other alignment options, claiming the particular meeting was only about the amenities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/244739 |title=Links alignment needs full democratic process |author=Arizona Star |accessdate=June 26, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.org/pt/2008/05/906233.shtml |title=Neighborhood Groups Claim Victory On Downtown Links (For Now) |author=Independent Media Report[/tpl]

==Future==

After the passage of the Regional Transportation Authority plan, a portion of the sales tax increase will pay for an extension of the parkway from Broadway Blvd to 6th St.  The plan is called Downtown Links. The road will go alongside the Union Pacific Railroad.  Also, the railroad crossing on 6th St, west of Stone will be improved, providing a new underpass below the railroad.  This will allow free-flowing traffic between I-10 and the new parkway.
The parkway will be four lanes wide.  Construction is scheduled to start in the second phase of the RTA plan in 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://downtownlinks.info |title=Downtown Links Home[/tpl]
ADOT is undergoing a study to connect SR 210 to I-10 at Valencia Road or Wilmot Road in South-East Tucson beginning as soon as 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/highways/projects/I10_SR210_Study/index.asp |title=Interstate 10 and State Route 210 Feasibility Study |publisher=Azdot.gov |date=October 6, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2012[/tpl] The new roadway would be built to freeway standards from I-10 to the current terminus at Golf Links Road.http://www.azdot.gov/highways/projects/I10_SR210_Study/PDF/I10_SR210_Feasibility_MeetingHandout_100611.pdf
