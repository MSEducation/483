==History==

===Early years and formation (1989–1993)===

Before Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the band L.A.P.D. – James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lapd-mn0000118924 | title=L.A.P.D. – Overview | work=Allmusic | publisher=Rovi Corporation | accessdate=March 20, 2013 | author=Torreano, Bradley[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=36[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=37[/tpl] Originally consisting of Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria joined when he was 16. When the band moved from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=38[/tpl] When Shaffer reunited with the band, they found a manager and released an EP entitled Love and Peace Dude in 1989 through Triple X Records.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=50[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=53[/tpl] L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991 which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled Who's Laughing Now.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/whos-laughing-now-mw0000841594 | title=Who's Laughing Now – L.A.P.D | work=Allmusic | publisher=Rovi Corporation | accessdate=March 20, 2013[/tpl] After releasing two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up. They were also briefly known as Creep, recording a demo with a singer named Corey until Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria enlisted Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis to form the band that went on to become Korn.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|pp=53–71[/tpl]

When thinking of a band name, someone suggested "corn", but the band rejected that name, so Shaffer had the idea to spell the name with both a "K" instead of a "C", and a backwards "R", so the band's name would appear as "KoЯn". The logo was designed by vocalist Jonathan Davis. Silveria explained, "the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool."
Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath, called Underground Chicken Sound, in Huntington Beach, California. While they were recording at Underground Chicken Sound, a crowd had been loitering outside the studio.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=63[/tpl] The band began playing a prelude to a later song, "Clown", resulting in a larger crowd gathering. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so "different."[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=64[/tpl] Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a "pain-in-the-ass." While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Epic Records A&R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as "the new genre of rock." In 1993, Korn released their first demo album, Neidermayer's Mind. The album had very limited printing, and was not well received by critics or the public.[tpl]Harvnb|Small|1998|p=16[/tpl] It was released to record companies and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with Biohazard and House of Pain.Small 1998 p. 16 With this demo, Korn pioneered the nu metal sound.[tpl]cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |pages=10; 12 |chapter=How did we get to nu-metal from old metal?[/tpl]

===Korn (1994–1996)===

The album received positive reviews by critics, and it is said to have established the new wave of metal.[tpl]cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |page=23[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = Arnopp | first = Jason | title = Slipknot: Inside the Sickness, Behind the Masks | publisher = Ebury | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-09-187933-7 | pages=6–7 | postscript = [/tpl] As well as sparking the nu metal genre, the album also started record producer Ross Robinson's music career. It also influenced other bands, such as Slipknot, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit.
After Korn finished recording the album, they began touring with Biohazard and House of Pain. Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus. Korn's first gig was in Atlanta.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=74[/tpl] About halfway through the tour, the tour bus that their record company gave them stopped working, and Korn had to find a new one.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=77[/tpl] Their first tour was not very successful in promoting the album.[tpl]Harvnb|Arvizu|2009|p=78[/tpl] The band went on tour with Sick of It All in January 1995.Arvizu 2009 p. 81 Later that year, Korn was chosen, alongside Deftones, as direct support for Ozzy Osbourne.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/brian-head-welch-of-korn-and-love-and-death-talks-favorite-metal-bands/10491061 | title=Brian "Head" Welch of Korn and Love And Death Talks Favorite Metal Bands | work=ARTISTdirect | date=May 3, 2013 | accessdate=May 6, 2013 | author=Florino, Rick[/tpl] The self-titled album went gold in the midst of the tour.

"Blind" was released on August 1, 1994, and "Shoots and Ladders" was released on October 31, 1995.

"Make Me Bad" was released as the album's second single in February 2000, peaking at number fourteen on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. A third single, "Somebody Someone", followed with more moderate success. Music videos were filmed for all three singles, with long-time friend Fred Durst directing "Falling Away from Me", and Martin Weisz directing a concept video for "Make Me Bad", as well as a performance-based video for "Somebody Someone", which featured the use of CGI effects. Every video was a staple on Total Request Live, two of which made it to retirement. Issues is considered by some critics to be less hip hop-influenced and closer to alternative metal than nu metal. It was certified three-times Platinum, following up the success of Follow the Leader.

The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally got to the point where I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now.

In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high drugs. I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said God, 'Show me how to quit.'"Cottrell, Kelli (March 1, 2005). "Korn's former guitarist says of newfound faith, 'this is real'". Baptist Press.  In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be on this side of the stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything."[tpl]cite web|author=Steve Baltin |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/korn-explore-the-paradigm-shift-jonathan-davis-rehab-on-new-album-20130709#ixzz2gkTzjmWs |title=Korn's New Album 'The Paradigm Shift' | Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-04-19[/tpl]  Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013."Brian 'Head' Welch Releases 'Save Me from Myself'".

This was confirmed by Head himself in May, when it was also confirmed that he had been recording as part of the band for their upcoming album.
Fieldy has said of the album "Right now, I will tell you this ... we've done something we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put the best of what we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's going to be a little extra special this time."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bakotopia.com/content/korn-reborn-welch-back |title=Korn reborn: Welch back |publisher=Bakotopia |date=March 20, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.harddriveradio.com/dirt/tuesday-mar-26 |title=Tuesday, Mar 26 |publisher=HardDriveRadio |accessdate=April 4, 2013[/tpl] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album.

Due to controversies and arguments over the band being heavy metal or not than just with nu metal being heavy metal or not, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, "I remember when were coming out we were fighting being called a metal band because we weren't a metal band, we were something that wasn't classifiable," Davis says. "Then they came up with 'nu-metal' but that's still cheesy. It's frustrating."[tpl]cite web|url=http://korn.simpol.net/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1147094704&archive=1278501972&start_from=&ucat=5&page=88|title=Music Choice Rock Show|date=May 8, 2006|work=Korn.simpol.net[/tpl]
The band's debut album warranted a Parental Advisory label solely because of the album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song "Daddy" was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to talk about that song.

==Controversy==

===Vulgarity in lyrics===

Prior to the release of 1998's Follow the Leader, Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that Korn's music is "indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting" after giving a student, Eric VanHoven, a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo on it.Ross, Mike (September 17, 1998).
