The Vikos Gorge ([tpl]lang-gr|Φαράγγι του Βίκου[/tpl]) is a gorge in the Pindus Mountains of northern Greece. It lies on the southern slopes of Mount Tymfi, with a length of about 20 km, depth ranging from 450 m to 1600 m and width from 400 m to some metres at its narrowest part.[tpl]cite web | last=Amanatidou |first=Despoina | title=A case study in Vikos-Aoos National Park - Greece | format=PDF | url=http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/2378/pdf/DespoinaAmanatidouDissertation.pdf |year= 2005| accessdate=2009-07-27  |work=University of Freiburg[/tpl]
Vikos is listed as the deepest gorge in the world by the Guinness Book of Records[tpl]cite book | author= | title=Guinness World Records 2005: Special 50th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records | year=2004 | editor= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=D4wYAAAAIAAJ&dq=Vikos%2BGuines&lr=&as_brr=0&hl= | isbn= 978-1-892051-22-6| page = 52[/tpl] among others. This follows a somewhat arbitrary definition of a gorge that excludes deeper features such as Colca Canyon because of their greater width:depth ratio.[tpl]cite book | author=Jackson Jack | title=The world's great adventure treks | publisher=New Holland Publishers | year=2003 | editor= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=yG5BtE7Hx9kC&pg=PA117&dq=Vikos-Aoos+National+Park&lr=&hl=| isbn=978-1-84330-261-2[/tpl]p. 113

==Location==

The gorge is found in the core zone of the Vikos–Aoös National Park, in the Zagori region. It begins between the villages of Monodendri and Koukouli and ends near the village of Vikos (or Vitsiko).*[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Natura 2000 Data Form.

The major part of Voidomatis is only seasonal, and is permanent only at the lowest part of the gorge. Vikos is also a site of major scientific interest, because it is in almost virgin condition, it is a haven for endangered species and contains many and varied ecosystems.
