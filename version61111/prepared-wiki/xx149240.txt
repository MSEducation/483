Contestants were divided into competing teams of three based upon career, at first three teams and later in the series just two teams. They were dressed in their regular work clothes. The winning team went on an exotic holiday where they had to work, to learn how their jobs were performed in other locations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eppley.org/blog/article/5-blog/459-busman-s-holiday-great-smoky-mountains-national-park|title= Busman’s Holiday – Great Smoky Mountains National Park|publisher= The Trustees of Indiana University|accessdate=17 August 2012[/tpl]
The format of the programme consisted of multiple rounds of quizzing: world geography, questions of the other's profession or brain teasers, questions of their own profession—sometimes quite embarrassing, and questions on a final destination— revealing which team had conducted the best research prior to the match. There was also a review of the prior week's winning contestants' holiday.
