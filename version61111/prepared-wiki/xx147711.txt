International Association for Jazz Education (IAJE), formerly a not-for-profit corporation based in Manhattan, Kansas, was a volunteer-run organization that, among other things, allocated student scholarships through its approved festivals program.  Its annual conference was a gathering point for professional artists as well as jazz enthusiasts.  Many considered IAJE to be a foundation of the jazz community, and its many programs to be a cornerstone of jazz education.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
IAJE was first incorporated as a non-profit on August 18, 1989, having developed from the International Association of Jazz Educators (since 1971) and the U.S. National Association of Jazz Education (since 1968). The association organized more than 7,000 teachers, musicians, producers, and others interested in jazz, from more than thirty countries. They organized a yearly conference, which included numerous musical presentations.
IAJE filed for bankruptcy April 2008, and ceased as a corporation March 15, 2009.  The bankruptcy filing was necessitated, in part, because of financial problems stemming from a lack of donations, and losses â€“ notably from the small turnout at the Toronto conference of 2008.[tpl]cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=A Jazz Lifeline to Academia Is Severed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/26/arts/music/26jazz.html?ex=1209873600&en=eb562ae3706118f9&ei=5070&emc=eta1|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 April 2008[/tpl]
