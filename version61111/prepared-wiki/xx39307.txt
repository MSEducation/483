</ref> Since then, academics who published a joint paper with Kendrick Moxon and later others referencing their work have stated that the "Old CAN" covertly continued to make and derive income from referrals to coercive [[deprogrammer]]s, while publicly distancing itself from the practice.<ref name="davis" /><ref name="oxford" />

===Foundation===

The CAN predecessor, Citizen's Freedom Foundation ("CFF"), was founded in the wake of the 1978 Jonestown mass murder-suicide, and was run for a time by Patricia Ryan, the  daughter of US Congressman Leo J. Ryan (D-Millbrae, California), who died from gunfire while investigating conditions at the Jonestown cult compound in Guyana.  CAN evolved out of the CFF, of which deprogrammer Ted Patrick was "the prime force in organizing."[tpl]cite news |first = James P. |last = Sterba |title = Parents Form Group to Fight Religious Cults' Hold on Young |work = New York Times |page = 18 |date = 1974-09-02[/tpl]  The organization was originally headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.  CAN collected information on many controversial organizations and religious movements.  Actor Mike Farrell was one of the members of the board of advisors of CAN, and Dr. Edward Lottick served as president.[ref]
