==The book==

Satsangi Jeevan comprises 19,387 Shlokas among 360 Chapters, in 5 Volumes.
Volume 1 narrates the prologue and the circumstances leading to Swaminarayan taking birth. This volume then goes on to speak of his childhood, his journey across India as a teenager and the meeting of Swaminarayan (then known as Neelkanth Varni) with his guru, Ramanand Swami. The volume ends with Swaminarayan being appointed head of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.
In volume 2, Shatanand Swami describes Swaminarayan’s social upliftment of the masses, spiritual / religious / social guidance for their personal well being and visiting followers whilst moving through villages, towns & cities.
Volume 3 continues the narrations of Swaminarayan’s movements to teach the depths of Devotion with true observance of Dharma. It is in this volume that the construction of temples by Swaminarayan is first talked about.
Volume 4 commences with narrations of the scriptural recitals that Swaminrayan instructed. However, this volume is primarily revered for it’s intricate explanation of the Shikshapatri, the establishing of the Acharyaship and teachings specifically to  the Acharyas.
Volume 5 is dedicated to personal religious activities of Swaminarayan in minute detail.

==Meaning of Satsang==

In Satsangi Jeevan, Shatanand Swami mentions that merging the two terms, the meaning of Satsang is derived. The term Sat implies four significances:[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.swaminarayan.nu/youth/satsang.shtml | title= Definition of Satsang[/tpl]
1. God 
2. Saints who has entirely surrendered to God 
3. Dharma asserted by God Himself and his favorite saints, and 
4. The Scriptures wherein these three above mentioned are prescribed. 
In Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan commented on the term "sang". The association which is made by body, action, and mind is called "sang". When you put the two together you get Satsang. Jeevan means life, therefore the meaning of the title, Satsangi Jeevan is way of life for a Satsangi.
