AL-Manaseer Jordanian Pro League ([tpl]lang-ar|دوري المناصير الأردني للمحترفين[/tpl]) is a Jordanian professional league for football clubs and represents the top flight of Jordanian football. The championship consists of twelve competing teams in a home and away league system. It is currently known as the AL-Manaseer Jordanian Pro League, after the FA signed a sponsorship deal with Ziyad  AL-Manaseer Companies Group.
==League history== 
The league is largely similar to that of the Scottish Premier League or Spain's La Liga. Two teams have dominated the domestic scene for a very long time: the two Amman clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly. Sometimes outside teams break out and make surprises, like Shabab Al-Ordon being 2006 League Champion and 2007 AFC Cup Champions abroad, and Al-Ramtha taking Al-Faisaly to a 1 off match for the league title after being tied on points at the end of the season in 2012. Those Among the most recent surprises.

===AFC Cup===

Jordan is the most successful country in the AFC Cup with three titles, 2 for Al-Faisaly (2005 and 2006) and 1 for Shabab Al-Ordon (2007), more than any other country who has their clubs eligible to play in the AFC Cup.
