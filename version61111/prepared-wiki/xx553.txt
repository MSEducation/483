The demographic profile of Cameroon is complex for a country of its population.  Cameroon comprises an estimated 250 distinct ethnic groups, which may be formed into five large regional-cultural divisions:
An up-to-date demographic profile is unavailable from the country's government, which hasn't published census data since 1976.
The Cameroon government held two national censuses during the country's first 44 years as an independent country, in 1976 and again in 1987.  Results from the second head count were never published.  A third census, expected to take years to produce results, began on November 11, 2005, with a three-week interviewing phase.  It is one of a series of projects and reforms required by the International Monetary Fund as prerequisites for foreign debt relief.
