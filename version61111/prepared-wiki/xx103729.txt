===Data cap===

Initially, Comcast had policy of terminating broadband customers who use "excessive bandwidth", a term the company refused to define in its terms of service, which once said only that a customer's use should not "represent (in the sole judgment of Comcast) an overly large burden on the network". Company responses to press inquiries suggest a limit of several hundred gigabytes per month.Carolyn Y. Johnson, "Not so fast, broadband providers tell big users",  The Boston Globe"Say Good Night, Bandwidth Hog", The New York Times In September 2007, Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas said the company defines "excessive use" as the equivalent of 30,000 songs, 250,000 pictures or 13 million emails in a month.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/comcast-clarifies-high-speed-extreme-use-policy/18014/ | title=Comcast Clarifies High Speed Extreme Use Policy, September 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 1, 2007 [/tpl] Other company statements have said the limit varied from month to month, depending on the capacity of specific CMTS's, and that it affected only the top one-thousandth of high-speed Internet customers.

==Land line telephone==

Comcast Digital Voice, now known as Xfinity Voice, is a telephone product offered  by Comcast Corporation.  Comcast offers CDV in both residential and business class and is packaged with Xfinity. The service was launched in 2005 in select markets, before being extended to all of Comcast's markets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Comcast-pushes-VoIP-to-prime-time/2100-7352_3-5519446.html|title=Comcast pushes VoIP to prime time|publisher=Cnet|author=Ben Charny |date=10 Jan 2005|accessdate=17 Feb 2014[/tpl]
Xfinity Voice allows communication over the internet using VoIP, but uses a private network instead of a public IP address, which allows Comcast to prioritize the voice data during heavy traffic. In technical terms, on Comcast's Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network, calls are placed into individual Unsolicited Grant Service flows, based on DOCSIS 1.1 Quality of service standards. For the customer, this has the benefit of preventing network congestion from interfering with call quality. However, this separation of traffic into separate flows, or Smart pipe, has been seen by some as a violation of net neutrality, who call instead for equal treatment of all data, or dumb pipe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/internet-video/smart-pipes-dumb-pipes-and-qos/129650|title=Smart Pipes, Dumb Pipes and QoS|publisher=MultiChannel|author= Leslie Ellis|date=17 Feb 2006|accessdate=8 Mar 2014[/tpl] Other, non-Comcast VoIP services on Comcast's network must use the lower priority public IP addresses. The practice was questioned by the FCC in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/01/19/fcc-asks-if-comcast-slows-rivals-voip-traffic/|title=FCC Asks if Comcast Slows Rivals' VoIP Traffic|publisher=Gigaom|author=Stacey Higginbotham|date=19 Jan 2009|accessdate=7 Mar 2014[/tpl] In their response, Comcast stated that services that use telecommunications are not necessarily telecommunications services, and noted the FCC's current designation of Comcast Digital Voice as an information service exempted it from telecommunications service regulations. Comcast also said that because Comcast Voice was a separate service, it was unfair to directly compare the data for Comcast Voice with the data for other VoIP services.[tpl]cite web|url=http://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.comcast.net%2Fdocs%2Fjanuary-30-2009-comcast-fcc-response.pdf|title=In the Matter of Formal Complaint of Free Press and Public Knowledge Against Comcast Corporation for Secretly Degrading Peer-to-Peer Applications, File No. EB-08-IH-1518|publisher=Comcast|author=Kathryn A.

Beginning in the mid 2000s, television stations increasingly required cable companies like Comcast to pay retransmission fees in exchange for permission to broadcast their content.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/14/tv-retrans-fees/2512233/|title=Retransmission fee race poses questions for TV viewers|publisher=USA Today|author=Roger Yu|date=2 Aug 2013|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl] (Historically, TV broadcasters made money almost exclusively through advertising.) These fees have been the subject of heated negotiation between broadcasters and distributors, with a few high profile blackouts prompting the FCC to publicly express serious concern in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/fcc-consider-forcing-bcasters-distributors-play-nice-125284|title=FCC to Consider Forcing B'casters, Distributors to Play Nice|publisher=AdWeek|author=Katy Bachman|date=3 Mar 2011|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl] Comcast currently has ten year agreements with CBS[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03cbs.html|title=CBS and Comcast Reach a 10-Year Deal on Fees|publisher=New York Times|author=BRIAN STELTER|date=2 Aug 2010|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl] and Disney,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/04/idUS230102746820120104|title=Disney-Comcast Make 10-Year Xfinity Multi-Platform Deal (Breaking)|publisher=Reuters|date=4 Jan 2012|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl] as well as deals with Fox[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2415351,00.asp|title=Fox, Comcast Re-Up Xfinity Content Deal|publisher=PC Magazine|author=Damon Poeter|date=12 Feb 2013|accessdate=17 Feb 2014[/tpl] and others, but the financial details of these deals are not public. Based on professional estimates, ESPN charges $5.06 to transmit their channel per viewer. However, most channels charge much less.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/141097593.html|title=ESPN continues to lead cable by a mile in terms of subscriber fees|publisher=Milwaukee, Wisconsin Journal Sentinel|author=Bob Wolfley|date=1 Mar 2012|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl]
Since the rise of retransmission fees, distributors like Comcast pay substantial fees for retransmitting broadcast television, which is free over the air for consumers. Comcast has instated a $1.50 Broadcast TV Fee to cover part of the cost of getting permission from stations to retransmit the free stations, itemized separately for consumers. Comcast's subsidiary, NBCUniversal, is one of several broadcasters currently in legal dispute with Aereo, over the question of whether the company is a retransmitter (which would require it to pay retransmission fees).[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-01-06/business/45885511_1_retransmission-fees-tv-stations-similar-fees|title=Fight continues over cable retransmission fees|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|author=Bob Fernandez|date=6 Jan 2014|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl]  The case is currently set to appear before the US Supreme Court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-10/broadcasters-get-u-s-supreme-court-review-in-bid-to-stop.html|title=Broadcasters Get U.S. Supreme Court Review in Bid to Stop Aereo |publisher=Bloomberg|author=Greg Stohr|date=11 Jan 2014|accessdate=18 Feb 2014[/tpl]

==Home security and automation==

This service provides residential customers a monitored burglar and fire alarm, surveillance cameras, and home automation.[tpl]cite web|title=Comcast Xfinity Home service|url=http://www.comcast.com/home-security/|accessdate=20 November 2, 2012[/tpl]

==Comcast Business==

In addition to residential consumers, Comcast also serves businesses as customers, targeting both small businesses with fewer than 20 employees and also mid-sized businesses of 20–500 employees.Comcast Speeds Up Business High-Speed-Data Offering, Glen Dickson, Broadcasting & Cable, April 29, 2008.

Comcast Business services were initially sold exclusively through direct sales employees. In March 2011, Comcast created an indirect sales channel called the Solution Provider Program, a comprehensive indirect channel program that enables telecommunications consultants and system integrators to sell Comcast’s services such as Business Class Internet, Voice, and high-capacity Ethernet services to small and mid-market businesses. The program offers recurring commissions for sales partners based on monthly revenue, and Comcast will provide, install, manage and bill for these services. For the initial launch of the Solutions Provider Program, Comcast enlisted three national master representatives—Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah; Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California; and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago. Sub-agent sales partners must work with one of these three partners in the early stages of the program.[tpl]cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Launches Agent Program|url=http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/news/2011/03/comcast-launches-agent-program.aspx|accessdate=March 14, 2011|newspaper=Channel Partners|date=March 14, 2011[/tpl]  The head of the Comcast Business indirect sales channel is Craig Schlagbaum, former head of the Level 3 Communications channel.[tpl]cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Taps Schlagbaum to Lead Channel|url=http://m.channelpartnersonline.com/20290/show/0d4e2b2fb4c6e55d70fd88eccf8e9ccf&t=e97cf1c2b7d1bba002abad67057fe9b4|accessdate=January 19, 2011|newspaper=PHONE+|date=January 19, 2011[/tpl]
