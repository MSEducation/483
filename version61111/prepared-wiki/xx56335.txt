==History==

===Origins===

The Plymouth automobile was introduced on July 7, 1928. It was Chrysler Corporation's first entry in the low-priced field, which at the time was already dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. Plymouths were actually priced slightly higher than their competition, but offered all standard features such as internal expanding hydraulic brakes that the competition did not provide. Plymouths were originally sold exclusively through Chrysler dealerships. The logo featured a rear view of the ship Mayflower which landed at Plymouth Rock. However, the Plymouth brand name came from Plymouth Binder Twine, chosen by Joe Frazer for its popularity among farmers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/plymouth-name.html |title=What's in a Name? (How Plymouth Was Named) |publisher=Allpar.com |date=1928-01-11 |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl] (Plymouth Binder Twine was a common household item that was used to tie up various items.)
The origins of Plymouth can be traced back to the Maxwell automobile. When Walter P. Chrysler took over control of the troubled Maxwell-Chalmers car company in the early 1920s, he inherited the Maxwell as part of the package. After he used the company's facilities to help create and launch the Chrysler car in 1924, he decided to create a lower-priced companion car. So for 1926 the Maxwell was reworked and re-badged as the low-end Chrysler "52" model. In 1928, the "52" was once again redesigned to create the Chrysler-Plymouth Model Q. The "Chrysler" portion of the nameplate was dropped with the introduction of the Plymouth Model U in 1929.

===Great Depression, 1940s and 1950s===

While the original purpose of the Plymouth was to serve a lower-end marketing niche, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the marque helped significantly in ensuring the survival of the Chrysler Corporation in a decade when many other car companies failed. Beginning in 1930, Plymouths were sold by all three Chrysler divisions (Chrysler, DeSoto, and Dodge). Plymouth sales were a bright spot during this dismal automotive period, and by 1931 Plymouth rose to the number three spot among all cars. In 1931 with the Model PA, the company introduced floating power and boasted, "The economy of a four; the smoothness of a six."
In 1933 Chrysler decided to catch up with Ford and Chevrolet with respect to engine cylinder count. The 190 cu in version of Chrysler's flathead-6 engine was equipped with a downdraft carburetor and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on 17 November 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC's wheelbase from [tpl]convert|112|in|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl] to  [tpl]convert|107|in|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl], and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division's Model DP chassis, with a [tpl]convert|112|in|cm|1|abbr=on[/tpl]  wheelbase, was put under the PC body with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to PD and the car was marketed as the "DeLuxe" 1933 Plymouth. This car sold very well and is the 1933 model most commonly found in collections. The PC became the 'Standard Six'. It had been the 'Plymouth Six' at introduction, and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. It is consequently in the minority in collectors' hands today. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat dash boards with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Plymouth/1937_Plymouth/1937_Plymouth_Biggest_Value_Brochure/1937%20Plymouth%20Biggest%20Value-19.html
The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK it was sold as a 'Chrysler Kew', Kew Gardens being the location of the Chrysler factory outside London.
The flathead 6 which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.
In 1939 Plymouth produced 417,528 vehicles, of which 5,967 were two-door convertible coupes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joesherlock.com/39Ply_history.html |title=1939 Plymouth - history |publisher=Joesherlock.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl] with rumble seats. The 1939 convertible coupe was prominently featured at Chrysler's exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair, advertised as the first mass-production convertible with a power folding top. It featured a 201 cu in, 82 hp version of the flathead six engine.
For much of its life, Plymouth was one of the top-selling American automobile brands; it together with Chevrolet and Ford was commonly referred to as the "low-priced three" marques in the American market.Vincent Curcio (2001), Chrysler: The Life and Times of an Automotive Genius, p.472 Plymouth almost surpassed Ford in 1940 and 1941 as the second most popular make of automobiles in the U.S. Through 1956, Plymouth vehicles were known[tpl]Who|date=March 2011[/tpl] for their durability, affordability, and engineering.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] In 1957, Virgil Exner's new Forward Look design theme, advertised by Plymouth with the tagline "Suddenly, it's 1960",[tpl]cite web|last=Benjaminson |first=Jim |url=http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/1946-1959/cars-1957.html |title=Plymouth cars 1957: Three Years Ahead |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl]  produced cars with much more advanced styling than Chevrolet or Ford. 1957 total production soared to 726,009, about 200,000 more than 1956, and the largest output yet for Plymouth. However, the 1957–1958 Forward Look models suffered from poor materials, spotty build quality and inadequate corrosion protection; they were rust-prone and greatly damaged Chrysler's reputation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/history/inside/plymouth-5.html |title=Insider's history of Plymouth - Part V |publisher=Allpar.com |date=1956-10-30 |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl]
In 1954 Chrysler started its decade long unsuccessful attempt to develop and market a viable car powered by turbine engine when it installed an experimental turbine they had developed specifically for vehicles in a Plymouth."Turbo Plymouth Threatens Future of Standard."

===1960s - 1970s===

Although Plymouth sales suffered as a result of the quality control problems and excesses of Exner-styled models in the early 1960s, people bought enough of the cars to keep the division profitable.  Starting in 1961, the Valiant compact became a Plymouth, further boosting sales.  Under the impression that Chevrolet was about to "downsize" its 1962 models, Chrysler introduced a significantly small standard Plymouth for 1962.  As is known, Chevrolet's big cars weren't downsized, catching Plymouth in a sales slump in a market where "bigger was better."  The '63 Fury, Belvedere and Savoy were slightly larger and more substantial, featuring a totally new body style, highlighted by prominent outboard front parking lights.  For 1964, Plymouth got another major restyle, featuring a new "slantback" roofline for hardtop coupes that would prove extremely popular.  Many enthusiasts consider the '64s to be the most attractive of the early '60s Plymouths.  
For 1965, Plymouth got a totally new platform.  The '65s were the biggest Plymouths ever produced, The Savoy was discontinued, and Belvedere became an "intermediate," but it was basically a restyled '64.  All big Plymouths became Furys for 1965.  The low end series was Fury I, the mid-level models were Fury II, and deluxe models were Fury IIIs.  Above Fury III was the Sport Fury, which featured bucket seats and a V8 engine, a la Ford Galaxie 500/XL and Chevrolet Impala Super Sport.  Ford and Chevrolet introduced special luxury editions of their big cars for 1965, the Ford Galaxie500/LTD and the Chevrolet Impala Caprice.  Plymouth responded in 1966 with the VIP, a luxurious version of the Fury.  Furys, Belvederes, and Valiants continued to sell well during the late 1960s and early '70s.  
Of note are the Plymouth "muscle cars" of the late 1960s. As the performance car craze of the late '60s and '70s swept over the U.S, Plymouth contributed greatly, and furthermore produced some of the most memorable muscle cars in American automotive history. Many consider the Barracuda fastback of 1964 to be the first of Plymouth's sporty cars. Based on the Valiant, it was available with a durable Slant Six, or 273 cubic-inch small block V8.  For 1967, Plymouth introduced the Belvedere GTX, a bucket-seat high-style hardtop coupe and convertible that could be ordered with either the Super Commando 440, or Hemi 426 V8.  Looking for an advantage at the drag races, 1968 saw a stripped down Belvedere coupe, the Road Runner, which featured a bench seat, a minimum of interior and exterior trim, but was available with Chrysler's big-block engines, and a floor-mounted 4-speed manual transmission. The Barracuda, originally a "compact sporty car" aimed at Ford's Mustang and the Chevy Camaro, became a top tier muscle car in 1970 when it was made available with the 440 big block and 426 Hemi motors- putting it in contention with America's most powerful mass produced sports cars. With the success of their big block and small block powered sports cars -principally among them the GTX, Barracuda (and the more muscular 'Cuda), Road Runner, Sport Fury GT, and Duster 340- Plymouth unveiled the 'Rapid Transit System', which, based on Dodge's 'Scat Pack' concept, was an all inclusive club made up of Plymouth sports car owners which provided further immersion into Plymouth performance automobiles. Throughout this period in Plymouth history, the brand also competed heavily in professional automobile racing. Their foremost prominent hallmark success stories come from racing icon Richard Petty's career with Plymouth in NASCAR, Dan Gurney, who raced a 'Cuda as part of the All American Racers in numerous Trans Am events, and Sox and Martin: one of the most well known drag racing teams of the period- only ever racing Plymouths. The GTX, Barracuda/'Cuda, and Road Runner continued into the 1970s, but as that decade wore on, emissions and safety regulations, along with soaring gasoline prices and an economic downturn spelled death for the majority of Plymouth's muscle car brands. Nonetheless, the compact Valiant sold well, built an enviable reputation for attractive styling, durability, economy, and value.  Although the Valiant hardtop was discontinued for 1967, it was re-introduced as a virtual clone of the Dodge Dart Swinger for 1971 under the model name "Valiant Scamp."  The Scamp was produced along with the Valiant, Dodge Dart and Swinger until 1976, when it was replaced with the Volare.  Featuring transverse-mounted torsion bars and a slightly larger body, the Volare (and its Dodge twin, the Aspen) was an instant sales success.  Available as coupe, sedan or station wagon, the Volare offered a smoother ride and better handling than the Dart/Valiant, but unfortunately suffered quality control problems and by 1980, was selling poorly.    
Realizing that front-wheel drive, four-cylinder engines, and rack-and-pinion steering would become the standards for the 1980s, Chrysler introduced a new compact car for 1978, the Plymouth Horizon/Dodge Omni twins.  Horizon sold well, but unfortunately suffered from a scathing report by Consumer Reports, which found its handling dangerous in certain situations.  Plymouth continued to sell the Horizon until 1987, when a gaggle of front-wheel drive compact cars made up the line.  Big Plymouths, including the Fury and Gran Fury, were sold up until the early 1980s, but mostly as fleet vehicles.  While attempting to compete with Ford and Chevrolet for big-car sales, Plymouth was hurt by Chrysler's financial woes in the late 1970s, when both its competitors downsized their full-size models.  Plymouth's attempt at downsizing the Gran Fury in 1979 was a poor seller, and dropped by 1981.  By the 1980s, Plymouth as a distinctive division within Chrysler Corporation was no more.  Plymouths were from then on simply re-badged Dodges.

===Final years===

Most Plymouth models offered from the late 1970s onward, such as the Volaré, Acclaim, Laser, Neon, and Breeze, were badge-engineered versions of Chrysler, Dodge, or Mitsubishi models. By the 1990s, Plymouth had lost much of its identity, as its models continued to overlap in features and prices with Dodges and Eagles."How Plymouth Works: 1990, 1991, 1992 Plymouths" by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, retrieved on 2011–01–20. In an attempt to fix this, Chrysler tried repositioning Plymouth to its traditional spot as the automaker's entry-level brand. Part of this marketing stategy included giving Plymouth its own new sailboat logo and advertisements that focused solely on value.[tpl]cite book |author=Yates, Brock |title=The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation "Showtime in St.Louis" p.209-11 |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1996[/tpl] However, this only further narrowed Plymouth's product offerings and buyer appeal, and sales continued to fall."How Plymouth Works: 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 Plymouths" by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, retrieved on 2011–01–20.
Chrysler considered giving Plymouth a variant of the highly successful new-for-1993 full-size LH platform,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/intrepid.html |title=Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, New Yorker, and LHS - the LH cars, with reviews |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl] which would have been called the Accolade, but decided against it. By the late 1990s, only four vehicles were sold under the Plymouth name: the Voyager/Grand Voyager minivans, the Breeze mid-size sedan, the Neon compact car, and the Prowler sports car, which was to be the last model unique to Plymouth, though the Chrysler PT Cruiser was conceived as a concept unique to Plymouth before production commenced as a Chrysler model.
After discontinuing the Eagle brand in 1998, Chrysler was planning to expand the Plymouth line with a number of unique models before the corporation's merger with Daimler-Benz AG. The first model was the Plymouth Prowler, a hot rod styled sports car. The PT Cruiser was to have been the second. Both models had similar front-end styling, suggesting Chrysler intended a retro styling theme for the Plymouth brand. At the time of Daimler's takeover of Chrysler, Plymouth had no unique models besides the Prowler not also available in the Dodge or Chrysler lines.
From a peak production of 973,000 for the 1973 model year, Plymouth rarely exceeded 200,000 cars per year after 1990. Even the Voyager sales were usually less than 50% that of Dodge Caravan. In Canada, the Plymouth name was defunct at the end of the 1999 model year. Consequently, DaimlerChrysler decided to drop the make after a limited run of 2001 models. This was announced on November 3, 1999.
The last new model sold under the Plymouth marque was the second generation Neon for 2000–2001. The PT Cruiser was ultimately launched as a Chrysler, and the Prowler and Voyager were absorbed into that make as well. Following the 2001 model year, the Neon was sold only as a Dodge in the US, though it remained available as a Chrysler in Canadian and other markets. The Plymouth Breeze was dropped after 2000, before Chrysler introduced their redesigned 2001 Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring sedan.

==Plymouth Trucks==

Plymouth built various trucks and vans over the years, mainly re-badged Dodge or Chrysler vehicles.  Early pickups, delivery trucks and other commercial trucks were available, and later an SUV, full size vans and mini-vans.  Plymouth had supplied components to the Fargo vehicles, another member of the Chrysler family, but entered the commercial market in 1937 with the PT50.[tpl]cite web|last=Benjaminson |first=Jim |url=http://www.allpar.com/history/plymouth/plymouth-commercial.html |title=Plymouth commercial vehicles |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-26[/tpl]
