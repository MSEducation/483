Born in Lisbon, Miguel started his career with local C.F. Estrela da Amadora as a winger. On 30 April 1999 he made his first-team debut, playing 17 minutes in a 1–2 away loss against Boavista FC, then added 28 league appearances in his only full season as the capital club retained its top division status.
In the 2000 summer Miguel moved to S.L. Benfica, making the transition to right midfielder and then right back (by the hand of former Benfica player Fernando Chalana, in his only game as a transition coach) – the position that ultimately brought him international recognition. In the 2004–05 campaign he contributed with 22 games and two goals, as the Reds won the national championship after an 11-year wait.
