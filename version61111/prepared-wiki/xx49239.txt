The son of a railway official, Schröder was born in Saarbrücken, then part of the Prussian Rhine Province. Having passed his Abitur exams, he went on to study law at the University of Königsberg and two semesters abroad at the University of Edinburgh, where he, according his own accounts, became familiar with a British way of life. In 1932 he finished his studies in Bonn in 1932, where he had committed himself to the university group of the national liberal German People's Party.

He continued his career as a law firm employee and in 1939 obtained an attorney's certificate and worked as a tax lawyer. He left the NSDAP in May 1941 (a rather rare occurrence). In the same month and perhaps in connection, he married his wife, Brigitte Schröder née Landsberg, needing - she was a half-Jew - with an extraordinary permission by his Armed Forces superiors.
