==History==

Elekta was founded in 1972 by the late Lars Leksell, Professor of Neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Since 1994, the company has been listed on the Nordic Exchange under the ticker EKTAb. Elekta was created to commercialize the development of the Leksell Stereotactic System, and Leksell Gamma Knife, which the professor had been researching since the late 1940s. Lars Leksell's son, Laurent, became chief executive officer of Elekta until 2005, and under his leadership the company expanded into a public medical technology group with more than 3,400 employees worldwide. In 2005 Tomas Puusepp became President and CEO of the company.  The company trades only in Sweden, but nearly half the sales of the company's equipment are in the United States.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_32/b4045080.htm | title = Why Elekta May Be A Stockholm Standout | date = 2007-08-06 | accessdate = 2009-06-12 | work = BusinessWeek | last = Marcial | first = GG [/tpl]
