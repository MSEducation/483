He began studying English literature at the University of Waseda, Tokyo. In parallel, he also studied the works of Fenwicke Holmes, and subsequently translated Holmes' book, The Law of Mind in Action into Japanese. In 1929, after much study and contemplation, he reported having received a divine revelation followed by the healing of his daughter.  This led in 1930 to the creation of a magazine, Seicho-no-ie ("home of infinite life, wisdom, and abundance"). The movement grew during the 1930s, although was suppressed during World War II. In 1952, he co-authored a book with Fenwicke Holmes titled The Science of Faith."Masaharu Taniguchi." Religious Leaders of America, 2nd ed., edited by J. Gordon Melton. Detroit: The Gale Group, 1999.
