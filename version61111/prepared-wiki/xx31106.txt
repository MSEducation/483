==International career==

Both France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen, but he was ineligible to play for the Algerian national team. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough.[tpl]cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/sports/2006/jul/10sld-zid1.htm |title=',The scarred French messiah', |publisher=Specials.rediff.com |accessdate=28 April 2011[/tpl] However, Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.Le Buteur magazine 7 May 2005
He earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2–2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2–0 deficit. After Éric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position. France was eliminated in the  Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout by the Czech Republic after the match ended 0–0 in extra time.

===1998 World Cup===

The 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in. It was held in his home country France. The French team won all three games in the group stage but Zidane was sent off in the second match against Saudi Arabia for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals. Without their suspended playmaker France proceeded to win 1–0 in the last sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals. France then defeated Croatia 2–1 in the semi-final. Zidane played a major role in the team's accomplishment, though he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.
Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane's two goals, France went into the half-time break 2-0 up with one hand already on the World Cup trophy. Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3–0 win and France's first ever World Cup. Zidane became an instant national hero, and over one million people celebrated the victory on the Champs-Élysées where a huge image of Zidane was projected on the Arc de Triomphe along with the words "Merci Zizou"."Zizou top".

===Euro 2000===

Two years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a memorable free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal, and was named player of the tournament by UEFA.

===2002 World Cup===

As reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup as favourites but a thigh injury prevented Zidane from playing in France's first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/story?id=216185 |title=Arrogant approach finishes favourites |first=John|last=Brewin|publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=12 June 2002|accessdate=11 July 2006[/tpl]

===Euro 2004===

At Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1–0 loss. In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn defeat into a 2–1 victory for France. After France's elimination Zidane announced his retirement from international football.[tpl]Cite news|title=Zidane quits French national team|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/football/08/12/zidane.retirement/ |publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2004|accessdate=11 July 2006 [/tpl]

===2006 World Cup===

With the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain.[ref]
