Holy Assumption Orthodox Church, also known as Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, is a Russian Orthodox church in Kenai, Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska, USA. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

==History==

Alaska became a diocese in the Russian Orthodox Church in 1840, and the church's popularity in the Kenai Peninsula region grew, particularly amongst the Kenaitze, the native people of the peninsula. Bishop Innocent created six parishes in Alaska, including one for the Kenai region. The first chapel was built that same year by the Russian-American Company near the village of Kenai within Fort St. Nicholas. The first priest to serve the parish, Igumen Nikolai Militov, arrived in 1844 and served until his death in 1869.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/nhl/russian-america/sec4.htm |title=Holy Assumption Orthodox Church |publisher=National Park Service |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=September 26, 2009[/tpl]
Igumen Nikolai oversaw the construction of a church in 1849 on a different portion of the lot. He opened a school in the early 1860s, and Russian became the principal language in both education and commerce. The church served as a vital method of assimilating the natives to the Russian culture. In addition to religious and educational purposes, the church served as an administrative and judicial center for the region.
Built from 1895 to 1896, the church was the second Orthodox church at the site, replacing the 1849 structure. The church was built from logs in the Pskov styleâ€”in the shape of a ship. The bell tower was completed later in 1900. The interior contains an elaborate iconostasis.
The Chapel of St. Nicholas was built in 1906. It rests over the graves of Igumen Nikolai, his assistant and reader Makari Ivanov, and an unrecorded monk. The chapel sits on the site of the original chapel, across the street from the church, on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the Kenai River and Cook Inlet. The rectory was built in 1881 and is considered the oldest building in the Peninsula.
The church site, including the rectory, cemetery, and chapel, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.[ref]

==List of priests==

Early on, the parish was served by priests who emigrated from Russia.  From 1860 on, Nikolai Militov and Makary Ivanov, in whose honor the Chapel of St. Nicholas was built, traveled the region and vaccinated thousands of Dena'ina from smallpox.  Militov died in 1867.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.travelalaska.com/Regions/CommunityDetail.aspx?LocationID=39&RegionID=30 |title=Southcentral Community: Kenai |publisher=Alaska Travel Industry Association |accessdate=October 8, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oca.org/DIRlisting.asp?SID=9&KEY=OCA-AK-KENDVM |title=Holy Assumption of the Virgin Mary Church |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |accessdate=September 27, 2009[/tpl]
