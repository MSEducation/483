[[Malware]]

CATEGORIES: Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, is any software used to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techterms.com/definition/malware| title=Malware definition| publisher=techterms.com |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] It can appear in the form of code, scripts, active content, and other software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/undirected_attack0905.pdf |title=An Undirected Attack Against Critical Infrastructure |publisher=United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team(Us-cert.gov) |date= | format=PDF| accessdate=20 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] 'Malware' is a general term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software.
Malware includes computer viruses (including worms, trojan horses), ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. The majority of active malware threats are usually worms or trojans rather than viruses. In law, malware is sometimes known as a computer contaminant, as in the legal codes of several U.S. states.[tpl]cite web| publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures |url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/telecom/state-virus-and-computer-contaminant-laws.aspx| title=Virus/Contaminant/Destructive Transmission Statutes by State| date=2012-02-14| accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] Malware is different from defective software, which is a legitimate software but contains harmful bugs that were not corrected before release. However, some malware is disguised as genuine software, and may come from an official company website in the form of a useful or attractive program which has the harmful malware embedded in it along with additional tracking software that gathers marketing statistics.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/story/default.aspx#!10year_malware |title=Evolution of Malware-Malware Trends |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= | work=Microsoft Security Intelligence Report-Featured Articles |accessdate=28 April 2013[/tpl]

==Purposes==

Many early infectious programs, including the first Internet Worm, were written as experiments or pranks. Today, malware is used by both black hat hackers and governments alike primarily to steal sensitive information of personal, financial, or business importance.[tpl]cite web|title=Malware|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0011-malware|publisher=FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION- CONSUMER INFORMATION|accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Pedro|title=Microsoft Vows to Combat Government Cyber-Spying|url=http://www.eweek.com/security/microsoft-vows-to-combat-government-cyber-spying.html|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=15 December 2013[/tpl] 
Malware is sometimes used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather guarded information,[tpl]cite web |last=Kovacs |first=Eduard |title=MiniDuke Malware Used Against European Government Organizations|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/MiniDuke-Malware-Used-Against-European-Government-Organizations-333006.shtml|publisher=Softpedia|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl] or to disrupt their operation in general. However, malware is often used against individuals to gain personal information such as social security numbers, bank or credit card numbers, and so on. Left unguarded, personal and networked computers can be at considerable risk against these threats. (These are most frequently counter-acted by various types of firewalls, anti-virus software, and network hardware).[tpl]cite news|title=South Korea network attack 'a computer virus' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21855051|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=20 March 2013[/tpl]
Since the rise of widespread broadband Internet access, malicious software has more frequently been designed for profit. Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users' computers for black-market exploitation.[tpl]cite web|title=Malware Revolution: A Change in Target|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512596.aspx|date=March 2007[/tpl] Infected "zombie computers" are used to send email spam, to host contraband data such as child pornography,[tpl]cite web|title=Child Porn: Malware's Ultimate Evil|url=http://www.itworld.com/security/84077/child-porn-malwares-ultimate-evil|date=November 2009[/tpl] or to engage in distributed denial-of-service attacks as a form of extortion.PC World - Zombie PCs: Silent, Growing Threat.
Another category of malware has emerged, called spyware. These programs are designed to monitor users' web browsing, display unsolicited advertisements, or redirect affiliate marketing revenues to the spyware creator. Spyware programs do not spread like viruses; instead they are generally installed by exploiting security holes. They can also be packaged together with user-installed software, such as peer-to-peer applications.[tpl]cite web|title=Peer To Peer Information|url=http://oit.ncsu.edu/resnet/p2p|publisher=NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY|accessdate=25 March 2011[/tpl]

The prevalence of malware as a vehicle for Internet crime, along with the challenge of anti-malware software to keep up with the continuous stream of new malware, has seen the adoption of a new mindset for individuals and businesses using the Internet. With the amount of malware currently being distributed, some percentage of computers are currently assumed to be infected. For businesses, especially those that sell mainly over the Internet, this means they need to find a way to operate despite security concerns. The result is a greater emphasis on back-office protection designed to protect against advanced malware operating on customers' computers.[tpl]cite web|title= Continuing Business with Malware Infected Customers|url=http://www.technicalinfo.net/papers/MalwareInfectedCustomers.html|publisher=Gunter Ollmann|date=October 2008[/tpl] A 2013 Webroot study shows that 64% of companies allow remote access to servers for 25% to 100% of their workforce and that companies with more than 25% of their employees accessing servers remotely have higher rates of malware threats.[tpl]cite web|title= New Research Shows Remote Users Expose Companies to Cybercrime|url=http://www.webroot.com/En_US/pr/web-security/ent/new-research-shows-remote-users-expose-companies-to-cybercrime-042313.html|publisher=Webroot|date=April 2013[/tpl]

==Infectious malware: viruses and worms==

The best-known types of malware, viruses and worms, are known for the manner in which they spread, rather than any specific types of behavior. The term computer virus is used for a program that embeds itself in some other executable software (including the operating system itself) on the target system without the users consent and when that is run causes the virus to spread to other executables. On the other hand, a worm is a stand-alone malware program that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected program or operating system for the virus to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/130688/computer-virus |title=computer virus - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013[/tpl]

==Concealment: Viruses, trojan horses, rootkits, and backdoors==

===Viruses===

===Trojan horses===

For a malicious program to accomplish its goals, it must be able to run without being detected, shut down, or deleted. When a malicious program is disguised as something normal or desirable, users may willfully install it without realizing it. This is the technique of the Trojan horse or trojan. In broad terms, a Trojan horse is any program that invites the user to run it, concealing harmful or malicious code. The code may take effect immediately and can lead to many undesirable effects, such as deleting the user's files or installing additional harmful software.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
One of the most common ways that spyware is distributed is as a Trojan horse, bundled with a piece of desirable software that the user downloads from the Internet. When the user installs the software, the spyware is installed along with it. Spyware authors who attempt to act in a legal fashion may include an end-user license agreement that states the behavior of the spyware in loose terms, which users may not read or understand.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Rootkits===

Once a malicious program is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection. Software packages known as rootkits allow this concealment, by modifying the host's operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a malicious process from being visible in the system's list of processes, or keep its files from being read.[tpl]cite web|last=McDowell|first=Mindi|title=Understanding Hidden Threats: Rootkits and Botnets|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST06-001|publisher=US-CERT|accessdate=6 February 2013[/tpl]
Some malicious programs contain routines to defend against removal, not merely to hide themselves. An early example of this behavior is recorded in the Jargon File tale of a pair of programs infesting a Xerox CP-V time sharing system:

===Backdoors===

A backdoor is a method of bypassing normal authentication procedures. Once a system has been compromised, one or more backdoors may be installed in order to allow easier access in the future.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/malware|title=Malware in SpyWareLoop.com|author=  Vincentas |newspaper=Spyware Loop |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl] Backdoors may also be installed prior to malicious software, to allow attackers entry.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The idea has often been suggested that computer manufacturers preinstall backdoors on their systems to provide technical support for customers, but this has never been reliably verified. Recently it came to light that government agencies have been preinstalling backdoors on private computers purchased online.[tpl]cite web|last=Staff|first=SPIEGEL|title=Inside TAO: Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses-powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969-3.html|publisher=SPIEGEL|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl] Backdoors secure remote access to a computer, while attempting to remain hidden from casual inspection.

==Vulnerability to malware==

===Security defects in software===

Malware exploits security defects (security bugs, or vulnerabilities) in the design of the operating system, in applications (such as browsers—avoid using Internet Explorer 8 or earlier, e.g. on Windows XP[tpl]cite web|title=Global Web Browser... Security Trends|publisher=Kaspersky lab|date=Nov 2012|url=http://www.kaspersky.com/images/Kaspersky_Report_Browser_Usage_ENG_Final.pdf[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]), or in vulnerable versions of browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Acrobat / Reader, or Java (see Java SE critical security issues).[tpl]cite web|last=Rashid|first=Fahmida Y.|title=Updated Browsers Still Vulnerable to Attack if Plugins Are Outdated|publisher=pcmag.com|date=Nov 27, 2012|url=http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/none/305385-updated-browsers-still-vulnerable-to-attack-if-plugins-are-outdated[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Danchev|first=Dancho|title=Kaspersky: 12 different vulnerabilities detected on every PC|publisher=pcmag.com|date=Aug 18, 2011|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/kaspersky-12-different-vulnerabilities-detected-on-every-pc/9283[/tpl] Sometimes even installing new versions of such plugins does not automatically uninstall old versions. Security advisories from such companies announce security-related updates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/ |title=Adobe Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe.com |date= |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] Common vulnerabilities are assigned CVE IDs and listed in the US National Vulnerability Database. Secunia PSI[tpl]cite web|last=Rubenking |first=Neil J. |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406767,00.asp |title=Secunia Personal Software Inspector 3.0 Review & Rating |publisher=PCMag.com |date= |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] is an example of software, free for personal use, that will check a PC for vulnerable out-of-date software, and attempt to update it.
Malware authors target bugs, or loopholes, to exploit. A typical example is a buffer-overrun vulnerability, in which an interface designed to store data, in a small area of memory, allows the caller to supply more data than will fit. This extra data then overwrites the interface's own executable structure (past the end of the buffer and other data). In this manner, malware can force the system to execute malicious code, by replacing legitimate code with its own payload of instructions (or data values) copied into live memory, outside the buffer area.

===Insecure design or user error===

Originally, PCs had to be booted from floppy disks. Until recently, it was common for a computer to boot from an external boot device by default. This meant that the computer would, by default, boot from a floppy disk, USB flash drive, or CD—and malicious boot code could be used to install malware or boot into a modified operating system. Autorun or autoplay features may allow code to be automatically executed from a floppy disk, CD-ROM or USB device with or without the user’s permission. Older email software would automatically open HTML email containing malicious JavaScript code; users may also unwarily open (execute) malicious email attachments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Over-privileged users and over-privileged code===

===Use of the same operating system===

==Anti-malware strategies==

As malware attacks become more frequent, attention has begun to shift from viruses and spyware protection, to malware protection, and programs that have been specifically developed to combat malware. (Other preventive and recovery measures, such as backup and recovery methods, are mentioned in the computer virus article).

===Anti-virus and anti-malware software===

A specific component of the anti-virus and anti-malware software commonly referred as the on-access or real-time scanner, hooks deep into the operating system's core or kernel functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate, though with the user's informed permission for protecting the system. Any time the operating system accesses a file, the on-access scanner checks if the file is a 'legitimate' file or not. If the file is considered a malware by the scanner, the access operation will be stopped, the file will be dealt by the scanner in pre-defined way (how the Anti-virus program was configured during/post installation) and the user will be notified. This may considerably slow down the operating system depending on how well the scanner was programmed. The goal is to stop any operations the malware may attempt on the system before they occur, including activities which might exploit bugs or trigger unexpected operating system behavior.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Anti-malware programs can combat malware in two ways:
Real-time protection from malware works identically to real-time antivirus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent malware. In some cases, it may also intercept attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Because many malware components are installed as a result of browser exploits or user error, using security software (some of which are anti-malware, though many are not) to "sandbox" browsers (essentially isolate the browser from the computer and hence any malware induced change) can also be effective in helping to restrict any damage done.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Examples of Microsoft Windows anti virus and anti-malware software include the optional Microsoft Security Essentials[tpl]cite web | title=Microsoft Security Essentials | url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials | publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl] (for Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8) for real-time protection, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool[tpl]cite web | title=Malicious Software Removal Tool | url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl] (now included with Windows (Security) Updates on "Patch Tuesday", the second Tuesday of each month), and Windows Defender (an optional download in the case of Windows XP).[tpl]cite web | title=Windows Defender | url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012[/tpl] Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use).[tpl]cite web|last=Rubenking|first=Neil J.|title=The Best Free Antivirus for 2014|publisher=pcmag.com|date=January 8, 2014|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388652,00.asp[/tpl] Tests found some free programs to be competitive with commercial ones. Microsoft's System File Checker can be used to check for and repair corrupted system files.
Some viruses disable System Restore and other important Windows tools such as Task Manager and Command Prompt. Many such viruses can be removed by rebooting the computer, entering Windows safe mode with networking,[tpl]cite web|title=How do I remove a computer virus?| url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/how-do-I-remove-a-computer-virus  |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl] and then using system tools or Microsoft Safety Scanner.[tpl]cite web| title=Microsoft Safety Scanner| url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl]
Currently, no method is known for detecting hardware implants. 

====Known good====

Typical malware products detect issues based on heuristics or signatures – i.e., based on information that can be assessed to be bad.  Some products[tpl]cite web|title=Glasswall|url=http://www.glasswallsolutions.com/how-it-works/|publisher=Glasswall[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Nexor Merlin|url=http://www.nexor.com/product-datasheets/nexor-merlin|publisher=Nexor[/tpl] take an alternative approach when scanning documents such as Word and PDF, by regenerating a new, clean file, based on what is known to be good from schema definitions of the file (a patent for this approach exists).[tpl]cite web|title=RESISTING THE SPREAD OF UNWANTED CODE AND DATA|url=http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20120278894|publisher=patentdocs[/tpl]

===Website security scans===

As malware also harms the compromised websites (by breaking reputation, blacklisting in search engines, etc.), some websites offer vulnerability scanning.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unmaskparasites.com/ |title=An example of a website vulnerability scanner |publisher=Unmaskparasites.com |date= |accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://aw-snap.info/file-viewer/ |title=Redleg's File Viewer.

Such scans check the website, detect malware, may note outdated software, and may report known security issues.

===Eliminating over-privileged code===

Over-privileged code dates from the time when most programs were either delivered with a computer or written in-house, and repairing it would serve to render most antivirus software essentially redundant. It would, however, have appreciable consequences for the user interface and system management.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The system would have to maintain privilege profiles, and know which to apply for each user and program.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
In the case of newly installed software, an administrator would need to set up default profiles for the new code.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Eliminating vulnerability to rogue device drivers is probably harder than for arbitrary rogue executable. Two techniques, used in VMS, that can help are memory mapping only the registers of the device in question and a system interface associating the driver with interrupts from the device.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Other approaches are[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]:
Such approaches, however, if not fully integrated with the operating system, would reduplicate effort and not be universally applied, both of which would be detrimental to security.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Grayware==

Grayware is a general term that refers to applications or files that are not directly classified as malware (like worms or trojan horses), but can still negatively affect the performance of computers and involve significant security risks.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/grayware|title=Grayware in SpyWareLoop.com|author=  Vincentas |newspaper=Spyware Loop |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2013[/tpl]
It describes applications that behave in an annoying or undesirable manner, and yet are less serious or troublesome than malware. Grayware encompasses spyware, adware, dialers, joke programs, remote access tools and any other program apart from a virus, that is designed to harm the performance of computers. The term is in use since around 2004.[tpl]cite web|title=Threat Encyclopedia - Generic Grayware|url=http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/us/archive/grayware/GENERIC_GRAYWARE|publisher=Trend Micro|accessdate=27 November 2012[/tpl]
Another term, PUP, which stands for Potentially Unwanted Program (or PUA Potentially Unwanted Application),[tpl]cite web|title=Rating the best anti-malware solutions|url=http://arstechnica.com/security/2009/12/av-comparatives-picks-eight-antipua-winners/|publisher=Arstechnica|accessdate=28 January 2014[/tpl] refers to applications that would be considered unwanted despite having been downloaded by the user (users may fail to read a download agreement). PUPs include spyware, adware, and dialers.

==History of viruses and worms==

Before Internet access became widespread, viruses spread on personal computers by infecting the executable boot sectors of floppy disks. By inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these executables, a virus causes itself to be run whenever a program is run or the disk is booted. Early computer viruses were written for the Apple II and Macintosh, but they became more widespread with the dominance of the IBM PC and MS-DOS system. Executable-infecting viruses are dependent on users exchanging software or boot-able floppies and thumb drives so they spread rapidly in computer hobbyist circles.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
The first worms, network-borne infectious programs, originated not on personal computers, but on multitasking Unix systems. The first well-known worm was the Internet Worm of 1988, which infected SunOS and VAX BSD systems. Unlike a virus, this worm did not insert itself into other programs. Instead, it exploited security holes (vulnerabilities) in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process. This same behavior is used by today's worms as well.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
With the rise of the Microsoft Windows platform in the 1990s, and the flexible macros of its applications, it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of Microsoft Word and similar programs. These macro viruses infect documents and templates rather than applications (executables), but rely on the fact that macros in a Word document are a form of executable code.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Today, worms are most commonly written for the Windows OS, although a few like Mare-D[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/20/linux_worm/ |title= Linux worm targets PHP flaw |author= Nick Farrell |date= 20 February 2006 |work= The Register|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl] and the Lion worm[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/03/28/highly_destructive_linux_worm_mutating/|title= Highly destructive Linux worm mutating |author= John Leyden |date= March 28, 2001 |work= The Register|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl] are also written for Linux and Unix systems. Worms today work in the same basic way as 1988's Internet Worm: they scan the network and use vulnerable computers to replicate. Because they need no human intervention, worms can spread with incredible speed. The SQL Slammer infected thousands of computers in a few minutes.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2720337.stm |title= Aggressive net bug makes history|date= February 3, 2003 |work= BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2010[/tpl]

==Academic research==

The notion of a self-reproducing computer program can be traced back to initial theories about the operation of complex automata.John von Neumann, "Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata", Part 1: Transcripts of lectures given at the University of Illinois, December 1949, Editor: A. W. Burks, University of Illinois, USA, 1966. John von Neumann showed that in theory a program could reproduce itself. This constituted a plausibility result in computability theory. Fred Cohen experimented with computer viruses and confirmed Neumann's postulate and investigated other properties of malware such as detectability, self-obfuscation using rudimentary encryption, and others. His Doctoral dissertation was on the subject of computer viruses.Fred Cohen, "Computer Viruses", PhD Thesis, University of Southern California, ASP Press, 1988.
