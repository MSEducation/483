[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]]

CATEGORIES: Anterior pituitary hormones, Peptide hormones

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), also known as corticotropin, is a polypeptide tropic hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It is an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is often produced in response to biological stress (along with its precursor corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus). Its principal effects are increased production and release of corticosteroids. Primary adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison's disease, occurs when adrenal gland production of cortisol is chronically deficient, resulting in chronically elevated ACTH levels; when a pituitary tumor is the cause of elevated ACTH (from the anterior pituitary) this is known as Cushing's Disease and the constellation of signs and symptoms of the excess cortisol (hypercortisolism) is known as  Cushing's syndrome. A deficiency of ACTH is a cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. ACTH is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.[tpl]Cite journal|last1= Dibner|first1= Charna|last2= Schibler|first2= Ueli|last3= Albrecht|first3= Urs|title= The Mammalian Circadian Timing System: Organization and Coordination of Central and Peripheral Clocks| journal= Annual Review of Physiology|volume= 72|year= 2010|pages= 517–549|doi= 10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135821|pmid=20148687|postscript= [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

==Production and regulation==

POMC, ACTH and β-lipotropin are secreted from corticotropes in the anterior lobe (or adenohypophysis) of the pituitary gland in response to the hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) released by the hypothalamus.[tpl]cite web |title=Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) |url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/hypopit/acth.html[/tpl] ACTH is synthesized from pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC). The removal of the signal peptide during translation produces the 241-amino acid polypeptide POMC, which undergoes a series of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation before it is proteolytically cleaved by endopeptidases to yield various polypeptide fragments with varying physiological activity. These fragments include:[tpl]cite web|title=Pro-opiomelocortin precursor|url=http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01189|accessdate=8 April 2013[/tpl]
In order to regulate the secretion of ACTH, many substances secreted within this axis exhibit slow/intermediate and fast feedback-loop activity. Glucocorticoids secreted from the adrenal cortex work to inhibit CRH secretion by the hypothalamus, which in turn decreases anterior pituitary secretion of ACTH. Glucocorticoids may also inhibit the rates of POMC gene transcription and peptide synthesis. The latter is an example of a slow feedback loop, which works on the order of hours to days, whereas the former works on the order of minutes.
The half-life of ACTH in human blood is about ten minutes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Yalow RS, Glick SM, Roth J, Berson SA | title = Radioimmunoassay of human plasma ACTH | journal = J. Clin.

==Structure==

ACTH consists of 39 amino acids, the first 13 of which (counting from the N-terminus) may be cleaved to form α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). (This common structure is responsible for excessively tanned skin in Addison's disease.) After a short period of time, ACTH is cleaved into α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and CLIP, a peptide with unknown activity in humans.
Human ACTH has a molecular weight of 4,540 atomic mass units (Da).PROOPIOMELANOCORTIN; NCBI --> POMC Retrieved on September 28, 2009

==Function==

ACTH stimulates secretion of glucocorticoid steroid hormones from adrenal cortex cells, especially in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal glands. ACTH acts by binding to cell surface ACTH receptors, which are located primarily on adrenocortical cells of the adrenal cortex. The ACTH receptor is a seven-membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor.[tpl]cite journal | author = Raikhinstein M, Zohar M, Hanukoglu I | title = cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta | volume = 1220 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–32 |date=February 1994 | pmid = 8305507 | doi =10.1016/0167-4889(94)90157-0 [/tpl] Upon ligand binding, the receptor undergoes conformation changes that stimulate the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP[tpl]cite journal | author = Hanukoglu I, Feuchtwanger R, Hanukoglu A | title = Mechanism of corticotropin and cAMP induction of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 system enzymes in adrenal cortex cells | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 265 | issue = 33 | pages = 20602–8 |date=November 1990 | pmid = 2173715 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/265/33/20602.full.pdf [/tpl] and subsequent activation of protein kinase A.
ACTH influences steroid hormone secretion by both rapid short-term mechanisms that take place within minutes and slower long-term actions. The rapid actions of ACTH include stimulation of cholesterol delivery to the mitochondria where the P450scc enzyme is located. P450scc catalyzes the first step of steroidogenesis that is cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol. 
ACTH also stimulates lipoprotein uptake into cortical cells. This increases the bio-availability of cholesterol in the cells of the adrenal cortex.
The long term actions of ACTH include stimulation of the transcription of the genes coding for steroidogenic enzymes, especially P450scc, steroid 11β-hydroxylase, and their associated electron transfer proteins. This effect is observed over several hours.
In addition to steroidogenic enzymes, ACTH also enhances transcription of mitochondrial genes that encode for subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation systems.[tpl]cite journal |author1=Raikhinstein M, Hanukoglu I | title = Mitochondrial-genome-encoded RNAs: differential regulation by corticotropin in bovine adrenocortical cells | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 90 | issue = 22 | pages = 10509–13 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 7504267 | pmc = 47806 | doi =10.1073/pnas.90.22.10509 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...9010509R |last2=Hanukoglu |first2=I.[/tpl] These actions are probably necessary to supply the enhanced energy needs of adrenocortical cells stimulated by ACTH.

==ACTH receptors outside of the adrenal gland==

As indicated above, ACTH is a cleavage product of the pro-hormone, proopiomelanocortin, which also produces other hormones including α-MSH that stimulates the production of melanin. A family of related receptors mediates the actions of these hormones, the MCR, or melanocortin receptor family. These are mainly not associated with the pituitary-adrenal axis. MC2R is the ACTH receptor. While it has a crucial function in regulating the adrenal, it is also expressed elsewhere in the body, specifically in the osteoblast, which is responsible for making new bone, a continual and highly regulated process in the bodies of air-breathing vertebrates.[tpl]cite journal | author = Isales CM, Zaidi M, Blair HC | title = ACTH is a novel regulator of bone mass | journal = Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. | volume = 1192 | issue = | pages = 110–6 |date=March 2010 | pmid = 20392225 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.05231.x [/tpl] The functional expression of MC2R on the osteoblast was discovered by Isales et alia in 2005.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zhong Q, Sridhar S, Ruan L, Ding KH, Xie D, Insogna K, Kang B, Xu J, Bollag RJ, Isales CM | title = Multiple melanocortin receptors are expressed in bone cells | journal = Bone | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 820–31 |date=May 2005 | pmid = 15804492 | doi = 10.1016/j.bone.2005.01.020 [/tpl] Since that time, it has been demonstrated that the response of bone forming cells to ACTH includes production of VEGF, as it does in the adrenal. This response might be important in maintaining osteoblast survival under some conditions.[tpl]cite journal | author = Zaidi M, Sun L, Robinson LJ, Tourkova IL, Liu L, Wang Y, Zhu LL, Liu X, Li J, Peng Y, Yang G, Shi X, Levine A, Iqbal J, Yaroslavskiy BB, Isales C, Blair HC | title = ACTH protects against glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of bone | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 107 | issue = 19 | pages = 8782–7 |date=May 2010 | pmid = 20421485 | pmc = 2889316 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0912176107 [/tpl] If this is physiologically important, it probably functions in conditions with short-period or intermittent ACTH signaling, since with continual exposure of osteoblasts to ACTH, the effect was lost in a few hours.

==Synthetic ACTH==

An active synthetic form of ACTH, consisting of the first 24 amino acids of native ACTH, was first synthesized by Klaus Hofmann at the University of Pittsburgh.[tpl]cite web |title=Simulated ACTH |work=Time|date=December 12, 1960 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871916,00.html[/tpl]
ACTH is available as a synthetic derivative in the forms of cosyntropin, tradename Cortrosyn, and Synacthen (synthetic ACTH).  Synacthen is not FDA approved but is used in the UK and Australia to conduct the ACTH stimulation test.
ACTH was first synthesized as a replacement for Acthar Gel, a long-lasting animal product used to treat infantile spasms. Once relatively inexpensive, Acthar Gel is currently an extremely expensive pharmaceutical product. Prices per vial have been as high as $36,000.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gettig J, Cummings JP, Matuszewski K | title = H.P.
