Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, KG, KB, PC (26 August 1676 – 18 March 1745), known before 1742 as Sir Robert Walpole, was a British statesman who is generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Although the position of "Prime Minister" had no recognition in law or official use at the time, Walpole is nevertheless acknowledged as having held the office de facto because of his influence within the Ministry.
A Whig who was first elected to parliament in 1701, Walpole served during the reigns of George I and George II. Some sources date his tenure as "Prime Minister" from 1730 when, with the retirement of Lord Townshend, he became the sole and undisputed leader of the Cabinet. But his premiership is normally dated from 1721, when he became First Lord of the Treasury; this was generally upheld by the contemporary press, most notably that of the opposition, who focused far more attention on Walpole than on Townshend. Walpole continued to govern until 1742; he was not only the first but also the longest serving Prime Minister in British history.

==Early life==

Walpole was born in Houghton Hall, Norfolk, in 1676. One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of Robert Walpole, a Whig politician who represented the borough of Castle Rising in the House of Commons, and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of Rougham, Suffolk.  Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole was his younger brother.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178–179[/tpl]

==Education==

As a child, Walpole attended a private school at Massingham, Norfolk.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179[/tpl] Walpole entered Eton College in 1690[tpl]sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R[/tpl] where he was considered "an excellent scholar". He left Eton on 2 April 1696[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179[/tpl] and matriculated at King's College, Cambridge on the same day.[tpl]sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R[/tpl] On 25 May 1698 he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir. Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea. In November 1700 his father died, and Walpole succeeded to the estate. A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180[/tpl]

==Early political career==

Walpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won the general election in Castle Rising. He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of King's Lynn, a pocket borough that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180[/tpl]
Like his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the Whig Party.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181[/tpl] In 1705, Walpole was appointed by Queen Anne to be a member of the council for her husband, Prince George of Denmark, Lord High Admiral.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=181[/tpl][tpl]Citation |last=Mortimer |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mortimer (writer) |title=The British Plutarch: Containing the Lives of the Most Eminent Statesmen, Patriots, Divines, Warriors, Philosophers, Poets, and Artists, of Great Britain and Ireland, from the Accession of Henry VIII. to the Present Time. Including a Complete History of England from that Area |year=1791|publisher=C. Dilly |page=26[/tpl] After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders. His abilities were recognised by Lord Godolphin (the Lord High Treasurer and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of Secretary at War in 1708;[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=181[/tpl] for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of Treasurer of the Navy.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=182[/tpl]
Despite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell, a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons. The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the Sacheverell riots, and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710. The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory Robert Harley,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711.[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=182[/tpl] cites Dartmouth MSS. p. 303 Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=182–183[/tpl] He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
In 1712, Walpole was accused of venality and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland. Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced "guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption".[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183[/tpl] He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the House of Lords; he was then imprisoned in the Tower of London for six months and expelled from Parliament. While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders. After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir Richard Steele in crafting political pamphlets. Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183[/tpl]

==Stanhope–Sunderland Ministry==

Queen Anne died in 1714. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by a distant German cousin, George I. George I distrusted the Tories, who he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne. The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Robert Walpole became a Privy Councillor and rose[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] to the position of Paymaster of the Forces[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184[/tpl] in a Cabinet nominally led by Lord Halifax, but actually dominated by Lord Townshend (Walpole's brother-in-law) and James Stanhope.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715. Lord Oxford was impeached, and Lord Bolingbroke suffered from an act of attainder.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184[/tpl]
Lord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Walpole was appointed to the posts of First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer; in this position, he introduced the sinking fund, a device to reduce the national debt.[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|pp=184, 186[/tpl]. The Cabinet of which he was a member was often divided over most important issues. Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and Lord Sunderland on the other.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] The Stanhope-Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] In 1716 Townshend was removed from the important post of Northern Secretary and put in the lesser[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185[/tpl] Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185[/tpl] On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition "because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on",[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185[/tpl] cites Parl. Hist. vii. 460; 9 May 1717. and by joining the opposition he did not intend "to make the king uneasy or to embarrass his affairs."[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185[/tpl] cites Parl. Hist.  vii. 449, 16 April 1717.  In the new Cabinet, Sunderland and Stanhope (who was created an Earl) were the effective heads.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Soon after Walpole's resignation, a bitter family quarrel between the King and the Prince of Wales split the Royal Family. Walpole and others who opposed the Government often congregated at Leicester House, the home of the Prince of Wales, to form political plans.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Walpole also became an adviser and close friend of the Prince of Wales's wife, Caroline.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] In 1720 he improved his position by bringing about a reconciliation between the Prince of Wales and the King.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Walpole continued to be an influential figure in the House of Commons.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] He was especially active in opposing one of the Government's more significant proposals, the Peerage Bill, which would have limited the power of the monarch to create new peerages.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=186[/tpl] Walpole brought about a temporary abandonment of the bill in 1719[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] and the outright rejection of the bill by the House of Commons.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] This defeat led Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland to reconcile with their opponents;[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Walpole returned as Paymaster of the Forces[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] and Townshend was appointed Lord President of the Council. By accepting the position of Paymaster, however, Walpole lost the favour of the Prince of Wales (the future King George II) who still harboured disdain for his father's Government.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Rise to power==

Soon after Walpole returned to the Cabinet, Britain was swept by a wave of over-enthusiastic speculation which led to the South Sea Bubble.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] The Government had established a plan whereby the South Sea Company would assume the national debt of Great Britain in exchange for lucrative bonds. It was widely believed that the Company would eventually reap an enormous profit through international trade in cloth, agricultural goods, and slaves.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Many in the country, including Walpole himself (who sold at the top of the market and made 1,000 percent profit), frenziedly invested in the company. By the latter part of 1720, however, the company had begun to collapse as the price of its shares plunged.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Walpole sold his shares at the top of the market.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl]
In 1721 a committee investigated[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] the scandal, finding that there was corruption on the part of many in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were John Aislabie[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), James Craggs the Elder (the Postmaster General), James Craggs the Younger (the Southern Secretary), and even Lords Stanhope and Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry). Both Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption. Aislabie was found guilty and imprisoned, but the personal influence of Walpole saved both Stanhope and Sunderland. For his role in preventing these individuals and others from being punished,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Walpole gained the nickname of "The Screen",[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] cites Coxe, ii. 216. or "Screenmaster-General".[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The resignation of Sunderland and the death of Stanhope in 1721 left Walpole as the most important figure in the administration.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] In April 1721 he was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Walpole's de facto tenure as "Prime Minister" is often dated to his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury in 1721.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] His brother-in-law Lord Townshend, served as Secretary of State[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] for the Northern Department and controlled the nation's foreign affairs. The two also had to contend with the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Lord Carteret.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Townshend and Walpole were thus restored to power and "annihilated the opposing faction".[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl]

==Premiership under George I==

Under the guidance of Walpole, Parliament attempted to deal with the financial crisis brought on by the South Sea Bubble. The estates of the directors of the South Sea Company were used to relieve the suffering of the victims, and the stock of the company was divided between the Bank of England and East India Company.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187[/tpl] The crisis had significantly damaged the credibility of the King and of the Whig Party, but Walpole defended both with skilful oratory in the House of Commons.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
Walpole's first year as Prime Minister was also marked by the discovery of a plot formed by Francis Atterbury, the Bishop of Rochester.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=188[/tpl] The exposure of the scheme crushed the hopes of the Jacobites whose previous attempts at rebellion (most notably the risings of 1715 and 1719) had also failed. The Tory Party was equally unfortunate even though Lord Bolingbroke, a Tory leader who fled to France to avoid punishment for his Jacobite sympathies, was permitted to return to Britain in 1723.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
During the remainder of George I's reign, Walpole's ascendancy continued; the political power of the monarch was gradually diminishing and that of his ministers gradually increasing.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] In 1724 the primary political rival of Walpole and Townshend in the Cabinet, Lord Carteret, was dismissed from the post of Southern Secretary and once again appointed to the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In Ireland, Lord Carteret used his power to secretly aid in the controversy over Wood's Halfpence and support Drapier's Letters behind the scenes and cause harm to Walpole's power.[tpl]citation |title=Jonathan Swift and Ireland |first=Oliver W. |last=Ferguson[/tpl][tpl]full|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]citation |title=Jonathan Swift |volume=III |first=Irvin |last=Ehrenpreis[/tpl][tpl]full|date=March 2014[/tpl] Walpole was able to recover from these events by removing the patent.  However, Irish sentiment was situated against the English control.[tpl]Citation|title=Memoirs of the Life and Administration of Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford |first=William |last=Coxe |year=1978|pages=[tpl]page needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] [/tpl]
Townshend, working with the king, helped keep Great Britain at peace, especially by negotiating a treaty with France and Prussia in 1725. Walpole was not consulted and stated that Townshend was "too precipitate" in his actions.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190[/tpl] Great Britain, free from Jacobite threats, from war, and from financial crises, grew prosperous, and Robert Walpole acquired the favour of George I.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] In 1725 he persuaded the king to revive the Knight of the Bath,[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190[/tpl] and in 1726 a Knight of the Garter,[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] earning him the nickname "Sir Bluestring".[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190[/tpl] Moreover, his eldest son was granted a barony.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Premiership under George II==

Walpole's position was threatened in 1727 when George I died and was succeeded by George II. For a few days it seemed that Walpole would be dismissed but, on the advice of Queen Caroline, the King agreed to keep him in office. Although the King disliked Townshend, he retained him as well. Over the next years Walpole continued to share power with Townshend but the two clashed over British foreign affairs, especially over policy regarding Austria. Gradually Walpole became the clearly dominant partner in government. His colleague retired on 15 May 1730 and this date is sometimes given as the beginning of Walpole's unofficial tenure as Prime Minister. Townsend's departure enabled Walpole to conclude the Treaty of Vienna, creating the Anglo-Austrian alliance.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Opposition===

Walpole, a polarising figure, had many opponents, the most important of whom were in the Country Party, such as Lord Bolingbroke (who had been his political enemy since the days of Queen Anne)[tpl]citation |first=Isaac |last=Kramnick |title=Bolingbroke and His Circle: The Politics of Nostalgia in the Age of Walpole |year=1992[/tpl][tpl]full|date=March 2014[/tpl] and William Pulteney (a capable Whig statesman who felt snubbed when Walpole failed to include him in the Cabinet).[tpl]cite ODNB |first=Stuart |last=Handley |first2=M. J. |last2=Rowe |first3=W. H. |last3=McBryde |title=Pulteney, William, earl of Bath (1684–1764) |date= October 2007 |id=22889 |separator=, |postscript=none[/tpl] Bolingbroke and Pulteney ran a periodical called The Craftsman in which they incessantly denounced the Prime Minister's policies.[tpl]Citation |first=Simon |last=Varey |title=The Craftsman |journal=Prose Studies |date=April 1993 |volume= 16 |issue=1 |pages=58–77[/tpl] Walpole was also satirised and parodied extensively; he was often compared to the criminal Jonathan Wild as, for example, John Gay did in his farcical Beggar's Opera. Walpole's other enemies included Jonathan Swift,[tpl]citation |first=J. A. |last=Downie |title=Jonathan Swift: Political Writer |year= 1986 |pages=[tpl]page needed|date=March 2014[/tpl][/tpl] Alexander Pope, Henry Fielding, and Dr Samuel Johnson.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

===Support===

Despite such opposition, Walpole secured the support of the people and of the House of Commons with a policy of avoiding war which, in turn, allowed him to impose low taxes.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] He used his influence to prevent George II from entering a European conflict in 1733 when the War of the Polish Succession broke out.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=194–195[/tpl] In the same year, however, his influence was seriously threatened by a taxation scheme he introduced.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] The revenue of the country had been severely diminished by smugglers so Walpole proposed that the tariff on wine and tobacco be replaced by an excise tax. To countervail the threat of smuggling, the tax was to be collected not at ports but at warehouses. This new proposal, however, was extremely unpopular and aroused the opposition of the nation's merchants.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=194[/tpl] Walpole agreed to withdraw the bill before Parliament voted on it,[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=194[/tpl] but he dismissed the politicians who had dared to oppose it in the first place. Thus, Walpole lost a considerable element of his Whig Party to the Opposition.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
After the general elections of 1734, Walpole's supporters still formed a majority in the House of Commons although they were less numerous than before. Though he maintained his parliamentary supremacy, his popularity began to wane.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=195–196[/tpl] In 1736 an increase in the tax on gin inspired riots in London. The even more serious Porteous Riots broke out in Edinburgh after the King pardoned a captain of the guard (John Porteous) who had commanded his troops to shoot a group of protesters. Though these events diminished Walpole's popularity,[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=195–196[/tpl] they failed to shake his majority in Parliament. Walpole's domination over the House of Commons was highlighted by the ease with which he secured the rejection of Sir John Barnard's plan to reduce the interest on the national debt. Walpole was also able to persuade Parliament to pass the Licensing Act of 1737 under which London theatres were regulated.[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|pp=195–196[/tpl] 10 Geo. II, c. 28. The Act revealed a disdain for Swift, Pope, Fielding, and other literary figures who had attacked his government in their works.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
While the "country party" attacked Walpole relentlessly, he subsidised writers who spoke up in his behalf. William Arnall and others defended Walpole from the charge of evil political corruption by arguing that corruption is the universal human condition. Furthermore, they argued, political divisiveness was also universal and inevitable because of selfish passions that were integral to human nature. Arnall argued that government must be strong enough to control conflict, and in that regard Walpole was quite successful. This style of "court" political rhetoric continued through the 18th century.[tpl]Citation |first=Thomas |last=Horne |title=Politics in a Corrupt Society: William Arnall's Defense of Robert Walpole |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=41 |number=4 |date=October–December 1980 |pages=601–614 |jstor=2709276[/tpl]

==Decline==

The year 1737 was saw the death of Walpole's close friend Queen Caroline. Though her death did not end his personal influence with George II, who had grown loyal to the Prime Minister during the preceding years, Walpole's domination of government continued to decline. His opponents acquired a vocal leader in the Prince of Wales who was estranged from his father, the King. Several young politicians including William Pitt the Elder and George Grenville formed a faction known as the "Patriot Boys" and joined the Prince of Wales in opposition.[tpl]Citation|first=Keith |last=Laybourn |year=2001 |title=British Political Leaders: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=319–20[/tpl]
Walpole's failure to maintain a policy of avoiding military conflict eventually led to his fall from power.[tpl]Citation |first=J.H. |last=Plumb |year=1960 |title=Sir Robert Walpole; the Making of a Statesman: The King's Minister|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=brYNAQAAMAAJ |publisher=Cresset Press |page=[tpl]page needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] [/tpl] Under the Treaty of Seville (1729), Great Britain agreed not to trade with the Spanish colonies in North America. Spain claimed the right to board and search British vessels to ensure compliance with this provision. Disputes, however, broke out over trade with the West Indies. Walpole attempted to prevent war but was opposed by the King, the House of Commons, and by a faction in his own Cabinet. In 1739 Walpole abandoned all efforts to stop the conflict and commenced the War of Jenkins' Ear (so called because Robert Jenkins, a Welsh mariner, claimed that a Spaniard inspecting his vessel had severed his ear).
Walpole's influence continued to dramatically decline even after the war began. In the 1741 general election his supporters secured an increase in votes in constituencies that were decided by mass electorates but failed to win in many pocket boroughs (constituencies subject to the informal but strong influence of patrons). In general the government made gains in England and Wales but this was not enough to overturn the reverses of the 1734 election and further losses in Cornwall where many constituencies were obedient to the will of the Prince of Wales (who was also Duke of Cornwall). These constituencies returned members of parliament hostile to the Prime Minister. Similarly, the influence of the Duke of Argyll secured the election of members opposed to Walpole in some parts of Scotland. Walpole's new majority was difficult to determine because of the uncertain loyalties of many new members, but contemporaries and historians estimated it as low as fourteen to eighteen.[tpl]Citation |last=Speck|first=W. A.  |year=1977 |title=Stability and Strife: England, 1714-1760 |publisher=Harvard UP|pages=235–38[/tpl]
In the new Parliament, many Whigs thought the ageing Prime Minister incapable of leading the military campaign. Moreover, his majority was not as strong as it used to be, his detractors being approximately as numerous as his supporters. In 1742 when the House of Commons was prepared to determine the validity of an allegedly rigged by-election in Chippenham, Walpole and others agreed to treat the issue as a Motion of No Confidence. As Walpole was defeated on the vote, he agreed to resign from the Government. The news of the naval disaster against Spain in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias also prompted the end of his political career. As part of his resignation the King agreed to elevate him to the House of Lords as the Earl of Orford and this occurred on 6 February 1742. Five days later he formally relinquished the seals of office.[tpl]Citation |first=Paul |last=Langford  |year=1998 |title=A Polite and Commercial People: England, 1727-1783 |publisher=Oxford University Press|page=56[/tpl]

==Later years==

Lord Orford was succeeded as Prime Minister by Lord Wilmington in an administration whose true head was Lord Carteret. A committee was created to inquire into Walpole's ministry but no substantial evidence of wrongdoing or corruption was discovered. Though no longer a member of the Cabinet, Lord Orford continued to maintain personal influence with George II and was often dubbed the "Minister behind the Curtain" for this advice and influence. In 1744 he managed to secure the dismissal of Carteret and the appointment of Henry Pelham whom he regarded as a political protégé. He advised Pelham to make use of his seat in the Commons to serve as a bridge between the King and Parliament, just as Walpole had done.[tpl]sfn|Browning|1975|p=117[/tpl][tpl]citation |first=Jonathan |last=Aotes |title=Sir Robert Walpole after his Fall from Power, 1742–1745 |journal=History |date=April 2006 |volume=91 |issue=302 |pages=218–230[/tpl]
His health, never good, deteriorated rapidly toward the end of 1744; Lord Orford died in London in 1745, aged nearly sixty-nine years; he was buried in the parish church of his home estate at Houghton, Norfolk. His earldom passed to his eldest son Robert who was in turn succeeded by his only son George. Upon the death of the third Earl, the Earldom was inherited by the first Earl's younger son Horace Walpole (a famous writer and friend of poet Thomas Gray), who died without heirs in 1797.

==Legacy==

Walpole's influence on the politics of his day was tremendous. The Tories became a minor, insignificant faction, and the Whigs became a dominant and largely unopposed party. His influence on the development of the uncodified constitution of Great Britain was less momentous even though he is regarded as Great Britain's first Prime Minister. He relied primarily on the favour of the King rather than on the support of the House of Commons. His power stemmed from his personal influence instead of the influence of his office. Most of his immediate successors were, comparatively speaking, extremely weak; it would take several decades more for the premiership to develop into the most powerful and most important office in the country.
Walpole's strategy of keeping Great Britain at peace contributed greatly to the country's prosperity. Walpole also managed to secure the position of the Hanoverian Dynasty, and effectively countervailed Jacobitism. The Jacobite threat was ended, soon after Walpole's term ended, by the defeat of the rebellion of 1745. Later in the century, the Whig MP Edmund Burke "admitted him into the whig pantheon".[tpl]cite ODNB|last= Taylor |first=Stephen |id=28601 |title=Walpole,  Robert, first earl of Orford  (1676–1745)] |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008 |separator=, |postscript=none[/tpl] Burke wrote:
[tpl]quote|He was an honorable man and a sound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and discontented Whigs of his time have represented him, and as ill-informed people still represent him, a prodigal and corrupt minister. They charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him, perhaps, than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time. He gained over very few from the Opposition. Without being a genius of the first class, he was an intelligent, prudent, and safe minister. He loved peace; and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs...With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were superficial. A careless, coarse, and over familiar style of discourse, without sufficient regard to persons or occasions, and an almost total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was most hurt in the public opinion: and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him. But justice must be done. The prudence, steadiness, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics, preserved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and liberties to this country.[tpl]citation |last=Burke |first=Edmund  |title=An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs |publisher=The Library of Liberal Arts |year=1962|pages=62–63[/tpl][/tpl]
Lord Chesterfield was sceptical whether "an impartial Character of Sr Robert Walpole, will or can be transmitted to Posterity, for he governed this Kingdom so long that the various passions of Mankind mingled, and in a manner incorporated themselves, with every thing that was said or writt concerning him. Never was Man more flattered nor more abused, and his long power, was probably the chief cause of both".[tpl]sfn|Franklin|1993|p=114[/tpl] Chesterfield claimed he was "much acquainted with him both in his publick and his private life":
[tpl]quote|In private life he was good natured, Chearfull, social. Inelegant in his manners, loose in his morals. He had a coarse wit, which he was too free of for a Man in his Station, as it is always inconsistent with dignity. He was very able as a Minister, but without a certain Elevation of mind...He was both the ablest Parliament man, and the ablest manager of a Parliament, that I believe ever lived...Money, not Prerogative, was the chief Engine of his administration, and he employed it with a success that in a manner disgraced humanity...When he found any body proof, against pecuniary temptations, which alass! was but seldom, he had recourse to still a worse art. For he laughed at and ridiculed all notions of Publick virtue, and the love of one's Country, calling them the Chimerical school boy flights of Classical learning; declaring himself at the same time, No Saint, no Spartan, no reformer. He would frequently ask young fellows at their first appearance in the world, while their honest hearts were yet untainted, well are you to be an old Roman? a Patriot? you will soon come off of that, and grow wiser. And thus he was more dangerous to the morals, than to the libertys of his country, to which I am persuaded that he meaned no ill in his heart...His Name will not be recorded in History among the best men, or the best Ministers, but much much less ought it to be ranked among the worst.[tpl]sfn|Franklin|1993|pp=114–115[/tpl] [/tpl]
Another part of Walpole's legacy is 10 Downing Street. George II offered this home to Walpole as a personal gift in 1732 but Walpole accepted it only as the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury, taking up his residence there on 22 September 1735. His immediate successors did not always reside in Number 10 (preferring their larger private residences) but the home has nevertheless become established as the official residence of the Prime Minister (in his or her capacity as First Lord of the Treasury).[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Walpole is immortalised in St Stephen's Hall, where he and other notable Parliamentarians look on at visitors to Parliament.parliament.uk: "Architecture of the Palace - St Stephen's Hall"
Walpole built as his country seat Houghton Hall in Norfolk.
Walpole also left behind a famous collection of art which he had assembled during his career. Many of the works in this collection were sold by his grandson, the 3rd Earl of Orford, to the Russian Empress Catherine II in 1779. This collection—which was regarded as one of the finest in Europe—now lies in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. in 2013 the collection was lent by The Hermitage to Houghton for display following the original William Kent hanging plan, recently discovered at Houghton.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]

On 30 July 1700, Walpole married Catherine, daughter of John Shorter of Bybrook in Ashford, Kent.

===Maria Skerritt===

Prior to the death of his first wife, Walpole took on a mistress, Maria, daughter of Thomas Skerrett (died 1734; an Irish merchant living in Dover Street, London).[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=205[/tpl] cites Gent.

She was a fashionable socialite of wit and beauty, with an independent fortune of £30,000.[tpl]harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=205[/tpl] cites Bishop Hare to F. Naylor, 9 March 1738, Hare MSS. p. 238).

Walpole considered her "indispensable to his happiness", and her loss plunged him into a "deplorable and comfortless condition", which ended in a severe illness.[tpl]sfn|Leadam|1899|p=205–206[/tpl]
