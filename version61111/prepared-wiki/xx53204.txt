[[Coxsackie B4 virus]]

CATEGORIES: Enteroviruses

Coxsackie B4 virus is a serotype of Enterovirus B, genus Enterovirus, which can trigger an autoimmune reaction which results in destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, which is one of several different etiologies of diabetes mellitus.
An absolute deficiency of insulin renders the person a type 1 diabetic. Of the several viruses in the Coxsackie family, many of them seem to evoke this response, as do several other agents. A genetic predisposition appears to be important, such that individuals with human leukocyte antigen types DR3 and DR4 predominate in the affected population.
