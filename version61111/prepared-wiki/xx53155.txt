[[Treap]]

CATEGORIES: Heaps (data structures), Binary trees, Probabilistic data structures

In computer science, the treap and the randomized binary search tree are two closely related forms of binary search tree data structures that maintain a dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the keys. After any sequence of insertions and deletions of keys, the shape of the tree is a random variable with the same probability distribution as a random binary tree; in particular, with high probability its height is proportional to the logarithm of the number of keys, so that each search, insertion, or deletion operation takes logarithmic time to perform.

==Description==

The treap was first described by Cecilia R. Aragon and Raimund Seidel in 1989; its name is a portmanteau of tree and heap.
It is a Cartesian tree[ref]
