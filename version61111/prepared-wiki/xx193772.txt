Rao Ramesh is an Indian actor and the son of Tollywood actor Rao Gopal Rao.

==Early life==

Rao Ramesh was born in Srikakulam and brought up in Chennai. He completed his B. Com in Chennai. He wanted to drop out of school in his +2. He got interested in still photography during that time and used to go to British library & American library to study books on photography.

==Career==

Rao joined KS Prakasa Rao (Son of K. Raghavendra Rao) as an assistant. But Rao was not provided with any petty work because of the respect Prakasa Rao carries for his father. During that time cinematographer VSR Swamy encouraged and sent him to a friend of his at Bangalore. He learnt about industrial photography over there. They used Cinar cameras which costs around 1.6 million each. He also applied for a course in live action and animation in The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, California. But his parents did not want Rao to pursue it.
Later he penned a couple of stories and wanted to direct films. But his mother encouraged him to pursue acting like his father. Initially he was reluctant about acting but his mother convinced him. Ghantasala Ratna Kumar was doing TV serials and he made Rao act in one such serial. The opening shot was about getting intimate with a girl and he was all nervous. That serial was stalled in the middle.
Then he got an offer to act as the brother of Simran in Bala Krishna's Seema Simham. It was a small and passive character without a dialogue. Afterwards he couldn't get many offers. Then he was back in Chennai and started acting in serials like Pavitra Bandham, Kalavari Kodalu etc. He worked on TV serials for over 4 and half years.

==Breakthrough==

Bibo Srinivas, Murali Srinivas and Panguluri Srinivas were his classmates in Chennai. Director Krish is the brother-in-law of Bibo Srinivas. As Rao was an avid reader of poetry and very fond of C. Narayana Reddy's work Kavitha Naa Chirunama, Krish made him narrate some poetry. He liked the ferocity in Rao's narration and promised him a role in his film. It took over three years to start Krish's Gamyam.
He appeared in the 2010 Kollywood film Easan directed by M. Sasikumar.

==Personal life==

Rao is married and has two kids – a son and a daughter.
