[[536]]

CATEGORIES: 536

Year 536 (DXXXVI) was a leap year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year after the Consulship of Belisarius (or, less frequently, year 1289 ''Ab urbe condita''). The denomination 536 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
