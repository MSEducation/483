Carson City, officially the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, is an independent city and the capital of the state of Nevada, named for the mountain man Kit Carson. As of the 2010 census, the population was 55,274.[tpl]cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/32/32510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 23, 2013[/tpl] The majority of the population of the town lives in Eagle Valley, on the eastern edge of the Carson Range, a branch of the Sierra Nevada. Carson City is about [tpl]convert|30|mi|-1[/tpl] south of Reno and originated as a stopover for California bound emigrants, but developed into a city with the Comstock Lode, a silver strike in the mountains to the northeast. The city has served as the capital of Nevada since statehood in 1864 and for much of its history was a hub for the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, although the tracks were removed in the 1950s. Prior to 1969, Carson City was also the county seat of Ormsby County. In 1969, the county was abolished, and its territory was merged with Carson City to form the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City. With the consolidation, the city limits today extend west across the Sierra Nevada to the California state line in the middle of Lake Tahoe.  Like other consolidated city-counties in the United States, it is treated as a county-equivalent for census purposes.

==History==

The first European Americans to arrive in what is known as Eagle Valley were John C. Fremont and his exploration party in January 1843.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/nevada/carson.htm|title=National Park Service: Three Historic Cities|publisher=Travel Nevada.com|accessdate=6=2-2010[/tpl]  Fremont named the river flowing through the valley Carson River in honor of Christopher "Kit" Carson, the mountain man and scout he had hired for his expedition. Prior to the Fremont expedition, the Washoe people inhabited the valley and surrounding areas. Settlers named the area Washoe in reference to the tribe.[tpl]cite book|last=Bayer|first=C.W.|title=Profits, plots & lynching; the creation of Nevada Territory|year=1995|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Carson, City NV|isbn=0-9628890-3-2|page=2[/tpl]
By 1851 the Eagle Station ranch located along the Carson River served as a trading post and stopover for travelers on the California Trail's Carson Branch which ran through Eagle Valley. The valley and trading post received their name from a bald eagle that was hunted and killed by one of the early settlers and was featured on a wall inside the post.
As the area was part of the Utah Territory, it was governed from Salt Lake City, where the territorial government was headquartered. Early settlers bristled at the control exterted by Mormon-influenced officials and desired the creation of the Nevada territory. A vigilante group of influential settlers, headed by Abraham Curry, sought a site for a capital city for the envisioned territory.[tpl]cite book|last=Oldham|first=Willa|title=Carson City: Nevada’s Capital City|year=1991|publisher=Nevada State Museum|location=Carson City, NV|asin=B0006QSL8Q|page=5[/tpl]  In 1858, Abraham Curry bought Eagle Station and thereafter renamed the settlement Carson City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcarsoncity.com/history/|title=Carson City Living History|author=Carson City website|accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]  As Curry and several other partners had Eagle Valley surveyed for development. Curry had decided for himself that Carson City would someday serve as the capital city and left a [tpl]convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on[/tpl] plot open in the center of town for a future capitol building.
Following the discovery of gold and silver in 1859 on the nearby Comstock Lode, Carson City's population began to rise. Curry built the Warm Springs Hotel a mile to the east of the center of town. When the territorial governor James W. Nye traveled to Nevada, he chose Carson City as the territorial capital, influenced by Carson City lawyer William Stewart, who escorted him from San Francisco to Nevada.[tpl]cite book|last=Hauck|first=Eldon|title=American Capitols|year=1991|publisher=McFarland & Compay, Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|page=138[/tpl] As such, Carson City bested Virginia City and American Flat. Curry loaned the Warm Springs Hotel to the territorial Legislature as a meeting hall. The Legislature named Carson City to be the seat of Ormsby County and selected the hotel as the territorial prison with Curry serving as its first warden. Today the property still serves as part of the state prison.
When Nevada became a state in 1864 during the Civil War, Carson City was confirmed as Nevada's permanent capital. Carson City's development was no longer dependent on the mining industry and instead became a thriving commercial center. The Virginia & Truckee Railroad was built between Virginia City and Carson City. A wooden flume was also built from the Sierra Nevadas into Carson City. The current capitol building was constructed from 1870 to 1871. The United States Mint operated a branch mint in Carson City between the years 1870 and 1893, which struck gold and silver coins. People came from China during that time, many of them to work on the railroad. Some of them owned businesses and taught school. By 1880, almost a thousand Chinese people, "one for every five Caucasians," lived in Carson City.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20030925/OPINION/309250201/|title=Dedicated to Carson's Chinese history|author=Kelli Du Fresne|publisher=Nevada Appeal|accessdate=September 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Carson City's population and transportation traffic decreased when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a line through Donner Pass, too far to the north to benefit Carson City. The city was slightly revitalized with the mining booms in Tonopah and Goldfield. The US federal building (now renamed the Paul Laxalt Building) was completed in 1890 as was the Stewart Indian School. Carson City resigned itself to small city status, advertising itself as "America's smallest capital."  The city slowly grew; by 1960 it had reached its 1880, boom-time population.

===20th-century revitalization and growth===

As early as the late 1940s, discussions began about merging Ormsby County and Carson City.  By this time, the county was little more than Carson City and a few hamlets to the west.  However, the effort never got beyond the planning stages until 1966, when a statewide referendum formally approved the merger.  The required constitutional amendment was passed in 1968.  On April 1, 1969; Ormsby County and Carson City officially merged, and Carson City took over all municipal services under an independent city status. With this consolidation, Carson City absorbed former town sites such as Empire City, which had grown up in the 1860s as a milling center along the Carson River and current US 50. Carson City could now advertise itself as one of America's largest state capitals with its [tpl]convert|146|sqmi|km2[/tpl] of city limits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carson.org/Index.aspx?page=140|title=Carson City: History|author=Carson City Government|accessdate=February 6, 2010[/tpl]
In 1991, the city adopted a downtown master plan, specifying that no building within [tpl]convert|500|ft|m|abbr=off[/tpl] of the capitol would surpass it in height. This plan prohibited future high-rise development in the center of downtown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=carsoncity-nv-usa|title=About Carson City|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Emporis|accessdate=February 6, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl]  The Ormsby House is currently the tallest building in downtown Carson City, at a height of 117 feet. The structure was completed in 1972.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/city/carsoncity-nv-usa/all-buildings/highrise |title=Carson City High Rise Buildings |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]

In an attempt to either make proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility at Yucca Mountain too expensive (by raising property tax rates to the maximum allowed) or to allow the state to collect the potential federal payments of property taxes on the facility, the State of Nevada in 1987 created a new county with no residents called Bullfrog County, carved Yucca Mountain out of Nye County, and made Carson City the county seat of Bullfrog County, even though it is not located in Bullfrog County and is more than 100 miles from Yucca Mountain.  A state judge found the process unconstitutional, Yucca Mountain was absorbed back into Nye County, and Bullfrog County was dissolved in 1989.
