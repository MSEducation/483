The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a uniqueOccasionally, publishers erroneously assign an ISBN to more than one title — the first edition of The Ultimate Alphabet and The Ultimate Alphabet Workbook have the same ISBN, 0-8050-0076-3. Conversely, books are published with several ISBNs: A German, second-language edition of Emil und die Detektive has the ISBNs 87-23-90157-8 (Denmark), 0-8219-1069-8 (United States), 91-21-15628-X (Sweden), 0-85048-548-7 (England) and 3-12-675495-3 (Germany).In some cases, books sold only as sets share ISBNs. For example, the Vance Integral Edition used only 2 ISBNs for 44 books. numeric commercial book identifier based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code created by Gordon Foster,  Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBERING (ISBN) SYSTEM original 1966 report |work=informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net |date=1966 |accessdate=20 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430024722/http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |first=Gordon |last=Foster[/tpl] for the booksellers and stationers WHSmith and others in 1965.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |title=ISBN History |work=isbn.org |date=20 April 2014  |accessdate=20 April 2014 |author= |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140420232459/http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. However, the 9-digit SBN code was used in the United Kingdom until 1974. An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit "0". ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.[tpl]citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6897 | title = ISO 2108:1978 | publisher = ISO[/tpl]
Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with "Bookland" European Article Number EAN-13s.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm | title = Frequently Asked Questions about the new ISBN standard from ISO | author = TC 46/SC 9 | publisher = LAC‐BAC | place = CA[/tpl]
Occasionally, a book may appear without a printed ISBN if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual ISBN procedure; however, this can be rectified later.Bradley, Philip (1992). "[tpl]PDFlink|Book numbering: The importance of the ISBN|245KB[/tpl]. The Indexer. 18 (1): 25–26.
Another identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines.

==Overview==

An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN.[tpl]PDFlink|See paragraph 5.2 of ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012)|548 KB[/tpl] The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10 digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13 digit ISBN):
[/ref]
The 13 digit ISBN separates its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) with either a hyphen or a space. Other than the prefix and the check digit, no part of the ISBN has a fixed number of digits.
The 10 digit ISBN also separated its parts (registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) with either a hyphen or a space.The international ISBN agency's ISBN User's Manual says: "The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces" although permitting their omission for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed; see hyphenation instructions at ISBN.org.

===How ISBNs are issued===

International Standard Book Numbers issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in National Libraries or within Ministries of Culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers who are not government funded. In Canada, the stated purpose of issuing International Standard Book Numbers for no cost was to encourage Canadian culture. In the United Kingdom, United States, and some other countries, where the service is provided by non-government funded organisations, the issuing of International Standard Book Numbers requires payment of a fee.
Australia: In Australia ISBNs are issued by the commercial library services agency Thorpe-Bowker, and prices range from $42 for a single ISBN (plus a $55 registration fee for new publishers) through to $2,890 for a block of 1,000 ISBNs.[ref]
</ref>
Canada: In Canada, Library and Archives Canada, a government agency, is responsible for issuing ISBNs, and there is no cost. Works in French are issued an ISBN by the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.
Pakistan: The National Library of PakistanNational Library of Pakistan is responsible for ISBN registrations for Pakistani publishers, authors, universities, institutions and government departments who are responsible for publishing books.
India: In India, Raja Rammohan National Agency for ISBN is responsible for registration of Indian publishers, authors, universities, institutions and government departments who are responsible for publishing books.
United Kingdom and Ireland: In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the privately held company Nielsen Book Services, part of Nielsen Holdings N.V., is responsible for issuing ISBNs and there is a charge. ISBNs are sold in lots of ten or more.
United States: In the United States, the privately held company RR Bowker issues ISBNs. There is a charge which varies depending upon the number of ISBNs purchased, with prices starting from $125.00 for a single number.[ref]

Publishers and authors in other countries need to obtain ISBNs from their respective national ISBN registration Agency. A directory of ISBN Agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website.

===Registration Group identifier===

The registration group identifier is a 1 to 5 digit number which is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979).[tpl]cite book |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' maunal |format=PDF |work=isbn-international.org |edition=Sixth International |isbn=978-92-95055-02-5 |date=2012 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl] Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation# |title=ISBN Ranges |work=isbn-international.org |at=Select the format you desire and click on the Generate button|date=29 April 2014  |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author= |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140429101326/https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |archivedate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The single digit group identifiers within the 978 prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries, 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5 digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–621, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9927–9989, and 99901–99972.See a complete list of group identifiers.  ISBN.org sometimes calls them group numbers. Their table of identifiers now refers to ISBN prefix ranges, which must be assumed to be group identifier ranges.  Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.Hailman, Jack Parker (2008). Coding and redundancy: man-made and animal-evolved signals. Harvard University Press. P. 209. ISBN 978-0-674-02795-4
Within the 979 prefix element the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with international standard music numbers (ISMN), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.[tpl]cite book |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' maunal |format=PDF |work=isbn-international.org |edition=Sixth International |isbn=978-92-95055-02-5 |date=2012 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=no |pages=7,23[/tpl] The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 which have been assigned are: 10 for France and 11 for the Republic of Korea.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation# |title=International ISBN Agency - Range Message (pdf sorted by prefix) |page=28 |work=isbn-international.org |date=2 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency[/tpl]
The original standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but affixing a zero (0) as prefix to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.

===Registrant element===

The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. :Category:ISBN agencies) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most book stores only handle ISBN-bearing merchandise.
A listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form (€1399, US$1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.See Publisher's International ISBN Directory Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1.
Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.
By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where the digits allocated for the registrant element are few and there are many digits allocated for the publication element; likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.Splane, Lily (2002). The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer. Anaphase II Publishing. p. 37. ISBN 978-0-945962-14-4. Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.

====Pattern====

English-language publisher codes follow a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be easily determined, as follows:Hyphenation Instructions. ISBN.org.

==Check digits==

A check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit.  It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the message.

===ISBN-10 check digits===

The 2001 edition of the official manual of the International ISBN Agency says that the ISBN-10 check digit[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |title=ISBN Users' Manual - 4. Structure of ISBN |publisher=Isbn.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27[/tpl] – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11.
For example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:
Formally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:
It is also true for ISBN-10's that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:
Formally, we can say:
The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proved that all possible valid ISBN-10's have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10's with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a prime number.)
The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN - the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.For example I'saka: a sketch grammar of a language of north-central New Guinea. Pacific Linguistics. ISBN "0-85883-554-4".
In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN number (although it is still unlikely).

===ISBN-10 check digit calculation===

Modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. Each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN – excluding the check digit, itself – is multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2, and the remainder of the sum, with respect to 11, is computed. The resulting remainder, plus the check digit, must equal 11; therefore, the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products.
For example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:
Thus the check digit is 2, and the complete sequence is .

===ISBN-13 check digit calculation===

The 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual[tpl]PDFlink|ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2005)|284 KB[/tpl] describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10.
Formally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:
The calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.
For example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:
 s = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3
   =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15
   = 93
 93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3
 10 –  3 = 7
Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is .
Formally, the ISBN-13 check digit calculation is:
This check system – similar to the UPC check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.
Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).

===ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion===

The conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix "978" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the ISBN-13 algorithm.

===Errors in usage===

Publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.Lorimer, Rowland; Shoichet, Jillian; Maxwell, John W. (2005). Book Publishing I. CCSP Press. p. 299. ISBN 978-0-9738727-0-5.
Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase "Cancelled ISBN".020 - International Standard Book Number (R) – MARC 21 Bibliographic - Full. Library of Congress. However, book-ordering systems such as Amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

===eISBN===

There are no e-ISBN or eISBN numbers. Only the term ISBN should be used.isbn.org, Retrieved, August 29, 2013[tpl]deadlink|date=March 2014[/tpl]www.sellbox.com, Retrieved, August 29, 2013

==EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading==

Currently the barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price.http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ — including a detailed description of the EAN13 format. For 10 digit ISBNs, the number "978", the Bookland "country code", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits).
Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007.There is a FAQ document about this migration.  As of 2011, all the 13-digit ISBNs begin with 978.  As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix will be introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. 10 digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an "M" letter; the bar code represents the "M" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.
Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.Are You Ready for ISBN-13? at isbn.org.
Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing ISBN-10s. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN-based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN-13 in North America.
