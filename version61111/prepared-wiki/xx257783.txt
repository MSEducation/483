[[The Who Tour 1981]]

CATEGORIES: 1981 concert tours, The Who concert tours

The Who Tour 1981 was The Who's third concert tour since the death of original drummer Keith Moon, with most dates performed in advance of the release of their recently recorded Face Dances album. Aside from a performance on the German TV program Rockpalast at the end of the tour, it was strictly a United Kingdom venture, with four shows in Scotland, one in Wales, and the rest in England. It was the group’s first U.K. tour since 1975.

==History==

Although the Face Dances album was completed by the end of 1980, it was not released until the 1981 tour had almost ended, meaning the new material played on the tour was entirely unfamiliar to audiences. Set lists from 1981 varied from one point of the tour to another, with the band experimenting with different song orders – for example, long-time show closer "Won't Get Fooled Again" appeared in the middle of the set early in the tour, with "Who Are You" serving as the closer. New songs performed each night were "You Better You Bet", "Don't Let Go the Coat", "The Quiet One", and "Another Tricky Day", while "Did You Steal My Money" was played occasionally and a loose version of "How Can You Do It Alone" appeared in an encore during one show. A very obscure song-segment that has never appeared in any official release, "You Stand Naked", was also performed during the encore of the 31 January show at St Austell. Additionally, early versions of "Communication" can be heard in improvisations during the first show in St Austell on 30 January; the final version of "Communication" was released on Pete Townshend's 1982 solo album All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes.
This represented the most new material The Who had performed on a tour since they supported Quadrophenia in 1973–74.
The brass section the band carried for most of 1979 and all of 1980 was not retained in 1981, meaning John "Rabbit" Bundrick was the only extra musician in addition to the four official band members.
