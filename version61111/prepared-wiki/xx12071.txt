The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is concerned with international public health. It was established on 7 April 1948, with its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. WHO is a member of the United Nations Development Group. Its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations.
The main responsibility was to help anybody in need of medical assistance.
The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 69 countries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the World Health Assembly finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the Office International d'Hygiène Publique and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its creation, it has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; the mitigation of the effects of non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and aging; nutrition, food security and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and drive the development of reporting, publications, and networking. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report, a leading international publication on health, the worldwide World Health Survey, and World Health Day (7 April of every year).
Its links with the International Atomic Energy Agency and distribution of contraception have both proved controversial, as have guidelines on healthy eating and the 2009 flu pandemic.

==History==

===Establishment===

The use of the word "world", rather than "international",emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization was seeking to achieve.[tpl]cite journal |title=World Health Organization |journal=The British Medical Journal |volume=2 |number=4570 |date=7 August 1948|pages=302–303 |publisher=BMJ Publishing Group |jstor=25364565 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4570.302[/tpl] The constitution of the World Health Organization had been signed by all 61 countries of the United Nations by 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialised agency of the United Nations to which every member subscribed.[tpl]cite journal|title=The World Health Organization |first=Michael B. |last=Shimkin|journal=Science |volume=104 |number=2700 |date=27 September 1946 |pages=281–283 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |jstor=1674843 |doi=10.1126/science.104.2700.281[/tpl] Its constitution formally came into force on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by the 26th member state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hist/chronicles/chronicle_1947.pdf|format=PDF|title=Chronicle of the World Health Organization, 1947|accessdate=18 July 2007[/tpl] The first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948, having secured a budget of US$5 million (then GBP£1,250,000) for the 1949 year. Andrija Stampar was the Assembly's first president, and G. Brock Chisholm was appointed Director-General of WHO, having served as Executive Secretary during the planning stages. Its first priorities were to control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and environmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the compilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. The logo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a symbol for healing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.org.ph/ |title=World Health Organization Philippines |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]

===Operational history===

WHO established an epidemiological information service via telex in 1947, and by 1950 a mass tuberculosis inoculation drive (using the BCG vaccine) was under way. In 1955, the malaria eradication programme was launched, although it was later altered in objective. 1965 saw the first report on diabetes mellitus and the creation of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. WHO moved into its headquarters building in 1966. The Expanded Programme on Immunization was started in 1974, as was the control programme into onchocerciasis – an important partnership between the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and World Bank. In the following year, the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases was also launched. In 1976, the World Health Assembly voted to enact a resolution on Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, with a focus on community-driven care. The first list of essential medicines was drawn up in 1977, and a year later the ambitious goal of "health for all" was declared. In 1986, WHO started its global programme on the growing problem of HIV/AIDS, followed two years later by additional attention on preventing discrimination against sufferers and UNAIDS was formed in 1996. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established in 1988.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/who60/media/exhibition_brochure.pdf |title=WHO at 60 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]
In 1958, Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox, resulting in Resolution WHA11.54.[tpl]cite book |author=Fenner, Frank|title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva|year=1988 |chapter=Development of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp9.pdf|pages=366–418 |isbn=92-4-156110-6 [/tpl] At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort and adopted a new disease surveillance method.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-10-full.pdf |title=Karel Raška and Smallpox |format=PDF |publisher=Central European Journal of Public Health |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.szu.cz/svi/cejph/archiv/2010-1-11-full.pdf |title=Karel Raška – The Development of Modern Epidemiology.

In 1998, WHO's Director General highlighted gains in child survival, reduced infant mortality, raised life expectancy and reduced rates of "scourges" such as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He, did, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and that progress in this area had been slow.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHD_98.1-13.pdf |title=World Health Day: Safe Motherhood |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |page=1 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl] Cholera and malaria have remained problems since WHO's founding, although in decline for a large part of that period.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medical-colleges.net/worldhealth.htm |title=World Health Organization |publisher=Medical Schools and Nursing Colleges |year=2003 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl] In the twenty-first century, the Stop TB Partnership was created in 2000, along with the UN's formulation of the Millennium Development Goals. The Measles initiative was formed in 2001, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve the resources available. In 2006, the organization endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which formed the basis for a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the AIDS pandemic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-10/04/content_5167991.htm |title=Zimbabwe launches world's 1st AIDS training package |publisher=chinaview.cn |date=4 October 2006 |accessdate=16 January 2012[/tpl]

==Current projects==

===Overall focus===

The WHO's Constitution states that its objective "is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization |accessdate=11 February 2008[/tpl]

WHO currently defines its role in public health as follows:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/about/role/en/index.html |title=The role of WHO in public health |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]

===Communicable diseases===

The 2012–2013 WHO budget identified 13 areas among which funding was distributed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/pb/2012-2013/PB_2012%E2%80%932013_eng.pdf |title=Programme Budget, 2012–2013|publisher=WHO |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] Two of those thirteen areas related to communicable diseases: the first, to reduce the "health, social and economic burden" of communicable diseases in general; the second to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in particular.
In terms of HIV/AIDS, WHO works within the UNAIDS network and considers it important that it works in alignment with UNAIDS objectives and strategies. It also strives to involve sections of society other than health to help deal with the economic and social effects of the disease.[tpl]cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |publisher=WHO  |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |year=2011 |page=5[/tpl] In line with UNAIDS, WHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the number of those aged 15–24 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV infections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.[tpl]cite journal |format=pdf |title=Global health sector strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011–2015 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501651_eng.pdf |publisher=WHO |year=2011 |page=7[/tpl]
Although WHO dropped its commitment to a global malaria eradication campaign in the 1970s as too ambitious, it retains a strong commitment to malaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria cases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. WHO is to report, likely in 2015, as to whether RTS,S/AS01, currently in research, is a viable malaria vaccine. For the time being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used to prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs – particularly to vulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html |title=Malaria Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl]
WHO's help has contributed to a 40% fall in the number of deaths from tuberculosis between 1990 and 2010, and since 2005, it claims that over 46 million people have been treated and an estimated 7 million lives saved through practices advocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their financing, early diagnosis, standardising treatment, monitoring of the spread and impact of tuberculosis and stabilising the drug supply. It has also recognised the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html |title=Tuberculosis Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=April 2012 |accessdate=24 May 2012[/tpl]
WHO aims to eradicate polio. It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988, which partnered WHO with Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), as well as smaller organizations. It works to immunize young children and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared "polio-free".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/ |title=Poliomyelitis Fact Sheet |publisher=WHO |work=WHO Media Centre |date=October 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl]

===Non-communicable diseases, mental health and injuries===

Another of the thirteen WHO priority areas is aimed at the prevention and reduction of "disease, disability and premature from chronic noncommunicable diseases, mental disorders, violence and injuries, and visual impairment".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/en/ |title=WHO Violence and Injury Prevention |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl]
For example, the WHO promotes road safety as a means to reduce traffic-related injuries.WHO. Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020
WHO has also worked on global initiatives in surgery, including emergency and essential surgical care,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/surgery/globalinitiative/en/ |title=Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care |publisher=WHO |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] trauma care,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/services/traumacare/en/ |title=Essential trauma care project |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] and safe surgery.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl] The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is in current use worldwide in the effort to improve patient safety.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ |title=Safe Surgery Saves Lives |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]

===Life course and life style===

WHO works to "reduce morbidity and mortality and improve health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood and adolescence, and improve sexual and reproductive health and promote active and healthy aging for all individuals".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/index.html |title=Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction |publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 February 2012[/tpl]
It also tries to prevent or reduce risk factors for "health conditions associated with use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and other psychoactive substances, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and unsafe sex".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/tobacco/en/ |title=Tobacco |publisher=WHO |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/en/ |title=Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health |publisher=WHO[/tpl]
WHO works to improve nutrition, food safety and food security and to ensure this has a positive effect on public health and sustainable development.

===Emergency work===

When any sort of disaster or emergency occurs, it is WHO's stated objective to reduce any consequences the event may have on world health and its social and economic implications.

===Health policy===

WHO addresses government health policy with two aims: firstly, "to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health through policies and programmes that enhance health equity and integrate pro-poor, gender-responsive, and human rights-based approaches" and secondly "to promote a healthier environment, intensify primary prevention and influence public policies in all sectors so as to address the root causes of environmental threats to health".
The organization develops and promotes the use of evidence-based tools, norms and standards to support member states to inform health policy options. It oversees the implementation of the International Health Regulations, and publishes a series of medical classifications; of these, three are overreaching "reference classifications": the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/en/FamilyDocument2007.pdf |title=Family of International Classifications: definition, scope and purpose |publisher=WHO |format=PDF |year=2007 |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] Other international policy frameworks produced by WHO include the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (adopted in 1981),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241541601/en/ |title=International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (adopted in 2003)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/about/en/index.html |title=About the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |publisher=WHO |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl] and the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (adopted in 2010).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hrh/migration/code/WHO_global_code_of_practice_EN.pdf |title=WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel  |publisher=WHO |year=2010 |accessdate=27 March 2012[/tpl]
In terms of health services, WHO looks to improve "governance, financing, staffing and management" and the availability and quality of evidence and research to guide policy making. It also strives to "ensure improved access, quality and use of medical products and technologies".

===Governance and support===

The remaining two of WHO's thirteen identified policy areas relate to the role of WHO itself: 

====Partnerships====

The WHO along with the World Bank constitute the core team responsible for administering the International Health Partnership (IHP+). The IHP+ is a group of partner governments, development agencies, civil society and others committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries.

WHO Member States appoint delegations to the World Health Assembly, WHO's supreme decision-making body. All UN Member States are eligible for WHO membership, and, according to the WHO web site, "other countries may be admitted as members when their application has been approved by a simple majority vote of the World Health Assembly".
In addition, the UN observer organizations International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have entered into "official relations" with WHO and are invited as observers. In the World Health Assembly they are seated along the other NGOs.

===Assembly and Executive Board===

The World Health Assembly is the legislative and supreme body of WHO. Based in Geneva, it typically meets yearly in May. It appoints the Director-General every five years, and votes on matters of policy and finance of WHO, including the proposed budget. It also reviews reports of the Executive Board and decides whether there are areas of work requiring further examination. The Assembly elects 34 members, technically qualified in the field of health, to the Executive Board for three-year terms. The main functions of the Board are to carry out the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and to facilitate its work.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/governance/en/index.html |title=Governance |publisher=WHO |accessdate=5 February 2012[/tpl]
