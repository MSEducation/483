==History==

Before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the Taíno people populated the island which they called Quisqueya (mother of all lands) and Ayiti (land of high mountains), and which Columbus named Hispaniola, including the territory of today's Republic of Haiti. At the time, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Marién, Maguá, Maguana, Jaragua, and Higüey.[tpl]cite book|last=Perez|first=Cosme E.|title=Quisqueya: un pas̕ en el mundo: La Revelacin̤ Maya Del 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AkDQoaMzrk0C&pg=PA27|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=20 December 2011|publisher=Palibrio|isbn=978-1-4633-1368-5|page=27[/tpl] These were ruled respectively by caciques (chiefs) Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohechío, and Cayacoa.
Dating to 1496, when the Spanish settled there, and officially to 5 August 1498, Santo Domingo is the oldest European city in the Americas. Bartholomew Columbus founded the settlement and named it La Nueva Isabela, after an earlier settlement in the north named after the Queen of Spain Isabella I.[tpl]cite book|last=Greenberger|first=Robert|title=Juan Ponce de León: The Exploration of Florida and the Search for the Fountain of Youth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ov7PNM3NcC0C&pg=PA35|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=1 January 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3627-4|page=35[/tpl] In 1495 it was renamed "Santo Domingo", in honor of Saint Dominic. Santo Domingo came to be known as the "Gateway to the Caribbean" and the chief town in Hispaniola from then on.[tpl]cite book|last1=Bolton|first1=Herbert E.|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas Maitland|title=The Colonization of North America 1492 to 1783|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YN64ri8RH80C&pg=PA17|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=30 April 2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-9438-0|page=17[/tpl] Expeditions which led to Ponce de León's colonization of Puerto Rico, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar's colonization of Cuba, Hernando Cortes' conquest of Mexico, and Vasco Núñez de Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean were all launched from Santo Domingo.
In June 1502,[tpl]cite book|last=Clayton|first=Lawrence A.|title=Bartolom de Las Casas and the Conquest of the Americas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NP1WfJFLePsC&pg=PA19|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=25 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9427-3|page=19[/tpl] Santo Domingo was destroyed by a major hurricane, and the new Governor Nicolás de Ovando had it rebuilt on a different site on the other side of the Ozama River.Meining 1986:9 The original layout of the city and a large portion of its defensive wall can still be appreciated today throughout the Colonial Zone, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
In 1586, Francis Drake captured the city and held it for ransom.[tpl]cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic - THE FIRST COLONY |accessdate=2009-03-18 |publisher=Library of Congress[/tpl] Drake's invasion signaled the decline of Spanish dominion over Hispaniola, which was accentuated in the early 17th century by policies that resulted in the depopulation of most of the island outside of the capital. An expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 attacked the city of Santo Domingo, but was defeated. The British troops withdrew and took Jamaica, instead.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rdvp3cGJUZoC&pg=PA148&dq=%22Santo+Domingo%22+1655+Penn+Venables&output=html |title=Wars of the Americas |last=Marley |first=David |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1998 |isbn=9780874368376 |pages=148–149[/tpl] In 1697, the Treaty of Ryswick included the acknowledgement by Spain of France's dominion over the Western third of the island, now Haiti.
From 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795, captured by rebellious Haitian slaves in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, recovered by Spain in 1809. In 1821 Santo Domingo became the capital of an independent nation: Spanish Haiti. The nation was unified with Haiti two months later . The city and the colony lost much of their Spanish population as a result of these events.[tpl]cite web |url=http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/dominican-republic/elections-and-events-17911849.html |title=Elections and Events 1791-1849 |accessdate=2009-03-18 |publisher=University of California-San Diego[/tpl]Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes, 2007, p. 70
Santo Domingo was again the capital of a free nation, when Dominicans gained their independence from Haitian occupation on February 27, 1844 led by their national hero Juan Pablo Duarte. The city was a prize fought over by various political factions over the succeeding decades of instability. In addition, the country had to fight multiple battles with Haiti; the Battle of March 19, Battle of March 30, Battle of Las Carreras, and Battle of Beler, are a few of the most prominent encounters, mentioned in the national anthem and with city streets named after them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.colonialzone-dr.com/stodgo_map-lenin.pdf |title=City street map of Santo Domingo at www.colonialzone-dr.com |accessdate=2009-03-20[/tpl] In 1861 Spain returned to the country, having struck a bargain with Dominican dictator Pedro Santana whereby the latter was granted several honorific titles and privileges, in exchange for annexing the young nation back to Spanish rule. The Dominican Restoration War began in 1863 however, and in 1865 the country was free again after Spain withdrew.
Over the next two-thirds of a century Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic went through many revolutions, power changes, and occupation by the United States, 1916–24. The city was struck by hurricane San Zenón in 1930, which caused major damage.[tpl]cite book|last=Derby|first=Lauren|title=The Dictator's Seduction: Politics and the Popular Imagination in the Era of Trujillo|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nzqw4w91vucC&pg=PA66|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=26 June 2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4482-7|page=66[/tpl] After its rebuilding, Santo Domingo was known officially as Ciudad Trujillo in honor of dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, who governed from 1930. Following his assassination in 1961 the city was renamed back to Santo Domingo. It was the scene of street fighting during the 1965 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic.
The year 1992 marked the 500th anniversary, El Quinto Centenario, of Christopher Columbus' Discovery of America. The Columbus Lighthouse – Faro a Colón – was erected in Santo Domingo in honor of this occasion, with an approximate cost of 400 million Dominican pesos .

==Geography==

The Ozama river flows [tpl]convert|148|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] before emptying into the Caribbean Sea. Santo Domingo's position on its banks was of great importance to the city's economic development and the growth of trade during colonial times. The Ozama River is where the country's busiest port is located.

===Climate===

The average temperature in Santo Domingo varies little, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. Thanks to these trade winds, Santo Domingo has a tropical climate but seldom experiences the oppressive heat and humidity that one may expect to find. December and January are the coolest months and July and August are the warmest. Santo Domingo averages [tpl]convert|1445|mm|in[/tpl] of rain annually. Its driest months are from January through April, however, due to the trade winds and mountains to the southwest, rain is seen even during these months. Because its driest month is just below [tpl]convert|60|mm|in[/tpl], Santo Domingo falls under the tropical monsoon climate category under the Köppen climate classification. Like many other cities in the Caribbean, Santo Domingo is very susceptible to hurricanes. The lowest recorded temperature has been [tpl]convert|13.0|C|F[/tpl] and the highest [tpl]convert|39.5|C|F[/tpl].

==Population==

The demographics of Santo Domingo are similar to other metropolitan areas of the country, except that the population of illegal immigrants (mainly Haitians) is larger in the city because of the relative ease of finding work and the economic dynamism compared to other provinces. Santo Domingo, like most of the country, is made up of native-born Dominican mulattos, though there are large numbers of Afro-Dominicans and Euro-Dominicans, as well as a large immigrant community, in fact over 20% of the city's population is immigrants, mainly Haitians. However, there are also recent immigrants from Europe, Asia, as well as other Latin American nations present in the city. The city of Santo Domingo has a significant community of Asians (mainly Chinese), Arabs (mostly Lebanese), and Europeans (mostly Spanish and Italian) are also present in the city. There are also significant numbers of Jamaicans and Puerto Ricans, in the city, as well as US born Dominicans returning to their parents' home country. The northeast quadrant of the city is the poorest while the southwest is wealthier. Santo Domingo is also considered one of the epicenters of the growing Dominican middle-class. The city is one of most economically developed cities in Latin America. Santo Domingo's population in 2010 was 3.8 million in the metropolitan area.

==Government and politics==

Santo Domingo is the center of the national government of the Dominican Republic. The President's office and ministries, National Congress, Supreme Court of Justice, and other main government institutions are located in the metropolitan area.
The city is administered by the Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional (City Hall), which is responsible for municipal functions.[tpl]cite book|last1=Moré|first1=Gustavo Luis|last2=Bergdoll|first2=Barry|title=Caribbean Modernist Architecture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CgI9cMHsSPIC&pg=RA1-PA8|accessdate=4 June 2012|date=30 June 2010|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|isbn=978-0-87070-775-9|page=8[/tpl] The current mayor of Santo Domingo is Roberto Esmérito Salcedo, of the governing Dominican Liberation Party.

==Economy==

The city is the center of economic activity in the Dominican Republic, it is where most of the country wealth is concentrated since it is the main sector where everything related to politics occurs. Many national and international firms have their headquarters or regional offices in Santo Domingo. The city attracts many international firms and franchises such as Goldcorp and Barrick due to its geographic location and economic stability.
The infrastructure is adequate for most business operations, however, power outages (blackouts) continue to be a problem in certain parts of the city. A key element that has helped the city grow and compete globally is the telecommunications infrastructure. In recent years, the Dominican Republic has enjoyed a modern telecommunications system due to its privatization and integration with the U.S. systems.
The city's economic growth is very noticeable in the increased building towers, shopping malls, highways, and the increase in commercial activity.
Santo Domingo has a great social divide ranging from the extremely poor to the very rich.

Juliet, Paradise, The Prairies, Los Prados, Bella Vista, Sarasota and other sectors, which consist mostly of costly buildings and luxury houses, contrasting with the outskirts of the city as Gualey and Capotille which are less economically developed .
Bella Vista and La Esperilla are currently the fastest growing sectors with large mega -projects. Gazcue belongs to the more traditional southeastern area of the city and is known for its buildings dating from the 1930s to the 1960s.
The city's shopping centers are located primarily on Avenida Winston Churchill, where there are places such as Acropolis Center, Blue Mall, and large supermarkets. It is also the home of the largest commercial banks, such as Banco Popular Dominicano, Scotiabank, Citibank, Banco BHD, Banco del Progreso, Banreservas, among others.
