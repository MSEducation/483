In Mexican cuisine, pico de gallo ([tpl]IPA-es|ˈpiko ðe ˈɣaʎo[/tpl], literally rooster's beak), also called  salsa fresca, is a fresh, uncooked salad made from chopped tomato, white onion, and chilis (generally jalapeños, serranos or habaneros). Other ingredients may also be added, such as shrimp, vienna sausage or squid, avocado, key lime juice, lime juice or apple cider vinegar, fresh coriander leafs, cucumber, radish or firm fruit such as mango. It is generally eaten with tortilla chips.
Pico de gallo can be used in much the same way as other salsas, Kenyan kachumbari, or Indian chutneys, but since it contains less liquid, it can also be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as tacos and fajitas.
The tomato-based variety is widely known as salsa picada (minced/chopped sauce). In Mexico it is sometimes called salsa mexicana (Mexican sauce). Because the colors of the red tomato, white onion, green chili are reminiscent of the colors of the Mexican flag, it is also sometimes called salsa bandera (flag sauce).
In many regions of Mexico the term refers to any of a variety of salads (including fruit salads), salsa, or fillings made with tomato, tomatillo, avocado, melon, orange, jícama, cucumber, papaya, or mild chilis. The ingredients are tossed in lime juice and either hot sauce or chamoy, then sprinkled with a salty chili powder.

In their book Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico, Rick Bayless and Deann Groen speculate that the name might allude to the bird feed-like texture and appearance of the mince.Bayless, Rick; Groen, Deann. Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico.
