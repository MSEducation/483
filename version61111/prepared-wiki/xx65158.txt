The Tren Urbano  (English: Urban Train), is a [tpl]convert|10.7|mi|km|1|adj=on[/tpl]  fully automated rapid transit that serves the metropolitan area of San Juan in Puerto Rico, and has stops in the municipalities of San Juan, Bayamón and Guaynabo. It is electrified by third rail at 750 V DC. The Tren Urbano consists of 16 stations along a single line.
The Tren Urbano complements other forms of public transportation on the island such as the public bus system, taxis, water ferries and shuttles. The entire mass transportation system has been dubbed the “Alternativa de Transporte Integrado” (Integrated Transportation Alternative) or “ATI”. Tren Urbano is also the Caribbean's first rapid transit system.Railway-Technology Tren Urbano Rapid Transit System, Puerto Rico, 2002

==History==

In the late 19th century while the island was under Spanish rule, regional rail systems were begun in Puerto Rico. The railroad continued to be in use under US rule for most of the first half of the 20th century and played a key role in the transportation of people and goods throughout the island. The railroad systems of the period also played a vital role in the sugarcane industry.
From 1901 to 1946 San Juan had a street tramway network known as “Trolley” de San Juan operated by the Porto Rico Railway, Light and Power CompanyCanadian Transit Interests Outside Canada with more than [tpl]convert|20|mi[/tpl] of tracks and ran between San Juan and Santurce. During its heyday, it was the most modern electric streetcar system in Puerto Rico, rivaling New York and Toronto and transported nearly 10 million passengers a year. Today there are plans to bring back the tram to the heart of San Juan to complement the Tren Urbano.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
During the 1950s, an industrial boom, due in part to development programs such as Operation Bootstrap, led to the downfall of agriculture as the principal industry on the island. During this decade automobiles became more widely available. Newer, and more efficient roads and highways along with the closure of sugarcane mills displaced the need for rail transportation. It was not long that it was realized that an alternative means of mass transportation was needed in addition to the public bus system to alleviate the severe traffic situation that was being created, especially in the San Juan metropolitan area.

===Proposals===

In 1967, proposals were made for the construction of a rapid rail transit system to serve the city of San Juan. In 1971, the major T.U.S.C.A. study -- funded jointly by the Puerto Rico Planning Board and the U.S. federal governement --0 recommended an island wide, elevated transit system and new community development program. That proposal would have traversed and also served the San Juan Metro Area, connecting it with the rest of the island without the necessity of highway construction. However, it was not until 1989 that Puerto Rico’s Department of Transportation and Public Works (Departamento de Transportación y Obras Públicas or DTOP in Spanish) officially adopted a proposal to begin design and construction of a rail system for the San Juan metropolitan area. The ridership demand for such a system had to be forecast using a mathematical model prepared by a team of transportation planners and engineers. By 1992, various alignments of the proposed system were considered, but the final design chosen served only certain parts of the metro area, and not Old San Juan. A rather prosaic name was chosen for the system: “Tren Urbano” (Urban Train), which adds little to its public image. Nevertheless, in 1993, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) selected the Tren Urbano as a Turnkey Demonstration Projects under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. During 1996 and 1997,seven design-build contracts were awarded for different segments of the Tren Urbano Phase 1 system. 
 
A number of companieswww.kiewit.com Projects Tren Urbano - Rio Piedras Section / Accessed [tpl]start date|2009|06|13[/tpl] shared the tasks for building the Tren Urbano including Siemens AG which was granted a concession to design and build the line and its rolling stock, and to operate it for the first five years. The company won a contract which was a “first” for North America in the scope of the work which it involved, and which was awarded in July 1996.

====Construction====

The construction project was plagued by delays, contractual disputes between the government and companies involved in the undertaking, as well as investigations into possible mismanagement of funds. The project cost was US $2.28 billion.http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/NSPA2007_Final(1).pdf FTA - The Predicted and Actual Impacts of New Starts Projects - 2007

====Free Service====

The rail system was officially inaugurated on [tpl]start date|2004|12|19[/tpl]. After this date, free service was offered on weekends until April, 2005 when weekdays were added to the free service. Popularity grew quickly and by the end of the free period 40,000 people were using the train on a daily basis. By late 2005, however, ridership had fallen to 24,000, less than one-third of the 80,000 projection (and well below the projection of 110,000 for 2010).Tren Urbano PR another way low transit ridership forecast, TOLLROADSNews, [tpl]start date|2005|11|20[/tpl], accessed [tpl]start date|2007|04|13[/tpl].

====Paid Service====

Paid fare service started on [tpl]start date|2005|06|06[/tpl]. In 2006, average weekday boardings stood at 28,179 and in 2007, ridership decreased to 27,567. Ironically, the Tren Urbano goes mostly through suburban areas. Nonetheless, by the third quarter of 2008 average weekday ridership had increased to 36,500.Transit Ridership Report Third Quarter 2008, Heavy rail / Accessed [tpl]start date|2008|12|05[/tpl]   Though it was announced that effective the month of March or April 2010, the fares would be reduced 50%. Fare was reduced from $1.50 to current $0.75.

====Issues and Concerns====

There is no service to Old San Juan, Santurce, the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (and many other parts of Guaynabo, Bayamón, and San Juan), and the Tren Urbano doesn't serve important suburbs like Cataño, Toa Baja, Toa Alta, Carolina, Trujillo Alto, Canóvanas and others, which helps to explain low ridership. Some question the viability of this system for additional reasons, such as the lack of an island-wide public-transportation system, such as the T.U.S.C.A. system proposed in 1971. The inner-city, public bus transportation system—the Metropolitan Bus Authority (AMA) -- that operates in the Greater San Juan Metro Area is considered unreliable by most people, and it does not have a regular schedule.  Integration with public mass transit systems, such as the AMA and the Acuaexpreso (an urban ferry), was initially poor and remains a challenge for the DTOP.  
The use of bicycles as an urban mode of transport is growing in Puerto Rico, despite the lack of proper, widespread bicycling infrastructure that P.R. Law 22, Ch. XI calls for, and that is the DTOP's responsibility to build. This lack was to be addressed as early as 1976, with a Bicentennial Bikeway study for a bikeway along the coastal edge of the metro area. Unfortunately, that proposal was killed by hotel interests in the Condado. Tren Urbano allows bicycles on trains -- the 'bici-tren' program, but that program is both not widely advertised and requires getting a photo permit that must be renewed annually.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
Customer service centers are located only at the Sagrado Corazón and Deportivo stations. These are also the only two centers/stations that issue the bici-tren permit.

==Route==

Tren Urbano is currently made up of one rapid transit route. It consists of 16 stations, ten of which are elevated, four at grade or in open cuttings, and two underground. All stations are designed to handle three permanently coupled pairs (6 vehicles). The stations in the system are:
Each of the 16 stations boasts unique artwork and architectural style.
A maintenance depot and operations control center is located halfway along the route, between Martínez Nadal station and Torrimar station.

===Rolling stock===

Tren Urbano's fleet consists of 74 Siemens, stainless steel-bodied cars, each [tpl]convert|75|ft|m[/tpl] long. Each vehicle carries 72 seated and 108 standing passengers.  Trains have a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|62|mph|km/h[/tpl], and average [tpl]convert|20.6|mph|km/h[/tpl] including stops. All cars operate as married pairs and up to three pairs will run together at any time. Tren Urbano currently operates 15 trains during rush hours, while the remaining cars stand at the yards or serve as backup should a train experience problems.
Power is provided by AC traction motors, chosen over DC as they contain fewer moving parts and require less maintenance. The trains share many characteristics with the stock built by Siemens for Boston MBTA's Blue Line route.
Air-conditioning systems, have been specially designed to cope with the hot, muggy conditions which are the norm in San Juan.

===Fares===

A single trip costs $0.75 ($0.75 if you transfer from an AMA bus) including a 2 hour bus transfer period. If you exit the station and wish to get back on the train the full fare must be re-paid; there is no train to train transfer period. Students and Seniors (60–74 years old) pay 35 cents per trip. Senior citizens older than 75 and children under 6 ride for free. Several unlimited passes are also available.
A stored-value multi-use farecard may be used for travel on buses as well as on trains. The value on the card is automatically deducted each time it is used. It is a system similar to the Metrocard system used in New York City.

===Security===

All Tren Urbano stations are protected by specialized security units, such as private police companies and the Tren Urbano Police of the Puerto Rico Police Department. 72 law enforcement officers compose the police force of the Tren Urbano Police.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] In August 2009, the Secretary of Transportation and Public Works of Puerto Rico indicated that he will make a Strike Force Unit specialized in terrorist attempts and suspicious activity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]

==Expansion Plans==

The Tren Urbano potentiality with its six–car train set and a minimum headway of 90 seconds, would give a maximum capacity of 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, and compared to the actual peak hour 8 minute headway of 3,000 passengers per hour per direction (actual daily ridership is roughly 40,000 commuters), the train is working at 13.33 per cent capacity, which is well under the 110,000 rail passengers it planned by 2010. 
In addition, with a fleet of 74 rail vehicles in the local yard to cover at least, “double” the 10.7 miles (17.2 km)  system length, and with all the basic facilities and capital equipment needed for the functioning in place, it is indispensable that the train be extended as it was originally intended to include higher-density areas of the central district for it to be operationally successful and sustainable. 
The Puerto Rico's Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTPW) plans include:
