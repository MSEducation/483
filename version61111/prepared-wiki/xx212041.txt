The Turners Falls Road Bridge (officially White Bridge) is a concrete and steel road bridge over the Connecticut River in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It carries Turners Falls Road and connects the town center of Greenfield and the village of Turners Falls (in the town of Montague).

==History==

The current bridge is the second on this site.  Previously, a suspension bridge constructed in 1871 and known as the "Lower Suspension Bridge" was located at the site.[ref]

Miller and K.J.

In the 1920s, Route 2 (former New England Route 7) originally left Greenfield via Turners Falls Road, crossing the old suspension bridge into the village of Turners Falls. Route 2 left Turners Falls via Millers Falls Road. In 1932, a more modern bridge capable of handling the increased automobile traffic, the French King Bridge, opened further upstream and Route 2 was relocated to its modern alignment along French King Highway.Massachusetts Highway Department, French King Bridge The former alignment through Turners Falls was designated as Route 2A. The Route 2A designation remained on Turners Falls Road until the 1960s.Topographic maps show the Route 2A still marked in 1954. A 1972 map no longer shows Route 2A through Turners Falls.
The Massachusetts Highway Department is currently in the planning stages for a rehabilitation project for this bridge.MassHighway project page
