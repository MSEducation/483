Lambert's Cafe, also known as Home of the Throwed Rolls is a restaurant known for its homestyle cooking, "pass arounds", and its "throwed" sic dinner rolls. It is distinguished from other restaurants by its policy of providing large 32 oz. drinks, a list of side items that are passed around to all customers, free refills on nearly all entr√©es, and, most famously, for throwing their homemade dinner rolls to the customers.[tpl]cite news |work=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/10great/2006-05-25-roadside-restaurants_x.htm |title=10 great places to take an exit to good eatin' |date=May 25, 2006[/tpl] Many restaurants have mimicked the "throwed roll" concept, but Lambert's Cafe holds that they are the first restaurant to practice it. The restaurant has three locations: the original in Sikeston, Missouri, and two others in Ozark, Missouri and Foley, Alabama.

==History==

Lambert's Cafe was opened on March 13, 1942 by Earl and Agnes Lambert in a small building on South Main Street in Sikeston, Missouri. It consisted of a nine-stool counter and eight tables for a total seating capacity of 41 people. 
Earl Lambert died in 1976, and his son Norman and wife Patti entered into the restaurant business as partners to Agnes Lambert. On April 20, 1981, Lambert's moved to 2109 East Malone and reopened for business. In 1988, the restaurant moved again to a site conveniently located for travelers along Interstate 55 in Sikeston.
The first roll was thrown in 1976 by Norman Lambert. At the original location, he would walk around and hand out the rolls. One day it was really busy when Norman couldn't get through the crowd....one of the customers yelled to him "Throw the dang thing!" and with that the "Home of Throwed Rolls" was born.
On March 1, 1994, a second Lambert's Cafe was opened near Springfield, Missouri on U.S. Highway 65, Junction CC & J, Ozark, Missouri and on June 24, 1996, the third restaurant was opened in Foley, Alabama.
The Travel Channel named Lambert's Cafe as the "World's Best Place to Pig Out", edging out Beth's Cafe, The Big Texan Steak Ranch, Primanti Brothers, Cluck-U Chicken, and other notable restaurants.[tpl]cite web  |first=Jason |last=Robey |publisher=Travel Channel |title=World's Best Places to Pig Out |accessdate=December 25, 2008 |url=http://www.travelchannel.com/ideas/picks/ci.Lambert's_Cafe.artTravelIdeasFmt?vgnextfmt=artTravelIdeasFmt&ch=0d685934dc165110VgnVCM1000009f183e0aRCRD&initArticlevgnextoid=b10c007f2cee6110VgnVCM100000698b3a0aRCRD[/tpl]
