During these triumphs Capablanca began to suffer symptoms of high blood pressure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Capablanca|first=J.R|year=1939|title=Capablanca Interviewed|journal=El Gráfico|publisher=Edward G.

Capablanca's high blood pressure was not correctly diagnosed and treated until after the AVRO tournament, and caused him to lose his train of thought towards the end of playing sessions. In 1940, Capablanca was found to have extremely dangerous hypertension of 210 systolic/180 diastolic (hypertensive crisis is 180/120 or above, and even after treatment Capablanca had 180/130).Capablanca's Death, chesshistory.com.
After winning at Paris in 1938 and placing second in a slightly stronger tournament at Margate in 1939, Capablanca played for Cuba in the 8th Chess Olympiad, held in Buenos Aires, and won the gold medal for the best performance on the top board. While Capablanca and Alekhine were both representing their countries in Buenos Aires, Capablanca made a final attempt to arrange a World Championship match. Alekhine declined, saying he was obliged to be available to defend his adopted homeland, France, as World War II had just broken out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter28.html#4696._Capablanca_and_Alekhine_in_Buenos|title=4696.

===Death===

On 7 March 1942, Capablanca was observing a skittles game and chatting with friends at the Manhattan Chess Club in New York City, when he asked for help removing his coat, and collapsed shortly afterward. He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he died at 6 a.m. the next morning. The cause of death was given as "a cerebral hemorrhage provoked by hypertension". Not long before his death, his familial hypertension had shot up to the ultra-hazardous 200–240/160+. His doctor strongly advised him that his life was endangered unless he totally relaxed, but Capablanca said that he couldn't because his ex-wife and children had started court proceedings against him. The doctor blamed Capa's death on "his troubles and aggravation."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca13.html|title=Capablanca's Death|last=Winter |first=E.G.|accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl] Capablanca's great rival Emanuel Lasker had died in the same hospital only a year earlier. Capablanca was given a public funeral in Havana's Colón Cemetery on March 15, 1942.
His bitter rival Alekhine wrote in a tribute to Capablanca:
Emanuel Lasker once said: "I have known many chess players, but only one chess genius: Capablanca."

==Assessment==

===Playing strength and style===

As an adult, Capablanca lost only 34 serious games. He was undefeated from February 10, 1916, when he lost to Oscar Chajes in the New York 1916 tournament, to March 21, 1924, when he lost to Richard Réti in the New York International tournament. During this streak, which included his 1921 World Championship match against Lasker, Capablanca played 63 games, winning 40 and drawing 23.[ref]34 losses out of 571 games, according to 
 Edward Winter quotes page 565 of the 1988 edition, which does not include the number of games – 
[/ref] In fact, only Marshall, Lasker, Alekhine and Rudolf Spielmann won two or more serious games from the mature Capablanca, though in each case, their overall lifetime scores were minus (Capablanca beat Marshall +20 −2 =28, Lasker +6 −2 =16, Alekhine +9 −7 =33), except for Spielmann who was level (+2 −2 =8).[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] Of top players, only Keres had a narrow plus score against him [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl] (+1 −0 =5).Capablanca-Keres games. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-02. Keres' win was at the AVRO 1938 chess tournament, during which tournament Capablanca turned 50, while Keres was 22.A.V.R.O. 1938, British Chess Magazine, pp. xiii, 1.
Statistical ranking systems place Capablanca high among the greatest players of all time. Nathan Divinsky and Raymond Keene's book Warriors of the Mind (1989) ranks him fifth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Botvinnik – and immediately ahead of Emanuel Lasker.[ref]
 See the summary list at 
[/ref] In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Capablanca was the strongest of those surveyed, with Lasker and Botvinnik sharing second place.[ref]
 The URL provides greater detail, covering 47 players whom Elo rated, and notes that Bobby Fischer and Anatoly Karpov would have topped the list if the January 1, 1978 FIDE ratings had been included – the FIDE ratings use Elo's system.[/ref] Chessmetrics (2005) is rather sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, and ranks Capablanca between third and fourth strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to fifteen years. Its author, the statistician Jeff Sonas, concluded that Capablanca had more years in the top three than anyone except Lasker, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov – although Alexander Alekhine had more years in the top two positions.[ref]
 Part IV gives links to all three earlier parts.[/ref] A 2006 study claimed to show that Capablanca was the most accurate of all the World Champions when compared with computer analysis of World Championship match games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3455|title=Computers choose: who was the strongest player?|last=Guid|first=M.|coauthors=Bratko, I.|date=December 30, 2006|publisher=Chessbase|accessdate=2009-06-01[/tpl] However, this analysis was criticized for using a second-rank chess program, Crafty, modified to limit its calculations to six moves by each side, and for favoring players whose style matched that of the program. A new 2011 computer analysis by Bratko and Guid using Rybka 2 and Rybka 3 has revealed similar results to those achieved in the 2006 Crafty analysis.
Boris Spassky, World Champion from 1969 to 1972, considered Capablanca the best player of all time.Chess Canada magazine, February 2008, p. 13. Bobby Fischer, who held the title from 1972 to 1975, admired Capablanca's "light touch" and ability to see the right move very quickly. Fischer reported that in the 1950s, older members of the Manhattan Chess Club spoke of Capablanca's performances with awe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3468|title=Fischer on Icelandic Radio|date=November 4, 2006|publisher=Chessbase|accessdate=2009-06-18[/tpl]
Capablanca excelled in simple positions and endgames, and his positional judgment was outstanding, so much so that most attempts to attack him came to grief without any apparent defensive efforts on his part. However, he could play great tactical chess when necessary – most famously in the 1918 Manhattan Chess Club Championship tournament (in New York) where Marshall sprang a deeply analyzed prepared variation on him, which he refuted while playing under the normal time limit (although ways have since been found to strengthen the Marshall Attack).[ref]

===Influence on the game===

Capablanca founded no school per se, but his style was very influential in the games of two world champions: Fischer and Anatoly Karpov. Botvinnik also wrote how much he learned from Capablanca, and pointed out that Alekhine had received much schooling from him in positional play, before their fight for the world title made them bitter enemies.
As a chess writer, Capablanca did not present large amounts of detailed analysis, instead focusing on the critical moments in a game. His writing style was plain and easy to understand. Botvinnik regarded Capablanca's book Chess Fundamentals as the best chess book ever written. Capablanca in a lecture and in his book A Primer of Chess pointed out that while the bishop was usually stronger than the knight, queen and knight was usually better than queen and bishop, especially in endings – the bishop merely mimics the queen's diagonal move, while the knight can immediately reach squares the queen cannot.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca10.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130120070250/http://chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca10.html| title = A Lecture by Capablanca | accessdate = 2010-05-30 | last = Winter | first = Edward | archivedate = 30 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last1 = Capablanca | first1 = Jose Raul | authorlink1 = Capablanca | title = A Primer of Chess | chapter = Synthesis of General Theory | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2002 |page = 202 | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pi37L2kBk4UC&pg=PA202&dq=Queen+and+Knight,+Queen+and+Bishop,+Capablanca&lr=&output=html_text&cd=3 | accessdate = May 2013 | isbn = 0-15-602807-7[/tpl] Research is divided over Capablanca's conclusion: in 2007, Glenn Flear found little difference, while in 1999, Larry Kaufman, analysing a large database of games, concluded that results very slightly favored queen plus knight.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=L.|date=March 1999|title=The Evaluation of Material Imbalances|journal=Chess Life|url=http://home.comcast.net/~danheisman/Articles/evaluation_of_material_imbalance.htm|accessdate=2009-06-01[/tpl] John Watson wrote in 1998 that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages in that specific game.

===Personality===

Early in his chess career, Capablanca had received some criticism, mainly in Britain, for the allegedly conceited description of his accomplishments in his first book, My Chess Career. He therefore took the unprecedented step of including virtually all of his tournament and match defeats up to that time in Chess Fundamentals, together with an instructive group of his victories. Nevertheless his preface to the 1934 edition of Chess Fundamentals is confident that the "reader may therefore go over the contents of the book with the assurance that there is in it everything he needs." However Julius du Mont wrote that he knew Capablanca well and could vouch that he was not conceited. In du Mont's opinion critics should understand the difference between the merely gifted and the towering genius of Capablanca, and the contrast between the British tendency towards modesty and the Latin and American tendency to say "I played this game as well as it could be played" if he honestly thought that it was correct. Capablanca himself said, in his author's note prefacing My Chess Career: "Conceit I consider a foolish thing, but more foolish still is the false modesty that vainly attempts to conceal which all facts tend to prove." Fischer also admired this frankness.
Du Mont also said that Capablanca was rather sensitive to criticism, and chess historian Edward Winter documented a number of examples of self-criticism in My Chess Career.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca.html | title=Capablanca Goes Algebraic | author=Winter, E. | year=1997 [/tpl]
Despite his achievements Capablanca appeared more interested in baseball than in chess, which he described as "not a difficult game to learn and it is an enjoyable game to play."[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.chessarch.com/excavations/0017_capablanca/capablanca.shtml | title=One Man's Mind | author=Reynolds. Q. | journal=Collier's magazine | date=March 2, 1935 [/tpl] His second wife, Olga, thought he resented the way in which chess had dominated his life, and wished he could have studied music or medicine.

==Capablanca chess==

In an interview in 1925 Capablanca denied reports that he thought chess had already currently reached its limit because it was easy for top players to obtain a draw. However he was concerned that the accelerating development of chess technique and opening knowledge might cause such stagnation in 50 years' time. Hence he suggested the adoption of a 10x8 board with 2 extra pieces per side:
He thought this would prevent technical knowledge from becoming such a dominant factor, at least for a few centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca7.html|title=Capablanca on Moscow|last=Winter|first=E.G.|accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl]
Capablanca and Edward Lasker experimented with 10x10 and 10x8 boards, using the same expanded set of pieces. They preferred the 8-rank version as it encouraged combat to start earlier, and their games typically lasted 20 to 25 moves.[tpl]cite journal |last=Trice|first=E. |date=June 2004 |title=80-Square Chess |journal=ICGA Journal |publisher=International Computer Games Association |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=81–95 |url=http://www.gothicchess.com/80.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-04[/tpl] Contrary to the claims of some critics, Capablanca proposed this variant while he was world champion, not as sour grapes after losing his title.[tpl]cite book|last=Winter |first=E.G.|title=Capablanca: A Compendium ...|publisher=McFarland|year=1990|chapter=8: Changing the Rules|isbn=0-89950-455-8[/tpl]
Similar 10x8 variants had previously been described in 1617 by Pietro Carrera and in 1874 by Henry Bird, differing only in how the new pieces were placed in each side's back row. Subsequent variants inspired by Capablanca's experimentation have been proposed, including Grand chess (which uses a 10x10 board and has pawns on the third rank), Gothic Chess, and Embassy Chess (the Grand chess setup on a 10x8 board).
