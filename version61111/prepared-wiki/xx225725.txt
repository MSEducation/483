Hackensack University Medical Center at Pascack Valley (HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley, formerly Hackensack University Medical Center North at Pascack Valley[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.humc.com/north/|title=Hackensack University Medical Center North at Pascack Valley|accessdate=2008-10-07[/tpl]) is a satellite, free-standing emergency department located in Westwood, New Jersey, at the site of the former Pascack Valley Hospital. Owned by Hackensack University Medical Center (HackensackUMC), HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley serves the Pascack Valley community in northern Bergen County, New Jersey.

==History==

After the closure of Pascack Valley Hospital, the site was placed for auction by order of the bankruptcy court judge administering the case. The Touro University College of Medicine, which had plans to open a medical school on the site, had sought to advance the planned March 2008 bidding so that it could meet a requirement for preliminary accreditation. The medical school planned to bid together with Hackensack University Medical Center. The other bidders were a joint offer from Ridgewood's Valley Hospital and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in which urgent care would be offered, but no overnight beds would be maintained. Paradigm Physician Partners planned to reopen the facility as a community hospital with 100 to 150 beds.Washburn, Lindy. "Pascack Valley Hospital auction might be shifted", The Record (Bergen County), February 7, 2008. Accessed November 2, 2008. In a fevered auction at the Newark, New Jersey courtroom, the HackensackUMC / Touro Medical School joint bid of $45 million won the bidding, beating the Valley Hospital / Englewood Hospital effort in 23 rounds of bids; Paradigm Physician Partners and another prospective participant were disqualified from participation.Washburn, Lindy.

In November 2006, HackensackUMC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Pascack Valley Hospital (PVH), located in Westwood, New Jersey, to acquire the hospital from Well Care Group, Inc.HUMC.com HUMC Press Releases: HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER AND PASCACK VALLEY HOSPITAL ENTER INTO MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITION On October 1, 2008, Hackensack University Medical Center North at Pascack Valley opened as, "a satellite emergency department to treat non-life-threatening emergencies."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/Pascack_ER_reopens.html|title=Pascack Valley ER Reopens|last=Washburn|first=Lindy|date=October 1, 2008|work=The Record|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|accessdate=2008-10-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
The reopening plans have been challenged by Englewood Hospital and Medical Center and Valley Hospital, which claim that they would be harmed by the reopened center. A study commissioned by the two opposing hospitals by a healthcare consulting firm concluded that the closing of Pascack Valley Hospital in 2007 benefited the two hospitals "without creating undue hardship to the residents of Bergen County" and that the reopening conflicts with state findings that there are too many hospital beds in Bergen County.Mranarevic, Karen F.
