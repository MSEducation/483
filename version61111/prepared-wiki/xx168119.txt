Proffit’s history dates back to the 1870s when two former slaves, John Coles and Benjamin Brown, purchased some land from former slaveholder W.G. Carr.  In 1876 Ned Brown purchased seventy-five acres in the area as well.  Its settlement began and the community thrived.
Proffit is noted as one of the few African American communities in Albemarle County to survive after the American Civil War. Today it is a quiet residential area whose backbone is the Evergreen Baptist Church.  The Church was built in 1891 by its first pastor, Reverend D.L. Gofney, and continues to be significantly involved in this historic community today.
The historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.
