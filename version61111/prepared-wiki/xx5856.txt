Kalmia latifolia, commonly called mountain-laurel,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?21115|title=Germplasm Resources Information Network: Kalmia latifolia[/tpl]
calico-bush, or spoonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the blueberry family, Ericaceae, that is native to the eastern United States. Its range stretches from southern Maine south to northern Florida, and west to Indiana and Louisiana. Mountain-laurel is the state flower of Connecticut and Pennsylvania. It is the namesake of the city of Laurel, Mississippi (founded 1882).

==Growth==

It is an evergreen shrub growing to 3–9 m tall. The leaves are 3–12 cm long and 1–4 cm wide. Its flowers are round, ranging from light pink to white, and occurring in clusters. There are several named cultivars today that have darker shades of pink, near red and maroon pigment. It blooms in May and June. All parts of the plant are poisonous.  Roots are fibrous and matted.[ref]

The plant is naturally found on rocky slopes and mountainous forest areas. It thrives in acidic soil, preferring a soil pH in the 4.5 to 5.5 range. The plant often grows in large thickets, covering great areas of forest floor.  In North America it can become tree sized on undeveloped mountains of the Carolinas but is a shrub farther north. The species is a frequent component of oak-heath forests.The Natural Communities of Virginia Classification of Ecological Community Groups (Version 2.3), Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, 2010Schafale, M.

==Etymology==

It is also known as Ivybush, Spoonwood (because native Americans used to make their spoons out of it), Sheep Laurel, Lambkill and Clamoun.
The plant was first recorded in America in 1624, but it was named after Pehr Kalm, who sent samples to Linnaeus in the 18th century.

==Cultivation==

The plant was originally brought to Europe as an ornamental plant during the 18th century. It is still widely grown for its attractive flowers. Numerous cultivars have been selected with varying flower color. Many of the cultivars have originated from the Connecticut Experiment Station in Hamden and from the plant breeding of Dr. Richard Jaynes. Jaynes has numerous named varieties that he has created and is considered the world's authority on Kalmia latifolia.[tpl]cite web | title=Mountain Laurel | last=Shreet | first=Sharon | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1082/is_n2_v40/ai_18152569/ | publisher=Flower and Garden Magazine | date=April–May 1996 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Richard A. |title=Kalmia: Mountain Laurel and Related Species |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, OR |year=1997 |isbn=0-88192-367-2[/tpl]

==Wood==

The wood of the mountain laurel is heavy and strong but brittle, with a close, straight grain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/shrub/kallat/all.html#BOTANICAL%20AND%20ECOLOGICAL%20CHARACTERISTICS |title=Species: Kalmia latifolia |work=Fire Effects Information Service |publisher=United States Forest Service |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] It has never been a viable commercial crop as it does not grow large enough, yet it is suitable for wreaths, furniture, bowls and other household items. It was used in the early 19th century in wooden-works clocks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/article1104.shtml |title=The legacy of the Ogee Clock |author=Gene Galbraith |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 3, 2011[/tpl] Burls were used for pipe bowls in place of imported briar burls.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.woodmagazine.com/materials-guide/lumber/wood-species-2/mountain-laurel/ |title=Mountain Laurel |publisher=Wood Magazine.com |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] It can be used for handrails or guard rails.

==Toxicity==

Mountain laurel is poisonous to several different animals due to grayanotoxin[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071128.htm |title=Grayanotoxin |work=Bad Bug Book |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=05/04/2009 |accessdate=Oct 7, 2011[/tpl] and arbutin,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/poison/Kalmila.htm |title=Poisonous Plants: Kalmia latifolia |work=Poisonous Plants of North Carolina |last1=Russell |first1=Alice B. |last2=Hardin |first2=James W. |last3=Grand |first3=Larry |last4=Fraser |first4=Angela |publisher=North Carolina State University |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] including horses,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/Pet-care/poison-control/Plants/mountain-laurel.aspx |title=Mountain Laurel |publisher=ASPCA |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] goats, cattle,  deer,[tpl]cite web |url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/pdf/ec/ec1440.pdf |title=Deer-resistant Ornamental Plants |author=Horton, Jenner L. |author2=Edge, W.Daniel |date=July 1994 |publisher=Oregon State University Extension |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] monkeys and humans. The green parts of the plant, flowers, twigs, and pollen are all toxic, including food products made from them, such as toxic honey that may produce neurotoxic and gastrointestinal symptoms in humans eating more than a modest amount. Fortunately the honey is sufficiently bitter to discourage most people from eating it, whereas it does not harm bees sufficiently to prevent its use as winter bee fodder. Symptoms of toxicity begin to appear about 6 hours following ingestion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://research.vet.upenn.edu/PoisonousPlantsofPA/Kalmialatifolia/tabid/5452/Default.aspx |title=Kalmia latifolia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine |accessdate=Oct 3, 2011[/tpl] Symptoms include irregular or difficulty breathing, anorexia, repeated swallowing, profuse salivation, watering of the eyes and nose, cardiac distress, incoordination, depression, vomiting, frequent defecation, weakness, convulsions, paralysis, coma, and eventually death. Autopsy will show  gastrointestinal irritation and hemorrhage.
