Jeffrey Scott "Jeff" Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scottie Moorhead,Browne (2001), p. 58 was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village, such as Sin-é,  gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labelsBrowne (2001), pp. 171–3 and his father's manager Herb Cohen,Browne (2001), p. 107 he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994. Rolling Stone considered him one of the greatest singers of all time.http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/jeff-buckley-20101202 100 greatest singers of all time - Jeff Buckley

In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue.

===Career beginnings===

Buckley spent the next six years working in a hotel and playing guitar in various struggling bands playing in styles from jazz, reggae, and roots rock to heavy metal.Browne (2001), pp. 99–103 He toured with the dancehall reggae artist Shinehead[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=What was his musical history? |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |date=1998-05-25 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/05musihist.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] and also played the occasional funk and R&B studio session, collaborating with fledgling producer Michael J. Clouse to form X-Factor Productions.Browne (2001), pp. 98–99 Throughout this period, Buckley limited his singing to backing vocals.
He moved to New York City in February 1990,Browne (2001), p. 104 but found few opportunities to work as a musician. He was introduced to Qawwali, the Sufi devotional music of India and Pakistan, and to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, one of its best-known singers.Browne (2001), pp. 106–107 Buckley was an impassioned fan of Khan,[tpl]cite web |last=Young |first=Paul |title=Talking Music: Confessing to Strangers |publisher=Transcribed from Buzz Magazine to jeffbuckley.com|year=1994 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/interviews/buzz.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] and during what he called his "cafe days," he often covered Khan's songs. In January 1996, he interviewed Khan for Interview and wrote liner notes for Khan's Supreme Collection, Vol. 1 compilation.[tpl]cite news |last=Buckley |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Buckley interviews Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan |publisher=Interview Magazine |date=January 1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_n1_v26/ai_17873369 |accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423132958/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_n1_v26/ai_17873369 |archivedate = April 23, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl] Buckley also became interested in blues musician Robert Johnson and hardcore punk band Bad Brains during this time. Buckley moved back to Los Angeles in September when his father's former manager, Herb Cohen, offered to help him record his first demo of original songs. Buckley completed Babylon Dungeon Sessions, a four-song cassette that included the songs "Eternal Life", "Unforgiven" (later titled "Last Goodbye"), "Strawberry Street" (a different version of which appears on the Grace Legacy Edition), and punk screamer "Radio".Browne (2001), p. 205 Cohen and Buckley hoped to attract attention from the music industry with the demo tape.Browne (2001), pp. 108–109
Buckley flew back to New York early the following year to make his public singing debut at a tribute concert for his father called "Greetings from Tim Buckley".Browne (2001), pp. 130–134 The event, produced by show business veteran Hal Willner, was held at St. Ann's Church in Brooklyn on April 26, 1991. Buckley rejected the idea of the concert as a springboard to his career, instead citing personal reasons regarding his decision to sing at the tribute.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=What was Jeff's public debut? |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |date=1998-05-26 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/06debut.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl]  With accompaniment by experimental rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley wrote about an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother.Browne (2001), pp. 136–137 Buckley returned to the stage to play "Sefronia – The King's Chain", "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded the concert with "Once I Was" performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression.[tpl]cite web |last=Arcade |first=Penny |title=Mannish Boy, Setting Sun |publisher=Transcribed from Rolling Stone by pennyarcade.tv |date=June 1997 |url=http://www.pennyarcade.tv/friends/jeff_buckley.html |accessdate=2008-06-20[/tpl] Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd never been able to tell him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects." The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.Browne (2001), p. 138
On subsequent trips to New York in mid-1991, Buckley began co-writing with Gary Lucas resulting in the songs "Grace" and "Mojo Pin",Browne (2001), pp. 140–141 and by late 1991 he began performing with Lucas' band Gods and Monsters around New York City.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=Jeff Buckley Tourography: 1991–1993 |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |year=1999 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/tourography/kfaktourog1.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] After being offered a development deal as a member of Gods and Monsters at Imago Records, Buckley moved back to New York to the Lower East Side at the end of 1991.Browne (2001), p. 142 The day after Gods and Monsters officially debuted in March 1992, Buckley decided to leave the band.Browne (2001), p. 146
Buckley began performing at several clubs and cafés around Lower Manhattan,[tpl]cite web |last=Testa |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Testa|title=Making It In New York: Jeff Buckley |publisher=Transcribed from New Jersey Beat Magazine to jeffbuckley.com |year=1993 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/features/njbeat.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] but Sin-é in the East Village became his main venue. Buckley first appeared at the small Irish café in April 1992,Browne (2001), p. 165 and quickly earned a regular Monday night slot there.Browne (2001), p. 167 His repertoire consisted of a diverse range of folk, rock, R&B, blues and jazz cover songs, much of it music he had newly learned. During this period, he discovered singers such as Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Van Morrison, and Judy Garland.Browne (2001), p. 166 Buckley performed an eclectic selection of covers from a range of artists from Led Zeppelin, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Bob Dylan, Édith Piaf, Elton John, The Smiths, Bad Brains, Leonard Cohen, Robert Johnson and Siouxsie Sioux.Untiedundone.com archives Buckley's version of "Killing Time"  performed at the radio WFMU Studios, East Orange, NJ, 10.11.92 "Killing Time" is a Siouxsie/The Creatures song from the Creatures's Boomerang albumJeffBuckley-fr.net list of songs covered by Jeff Buckley including "Killing Time" composed by Siouxsie for The Creatures. Original songs from the Babylon Dungeon Sessions, and the songs he'd written with Gary Lucas were also included in his set lists. He performed solo, accompanying himself on a borrowed Fender Telecaster. Buckley stated that he learned how to perform onstage from playing to small audiences.
Over the next few months, Buckley attracted admiring crowds and attention from record label executives.Browne (2001), pp. 170–71 Industry maven Clive Davis even dropped by to see him. By the summer of 1992, limos from executives eager to sign the singer lined the street outside Sin-é. Buckley signed with Columbia Records, home of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen,Browne (2001), p. 174 for a three-album, essentially million-dollar deal in October 1992.Browne (2001), pp. 173, 177–179  Buckley spent three days in February 1993 in the studio with engineer Steve Addabbo and Columbia A&R man, Steve Berkowitz, recording much of Buckley's solo repertoire. Buckley sang a cappella and also accompanied himself on acoustic and electric guitars, Wurlitzer electric piano, and harmonium. Much of this material(not recordings) later surfaced on the "Grace" album,.Browne (2001) These tapes remain unreleased in the Columbia vaults.  Recording dates were set for July and August 1993 for what would become Buckley's recording debut, an EP of four songs which included a cover of Van Morrison's "The Way Young Lovers Do".Browne (2001), pp. 199–200 Live at Sin-é was released on November 23, 1993, documenting this period of Buckley's life.Browne (2001), p. 223

===Grace===

In mid-1993, Buckley began working on his first album with record producer Andy Wallace. Buckley assembled a band, composed of bassist Mick Grøndahl and drummer Matt Johnson, and spent several weeks rehearsing.Browne (2001), pp. 201–203[tpl]cite web |title=Grace album info |publisher=Transcribed from Sony Music Entertainment Inc. to jeffbuckley.com|date=1994-08-23 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/album.asp?SecID=2#info |accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071020025449/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/album.asp?SecID=2|archivedate=2007-10-20[/tpl] In September, the trio headed to Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York to spend six weeks recording basic tracks for what would become Grace. Buckley invited ex-bandmate Lucas to play guitar on the songs "Grace" and "Mojo Pin", and Woodstock-based jazz musician Karl Berger wrote and conducted string arrangements with Buckley assisting at times.Browne (2001), pp. 204–208 Buckley returned home for overdubbing at studios in Manhattan and New Jersey where he performed take after take to capture the perfect vocals and experimented with ideas for additional instruments, and added textures to the songs.Browne (2001), pp. 224–226
In January 1994, Buckley left to go on his first solo North American tour to support Live at Sin-é. It was followed by a 10-day European tour in March.Browne (2001), p. 230 Buckley played clubs and coffeehouses and made in-store appearances. After returning, Buckley invited guitarist Michael Tighe to join the band and a collaboration between the two resulted in "So Real", a song which was recorded as a late addition to the album.Browne (2001), p. 227Browne (2001), p. 228 In June, Buckley began his first full band tour called the "Peyote Radio Theatre Tour" that lasted into August.[tpl]cite web |title=Jeff Buckley Biography |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/bio.asp |accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017212001/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/bio.asp|archivedate=2007-10-17[/tpl] Pretender Chrissie Hynde,Browne (2001), p. 231 Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, and The Edge from U2Browne (2001), p. 251 were among the attendees of these early shows.

A gig on September 24 in New York dovetailed on to the end of the European tour and Buckley and band spent the next month relaxing and rehearsing.[tpl]cite web|title=Past tour dates|publisher=jeffbuckley.com|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/news.asp?id=10|accessdate=2010-03-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080409161821/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/news.asp?id=10|archivedate=2008-04-09[/tpl]
A tour of Canada and the U.S. began on October 19, 1994 at CBGB's. The tour was far reaching with concerts held on both east and west coasts of the U.S., and a number of performances in central and southern states. The tour ended two months later on December 18 at Maxwell's in New Jersey. After another month of rest and rehearsal, the band commenced a second European tour, this time mainly for promotion purposes. The band began the tour in Dublin; Buckley has remained particularly popular in Ireland.[tpl]cite web |title=Jeff Buckley's So Real Grows Internationally |publisher=Legacy Recordings |date=2007-06-12 |url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=375c5bca-6900-44ee-872d-df5491f78e66 |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] The short tour largely consisted of promotional work in London and Paris.
In late January, the band did their first tour of Japan, playing concerts and appearing for promotion of the album and newly released Japanese single "Last Goodbye".  The band returned to Europe on February 6 and toured various Western European countries before returning to the U.S. on March 6. Among the gigs performed during this period, Buckley and his band performed at a 19th-century-built French venue, the Bataclan, and material from the concert was recorded and later released in October of that year as a four track EP, Live from the Bataclan. Also, songs from a performance on February 25, at the venue Nighttown in Rotterdam, were subsequently released as a promotional-only CD, So Real.
Touring recommenced in April with dates across the U.S. and Canada. During this period Buckley and the band notably played Metro in Chicago, which was recorded on video and later released as Live in Chicago on VHS and later on DVD. In addition, on June 4 they played at Sony Music Studios for the Sony Music radio hour. Following this was a month long European tour between June 20 and July 18 in which they played many summer music festivals. During the tour, Buckley played two concerts at the Paris Olympia, a venue made famous by the French vocalist Édith Piaf. Although he had failed to fill out smaller American venues at that point of his career, both nights at the large Paris Olympia venue were sold out.Liner notes, Live a L'Olympia. Jeff Buckley (2001). Shortly after this Buckley attended the Festival de la Musique Sacrée (Festival of Sacred Music), also held in France, and performed "What Will You Say" as a duet with Alim Qasimov, an Azerbaijani mugham singer. Sony BMG has since released a live album, 2001's Live à L'Olympia, which has a selection of songs from both Olympia performances and the collaboration with Qasimov.Shiel, Christopher (2001-10-01).

Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour, playing concerts in both Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, lasted between August 28 and September 6 and recordings of these performances were compiled and released on the live album Mystery White Boy. Buckley was so well received during these concerts that his album Grace went gold in Australia, selling over 35,000 copies, and taking this into account he decided a longer tour was needed and returned for a tour of New Zealand and Australia in February the following year.
Between the two Oceanian tours Buckley and the band took a break from touring. Buckley played solo in the meantime with concerts at Sin-é and a New Year's Eve concert at Mercury Lounge in New York. After the break, the band spent the majority of February on the Hard Luck Tour in Australia and New Zealand, but tensions had risen between the group and drummer Matt Johnson. The concert on March 1, 1996 was the last gig he played with Buckley and his band.
Much of the material from the tours of 1995 and 1996 was recorded and released on either promotional EPs, such as the Grace EP, or posthumously on albums, such as Mystery White Boy (a reference to Buckley not using his real name) and Live a L'Olympia. Many of the other concerts Buckley played during this period have surfaced on bootleg recordings.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=The Jeff Buckley Discography: Bootlegs |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/discography/bootlegs.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl]
Following Johnson's departure, the band, now without a drummer, was put on hold and did not perform live again until February 12, 1997.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=Jeff Buckley Tourography |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/tourography/kfaktourog6.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] Due to the pressure from extensive touring, Buckley spent the majority of the year away from the stage. However, from May 2 to May 5 he played a short stint as bass guitarist with Mind Science of the Mind, with friend Nathan Larson, then guitarist of Shudder to Think. Buckley returned to playing live concerts when he went on his "phantom solo tour" of cafés in the Northeast in December 1996, appearing under a series of aliases: The Crackrobats, Possessed by Elves, Father Demo, Smackrobiotic, The Halfspeeds, Crit-Club, Topless America, Martha & the Nicotines, and A Puppet Show Named Julio. By way of justification, Buckley posted a note on his Internet site stating that he missed the anonymity of playing in cafes and local bars:
[tpl]quote|There was a time in my life not too long ago when I could show up in a cafe and simply do what I do, make music, learn from performing my music, explore what it means to me, i.e., have fun while I irritate and/or entertain an audience who don't know me or what I am about. In this situation I have that precious and irreplaceable luxury of failure, of risk, of surrender. I worked very hard to get this kind of thing together, this work forum. I loved it and then I missed it when it disappeared. All I am doing is reclaiming it.[tpl]cite web |last=Van De Kamp |first=Bert |title=Jeff Buckley 1966–1997 |publisher=Trascribed from OOR Magazine to jeffbuckley.com|date=1997-06-14 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/tributes/oor14jun97.html |accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102024108/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/tributes/oor14jun97.html|archivedate=2008-01-02[/tpl][/tpl]

===Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk===

After completing touring in 1996, Buckley started to write for a new album to be called My Sweetheart the Drunk. Buckley worked with Patti Smith on her 1996 album Gone Again and met fellow collaborater Tom Verlaine, the lead singer for the punk band Television. Buckley asked Verlaine to be producer on the new album and he agreed.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=Sketches |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |date=1998-07-20 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/17sketches.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] In the middle of 1996, Buckley and his band began recording sessions in Manhattan with Verlaine. Eric Eidel played the drums through these sessions as a stop-gap between the dates drummer Matt Johnson left and before Parker Kindred joined as full-time drummer.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane|first=Rebecca|title=Who were the members of Jeff's band? |publisher=jeffbuckley.com|date=1999-05-17|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/08band.html |accessdate=2008-05-05[/tpl] Around this time Buckley met Inger Lorre of The Nymphs in an East Village bar,Browne (2001), p. 283 and struck up a fast and close friendship.  Together, they contributed a track to Kerouac: Kicks Joy Darkness, a Jack Kerouac tribute album.  After Lorre's backup guitarist for an upcoming album quit the project, Buckley offered to fill in.Browne (2001), p. 296  He became very attached to one of the songs from the album, "Yard of Blonde Girls", and covered it on Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk.Browne (2001), p.315 Another recording session in Manhattan followed in early 1997, but Buckley and the band were unsatisfied and the album was not considered finished.
On February 4, 1997, Buckley played a short set at The Knitting Factory's tenth anniversary concert featuring a selection of his new songs: "Jewel Box", "Morning Theft", "Everybody Here Wants You", "The Sky is a Landfill" and "Yard of Blonde Girls".Browne (2001), p. 299 Lou Reed was there to watch  and expressed an interest in working with Buckley. The band played their first gig with Parker Kindred, their new drummer, at Arlene's Grocery in New York on February 9. This set featured much of Buckley's new material that would appear on Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk and a recording has become one of Buckley's most widely distributed bootlegs.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=What Is Arlene's? |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |date=1999-04-19 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/20arlenes.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] Later that month, Buckley recorded a spoken word reading of the Edgar Allan Poe poem, "Ulalume", for the album Closed on Account of Rabies.[tpl]cite web |last=Willner |first=Hal |title=Closed on the Account of Rabies liner notes |publisher=parisrecords.net |date=August 1997 |url=http://www.parisrecords.net/t-closedonaccountofrabies.aspx |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] This would be his last recording in New York; shortly after, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee.
Buckley became interested in recording at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, at the suggestion of friend Dave Shouse from the Grifters.Browne (2001), p. 294 He rented a shotgun house there, of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it.Browne (2001), p. 1 Throughout this period, February 12 to May 26, 1997, Buckley played at Barristers', a bar located in downtown Memphis underneath a parking garage in an alley off of Jefferson Avenue. He played numerous times in order to work through the new material in a live atmosphere, at first with the band then solo as part of a Monday night residency.[tpl]cite web |last=Kane |first=Rebecca |title=Why is Barristers' Significant?  |publisher=jeffbuckley.com |date=1998-06-01 |url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/23barristers.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] In early February, Buckley and the band did a third recording session with Verlaine, in Memphis, but Buckley expressed his dissatisfaction with the sessions and later called Grace producer, Andy Wallace, to step in as Verlaine's replacement. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder in preparation for a forthcoming session with Wallace. Some of these demos were sent to his band in New York, who listened to them enthusiastically, and were excited to resume working on the album. These recordings would go on to compose the second disc of Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk. However Buckley was not entirely happy with the results and he sent his band back to New York while he stayed behind to work on the songs. The band was scheduled to return to Memphis for rehearsals and recording sessions on May 29.

===Death===

On the evening of May 29, 1997, Buckley's band flew to Memphis intending to join him in his studio there to work on the newly written material. That same evening, Buckley went swimming in Wolf River Harbor,[tpl]cite web |title=Biography from The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Simon and Schuster, 2001) |publisher=Rolling Stone |year=2001 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jeffbuckley/biography |accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622104631/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jeffbuckley/biography|archivedate=2008-06-22[/tpl] a slack water channel of the Mississippi River, while wearing boots, all of his clothing, and singing the chorus of the song "Whole Lotta Love" by Led Zeppelin.[tpl]cite web |last=Schruers |first=Fred |title=River's Edge |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1997-08-07 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jeffbuckley/articles/story/14925058/rivers_edge |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2010[/tpl] Buckley had gone swimming there several times before.Browne (2001), p. 321  A roadie in Buckley's band, Keith Foti, remained on shore.

Despite a determined rescue effort that night, Buckley remained missing. On June 4,  two locals spotted his body in the Wolf River near a riverboat, and he was brought to land.
Buckley's autopsy showed no signs of drugs or alcohol in his system and the death was ruled as an accidental drowning. The following statement was released from the Buckley estate:
[tpl]quote|Jeff Buckley's death was not "mysterious," related to drugs, alcohol, or suicide.

The Guardian. 26 November 2009
PJ Harvey's song "Memphis", a b-side to "Good Fortune", commemorates Buckley's death. Glen Hansard wrote "Neath the Beeches" in memory of Buckley; it appears on the album Dance the Devil by Hansard's band The Frames.
Rufus Wainwright's song "Memphis Skyline", released in 2004, is a tribute to Jeff Buckley.

==Musical style==

Buckley's voice was a particularly distinguished aspect of his music. He possessed a tenor vocal range,Vocal range. BBC Bitesize. Retrieved on 2012-02-13. he had a vocal range of between three and a half to four octaves. Buckley made full use of this range in his performance, particularly in the songs from Grace, and reached peaks of high G in the tenor range at the culmination of "Grace". "Corpus Christi Carol" was sung entirely in a high falsetto. The pitch and volume of his singing was also highly variable, as songs such as "Mojo Pin" and "Dream Brother" began with mid-range quieter vocals before reaching louder, higher peaks near the ending of the songs.Jeff's vocal style and range. Jeff Buckley. Retrieved on 2012-02-13.Dillon, Jared W. (2006-05-26). Jeff Buckley Grace. Sputnik Music. Retrieved on 2012-02-13.
Buckley played guitar in a variety of styles ranging from the distorted rock of "Sky is a Landfill", to the jazz of "Strange Fruit", the country styling of "Lost Highway", and the guitar picking style in "Hallelujah". He occasionally used slide guitar in live performances as a solo act and used a slide for the introduction of "Last Goodbye" when playing with a full band. His songs were written in various guitar tunings which, apart from the EADGBE standard tuning, included Drop D tuning and an Open G tuning. His guitar playing style varied from highly melodic songs, such as "Twelfth Of Never", to more percussive ones, such as "New Year's Prayer".Jeff Buckley: Grace and Other Songs-Guitar Tab Edition-Music Book.

===Equipment===

Buckley used several guitars, but mainly played a 1983 Fender Telecaster and a Rickenbacker 360/12. When touring with his band he used Fender Amplifiers for a clean sound and Mesa Boogie for overdriven tones. He was primarily a singer and guitarist; however, he also played other instruments on various studio recordings and sessions, including bass, dobro, mandolin, harmonium (intro to "Lover, You Should've Come Over"), organ, dulcimer ("Dream Brother" intro), tabla, esraj, harmonica.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/pages/node/114 | title=What comprised Jeff's gear? | publisher=jeffbuckley.com | accessdate=October 4, 2010[/tpl]

==Legacy==

After Buckley's death, a collection of demo recordings and a full-length album he had been reworking for his second album were released as Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk — the compilation being overseen by his mother, Mary Guibert, band members and old friend Michael J. Clouse, as well as Chris Cornell.

On March 7, 2008, Buckley’s version of the Leonard Cohen song, “Hallelujah”, went to No. 1 on the iTunes chart, selling 178,000 downloads for the week, after being performed by Jason Castro on the seventh season of the television series American Idol.[tpl]cite web |last=Willman |first=Chris |title=Chart Watch: Alan Jackson, late Jeff Buckley top the charts |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/03/alan-jackson-je.html |accessdate=2008-06-13[/tpl] The song debuted at #1 that week on Billboard[tpl]'[/tpl]s Hot Digital Songs chart, giving Buckley his first #1 on any Billboard chart.
In a similar vein, the 2008 UK X Factor winner, Alexandra Burke, released a cover of "Hallelujah" with the intent to top the UK Singles Chart as the Christmas number one single.
