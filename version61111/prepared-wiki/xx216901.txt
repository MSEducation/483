Lactarius blennius (commonly known as the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a medium-sized mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It has been the subject of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L. blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.

==Taxonomy and naming==

Lactarius blennius was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus blennius in 1815, before being given its current binomial name by the same author in 1838. Within the genus Lactarius, it is closely related to Lactarius cinereus, another Lactarius species that also favours beech. It has been suggested that the two species (forming a group) could have a coevolutionary pathway with beech. The specific epithet is derived from a Latin adjective blennius, meaning "slimy".[tpl]cite book | last = Nilson|first= Sven |coauthors= Olle Persson | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 100[/tpl] Lactarius mushrooms are commonly known as milkcaps,[tpl]cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author= Sterry, Paul; Hughes, Barry|year= 2009|publisher= HarperCollins|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 52[/tpl] and L. blennius is known as the Slimy Milkcap or the Beech Milkcap.
Lactarius blennius is synonymous with Agaricus blennius (the name under which Fries first described the species in 1815) and Agaricus viridis, a name given earlier by Heinrich Schrader, in 1794. Galorrheus blennius (a name proposed in 1871 by Paul Kummer), Lactarius viridis (proposed in 1888 by Lucien Quélet) and Lactifluus blennius (proposed by Otto Kuntze in 1891) are also now recognised as synonyms.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=219169|title= Lactarius blennius synonymy|publisher= Index Fungorum|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] Lactarius albidopallens was originally described as a form of L. blennius as Lactarius blennius f. albidopallens by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1928, before being classified as a separate species by J. Blum.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/HomoSpecies.asp?RecordID=258570|title= Lactarius blennius f. albidopallens|publisher= Index Fungorum|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] Lange also described Lactarius blennius f. virescens, which is now recognised as nomen invalidum (an invalid name).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=118004|title= Lactarius blennius f. virescens|publisher= Index Fungorum|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] Lactarius fluens is another species that has been included in L. blennius; originally described in 1899 by Jean Louis Émile Boudier, in 1999, German Joseph Krieglsteiner suggested that it is actually a variety of L. blennius, naming it Lactarius blennius var. fluens.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=459444|title= Lactarius blennius var. fluens|publisher= Index Fungorum|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl] The situation with Lactarius viridis is similar; first described as a separate species by Quélet in 1888, A. Marchand proposed that it is in fact a variety of L. blennius, naming it Lactarius blennius var. viridis.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=456054|title= Lactarius blennius var. viridis|publisher= Index Fungorum|accessdate=12 September 2010[/tpl]

==Description==

Lactarius blennius has a flattened convex cap that is 4–10 cm (1.6–4 in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale olive to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-sepia, and has blotches of darker colouration in concentric bands,[tpl]cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= Pan Books|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 83[/tpl] though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known, and a very brown specimen similar to Lactarius circellatus was recorded in Scotland.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.2307/4113927 |author= Dennis, Richard William George|year= 1955|title= The Larger Fungi in the North-West Highlands of Scotland|journal= Kew Bulletin|publisher= Springer|volume= 10|issue= 1|pages= 111–26|issn= 00755974 |jstor= 4113927[/tpl] The cap is very slimy when moist and has a margin that is curved inwards. The stem is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5 cm (1.6–2 in) tall by 1–1.7 cm (0.4–0.7 in) thick, tapering a little towards the bottom.[tpl]cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David N.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley Publishing|location= London|isbn= 0-85533-500-9|page= 115[/tpl] The flesh is whitish, similar in colour to the gills, which later become a creamy or pale buff colour. The gills turn a brownish-grey colour when wounded, and are crowded. In shape, they are slightly decurrent or adnate, meaning that they run a small way down the stem in attachment, or that they are attached to the stem by the whole depth of the gills. The milk is white and dries grey, and is very plentiful. L. blennius spores leave a creamy print, and are elliptic with low warts joined by ridges with a small number of cross-connections, measuring from 6–9 by 5.5–7 µm.

==Distribution, habitat and ecology==

Lactarius blennius is very common and is found in broad-leaved woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the European Beech,[tpl]cite journal|doi= 10.2307/3793379|author= Bills, Gerald F.|title= Notes on Lactarius in the High-Elevation Forests of the Southern Appalachians|year= 1986|journal= Mycologia|publisher= Mycological Society of America|volume= 78|issue=1|pages= 70–9|issn= 00275514|jstor= 3793379[/tpl] though it has also been observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees,[tpl]cite journal|doi= 10.1007/BF02868758|author= Trappe, James M.|title= Fungus Associates of Ectotrophic Mycorrhizae|journal=Botanical Review|volume=28|issue= 4|pages= 538–606|year= 1962|issn=00068101[/tpl] and can grow on a wide variety of subsoil types,[tpl]cite journal|doi= 10.2307/1930998|author= Bridge Cook, William|title= A Survey of Literature on Fungus Sociology and Ecology|journal= Ecology|publisher= Ecological Society of America|year= 1948|volume=29|issue=3|issn= 00129658|pages= 376–82|jstor= 1930998[/tpl] but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of beech. In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other areas in which it has been recorded include Sweden,[tpl]cite journal|author= Rühling, Åke; Tyler, Germund|title= Soil Factors Influencing the Distribution of Macrofungi in Oak Forests of Southern Sweden|journal= Holarctic Ecology|volume= 13|issue=1|pages=11–8|issn= 01059327[/tpl] France,[tpl]cite journal|author1= France, Société Botanique de|author2= (france), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|title= Plantes cryptogames de France|language= French|journal= Bulletin de la Société botanique de France|volume= 3|year= 1856|url=http://books.google.com/?id=u4sVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&dq=%22Lactarius+blennius%22#v=onepage&q=%22Lactarius%20blennius%22&f=false|page=72|accessdate= 12 September 2010[/tpl] Italy,[tpl]cite journal|author= Bargagli, R.; Baldi, F.|title= Mercury and methyl mercury in higher fungi and their relation with the substrata in a cinnabar mining area|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(84)90065-1|journal= Chemosphere|year= 1984|pages= 1059–71|volume=13|issue= 9[/tpl] and Poland.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1002/fedr.19951060324|title=Ecological groups of macrofungi in beech forests on Czȩestochowa Upland, Southern Poland|author= Adamczyk, J.|journal= Feddes Repertorium|volume= 106|issue= 3-4|pages= 303–15|year= 1995[/tpl]

==Uses==

Mycologist Roger Phillips claims that L. blennius is edible when cooked, but not recommended, while others describe it as inedible or even poisonous.[tpl]cite book |title= Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the World|last= Hall|first= Ian Robert|url= http://books.google.com/?id=yqHA_M7BVRcC&pg=PA156&dq=%22Lactarius+blennius%22|accessdate= 12 September 2010|coauthors= Buchanan, Peter K.; Stephenson, Steven L.; Yun, Wang; Cole, Anthony L. J.|year= 2003|publisher= Timber Press|isbn= 978-0-88192-586-9|page= 156[/tpl] The milk tastes very hot and acrid.
L. blennius has been the subject of some research in chemistry. Lactarane derivatives (known as "blennins") have been acquired from the mushroom, including the lactone blennin D,[tpl]cite book |title= Terpenes|last= Breitmaier|first= Eberhand|url= http://books.google.com/?id=Zu3No7HWS8wC&pg=PA44&dq=Lactarius+blennius|accessdate= 12 September 2010|year= 2007|publisher= Wiley-VCH|isbn= 978-3-527-60910-9|page= 44[/tpl] and blennin A, which was first isolated from this species.[tpl]cite journal |last= Lorenzen|first= K.|coauthors= Anke, T.|year= 1998|title= Basidiomycetes as a Source for New Bioactive Natural Products|journal= Current Organic Chemistry|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 329–54|url= http://books.google.com/?id=aI_3BDcYKXgC&pg=PA348&dq=Lactarius+blennius+blennin|accessdate= 12 September 2010|issn= 1385-2728 |publisher= Bentham Science Publishers[/tpl] Lactaranes are chemicals so named because of their occurrence in Lactarius species. Blennins have been shown to be potentially useful- blennin A, for instance (a lactarane-type sesquiterpene) has been shown to be an anti-inflammatory, having a strong inhibitative affect against leukotriene C4 biosynthesis. L. blennius can also be refined to create a green pigment, known as blennione.[tpl]cite journal |last= Spiteller|first= Peter|coauthors= Steglich, Wolfgang|year= 2002|title= Blennione, a green aminobenzoquinone derivative from Lactarius blennius|journal= Journal of Natural Products|volume= 65|issue= 5|pages= 725–27 |doi= 10.1021/np0106541[/tpl]
