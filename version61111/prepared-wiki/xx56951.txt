Hughes Airwest [tpl]Airline codes|RW| n/a |Hughes-Air[/tpl] was an airline in the western United States, backed by the Summa Corporation of Howard Hughes. Hughes Airwest flew routes in the western U.S. and to a few cities in Mexico and Canada; it was  purchased by Republic Airlines on October 1, 1980. Its headquarters were on the grounds of San Francisco International Airport in unincorporated San Mateo County, California."World Airline Directory." Flight International. April 28, 1979. 1379.

==History==

On April 17, 1968 three "local service" airlines in the western U.S. merged to form Air West:[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8mQhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JIcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4770,3404180 |newspaper=Tri-City Herald|agency=Associated Press|title=Air West merger legally complete|date=April 18, 1968|page=3[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8KVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WDIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5036,5115162 |newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|last=Campbell |first=Thomas W. |title=Another merger: now itâ€™s Air West |date=April 28, 1968|page=21[/tpl]
The initial Air West fleet included Boeing 727-100s, Douglas DC-9s, F-27s, and Piper Navajos.  The first new type was a Douglas DC-9-30 that had been ordered by Bonanza Air Lines. Hughes Airwest became an all-jet airline around 1979 with Boeing 727-200s and DC-9s and merged with Republic Airlines in 1980.
Hungry for another adventure in the airline industry, TWA's former owner Howard Hughes sought the airline in 1968,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AclOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YkkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6917,2603821 |newspaper=Deseret News|title=Hughes may buy Air West|agency=UPI|date=August 12, 1967|page=6C[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=avFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p4IMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5028,5643083 |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|last=Arnold|first=Patrick|agency=Associated Press|title=Hughes charged with stock fraud|page=1|date=July 31, 1974[/tpl] and the deal was finalized in 1970.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c2NOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MkwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4762,111916|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|agency=UPI|title=Air West purchase almost completed|date=April 2, 1970|page=8[/tpl] The airline was renamed Hughes Air West and its call sign became "Hughes Air." It expanded to several cities in the western United States, Canada and Mexico. With the new yellow paint scheme, unveiled 28 September 1971, the airline began calling itself Hughes Airwest, two words.
The airline participated in some movies in the 1970s, most notably The Gauntlet with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke in 1977. Eastwood's character arrives in Las Vegas from Phoenix on the airline and when he later phones the airport for flight departure times, Locke's character sarcastically called the airline, "Air Worst."
Like other local service airlines in the 1970s, Hughes Airwest eliminated many stops and opened longer routes. Service expanded to resorts in Mexico; domestic routes didn't reach east of Utah and Arizona until Denver, Des Moines, Milwaukee, and Houston Hobby Airport were added in 1978.
In September 1979 the airline was grounded for two months by a walkout by their ticket agents, reservations  handlers, and office employees, who had been without a contract for over a year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I1tOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J_kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3870,2548519|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|title=Airwest strike effect minimal|date=September 11, 1979|page=5[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pKtfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rzIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6097,5417915|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=No talks in Airwest strike|date=September 29, 1979|page=2A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_2VJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nAoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2737,2413684|newspaper=News and Courier|location=Charleston, SC|agency=Associated Press|title=Hughes Airwest flights resume after strike|date=November 11, 1979|page=2A[/tpl] During 1979 several airlines showed interest in buying Hughes Airwest, including Alaska and Allegheny, with the latter soon becoming USAir.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UspeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YjIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2244,42763|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=Associated Press|title=Airwest entertains offers to sell|date=October 1, 1979 |page=1B[/tpl] The strike was resolved in late October and flights resumed in November.

==Corporate affairs==

The headquarters were originally in two buildings in downtown San Mateo County, California.[tpl]clarify|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Its new headquarters were located in San Mateo.Standard & Poor's Register of Corporations, Directors and Executives, Volume 3. Standard & Poor's Corporation, 1976. p. 638. "Hughes Air Corp d/b/a Hughes Airwest Airlines, 3125 Clearview Way, San Mateo, Cal." The airline scheduled the move to a new headquarters from Thursday August 25, 1973 to August 28, 1973. The complex was on a hill overlooking San Mateo and San Francisco. The airline planned to move in two departments from the offices at San Francisco International Airport: flight control and reservations."'Big Move' under way to new international headquarters in San Mateo."

==Livery==

Hughes Airwest's planes were recognizable by their banana-yellow fuselage and tail colors.Hughes promoted their new colors as "Sundance Yellow" and "Universe Blue."  The blue has sometimes been described as purple, but this is an optical illusion when viewed on the yellow expanse of aircraft hull.  Since these were not standards-compliant color names, the exact color values are uncertain, and can only be approximated by examining color photographs of Hughes Airwest aircraft. Their airplanes were often dubbed "flying bananas" and the airline launched an advertising campaign with the catchphrase "Top Banana in the West."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wCJZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NH8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3502,6737762 |newspaper=Deseret News|title=Now, "Top Banana" service|agency=advertisement|date=June 29, 1976|page=16A[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uyJZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NH8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6184%2C5208764|newspaper=Deseret News|title=Top Banana in the West|agency=advertisement|date=June 22, 1976[/tpl]
[tpl]cite journal|magazine=Aopa pilot|date=July 2011[/tpl] Most nicknames given to Hughes Airwest airplanes in aviation books and magazines have to do with bananas. Apart from their all-yellow scheme, the airplanes also featured a blue logo on the vertical stabilizer (tail) that resembled three diamonds connected (possibly a reference to the initials of Howard Hughes). The name Hughes Airwest, in stylized lettering, was featured unconventionally below the front passenger windows.
