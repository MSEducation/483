[[13 (number)]]

CATEGORIES: Integers, Numerology, Triskaidekaphobia, Superstitions about numbers

13 (thirteen [tpl]IPAc-en|θ|ɜr|'|t|i:|n[/tpl]) is the natural number following 12 and preceding 14.
In spoken English, the numbers 13 and 30 are often confused. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 13 [tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-us-thirteen.ogg|θ|ər|ˈ|t|iː|n[/tpl] vs. 30 [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɜr|t|i[/tpl]. However, in dates such as 1300 ("thirteen hundred") or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as 13, 14, 15, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 13 [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|ɜr|t|iː|n[/tpl].
Strikingly similar folkloric aspects of the number 13 have been noted in various cultures around the world: one theory is that this is due to the cultures employing lunar-solar calendars (there are approximately 12.41 lunations per solar year, and hence 12 "true months" plus a smaller, and often portentous, thirteenth month). This can be witnessed, for example, in the "Twelve Days of Christmas" of Western European tradition.Frazier, King of the Bean, and the Festival of Fools. Cited in Thompson, Tok. 2002. The thirteenth number: Then, there/ here and now. 'Studia Mythological Slavica '5''', 145–159.

===List of basic calculations===

===Grammar===

===Spelling===

In Germany, according to an old rule, 13 as the first compound number was the first number written in digits; the numbers 0 through 12 were spelled out. The Duden (the German standard dictionary) now calls this rule outdated and no longer valid, but many writers still follow it.
For the English language, different systems are used: Sometimes it is recommended to spell out numbers up to and including nine or ten or twelve, like formerly in German, or even ninety-nine or one hundred. Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (sixteen, twenty-seven, fifteen thousand, but 372 or 15,001 ).

===Judaism===

===Zoroastrianism===

The number 13 had been considered sinister and wicked in ancient Iranian civilization and Zoroastrianism. Since beginning of the Nourooz tradition, the 13th day of each new Iranian year is called Sizdah Be-dar, and this tradition is still alive among Iranian people both within modern Iran and abroad. Since Sizdah Be-dar is the 13th day of the year, it is considered a day when evil's power might cause difficulties for people. Therefore people leave  urban areas for one day and camp in the countryside. Even in the current post-1979 Revolution era, and despite the wishes of Islamic government, this tradition continues to be practiced by the majority of the population throughout Iran.

The number 13 is considered an unlucky number in some countries.http://urbanlegends.about.com/cs/historical/a/friday_the_13th.htm Charles Stewart Parnell had an irrational fear of the number thirteen.Parnell, John Howard Charles Stewart Parnell: A Memoir New York Henry Holt and Company 1914 page 264 The end of the Mayan calendar's 13th Baktun was superstitiously feared as a harbinger of the apocalyptic 2012 phenomenon.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/story/2011-11-24/mexico-apocalypse-2012-mayans/51387348/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=November 24, 2011[/tpl] Fear of the number 13 has a specifically recognized phobia, Triskaidekaphobia, a word coined in 1911. The superstitious sufferers of triskaidekaphobia try to avoid bad luck by keeping away from anything numbered or labelled thirteen. As a result, companies and manufacturers use another way of numbering or labeling to avoid the number, with hotels and tall buildings being conspicuous examples (thirteenth floor).[tpl]cite news |last=Fleischman |first =Sid |title=The 13th Floor: A Ghost Story |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/18/AR2007081800890.html |publisher=The Washington Post Company |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |date=August 19, 2007[/tpl] It's also considered unlucky to have thirteen guests at a table. Friday the 13th has been considered the unluckiest day of the month.

There are a number of theories behind the cause of the association between thirteen and bad luck, but none of them have been accepted as likely.

====The Last Supper====

At Jesus Christ's last supper, there were thirteen people around the table, counting Christ and the twelve apostles. Some believe this unlucky because one of those thirteen, Judas Iscariot, was the betrayer of Jesus Christ.

====Knights Templar====

On Friday 13 October 1307, King Philip IV of France ordered the arrest of the Knights Templar., and most of the knights were tortured and killed.

====Full moons====

A year with 13 full moons instead of 12 posed problems for the monks in charge of the calendars. "This was considered a very unfortunate circumstance, especially by the monks who had charge of the calendar of thirteen months for that year, and it upset the regular arrangement of church festivals. For this reason thirteen came to be considered an unlucky number."http://www.space.com/9566-strange-story-sunday-blue-moon.html
However, a typical century has about 37 years that have 13 full moons, compared to 63 years with 12 full moons, and typically every third or fourth year has 13 full moons.http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/fullmoonU.htm

====A repressed lunar cult====

In ancient cultures, the number 13 represented femininity, because it corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year (13 x 28 = 364 days). The theory is that, as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunar, the number thirteen became anathema.Stan Gooch, Guardians of the Ancient Wisdom (1980)
