Belizean passports are issued to Belizean citizens to travel outside of Belize. The passport is a Caricom passport as Belize is a member of the Caribbean Community.

==Appearance and issuance==

The issuance of passports is governed by the Passports Act (Cap. 164).[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.belizelaw.org/lawadmin/PDF%20files/cap164.pdf|chapter=Passports Act, Chapter 164|title=The Laws of Belize|edition=Revised|publisher=Attorney-General of Belize|year=2000|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl]
In early 2004, Belize suffered a "passport crisis" due to a shortage of blank passports when a delivery from the country's United Kingdom-based passport supplier De La Rue was delayed. The Ministry of Home Affairs tried to handle the crisis by recalling unused passport blanks from Belizean diplomatic missions abroad, while newspapers urged those who did not immediately need passports to wait until September or October when the switchover to the new machine-readable passports would begin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/13369|title=G.O.B. hopes to ease passport crisis|work=News 5 Belize|date=2004-05-21|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl] The problem came to an end in August, though delays in issuance of up to four weeks persisted.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/12913|title=Passport shortage ends as first batch arrives|date=2004-08-24|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl]
In 2009, Belize began issuing passports in the common CARICOM design, with additional security features such as intaglio printing of certain text, a guilloch√© pattern on the inside pages, and a "ghost image" on the biodata pages.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/2126|title=CARICOM passport comes with new security features|work=News 5 Belize|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl]

==Theft and illegal issuance==

In 2002, it was found that hundreds and perhaps more than a thousand Belizean passports had been sold illegally on the black market. This was not an immigrant investor program but simply the issuance of passports to persons who were not qualified to hold them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/7748|title=Passport scandal laid to rest as last charges dropped|work=News 5 Belize|date=2007-01-30|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl]
In August 2005, two hundred blank passports were stolen from the Immigration Department. Police searched the homes of high-ranking officials, but to no avail. Director of Immigration Carmen Zetina complained  the investigation was further hampered by a high number of crank calls from members of the public about the investigation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/10323|title=Zetina: Passport investigation stumped by crank calls|work=News 5 Belize|date=2005-11-29|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl] In September 2006, another ninety-five passports were stolen from the Belmopan Immigration Office.[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/8395|title=Third suspect in passport heist turns himself in|work=News 5 Belize|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2012-04-27[/tpl]
