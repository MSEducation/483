The second single, "Last Drop", was released in markets outside the USA, but didn't manage to repeat the success of "Turn Me On", becoming only a minor hit in Europe. "Drive Me Crazy" was released as the third single in autumn 2004, followed by a promotional only single "I Got It". Both songs were commercial failures. In 2005, Lyttle released a new song in Jamaica only, "Jimmy Johnny".

The title song was released as the first single and both the single and the album were unsuccessful in terms of commercial performance.
