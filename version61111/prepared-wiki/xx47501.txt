===Morphy match, 1858===

Opportunities for tournament play remained rare, and Anderssen was reluctant to travel far because of the expense. In his one recorded tournament between 1851 and 1862, a one-game-per-round knock-out tournament at Manchester in 1857, he was eliminated in the second round.  Then in late 1858 he was beaten 8–3 by the American champion Paul Morphy in a famous match held in Paris, France (two wins, two draws, seven losses).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/v$m$$mix.htm | title=Morphy Matches| accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] from Mark Weeks' Chess Pages Although Anderssen knew as well as anyone how to attack, Morphy understood much better when to attack and how to prepare an attack. Morphy had recently scored equally convincing wins in matches against other top-class players: Johann Löwenthal, the Rev. John Owen and Daniel Harrwitz.[tpl]cite book | author=Fine, R. | title=The World's Great Chess Games | year=1952 | chapter=Adolf Anderssen | publisher=Andre Deutsch (now as paperback from Dover) [/tpl] However Morphy returned to the USA in 1859 and soon afterwards announced his retirement from serious chess. Hence Anderssen was once again the strongest active player.
Anderssen played the curious opening move 1. a3 in three games of his match against Morphy, and broke even with it (one loss, one draw, one win).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019039 | title=Anderssen vs Morphy, Paris 1858, game 6 | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019043 | title=Anderssen vs Morphy, Paris 1858, game 8 | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019048 | title=Anderssen vs Morphy, Paris 1858, game 10 | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080712205707/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019048| archivedate= 12 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This opening move, now referred to as "Anderssen's Opening", has never been popular in serious competition.[tpl]cite book | author=Eric Schiller | year=2002 | edition=Second | title=Unorthodox Chess Openings | publisher=Cardoza | isbn=1-58042-072-9 [/tpl]

===Other games 1851–62===

Shortly after the 1851 London International tournament, Anderssen played his two most famous games, both casual encounters which he won by combinations that involved several sacrifices. In the first, as Black, but moving first, against Lionel Kieseritzky in London just after the International tournament (1851) and now called the "Immortal Game", he sacrificed a bishop, both rooks and finally his queen.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1018910 | title=Adolf Anderssen vs Lionel Kieseritsky, 1851, King's Gambit Accepted – The "Immortal Game"  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080607235504/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1018910| archivedate= 7 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] In the second, played in Berlin in 1852 as white against Jean Dufresne and now called the "Evergreen Game", the total sacrifice was more modest, but still exceeded a queen and a minor piece.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1018961 | title=Adolf Anderssen vs Jean Dufresne, Berlin 1852, Evans Gambit – The "Evergreen Game"  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080714034402/http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1018961| archivedate= 14 July 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
After the match with Morphy, Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch, a "top five" player who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess.[tpl]cite web | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S067035000000111000000000016610100  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Ignatz Kolisch [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last1=Singer | first1=Isidore | author1-link=Isidore Singer | last2=Porter | first2=A. | year=1901–1906 | title=Jewish Encyclopedia | contribution=Kolisch, Baron Ignaz Von | contribution-url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=343&letter=K | volume=7 | page=547[/tpl] Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and narrowly won in 1861 (5/9; won four, drew two, lost three; Kolisch was ahead at the half-way stage).

===London 1862===

Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, the first international round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John OwenA very strong player who had a long career; 1862 was his most successful year: [tpl]cite web | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S003629000000111000000000001310100 | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: John Owen  | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] and finished two points ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s.[tpl]cite web | url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S098485000000111000000000023610100 | title=Chessmetrics Player Profile: Louis Paulsen  | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] Morphy had retired from chess at this time, so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world's leading active player.
Anderssen's only known competitive chess between 1862 and 1866 was a drawn match (three wins, three losses, and two draws) in 1864 against Berthold Suhle, who was a strong player and respected chess writer.In collaboration with Gustav Neumann, see the "Lehrbücher" ("textbooks") section of [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ballo.de/1844-1945,_b.htm | title=Schachliteratur 1844–1945  | accessdate=2008-06-17 [/tpl] Wilhelm Steinitz respected their work, see his review of Wormald’s "The Chess Openings" quoted at [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter15.html | title=Chess Notes Archive 15 | author=Winter, E.  | accessdate=2008-06-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509083517/http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter15.html| archivedate= 9 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Steinitz match, 1866===

In 1866 Anderssen lost a close match with 30-year-old Wilhelm Steinitz (six wins, eight losses, and no draws; Steinitz won the last two games). Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the positional approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority, the 1866 match was played in the attack-at-all-costs style of the 1850s and 1860s.[ref]
