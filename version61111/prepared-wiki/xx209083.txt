==History==

Among the tribal names given in "Ashkharatsuyts" there is an ethnonym ashdigor, which is considered to be the name of the Digors. This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believed that Digor dialect became separated from Proto-Ossetian during the Mongol conquests. 
Digors make the majority of the Ossetians in Digoria - the western part of the North Ossetia–Alania (Digorsky and Irafsky districts) and in Kabardino-Balkaria. In the beginning of the 19th century some families from Digoria resettled in  Mozdoksky District and there are 2 large settlements of them.
Digoria was annexed to the Russian Empire quite late compared to the rest of Ossetia. 
The Digors were converted to Sunni Islam in the 17th and 18th century[tpl]cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New-York|isbn=1-57958-133-1|page=211|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=jwNeAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA211&dq=digor%20people&hl=de&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q=digor%20people&f=false[/tpl] under the influence of the neighboring Kabarday people who introduced Islam to them.[tpl]cite book|last=Olson|first=James S.

(see: Ossetians in Turkey)
During World War II, North Ossetia–Alania was occupied by German armies in 1942. While under Nazi occupation the Ossetians remained unmoved, after the Germans were forced out of the region the Muslim Digors, like other Muslim peoples, were accused of Collaboration with the Germans and deported to Central Asia. Estimates say 50% of the Digors died during deportation. Their reputation was rehabilitated in the mid 1950s, andthey were allowed to return to their homelands.[tpl]cite book|last=Minahan|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World.
