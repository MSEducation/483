An estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.[tpl]cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. W. |year=1967 |chapter=What is an estuary: physical viewpoint |pages=3–5 |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=Lauf |title=Estuaries |series=A.A.A.S. Publ. |volume=83 |location=Washington, DC [/tpl]
Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.[tpl]cite book |last=McLusky |first=D.

Most existing estuaries were formed during the Holocene epoch by the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago.[tpl]cite book |last=Wolanski |first=E. |year=2007 |title=Estuarine Ecohydrology |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-53066-0 [/tpl] Estuaries are typically classified by their geomorphological features or by water circulation patterns and can be referred to by many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons, inlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the above definition of an estuary and may be fully saline.
The banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the world, with about 60% of the world's population living along estuaries and the coast. As a result, many estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation, overgrazing, and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.

==Definition==

The word "estuary" is derived from the Latin word aestuarium meaning tidal inlet of the sea, which in itself is derived from the term aestus, meaning tide. There have been many definitions proposed to describe an estuary. The most widely accepted definition is: "a semi-enclosed coastal body of water, which has a free connection with the open sea, and within sea water is measurably diluted with freshwater derived from land drainage". However, this definition excludes a number of coastal water bodies such as coastal lagoons and brackish seas. A more comprehensive definition of an estuary is "a semi-enclosed body of water connected to the sea as far as the tidal limit or the salt intrusion limit and receiving freshwater runoff; however the freshwater inflow may not be perennial, the connection to the sea may be closed for part of the year and tidal influence may be negligible". This definition includes classical estuaries[tpl]clarify|date=December 2012[/tpl] as well as fjords, lagoons, river mouths, and tidal creeks. An estuary is a dynamic ecosystem with a connection with the open sea through which the sea water enters with the rhythm of the tides. The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. The pattern of dilution varies between different estuaries and depends on the volume of fresh water, the tidal range, and the extent of evaporation of the water in the estuary.

==Classification based on geomorphology==

===Drowned river valleys===

Their width-to-depth ratio is typically large, appearing wedge-shaped in the inner part and broadening and deepening seaward.  Water depths rarely exceed [tpl]convert|30|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl]. Examples of this type of estuary in the U.S. are the Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay along the Mid-Atlantic coast; and along the Gulf coast, Galveston Bay and Tampa Bay.[tpl]cite journal |last=Kunneke |first=J. T. |first2=T. F. |last2=Palik |year=1984 |url=http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/others/85_15.pdf |title=Tampa Bay environmental atlas |journal=U.S. Fish Wildl. Serv. Biol. Rep. |volume=85 |issue=15 |pages=3 |accessdate=January 12, 2010 [/tpl] San Francisco Bay is another good example of a drowned river valley.

===Lagoon-type or bar-built===

These estuaries are semi-isolated from ocean waters by barrier beaches (barrier islands and barrier spits). Formation of barrier beaches partially encloses the estuary, with only narrow inlets allowing contact with the ocean waters. Bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts. They are extensive along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than [tpl]convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The barrier beaches that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways:
Barrier beaches form in shallow water and are generally parallel to the shoreline, resulting in long, narrow estuaries. The average water depth is usually less than [tpl]convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and rarely exceeds [tpl]convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Examples of bar-built estuaries are Barnegat Bay, New Jersey; Laguna Madre,1393960326 Texas; and Pamlico Sound, North Carolina.

===Fjord-type===

Fjord-type estuaries are formed in deeply eroded valleys formed by glaciers. These U-shaped estuaries typically have steep sides, rock bottoms, and underwater sills contoured by glacial movement. The estuary is shallowest at its mouth, where terminal glacial moraines or rock bars form sills that restrict water flow. In the upper reaches of the estuary, the depth can exceed [tpl]convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on[/tpl]. The width-to-depth ratio is generally small. In estuaries with very shallow sills, tidal oscillations only affect the water down to the depth of the sill, and the waters deeper than that may remain stagnant for a very long time, so there is only an occasional exchange of the deep water of the estuary with the ocean. If the sill depth is deep, water circulation is less restricted, and there is a slow but steady exchange of water between the estuary and the ocean. Fjord-type estuaries can be found along the coasts of Alaska, the Puget Sound region of western Washington state, British Columbia, eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, New Zealand, and Norway.

===Tectonically produced===

These estuaries are formed by subsidence or land cut off from the ocean by land movement associated with faulting, volcanoes, and landslides.  Inundation from eustatic sea level rise during the Holocene Epoch has also contributed to the formation of these estuaries.  There are only a small number of tectonically produced estuaries; one example is the San Francisco Bay, which was formed by the crustal movements of the San Andreas fault system causing the inundation of the lower reaches of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.[tpl]cite book |last=Kennish |first=M. J. |year=1986 |title=Ecology of Estuaries. Volume I: Physical and Chemical Aspects |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0-8493-5892-2 [/tpl]

==Classification based on water circulation==

===Salt wedge===

In this type of estuary, river output greatly exceeds marine input and tidal effects have a minor importance.  Fresh water floats on top of the seawater in a layer that gradually thins as it moves seaward.  The denser seawater moves landward along the bottom of the estuary, forming a wedge-shaped layer that is thinner as it approaches land.  As a velocity difference develops between the two layers, shear forces generate internal waves at the interface, mixing the seawater upward with the freshwater.  An example of a salt wedge estuary is the Mississippi River.

===Partially mixed===

As tidal forcing increases, river output becomes less than the marine input.  Here, current induced turbulence causes mixing of the whole water column such that salinity varies more longitudinally rather than vertically, leading to a moderately stratified condition.  Examples include the Chesapeake Bay and Narragansett Bay.

===Vertically homogenous===

Tidal mixing forces exceed river output, resulting in a well mixed water column and the disappearance of the vertical salinity gradient.  The freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects.  The lower reaches of the Delaware Bay and the Raritan River in New Jersey are examples of vertically homogenous estuaries.

===Inverse===

Inverse estuaries occur in dry climates where evaporation greatly exceeds the inflow of fresh water.  A salinity maximum zone is formed, and both riverine and oceanic water flow close to the surface towards this zone.[tpl]cite journal |last=Wolanski |first=E. |year=1986 |title=An evaporation-driven salinity maximum zone in Australian tropical estuaries |journal=Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=415–424 |doi=10.1016/0272-7714(86)90065-X |bibcode = 1986ECSS...22..415W [/tpl]  This water is pushed downward and spreads along the bottom in both the seaward and landward direction. An example of an inverse estuary is Spencer Gulf, South Australia.

===Intermittent===

Estuary type varies dramatically depending on freshwater input, and is capable of changing from a wholly marine embayment to any of the other estuary types.[tpl]cite web |last=Tomczak |first=M. |year=2000 |url=http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/IntroOc/notes/lecture12.html |title=Oceanography Notes Ch. 12:  Estuaries |accessdate=30 November 2006 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Day |first=J. H. |year=1981 |title=Estuarine Ecology |location=Rotterdam |publisher=A. A. Balkema |isbn=90-6191-205-9 [/tpl]

==Physiochemical variation==

The most important variable characteristics of estuary water are the concentration of dissolved oxygen, salinity and sediment load. There is extreme spatial variability in salinity, with a range of near zero at the tidal limit of the tributary river(s) to 3.4% at the estuary mouth. At any one point the salinity will vary considerably over time and seasons, making it a harsh environment for organisms. Sediment often settles in intertidal mudflats which are extremely difficult to colonize. No points of attachment exist for algae, so vegetation based habitat is not established[tpl]clarify|date=June 2012[/tpl]. Sediment can also clog feeding and respiratory structures of species, and special adaptations exist within mudflat species to cope with this problem. Lastly, dissolved oxygen variation can cause problems for life forms. Nutrient-rich sediment from man-made sources can promote primary production life cycles, perhaps leading to eventual decay removing the dissolved oxygen from the water; thus hypoxic or anoxic zones can develop.[tpl]cite book |last=Kaiser |last2=et al. |year=2005 |title=Marine Ecology.

==Implications for marine life==

Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for many fish nurseries, depending upon their locations in the world, such as salmon and sea trout.[tpl]cite paper |first=Bronwyn M. |last=Gillanders |url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2003/247/m247p281.pdf |title=Evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats for mobile marine fauna: an important component of nurseries |year=2003 |series=Marine Ecology Progress Series [/tpl] Also, migratory bird populations, such as the black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa islandica[tpl]cite journal |first=Jennifer A. |last=Gill |title=The buffer effect and large-scale population regulation in migratory birds |year=2001 |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6845 |pages=436–438 |doi=10.1038/35086568 [/tpl] make essential use of estuaries.
Two of the main challenges of estuarine life are the variability in salinity and sedimentation. Many species of fish and invertebrates have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Many animals also burrow to avoid predation and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially anoxic conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux.
Phytoplankton are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the tides. Their productivity is largely dependant upon the turbidity of the water. The main phytoplankton present are diatoms and dinoflagellates which are abundant in the sediment.
It is important to remember that a primary source of food for many organisms on estuaries, including bacteria, is detritus from the settlement of the sedimentation.

==Human impact==

Of the thirty-two largest cities in the world, twenty-two are located on estuaries.[tpl]cite book |last=Ross |first=D. A. |year=1995 |title=Introduction to Oceanography |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins College Publishers |isbn=978-0-673-46938-0 [/tpl] For example, New York City is located at the mouth of the Hudson River estuary.[tpl]cite web |work=NOAA |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/estuaries/media/supp_estuar00c.html |title=Estuaries tutorial |accessdate=March 25, 2008 [/tpl]
As ecosystems, estuaries are under threat from human activities such as pollution and overfishing. They are also threatened by sewage, coastal settlement, land clearance and much more. Estuaries are affected by events far upstream, and concentrate materials such as pollutants and sediments.[tpl]cite journal |first=G. |last=Branch |title=Estuarine vulnerability and ecological impacts: Estuaries of South Africa, edited by Brian R. Allanson and Dan Baird |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=14 |issue=12 |year=1999 |pages=499 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01732-2 [/tpl] Land run-off and industrial, agricultural, and domestic waste enter rivers and are discharged into estuaries. Contaminants can be introduced which do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment, such as plastics, pesticides, furans, dioxins, phenols and heavy metals.
Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called bioaccumulation. They also accumulate in benthic environments, such as estuaries and bay muds: a geological record of human activities of the last century.
For example, Chinese and Russian industrial pollution, such as phenols and heavy metals, has devastated fish stocks in the Amur River and damaged its estuary soil."Indigenous Peoples of the Russian North, Siberia and Far East: Nivkh" by Arctic Network for the Support of the Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Arctic
Estuaries tend to be naturally eutrophic because land runoff discharges nutrients into estuaries. With human activities, land run-off also now includes the many chemicals used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. Excess oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones.[tpl]cite book |last=Gerlach |first= |title=Marine Pollution |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1981 |isbn=0387109404 [/tpl] This can result in reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.
Overfishing also occurs. Chesapeake Bay once had a flourishing oyster population which has been almost wiped out by overfishing. Historically the oysters filtered the estuary's entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days. Today that process takes almost a year,[tpl]cite web|url=http://habitat.noaa.gov/restorationtechniques/public/habitat.cfm?HabitatID=2&HabitatTopicID=11|title=Oyster Reefs: Ecological importance|publisher=US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=2008-01-16[/tpl] and sediment, nutrients, and algae can cause problems in local waters. Oysters filter these pollutants, and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless.
