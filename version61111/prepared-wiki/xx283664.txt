James Mills Storehouse, also known as the Old Tobacco Warehouse, is a historic store located at Urbanna, Middlesex County, Virginia. It was built between 1763 and 1767, and is a 1 1/2-story, rectangular brick structure on a raised brick basement.  It has a gable roof and full width front porch. It is a rare if not unique survivor of the type of storehouse which, being run by a resident factor of a British company, was not only connected with the sale of tobacco but which housed imported goods to be bought on credit by the planters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Middlesex/316-0004_Mills,_James,_Storehouse_1972_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: James Mills Storehouse |author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission staff| date=April 1972|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources[/tpl] and Accompanying photo
