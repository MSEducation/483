[[3-Methoxytyramine]]

CATEGORIES: Phenethylamines, Phenols, TAAR1 agonists

3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT), also known as 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethylamine, is a metabolite of the neurotransmitter dopamine formed by the introduction of a methyl group to dopamine by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). 3-MT can be further metabolized by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form homovanillic acid (HVA), which is then typically excreted in the urine.
Originally thought to be physiologically inactive, 3-MT has recently been shown to act as an agonist of the TAAR1.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sotnikova TD, Beaulieu JM, Espinoza S, et al. | title = The dopamine metabolite 3-methoxytyramine is a neuromodulator | journal = Plos One | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13452 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976142 | pmc = 2956650 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013452 | url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013452[/tpl]
