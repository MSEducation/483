Uschi Digard (born 15 August 1948 in the town of Saltsjö-Duvnäs near Stockholm in Sweden and raised in Scandinavia) is a Swedish former softcore porn star and model known for her roles in Russ Meyer films.

==Early years==

When asked of her childhood, she has said, [tpl]blockquote|I was born in Saltsjö-Duvnäs, a little town outside Stockholm, Sweden, and am of Swedish/Swiss heritage. I was sent to a boarding school with nuns at an early age because those were the best schools in the country and I was pretty promiscuous as a little one -- not with men, but with books. I loved reading and at age 6 I decided I wanted to learn languages because I couldn't stand reading books that had been translated -- they lost the essence. By age 7 I had read every book in the little village library.[/tpl]
Digard's breasts started developing at a young age, about which she commented, [tpl]blockquote|When I started to develop at 11 I had to strap myself in, because it wasn't seemly to have breasts, and we all wore uniforms. By age 15 I was a 40DD."Hansen 2006, p. 226.[/tpl]

==Career==

Digard burst into cinema in Sweden where she starred in several erotic films. In 1967, she went to the U.S. where she soon began appearing in numerous sexploitation movies and pornographic magazines.
She was among the best known big bust models in the late-1960s and early-1970s. Digard was cast in Russ Meyer's Cherry, Harry & Raquel! to provide the dénouement in a final interpretive dance scene symbolizing the death of the antagonist. Digard would go on to appear in three more of Meyer's films in the 1970s.
In 1979, she performed with John Holmes, Johnny Keyes, Serena, Candy Samples, Kitten Natividad, and Kelly Stewart in the pornographic film John Holmes and the All-Star Sex Queens from Zane Entertainment Group. In those years she also starred in some "sexy wrestling" short-footage films, mainly for Triumph Studios and Ron Dvorkin's Bellstone.
