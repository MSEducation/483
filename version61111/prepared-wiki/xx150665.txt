[[Unistat]]

The Unistat computer program is a statistical data analysis tool featuring two modes of operation: The stand-alone user interface is a complete workbench for data input, analysis and visualization while the Microsoft Excel add-in mode extends the features of the mainstream spreadsheet application with powerful analytical capabilities.
With its first release in 1984, Unistat soon differentiated itself by targeting the new generation of microcomputers that were becoming commonplace in offices and homes at a time when data analysis was largely the domain of big iron mainframe and minicomputers. Since then, the product has gone through several major revisions targeting various desktop computing platforms, but its development has always been focused on user interaction and dynamic visualization.
As desktop computing has continued to proliferate throughout the 1990s and onwards, Unistat's end-user oriented interface has attracted a following amongst biomedicine researchers, social scientists, market researchers, government departments and students, enabling them to perform complex data analysis without the need for large manuals and scripting languages.
Procedures supported by Unistat include:
