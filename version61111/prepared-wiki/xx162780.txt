Some Like It Hot is a 1939 comedy film starring Bob Hope, Shirley Ross, and Gene Krupa.  The movie was directed by George Archainbaud, and the screenplay was written by Wilkie C. Mahoney and Lewis R. Foster, based on the play The Great Magoo by Ben Hecht and Gene Fowler, which performed briefly on Broadway in 1932.[tpl]ibdb title|11690|The Great Magoo[/tpl]  The film was released the year before Road to Singapore converted theatre and radio star Hope into a huge movie box office draw. Legendary cinematographer Karl Struss filmed the movie.
The title of the film is taken from a nursery rhyme, and bears no relation to the Billy Wilder's acclaimed 1959 comedy film Some Like It Hot starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis. The movie was reissued for television as Rhythm Romance, presumably to avoid viewers confusing it with the other Some Like It Hot.
