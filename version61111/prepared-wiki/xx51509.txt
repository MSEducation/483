[[Impeccability]]

Impeccability is the absence of sin.  Christianity teaches this to be an attribute of God (logically God cannot sin, it would mean that he would act against his own will and nature) and therefore it is also commonly, but not uncontroversially, attributed to Christ.

==Roman Catholic Church Teaching==

===Impeccability and Heaven===

Early Christians questioned whether the saints in heaven could sin: Origen claimed they could. Roman Catholic doctrine holds that they can not. Although Catholics believe in the gift of free will, saints in heaven already see God face to face and can not sin, i.e. they remain in God. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states (emphasis added):

===Impeccability and Purgatory===

Thomas Aquinas taught that souls in Purgatory cannot sin (Summa Theologica, Second Part of the Second Part, Question 83, Article 11, Reply to Objection 3), let alone the saints in heaven. This is the teaching of the Catholic Church, although there are different opinions on the reasons for the impossibility to sin.

===Impeccability and the Blessed Virgin Mary===

The Roman Catholic church teaches that the Blessed Virgin Mary was, by a special grace of God, without sin her entire life. This included the moment of her conception, so the Virgin was even preserved from original sin. 
The Immaculate Conception is a Roman Catholic dogma that asserts that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was preserved by God from the stain of original sin at the time of her own conception.  Some theologians have asserted this special grace extended to impeccability in this context as the inability to sin; others argue this could not be so: as a person, she would have had free will, and therefore the ability to sin, but through her cooperation avoided it. 

===Impeccability and the Pope===

Impeccability is sometimes confused with infallibility, especially in discussions of papal infallibility. Impeccability is an attribute not claimed by the pope, and few would deny that there have been "bad" popes - Saint Peter himself denied Jesus three times.  On the other hand, Pope Gregory VII, intellectual progenitor of the Ultramontanes and nemesis of the lay faction in the investiture controversy, voiced an assertion of Papal prerogative beyond even the strongest of modern apologists':
 
 The pope can be judged by no one; the Roman church has never erred and never will err till the end of time; the Roman church was founded by Christ alone; the pope alone can depose and restore bishops; he alone can make new laws, set up new bishoprics and divide old ones. ... He alone can call general councils and authorize canon laws; his legates .. have precedence over all bishops. ... A duly ordained pope is undoubtedly made a saint by the merits of St. Peter.Power and the Papacy (ISBN 0-7648-0141-4), by Robert McClory, p. 19.
Nevertheless, in Catholic thought, the exemption of the Roman Church from error extends only to its definitive teachings on faith and morals: not its historical judgments. Similarly, papal "sainthood" does not suggest that popes are free from sin. Quite the contrary, popes frequent the sacrament of Reconciliation (confession) for the forgiveness of their sins, as all other Catholics are required to do. Pope Benedict XVI confessed his sins once a week.David Willey, ".Fewer Confessions and New Sins"
