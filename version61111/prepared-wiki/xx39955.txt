==Music career==

===Radio DJ, Timbaland collaboration===

Bridges served as an intern and then as a disc jockey at Atlanta's Hot 97.5 (now Hot 107.9) under the name "Chris Lova Lova".[tpl]cite web|url=http://hotspotatl.com/videos/markallwood/ludacris-talks-conjure-fast-the-furious-exclusive-video/#more-1215211 |title=Ludacris Talks Conjure, Fast & The Furious (EXCLUSIVE VIDEO) | HotSpotATL - Hot 107.9 Atlanta's Home for the Hip-Hop Community |publisher=HotSpotATL |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2011-08-15[/tpl] He was also known for DJ'ing during Freaknik at one point.
Ludacris collaborated with Timbaland on the track "Phat Rabbit" from his album Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment. This song was a hit in many countries. It was later included on Ludacris's debut LP album Back for the First Time. In Ludacris' early music career he collaborated with Dallas Austin and Jermaine Dupri.

===1998−2000: Incognegro and Back for the First Time===

thumb|right|300px|Ludacris at Music Midtown 2012In 1998, Ludacris began to record his debut album "Incognegro". This album was the defining example of Ludacris' fast, wild, and comedic flow, a unique style for southern rappers. Timbaland handled part of the production. Despite its poor sales, it was never deleted and is still sold today. Ludacris also appeared on Timbaland's 1998 debut on "Phat Rabbit," a track that would later be used on his re-issue of "Incognegro" called "Back For The First Time". In 2000, Ludacris released his major label debut, Back for the First Time. It was produced with the help of the underground producer Sessy Melia, whom he dated for a short while. The album reached as high as #4 on the U.S. Billboard 200, and was a major success. Ludacris made his mark on the industry with singles such as "Southern Hospitality" and "What's Your Fantasy", along with his first ever single the "Phat Rabbit", from two years prior. Guest appearances included 4-Ize, I-20, Shawnna, Pastor Troy, Timbaland, Trina, Foxy Brown, UGK, and others. Ludacris stated in an interview on MTV's hip hop program Direct Effect that he came up with his stage name based on his "split personality" that he considered "ridiculous" and "ludicrous".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428130/20001019/ludacris.jhtml|title=DFX: Ludacris Is "Back For The First Time"|last=Johnson|first=Elon|date=October 19, 2000|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=March 1, 2009[/tpl]

===2001−03: Word of Mouf and Chicken-n-Beer===

Ludacris promptly completed his next album, Word of Mouf, and released it at the end of 2001. The video for the lead single, "Rollout (My Business)", was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award, and Ludacris performed it live at the awards' pre-show. He released singles "Saturday (Oooh Oooh)" with Sleepy Brown, "Move Bitch" with Mystikal and I-20, and "Area Codes" with Nate Dogg.
During the spring of 2003, Ludacris returned to the music scene after a brief hiatus with a new single, "Act a Fool", from the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. At around the same time, he released the lead single from his album Chicken-n-Beer, called "P-Poppin" (short for "Pussy Poppin'"). Neither of his new singles were as well received by either the urban or pop audiences as his previous songs had been, and both music videos received only limited airplay. Chicken-N-Beer opened strongly, but without a popular single, the album fell quickly. Guest appearances include Playaz Circle, Chingy, Snoop Dogg, 8Ball & MJG, Lil' Flip, I-20, Lil Fate, and Shawnna.
In the fall of 2003, Ludacris rebounded with his next single, "Stand Up", which appeared on both Chicken-n-Beer as well as the soundtrack for the teen hip hop/dance movie, You Got Served. Produced by Kanye West, "Stand Up" went on to become one of Ludacris' biggest mainstream hits to date, hitting the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 garnering heavy airplay on mainstream pop, rhythmic, and urban radio stations, as well as on MTV, MTV2, and BET. Ludacris was sued by a New Jersey group called I.O.F. who claimed that "Stand Up" used a hook from one of their songs, but in June 2006, a jury found that the song did not violate copyrights. "I hope the plaintiffs enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame," Ludacris said after the verdict.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532400/20060524/ludacris.jhtml|title=For The Record: Quick News On Luda, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Avenged Sevenfold, Social Distortion & More|work=MTV.com|accessdate=May 24, 2006[/tpl]
The album's next single, "Splash Waterfalls", was released in early 2004. A huge pop hit (despite its steamy video and explicit, adult-oriented lyrical content and themes), it subsequently became a success at urban radio and BET, and is the only time he has produced two consecutive top 10 singles from a solo album, [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] except for Release Therapy (an unedited version of the video could only be viewed on BET's Uncut program). It was Ludacris' most sexual video yet, an R&B remix that featured Raphael Saadiq and sampled Tony! Toni! Tone!'s "Whatever You Want". Ludacris received his first Grammy Award with Usher and Lil Jon for their hit single "Yeah!". Ludacris next released "Blow It Out", which was accompanied by a low-budget music video.

===2004−07: The Red Light District and Release Therapy===

Chris Bridges took a more mature approach to his fourth album, The Red Light District. Sohail Khalid helped produce this album with various artists such as T.I., Lil Flip and Bun B. Ludacris openly boasted that he may be the only rapper able to keep the Def Jam label afloat on the opening track. Ludacris filmed and recorded the single "Get Back" in which he was featured as a muscle-bound hulk who was being annoyed by the media and warned critics to leave him alone. He first appeared on Saturday Night Live as a special guest performing with musical guest Sum 41 on a season 30 episode hosted by Paul Giamatti. He then recorded "Get Back" with Sum 41 to make a rock crossover single. The follow-up single was the Austin Powers-inspired "Number One Spot". It was produced by New York City's Hot 97 personality DJ Green Lantern. It used the Quincy Jones sample of "Soul Bossa Nova" and sped it up to the tempo of Ludacris' rap flow. Featured artists on the album include Nas, DJ Quik, DMX, Trick Daddy, Sleepy Brown, and Disturbing tha Peace newcomers Bobby Valentino, Dolla Boi, and Small World. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts.
In an issue of XXL, Ludacris was placed in the number nine spot for the most anticipated albums of 2006, for Release Therapy. The album Release Therapy was released on September 26, 2006. Ludacris formatted the CD to have two sides: a Release side and a Therapy side on a single CD. Guest appearances include Pharrell Williams, R. Kelly, Young Jeezy, Mary J. Blige, Field Mob, Bobby Valentino, Pimp C, C-Murder, and Beanie Sigel. The first single, "Money Maker", which features Pharrell Williams, was released to U.S. radio outlets on July 17, 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57826/ludacris-digs-deep-on-release-therapy |title=Ludacris Digs Deep On 'Release Therapy' |work=Billboard.com |accessdate=July 14, 2006[/tpl] "Money Maker" reached number one on the BET program 106 & Park. It then went to become the rapper's second number-one single after 6 years[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]. His second single, "Grew Up a Screw Up", featuring Young Jeezy, dispels rumors that the two are or ever were in a dispute. His third single, "Runaway Love", soon peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Tracks and won Best Collaboration in the 2007 BET Awards. His album then reached number one on the Billboard 200 album charts with sales of 309,000 in its first week. With the release of this album, Ludacris marked a change in style in his career with his musical style. The new album itself features a departure of the lighthearted mood of his previous albums, and introduces a darker side. A change of hair accompanied this as he cut off his trademark braids for a more conventional "fade" cut. To promote the album, Ludacris returned to Saturday Night Live (as both host and musical guest) on November 18, 2006.

===2008−10: Theater of the Mind and Battle of the Sexes===

The Preview, a mixtape to preview the album was released on July 28, 2008. Theater of the Mind, released on November 24, 2008, and in April 2008, the single "Let's Stay Together" appeared on xxlmag.com; supposedly from the new album ("Let's Stay Together" was expected to but was released as a bonus track on the CD). A song with Small World called "Pinky Shinin" was expected to be on the album, but it was dropped. In an interview with Complex Magazine he stated that Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, T.I., Plies, Common, T-Pain, Jay-Z, Nas and The Game will be on the album; Game is featured in a track with Willy Northpole titled "Call Up the Homies". T.I. was on the album on a track called "Wish You Would" squashing the long feud between them. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with 213,493 sold first week. The album was released the same day as Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak, which took the number-one spot.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8192 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: The Week Ending 11/30/08 |work=HipHopDX.com |date=December 3, 2008 |last=Paine |first=Jake |accessdate=June 17, 2011[/tpl] His first single "What Them Girls Like", featuring Chris Brown and Sean Garrett, peaked at #33 on the Billboard 100.

Ludacris' seventh studio album was released on March 9, 2010, with his first promotional single for the album being "Everybody Drunk" which features Callum Smith, originally featuring Shawnna. The first concept idea of the album was to have Ludacris and Shawnna battle it out on the album back–to–back, but this was later axed upon Shawnna's departure from Disturbing tha Peace, ending her contract on Ludacris' label and joining T-Pain's Nappy Boy Entertainment label. The first official single released from Battle of the Sexes was "How Low", which was released on December 8, 2009. The follow–up single was "My Chick Bad", released on February 23, 2010. The third single is "Sex Room", peaking at #69 on the Billboard 100. Ludacris’s Battle of the Sexes entered the chart at No. 1, with 137,000 sales in the first week.

On May 24, 2013, Ludacris released his newest mixtape, entitled #IDGAF.  He had been releasing a new song on Fridays as he is calling these releases IDGAF Fridays.

Ludacris reprised his role as Tej in the blockbuster movie 'Fast & Furious 6', during Memorial Day Weekend, May 2013. Ludacris had this to say about his upcoming new album:
"I think every album is like a progression, I'm working with different producers. Usher, We definitely have this album which is a great thing. Ne-Yo is also on the album and I have producers like David Guetta, we have Stargate, have trainees. The Kelly Rowland single just came out that you need to check out. It's called 'Representing'".

==Business ventures==

Ludacris is the co-founder of his own record label, Disturbing tha Peace, an imprint distributed by Def Jam Recordings. He is the co-owner of Conjure Cognac liquor. In 2011 Ludacris released his own line of headphones called " Soul By Ludacris" manufactured by Soul Electronics[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] He also has various real estate holdings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2010/03/16/a-day-in-the-life-ludacris/ |title=Ludacris - A Day in the Life |publisher=The Boombox |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2012-12-15[/tpl]

==Philanthropy==

In 2011, Ludacris joined a joint effort between Dosomething.org and Better World Books to collect books to help restock library shelves in New Orleans. He filmed a public service announcement in support of the Epic Book Drive.[tpl]cite web|title=Ludacris and DoSomething.org Launch ‘Epic Book Drive’ For New Orleans Recovery School District|url=http://www.urbanorleans.com/site/2011/04/16/ludacris-and-dosomething-org-launch-epic-book-drive-for-new-orleans-recovery-school-district/|publisher=urbanorleans.com[/tpl] Chris "Ludacris" Bridges also started the Ludacris Foundation at the beginning of his music career back in 2001.

==Controversy==

===T.I.===

Tensions began when T.I. saw Disturbing tha Peace rapper I-20's video in which a man wearing a shirt with the words "Trap House,"[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] was being beaten. T.I. believed the man's shirt actually said "Trap Muzik," perhaps interpreting this to be a reference to his album of the same name. Later, former G-Unit artist Young Buck asked these two fellow Southern rappers to appear on his new record on the track "Stomp". T.I. recorded a verse, which contained a line that Young Buck considered to be a subliminal insult towards Ludacris "Me gettin' beat down?/That's ludicrous". Young Buck spoke to Ludacris about his interpretation of the event. Ludacris then later recorded a verse that can be found on the album, "Straight Outta Cashville".[tpl]cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489952/20040804/young_buck.jhtml |title=Young Buck To 'Stomp' Out Luda/ T.I. Beef On Debut Album |publisher=Mtv.com |date=August 4, 2004 |accessdate=December 1, 2010[/tpl] T.I's record company wanted Ludacris to change his verse before they sanctioned it but Ludacris refused and T.I. was therefore replaced by Game on the album version.
On June 24, 2007 at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, California, T.I. was involved in a physical altercation. During a luncheon held by Kevin Liles of Warner Music Group (parent company of T.I.'s label, Atlantic Records), the MC got into a fight with Ludacris' manager Chaka Zulu. According to witnesses, T.I. punched Zulu in the face and choked him and a small, brief melee ensued.Shaheem Reid (June 25, 2007). T.I., Ludacris' Manager Get Into Scuffle At Industry Event MTV. Retrieved October 3, 2008.
T.I. was awarded honors for Best Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Awards, and took the opportunity to apologize for his scuffle with Disturbing tha Peace executive Chaka Zulu earlier in the week. While accepting his award, he expressed regret over the situation. "They say it's a fine line between brilliance and insanity," he said, in an apparent reference to his troublesome alter ego, T.I.P. During the broadcast, cameras showed his onetime rival Ludacris smiling in the audience.
The two rappers have resolved their disagreement and have collaborated on four songs: "Wish You Would" off Ludacris's sixth studio album, Theater of the Mind,  "On Top of the World" off T.I.'s sixth studio album, Paper Trail and "We In This Bitch" off DJ Drama's album, Quality Street Music. The original version of the latter had Kanye West. The two have also collaborated on Big Boi's song called "In The A," released on the 2012 album Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors.

===Bill O'Reilly and Pepsi===

On August 27, 2002, political pundit Bill O'Reilly called for all Americans to boycott Pepsi products,[tpl]cite web|last=Noah |first=Timothy |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2078577/ |title=Whopper of the Week: Bill O'Reilly. – By Timothy Noah – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=December 1, 2010[/tpl] saying that Ludacris' lyrics glamorize a "life of guns, violence, drugs and disrespect of women".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28916 |title=Singing a different tune |publisher=Worldnetdaily.com |date= |accessdate=December 1, 2010[/tpl] The next day, O'Reilly reported that Pepsi had fired Ludacris. Six months later, Russel Simmons and his hip hop action summit threatened a boycott of all PepsiCo products on the grounds that Pepsi had subsequently hired Ozzy Osbourne for a commercial even though Osbourne is notable for use of profanity and explicit lyrics. Eventually an agreement was reached which resulted in PepsiCo donating $3 million to Ludacris' foundation and other inner city charities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.be/books?id=FBV4lf9v_ssC&lpg=PA19&ots=bCKxwE4JYJ&dq=ludacris%20pepsi%20%223%20million%22&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=ludacris%20pepsi%20%223%20million%22&f=false |title=Stand and Deliver: Political Activism, Leadership, and Hip Hop Culture - Yvonne Bynoe - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.be |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11[/tpl]
