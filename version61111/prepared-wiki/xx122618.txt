The Strachey Baronetcy, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, England, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=15372 |date=2 June 1801 |startpage=619[/tpl] It was created on 15 June 1801 for the politician and civil servant Henry Strachey.

On 3 November 1911 he was created Baron Strachie, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.[tpl]London Gazette |issue=28547 |date=3 November 1911 |startpage=7952[/tpl] He later served as Paymaster-General. The peerage became extinct on the death of his son, the second Baron, in 1973. The late Baron was succeeded in the baronetcy by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of John Strachey, son and namesake of John Strachey, second son of the third Baronet. Strachey does not use his title.
