The 1988 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 8, 1988. All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1988 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose 11 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the President and Vice President.
Tennessee was won by incumbent United States Vice President George H. W. Bush of Texas, who was running against Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. Bush ran with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle as Vice President, and Dukakis ran with Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.
Tennessee weighed in for this election as 4% more Republican than the national average.

==Partisan background==

The presidential election of 1988 was a very partisan election for Tennessee, with more than 99% of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or  Republican parties, though 9 candidates did appear on the ballot.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl] Most counties in Tennessee turned out for Bush, including the highly populated Shelby County and Davidson County, by narrow margins. Also, it is interesting to note that Tennessee was the only state that Bush actually improved on Ronald Reagan's 1984 performance, if only by 0.07%.

==Republican victory==

Bush won the election in Tennessee with a solid 16 point landslide. The election results in Tennessee are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party, which took place through the 1980s. Through the passage of some very controversial economic programs, spearheaded by then President Ronald Reagan (called, collectively, "Reaganomics"), the mid-to-late 1980's saw a period of economic growth and stability. The hallmark for Reaganomics was, in part, the wide-scale deregulation of corporate interests, and tax cuts for the wealthy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/us/politics/for-wealthy-tax-cuts-since-1980s-have-been-gain-gain.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Since 1980s, the Kindest of Tax Cuts for the Rich | date=2012-01-18 | accessdate=2013-07-21[/tpl]
Dukakis ran his campaign on a notably socially liberal agenda, and advocated for higher economic regulation and environmental protection. Bush, alternatively, ran on a campaign of continuing the social and economic policies of former President Reagan - which gained him much support with social conservatives and people living in rural areas, who largely associated the Republican Party with the economic growth of the 1980s. Additionally, while the economic programs passed under Reagan, and furthered under Bush and Clinton, may have boosted the economy for a brief period, they are criticized by many analysts as "setting the stage" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession.
