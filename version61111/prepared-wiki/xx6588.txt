===Connection to artificial intelligence===

Since its inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence research community, especially on PDP-10The 36-bit word size of the PDP-6/PDP-10 was influenced by the usefulness of having two Lisp 18-bit pointers in a single word. [tpl]cite newsgroup | quote = The PDP-6 project started in early 1963, as a 24-bit machine. It grew to 36 bits for LISP, a design goal. | url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.folklore.computers/browse_thread/thread/6e5602ce733d0ec/17597705ae289112 | title = The History of TOPS or Life in the Fast ACs | newsgroup = alt.folklore.computers | id = 84950@tut.cis.ohio-state.edu | date = 18 October 1990 | author = Peter J.

In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of existing Lisp systems became a growing issue.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

===Genealogy and variants===

Over its fifty-year history, Lisp has spawned many variations on the core theme of an S-expression language. Moreover, each given dialect may have several implementations—for instance, there are more than a dozen implementations of Common Lisp.
Differences between dialects may be quite visible—for instance, Common Lisp uses the keyword defun to name a function, but Scheme uses define.Common Lisp: (defun f (x) x) Scheme: (define f (lambda (x) x)) or (define (f x) x) Within a dialect that is standardized, however, conforming implementations support the same core language, but with different extensions and libraries.
