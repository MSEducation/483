[[Broom]]

CATEGORIES: Cleaning tools, Domestic implements

A broom is a cleaning tool consisting of stiff fibers attached to, and roughly parallel to, a cylindrical handle, the broomstick. It is thus a variety of brush with a long handle. It is commonly used in combination with a dustpan.
The word "broom" derives from the name of certain thorny shrubs (Genista and others) used for sweeping.[tpl]cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary, 6th ed.|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0199206872|pages=3804[/tpl] 
The name of the shrubs began to be used for the household implement in Late Middle English and gradually replaced the earlier besom during the Early Modern English period.
The song Buy Broom Buzzems (by William Purvis 1752 - 1832) still refers to the "broom besom" as one type of besom (i.e. "a besom made from broom") Flat brooms, made of broom corn,[tpl]cite web | title=How to make a broom | url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Do-It-Yourself/How-To-Make-A-Broom.aspx | publisher=Ogden Publications, Inc. | accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl] were invented by Shakers in the 19th century.[tpl]cite web |title=Broom |url=http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/broom |accessdate=2008-11-05[/tpl] A smaller whisk broom or brush is sometimes called a duster.
One source states that the United States had 303 broom factories by 1839 and that the number peaked at 1,039 in 1919. Most of these were in the Eastern U. S. During the Great Depression, the number of factories declined to 320 in 1939.Fugate, Tally D. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. "Broom Factories."

Oklahoma became a major center for broom production because broom corn grew especially well there. The Oklahoma Broom Corn Company opened a factory in El Reno, Oklahoma in 1906, a year before statehood. Faced with competition from imported brooms and synthetic bristles, most of the factories closed by the 1960s.
Today, brooms are also commonly made with synthetic bristles. Another common type is the push/pull broom, consisting of a wide brush with short bristles, to which a broomstick is attached at an angle in the center of the brush.

In the context of witchcraft, broomstick is likely to refer to the broom as a whole.
In The Wizard of Oz, the Wicked Witch of the West used a broomstick to fly over Oz. She also used it to skywrite "Surrender Dorothy" above the Emerald City. The Wizard commands Dorothy and her three traveling companions to bring the Wicked Witch's broomstick to him in order to grant their wishes. Dorothy carries it to the Wizard with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion after the Wicked Witch's death.
In the movie Fantasia, Mickey Mouse, playing The Sorcerer's Apprentice, brings a broom to life to do his chore of filling a well full of water. The boom overdoes its job and when chopped into pieces, each splinter becomes a new broom that flood the room until Yen Sid stops them. This story comes from a poem by Goethe called "Der Zauberlehrling" ("The Sorcerer's Apprentice"). The Disney brooms have had recurring cameos in Disney media, mostly portrayed as janitors, albeit not out of control or causing chaos such as in the original appearance. 
In the movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (film), There is a Wizarding Game called Quidditch where players use their broomsticks to fly around a field and shoot goals. Harry Potter (character) plays the game also. Broomsticks are also a form of transport which wizards and witches use.
