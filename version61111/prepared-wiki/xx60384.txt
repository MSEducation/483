"The Internationale" (French: "L'Internationale") is a widely sung left-wing anthem. It has been one of the most recognizable and popular songs of the socialist movement since the late 19th century, when the Second International (now the Socialist International) adopted it as its official anthem.  The title arises from the "First International", an alliance of socialist parties formed by Marx and Engels which held a congress in 1864.  The author of the anthem's lyrics, Eugène Pottier, attended this congress.
The original French refrain of the song is C'est la lutte finale / Groupons-nous et demain / L'Internationale / Sera le genre humain. (English: "This is the final struggle / Let us group together and tomorrow / The Internationale / Will be the human race.") "The Internationale" has been translated into many languages. It is often sung with the left hand raised in a clenched fist salute and is sometimes followed (in English-speaking places) with a chant of "The workers united will never be defeated." "The Internationale" has been celebrated by socialists, communists, anarchists, democratic socialists, and some social democrats.

==Original lyrics and copyright==

The original French words were written in June 1871 by Eugène Pottier (1816–1887, previously a member of the Paris Commune)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|pages=first paragraph|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&date=2009-10-25+16:54:58|archivedate=2009-10-25[/tpl] and were originally intended to be sung to the tune of "La Marseillaise".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/smm-aging-anthems.shtml#_ednref15|title=Billy Bragg's Revival of Aging Anthems: Radical Nostalgia or Activist Inspiration?|author=David Walls, Sonoma State University[/tpl] Pierre De Geyter (1848–1932) set the poem to music in 1888.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|pages=ninth paragraph|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&date=2009-10-25+16:54:58|archivedate=2009-10-25[/tpl] His melody was first publicly performed in July 1888[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|pages=11th paragraph|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&date=2009-10-25+16:54:58|archivedate=2009-10-25[/tpl] and became widely used soon after.
In an unsuccessful attempt to save Pierre De Geyter's job as a woodcarver, the 6,000 leaflets printed by Lille printer Bolboduc only mentioned the French version of his family name (Degeyter). In 1904, Pierre's brother Adolphe was induced by the Lille mayor Gustave Delory to claim copyright, so that the income of the song would continue to go to Delory's French Socialist Party. Pierre De Geyter lost the first copyright case in 1914, but after his brother committed suicide and left a note explaining the fraud, Pierre was declared the copyright owner by a court of appeal in 1922.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&date=2009-10-25+16:54:58|archivedate=2009-10-25[/tpl]
Pierre De Geyter died in 1932. The duration of copyright in France is 70 years following the end of the year when the author died.  Previously,  for musical works,[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Loi n° 85-660 du 3 juillet 1985, art. 8. additional protection for 6 years and 152 days to compensate for World War I, and 8 years and 120 days to compensate for World War II,Arts. L123-1, L123-8, and L123-9 in Chapter III of Title II of Book I of the Intellectual Property Code of France and its French version; see :fr:Prorogations de guerre#Exception for commentary. was allowed, so his music of the "Internationale" would have been expected to remain copyrighted in France until October 2017.Year  1932 when Pierre De Geyter died, plus 70 years until year end, plus 6 years and 152 days, plus 8 years and 120 days, will get to October 2017. However, the 1995 harmonization of copyright term across the European Union at 70 years without extension means that the musical composition fell into the public domain in France at the end of 2002.  Nonetheless, in 2005, Le Chant du Monde, the corporation administering the authors' rights, asked Pierre Merejkowsky, the film director and an actor of Insurrection / résurrection, to pay €1,000 for whistling the song for seven seconds.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Siffloter « L'Internationale » peut coûter cher Le Monde, April 9, 2005  This position is inconsistent with a 2007 decision of the Cour de Cassation clarifying the matter.
As the "Internationale" music was published before 1 July 1909 outside the United States of America, it is in the public domain in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm|title=Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States|author=Peter B.

As Eugène Pottier died in 1887, his original French lyrics are in the public domain. Gustave Delory once acquired the copyright of his lyrics through the songwriter G B Clement having bought it from Pottier's widow.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt|title=The International|author=The Guardian, Australia|pages=16th paragraph|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/7078/inter.txt&date=2009-10-25+16:54:58|archivedate=2009-10-25[/tpl]

==Translations into other languages==

The German version, Die Internationale, was adopted by the protesters on the streets of East Berlin in 1953 and again in October 1989, when East Germans taken prisoner by their own police following demonstrations in the wake of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit sang the hymn to embarrass their captors by suggesting they had abandoned the socialist cause they were supposed to serve. Luckhardt's version, the standard German translation, of the final line of the chorus tellingly reads: "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht". (The Internationale will win our human rights.) It was coupled with the chant: "Volkspolizei, steh dem Volke bei" (People's police, stand with the people!).
The Internationale in Chinese ([tpl]zh|t=國際歌|s=国际歌|p=Guójìgē[/tpl]), literally the International Song, has several different sets of lyrics. One such version served as the de facto anthem of the Communist Party of China,[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] Xinhua Net: 瞿秋白：译词传谱国际歌 the national anthem of the Chinese Soviet Republic,[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] People's Daily: History of Chinese national anthems in a hundred years as well as a rallying song of the students and workers at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.Modern History Sourcebook: The Internationale
Versions of the song in Indian languages, particularly Bengali and Malayalam, have existed since the time of colonial rule. It was translated into Bengali by the radical poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and subsequently by Hemanga Biswas. The Malayalam version of the song has also existed since the 1950s with the translation of the song for the people of the Indian state of Kerala by actor and social activist Premji for the united Communist Party of India (CPI). In the 1980s, more translations appeared. Translations by Sachidanandan and Mokeri Ramachandran were sung by the activists of Janakeeya Samskarikavedi, an organisation connected with CPI(Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML). Translation by N. P. Chandrasekharan was for Students Federation of India (SFI), the student organisation associated with CPI(Marxist) (CPI(M) and published in the Student Monthly, the organ of SFI.
Nepali translations of the song have also been sung in various parts of Nepal, and Kathmandu and the song has been popularised by the Nepali Maoists.

===Russian lyrics===

The Russian version was initially translated by Aron Kots (Arkady Yakovlevich Kots) in 1902  and printed in London in Zhizn, a Russian émigré magazine. The first Russian version consisted of three stanzas (as opposed to six stanzas in the original French lyrics, and based on stanzas 1, 2 and 6) and the refrain. After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the text was slightly re-worded to get rid of "now useless" future tenses - particularly the refrain was reworded (the future tense was replaced by the present, and the first person plural possessive pronoun was introduced). In 1918, the chief-editor of Izvestia, Yuri Steklov, appealed to Russian writers to translate the other three stanzas and in the end, the song was expanded into six stanzas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le4/le4-5401.htm|title=The International (in Russian)|publisher=Fundamental'naya Elektronnaya Biblioteka|author=A.V. Lunacharskiy(ed)[/tpl] In 1944, the Soviet Union adopted the "Hymn of the Soviet Union" as its national anthem.  Prior to that time, the "Internationale" served as the principal musical expression of allegiance to the ideals of the October Revolution and the Soviet Union. (The "Internationale" continued to be recognized as the official song of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the post-1919 Soviet version is still used by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.) The three stanzas by Kots were as follows:

===English Lyrics===

The traditional British version of The Internationale is usually sung in three verses, while the American version, written by Charles Hope Kerr with five verses, is usually sung in two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/smm-aging-anthems.shtml#_ednref20|title=Billy Bragg's Revival of Aging Anthems: Radical Nostalgia or Activist Inspiration?|author=David Walls, Sonoma State University[/tpl]The Internationale in 82 languages The American version is sometimes sung with the phrase "the internationale", "the international soviet", or "the international union" in place of "the international working class". In English renditions, "Internationale" is sometimes sung as [tpl]IPAc-en|ɪ|n|t|ər|n|æ|ʃ|ə|ˈ|n|æ|l|i[/tpl] rather than the French pronunciation of [tpl]IPA-fr|lɛ̃tɛʁnasjɔnal(ə)|[/tpl].
The English versions are known to be notoriously difficult to sing, as the lyrics may appear sometimes forced and unnatural [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]. British musician Billy Bragg, after talking to the American folk singer and activist Pete Seeger, agreed that the old lyrics were "archaic and unsingable".Billy Bragg sings the Internationale at Pete Seeger's 90th birthday concert, May 3, 2009: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BIvqbyku5g However, the Scottish musician Dick Gaughan takes a different view.Scottish musician Dick Gaughan supports an older British English version http://www.dickgaughan.co.uk/songs/texts/internat.html Bragg composed revised verses for the song, based on the British version. The recording was released on his album The Internationale along with reworkings of other socialist songs. A full, six-stanza translation can be found on the Wikisource page on The Internationale.
