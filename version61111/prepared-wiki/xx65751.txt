Hybristophilia "is a paraphilia of the predatory type in which sexual arousal, facilitation, and attainment of orgasm are responsive to and contingent upon being with a partner known to have committed an outrage, cheating, lying, known infidelities or crime, such as rape, murder, or armed robbery." The term is derived from the Greek word ὑβρίζειν hubrizein, meaning "to commit an outrage against someone" (ultimately derived from ὕβρις  hubris "hubris"), and philo, meaning "having a strong affinity/preference for".[tpl]cite book|last=Hickey|first=by Eric W.|title=Sex crimes and paraphilia|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=9780131703506|pages=197-9[/tpl] In popular culture, this phenomenon is also known as "Bonnie and Clyde Syndrome".
Many high-profile criminals, particularly those who have committed atrocious crimes, receive "fan mail" in prison which is sometimes amorous or sexual, presumably as a result of this phenomenon. In some cases, admirers of these criminals have gone on to marry the object of their affections in prison.[tpl]cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|title=Women Who Love Serial Killers|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201204/women-who-love-serial-killers|work=Psychology Today|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Seltzer|first=Leon F.|title=Why Do Women Fall for Serial Killers?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201204/why-do-women-fall-serial-killers|work=Psychology Today|date=24 April 2012|accessdate=13 May 2013[/tpl]

The reason why some women do this is unknown, but some speculations have been offered. For instance,  Katherine Ramsland, who is a professor of forensic psychology at DeSales University mentions, that some of the women who have married or dated serial killers have offered the following reasons:
Others offered reasons along the lines of:
Other psychologists, such as Leon F. Seltzer, has offered explanations based on evolutionary psychology. Serial killers, in his view, are cases of alpha males that tend to attract women. This is because such males were good at protecting women and their offspring in our evolutionary history. Women nowadays may consciously realize that it is unwise to date a serial killer, but they are nevertheless attracted to them, as he notes "as a therapist I've encountered many women who bemoaned their vulnerability toward dominant men who, consciously, they recognized were all wrong for them." As evidence of women's fantasy preference for dominant men, he refers to the book A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire  by Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam. Seltzer discusses Ogas and Gaddam's argument that this fantasy is the dominant plot of most erotic/romantic books and movies written for women but the fantasy always holds that this male dominance is conditional, "it doesn’t really represent the man’s innermost reality." 

==Examples in popular media==

An episode of The Good Wife was titled "Hybristophilia" and centered on the death of a woman stalking an infamous murderer.
Harley Quinn from the Batman media appears to suffer from a form of this, having fallen in love with The Joker while working at Arkham Asylum as a psychologist.
