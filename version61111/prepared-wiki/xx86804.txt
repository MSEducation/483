==Development==

First Hawaiian Center was completed and opened in 1996 by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of First Hawaiian Bank Walter A. Dods, Jr.  With over 645,834 square feet (60,000 m²) of space  and a height of 429 feet (131 m), the building cost over USD $175 million to construct.  The architects were from the firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]

==Architecture==

First Hawaiian Center planning was met with controversy as Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i residents became concerned about the effect skyscrapers would have on the Hawaiian landscape.  Architects compromised with the use of Hawaiian architectural principles used in most contemporary Honolulu urban projects like those employed by architects of the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i Convention Center.  Metaphoric designs were used in reference to natural phenomena found in Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] 
Two distinct architectural forms resulted in the compromise, one for the makai side facing the ocean and one for the mauka side facing the mountains.  Horizontally louvered windows framed views of the sea and the horizon while vertically proportioned windows faced the mountains.  A great deal of effort was made to incorporate as much natural light into the building interiors.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
