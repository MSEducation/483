Priddey had several styles, all unmistakably his own. He produced hundreds of black and white line illustrations for books and pamphlets, perhaps most notably for the 1973 publication Heart of England, a guide to the Midlands region which he illustrated throughout, with accompanying text by Louise Wright. Towns, villages, rural scenes and some fine Black Country landscapes filled its pages, while a watercolour, very different in style but equally beautiful, graced the dustjacket.
James Priddey died just before Christmas in 1980. His granddaughters are Catherine and Hannah Priddey.
