==History==

In 1969 the State of Texas created the Star of the Republic Museum through House Bill No. 634, of the Sixty-First Legislature. The Museum officially opened on Texas Independence Day, March 2, 1970 and was transferred from the State Parks and Wildlife to Blinn College, located in Brenham, Texas. In 1972 the Star of the Republic Museum received one of the highest honors in the museum field by achieving accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums. As an accredited facility, the Museum is certified in adhering to the standards set forth by the museum profession, providing quality service to the public, and maintaining the collections in a responsible manner. Of the approximate 8,500 museums in the nation, only around 800 are accredited. In 1992 the Museum began a long-range plan for major facility renovations. The plans included renovations to the building, a building addition, and a fund raising campaign to renovate the Museum's exhibits. Through the efforts of this plan, The Republic of Texas exhibition was finished in 2002. This permanent exhibit allows visitors to view over 1,000 objects from the collection depicting the culture of early 19th century Texas.
