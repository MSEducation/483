</ref>  In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and though it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.
Although Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.

===2060===

In late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060.  The story garnered vast amounts of public interest and found its way onto the front page of several widely distributed newspapers, including the UK's Daily Telegraph, Canada's National Post, Israel's Maariv and Yediot Aharonot, and was also featured in an article in the scientific
journal, Canadian Journal of History.[ref]
</ref>  Television and Internet stories in the following weeks heightened the exposure and ultimately would include the production of several documentary films focused upon the topic of the 2060 prediction and some of Newton's lesser known beliefs and practices.
The two documents detailing this prediction are currently housed within the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem.  Both were believed to be written toward the end of Newton's life, circa 1705, a time frame most notably established by the use of the full title of Sir Isaac Newton within portions of the documents.
These documents do not appear to have been written with the intention of publication and Newton expressed a strong personal dislike for individuals who provided specific dates for the Apocalypse purely for sensational value. Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.
To understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent antitrinitarian beliefs and his Protestant views on the Papacy.  Both of these lay essential to his calculations, which ultimately would provide the 2060 time frame.  See Isaac Newton's religious views for more details.
The first document, part of the Yahuda collection,Yahuda MS 7.3o, f. 8r is a small letter slip, on the back of which is written haphazardly in Newton's hand:

The second reference to the 2060 prediction can be found in a folio,[ref]Yahuda MS 7.3g, f.
13v[/ref] in which Newton writes:
Clearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.
Newton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace.  In Christian and Islamic theology this concept is often referred to as The Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the establishment of The Kingdom of God on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:

==Newton's chronology==

Isaac Newton wrote extensively upon the historical topic of Chronology. In 1728 "The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms", an approximately 87,000 word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, though the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died.  As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications.  Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled, "The Original of Monarchies" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of Noah.[ref]
</ref>
Newton's chronological writing is Eurocentric, with the earliest records focusing upon Greece, Anatolia, Egypt, and the Levant.  Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge.  While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within The Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC.  In this entry he mentions Mephres, a ruler over Upper Egypt from the territories of Syene to Heliopolis, and his successor Misphragmuthosis.  However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be Ramesses IX.
Though some of the dates Newton provides for various events are inaccurate by modern standards, archaeology as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time.  In fact, the majority of  the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of Herodotus, Pliny, Plutarch, Homer, and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date.  Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.

===Newton's Atlantis===

Found within The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms, are several passages that directly mention the mythical land of Atlantis.  The first such passage is part of his Short Chronical which indicates his belief that Homer's Ulysses left the island of Ogygia in 896 BC.  In Greek mythology, Ogygia was home to Calypso, the daughter of Atlas (after whom Atlantis was named).  Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island.  From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief.  Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.  Within the same material Newton mentions that according to ancient sources, Atlantis had been as big as all Europe, Africa and Asia, but was sunk into the Sea.

==Newton and secret societies==

Isaac Newton has often been associated with various secret societies and fraternal orders throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.[tpl]Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publication-date =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | publication-place = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-maçonnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt - from Chapter 3 | isbn =1-59477-172-3  | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =2008-06-25 | nopp =true | year =2007 | postscript = [/tpl]
Regardless of his own membership status, Newton was a known associate of many individuals who themselves have often been labeled as members of various esoteric groups.  It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting President of The Royal Society (1703–1727), a prominent figure of State and Master of the Mint, a recognized Knight, or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues.  The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.
Though Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of "Societies" or "Clubs" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking.  Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels.  He was most certainly a member of The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the Spalding Gentlemen's Society,[tpl]cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe, Scott Mandelbrote, |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|year=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =2008-06-25 [/tpl] however, these are considered learned societies, not esoteric societies.  Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.

===Newton and The Rosicrucians===

Perhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was Rosicrucianism.[tpl]Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publication-date = | year =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press  | page =117 | isbn =0-7382-0143-X | url =http://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =2008-06-25 | postscript = [/tpl]  Though the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized.  However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.
The Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs.  Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the elixir vitae and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of The Philosopher's Stone, which they claimed to have in their possession.  Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised.  Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.
At the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696.  For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world.  In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C., by Thomas Vaughan which represents an English translation of The Rosicrucian Manifestos.  Newton also possessed copies of Themis Aurea and Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium by the learned alchemist Michael Maier, both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement.  These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.
Newton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order.  Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership.  However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have ‘found God’ would not preclude others from the search — quite the opposite.  The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order, 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA. During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.[tpl]cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |year=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London[/tpl]  Though it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.
