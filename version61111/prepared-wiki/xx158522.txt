The history of skyscrapers in Houston began with the 1904 completion of the Lomas & Nettleton Building; this 8-story structure is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5553/is_199906/ai_n22408553|author=Bivins, Ralph|title=Houston Developer to Transform Early 'Skyscraper' into Loft Apartments.|date=1999-06-12|accessdate=2008-04-18|work=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] It was also the tallest steel-framed building west of the Mississippi River at the time of its completion.[tpl]cite web|author=Martin, Paige|url=http://www.franklinloftshouston.com/|title=Franklin Lofts in Houston|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=Martha Turner Properties[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.inthelooplofts.com/For_Sale.html|title=Franklin Lofts|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=In The Loop Lofts[/tpl] The building originally housed offices, but was converted into a residential loft tower in 1999 and renamed "Franklin Lofts". As Franklin Lofts is a low-rise building,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=franklinlofts-houston-tx-usa|title=Franklin Lofts|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=Emporis.com[/tpl] 711 Main, which was completed in 1908, was actually the city's first high-rise to rise at least 10 floors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=capitollofts-houston-tx-usa|title=Capitol Lofts|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=Emporis.com[/tpl] Although originally constructed as a commercial building, 711 Main was given a new glass and granite facade in 1980 and also renovated into a residential tower. Houston went through a small building boom in the early 1920s, and then experienced a much larger boom lasting from 1963 to the late 1980s. During this time 38 of the city's 45 tallest buildings were constructed, including the JPMorgan Chase Tower, the Wells Fargo Bank Plaza and the Williams Tower. As of 2009, the skyline of Houston is ranked 13th in the world and fourth in the United States, behind New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, with 443 completed high-rises.
Houston entered into another high-rise construction boom in 2002, and has since seen the completion of five buildings rising over [tpl]convert|400|ft|m|0[/tpl] tall. Four more skyscrapers are under construction in the city, including MainPlace, which is planned to rise 46 stories and [tpl]convert|630|ft|m|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=68208|title=MainPlace|accessdate=2008-04-19|publisher=SkyscraperPage.com[/tpl] Set to be completed in 2010, the building is the tallest structure under construction in Houston.
