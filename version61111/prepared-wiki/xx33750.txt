Interstate 37 (I-37) is a [tpl]convert|143.0|mi|km|1|sing=on[/tpl] intrastate Interstate Highway located within the U.S. state of Texas.  The highway was first designated in 1959 as a route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio.  Construction in the urban areas of Corpus Christi and San Antonio began in the 1960s and the segments of the Interstate Highway in rural areas were completed by the 1980s.  Prior to I-37, the route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was served by a combination of State Highway 9 (SH 9) from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and U.S. Route 281 (US 281) from Three Rivers to San Antonio.  As a result of the construction of I-37, SH 9 was removed from the State Highway System.
The highway begins in Corpus Christi at US 181 and SH 35 and heads north to San Antonio, where it ends at I-35.  Beyond I-35, the freeway continues as US 281 to northern San Antonio as a major freeway.  In Corpus Christi, the highway provides access to the downtown area, the Port of Corpus Christi, and the Corpus Christi International Airport.  In San Antonio, it provides access to Downtown, Brooks City-Base, the Alamodome, the Tower of the Americas, the River Walk, the Alamo, and by extension via US 281, the San Antonio International Airport.  The route provides an important connection between I-35 and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as one of the few limited-access hurricane evacuation routes away from the southern Texas coast.

==Route description==

Interstate 37 starts near the Gulf Coast in Corpus Christi and heads northwest toward San Antonio. It links South Texas to the northern parts of the state via I-69E, US 77, and US 281. The highway functions as one of the few freeway hurricane evacuation routes for the southern Texas coast. It roughly parallels US 181, which both begins and ends at I-37, and US 281.
Unofficially, I-37 begins at an intersection with Shoreline Boulevard on the edge of Corpus Christi Bay. It then heads west as a surface street for three blocks where it becomes entrance and exit ramps which connect to the freeway.[tpl]Google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Unknown+road&daddr=Unknown+road&hl=en&ll=27.801273,-97.395505&spn=0.005476,0.008969&sll=27.800409,-97.395859&sspn=0.005476,0.008969&geocode=FT46qAEduusx-g%3BFe4uqAEdRs4x-g&t=h&mra=me&mrsp=1,0&sz=17&z=17|title=East of I-37 in Corpus Christi|accessdate=April 20, 2013[/tpl]  I-37 begins officially at the gore point for these ramps, which is part of an interchange complex that also represents the southern ends of US 181 and SH 35.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tnris.org/get-data?quicktabs_maps_data=1|title=Maps & Data|year=2012|publisher=Texas Natural Resources Information System|accessdate=April 20, 2013|format=ESRI shapefile[/tpl]
It heads west from US 181 through Corpus Christi and intersects two freeways, SH 286 (the Crosstown Expressway) and SH 358 (Padre Island Drive). The highway turns towards the northwest after the SH 358 interchange roughly parallel to the south of the Nueces River. Just prior to leaving the Corpus Christi city limits, it intersects and has a short concurrency with US 77 (future I-69E). US 77 (future I-69E) merges with I-37 as a freeway from the south; the two continue to the north and split after crossing the Nueces River. The Interstate continues to the northwest as US 77 (future I-69E) continues to the northeast.
I-37 transitions to a rural setting once outside of the Corpus Christi city limits on its way to Mathis and Lake Corpus Christi. It continues on to the northwest and intersects US 59 (proposed I-69W) east of George West. It begins paralleling US 281 to the east before the two intersect and have a concurrency north of Three Rivers near Choke Canyon Reservoir. U.S. Highway 281 Alternate (US 281 Alt) splits off from I-37 near Sunniland and parallels I-37 before rejoining north of Campbellton. The two routes remain concurrent until US 281 splits off to head to Pleasanton, while I-37 bypasses the city to the east. After US 281 leaves towards the northwest, I-37 turns to the north towards San Antonio.
As I-37 enters the San Antonio city limits, it intersects the northern terminus of US 181.  Continuing to the north, it intersects I-410, the inner loop around San Antonio, at a stack interchange. At this junction, the Interstate once again runs concurrently with US 281 which had been concurrent with I-410. Heading north through the south side of San Antonio, I-37 provides access to Brooks City-Base (formerly Brooks AFB). After a cloverleaf interchange at Loop 13, the freeway turns towards the northwest. The highway intersects I-10, which is concurrent with US 90 and US 87, at a stack interchange on the southeastern corner of Downtown. After the interchange, it once again heads north on the east side of Downtown. It passes near the Alamodome, the Tower of the Americas, the River Walk and the Alamo. I-37 ends at the northeastern corner of Downtown at a junction with I-35. US 281 continues to the north as a freeway and provides access to the San Antonio International Airport and later Far North Central.
From I-410 to I-10 in San Antonio, I-37 is designated the Lucian Adams Freeway, after the World War II veteran.  Adams is a native of Port Arthur, and received the Medal of Honor for his service in France, along with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his gallantry during the Cassino Campaign.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form.asp?step=1&pers_id=11141 |title= Lucian Adams |publisher=Texas State Cemetery |accessdate= February 27, 2008[/tpl] From I-10 to its northern terminus at I-35, it is designated the Staff Sergeant William J.

==History==

Prior to I-37, the routing between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was covered by SH 9 from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and US 281 from Three Rivers to San Antonio.  Beginning in 1971, sections of SH 9 were officially removed from the State Highway System as I-37 was completed.[tpl]TxDOT|SH|9|accessdate=February 27, 2008 |link=no[/tpl]  No sections of US 281 were removed from the State Highway System as a result of the construction of I-37, but the two do share the same alignment at two different points between San Antonio and Three Rivers.  Also, US 281 was rerouted onto I-37 in San Antonio in 1978.[tpl]google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=2568522560958495253,27.801020,-97.395701%3B6464171849619486050,29.438726,-98.477498&saddr=I-37+N+%4027.801020,+-97.395701&daddr=US-281+N+%4029.438726,+-98.477498&doflg=ptm&sll=28.61835,-97.938615&sspn=3.187023,5.108643&ie=UTF8&z=8 |title= Overview map of I-37 |accessdate= February 25, 2008[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|SS|536|accessdate= March 8, 2008 |link=no[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|SS|537|accessdate= March 8, 2008 |link= no[/tpl]
