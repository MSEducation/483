[[Calling Out]]

CATEGORIES: 2008 albums, FemBots albums

Calling Out is the fourth album by Canadian indie rock band FemBots, released on September 16, 2008 with Weewerk.
The album was originally intended to use only junk instruments created out of garbage by guest musician Iner Souster. However, the band reportedly found the instruments were not sufficiently reliable to form the basis of the entire album, and instead added some conventional instrumentation while retaining the junk instruments on the songs' rhythm tracks.Fembots detail Calling Out, punknews.org
In addition to Souster and the FemBots, the album also features Nathan Lawr and Christine Fellows.
