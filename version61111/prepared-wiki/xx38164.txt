The statement continued, "To start the concert KANSAS will perform a set backed by a 35-piece symphony orchestra. Following an intermission, KANSAS will then rock out a traditional band set of classics from their repertoire. The night will be highlighted by special guest appearances throughout the concert by original members Dave Hope, Kerry Livgren, and Robby Steinhardt—marking the first time all original members of the band will be on the same stage together in more than 30 years." However Steinhardt suffered a heart attack days before the concert and was unable to participate.
