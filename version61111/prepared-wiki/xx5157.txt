Established in the fourth century, the city became an important trading port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies (known as Batavia at that time) and has continued as the capital of Indonesia since the country's independence was declared in 1945.
The city is the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat. Jakarta is served by the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport, and Tanjung Priok Harbour; it is connected by several intercity and commuter railways, and served by several bus lines running on reserved busways.

==Etymology==

The place that is now called Jakarta has been home to multiple settlements along with their respective names: Sunda Kelapa (397–1527), Jayakarta (1527–1619), Batavia (1619–1949), and Djakarta (1949–1972).
Its current name is derived from the word "Jayakarta". The origins of this word lie in the Old Javanese and ultimately in the Sanskrit language. "Jayakarta" translates as "victorious deed", "complete act", or "complete victory".
Jakarta is nicknamed the Big Durian, the thorny foul-smelling fruit; the city is seen as the Indonesian equivalent of New York City (the Big Apple).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1532 |title=Sojourn in the Big Durian |publisher=ThingsAsian |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-colonial era===

The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the fourth century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia.[tpl]Cite book|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Jaya, Jakarta|title=Sundakala: cuplikan sejarah Sunda berdasarkan naskah-naskah "Panitia Wangsakerta" Cirebon|year=2005[/tpl] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Kingdom of Sunda. From 7th to early 13th century port of Sunda is within the sphere of influence of Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1200, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source reports the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, pepper from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden piles.[tpl]cite book | author=Drs. R.

The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 when the Portuguese were looking for a route for spices.[tpl]Cite book|publisher=Cipta Loka Caraka|title=Sumber-sumber asli sejarah Jakarta, Jilid I: Dokumen-dokumen sejarah Jakarta sampai dengan akhir abad ke-16|year=1999[/tpl] The Kingdom of Sunda made an alliance treaty with Portugal by allowing the Portuguese to build a port in 1522 in order to defend against the rising power of the Sultanate of Demak from central Java.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beritajakarta.com/english/AboutJakarta/HistoryofJakarta.asp |title=History of Jakarta |work=BeritaJakarta[/tpl] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Javanese general from Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta, and became a fiefdom of the Sultanate of Banten which became a major Southeast Asia trading centre.
Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta from the Sultanate of Banten, Dutch ships arrived in Jayakarta in 1596. In 1602, the English East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in Indonesia until 1682.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ricklefs |first=M.C. |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300 |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan |year=1993 |location=London |page=29 |isbn=0-333-57689-6[/tpl]
Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[tpl]Cite book|last=Heuken |first=Adolf|title=Sumber-sumber asli sejarah Jakarta Jilid II: Dokumen-dokumen Sejarah Jakarta dari kedatangan kapal pertama Belanda (1596) sampai dengan tahun 1619 (Authentic sources of History of Jakarta part II: Documents of history of Jakarta from the first arrival of Dutch ship (1596) to year 1619) |publisher=Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka |year=2000 |location=Jakarta [/tpl]

===Colonial era===

When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, Jayawikarta's soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. Prince Jayakarta's army and the English were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen (J.P. Coen). The Dutch burned the English fort, and forced the English to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power and in 1619 they renamed the city Batavia.
Commercial opportunities in the capital of the Dutch colony attracted Indonesian and especially Chinese immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740 and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[tpl]Cite book|last=Witton |first=Patrick |title=Indonesia |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |year=2003 |location=Melbourne |pages=138–139|isbn=1-74059-154-2[/tpl] The city began to move further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 encouraged more people to move far south of the port.

===Independence era===

Following World War II, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta during their fight for Indonesian independence and established their capital in Yogyakarta. In 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta was once again made the national capital. Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, envisaged Jakarta as a great international city, and instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.[tpl]Cite book|last=Kusno |first=Abidin |year=2000 |title=Behind the Postcolonial: Architecture, Urban Space and Political Cultures |location=New York City |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-23615-0[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|first=P. |last=Schoppert |coauthor=Damais, S. |title=Java Style |year=1997 |publisher=Didier Millet |location=Paris |isbn= 962-593-232-1[/tpl] Projects included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new parliament building.

The boom ended with the 1997/98 East Asian Economic crisis putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political maneuvering. After 32 years in power, support for President Suharto began to wane.

==Administration==

===Kota or kotamadya (municipalities) and regency of Jakarta===

Officially, Jakarta is not a city, but a province with special status as the capital of Indonesia. It has a governor (instead of a mayor), and is divided into several sub-regions with their own administrative systems. As a province, the official name of Jakarta is Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta ("Special Capital City District of Jakarta"), which in Indonesian is abbreviated to DKI Jakarta.
Jakarta is divided into five kota or kotamadya ("cities" – formerly municipalities), each headed by a mayor – and one regency (kabupaten) headed by a regent. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor, whereas previously the city's governors were appointed by the local house of representatives. The poll is part of a country-wide decentralization drive, allowing for direct local elections in several areas.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6936276.stm |title=Jakarta holds historic election |work=BBC News  |publisher=BBC  |date=8 August 2007[/tpl]
The cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:
The only regency (kabupaten) of Jakarta is:

===Government===

In September 1945, the government of Jakarta City was changed from the Japanese Djakarta Toku-Betsu Shi into the Jakarta National Administration. This first government was held by a Mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a Governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Sudiro, until he was replaced by Dr Sumarno as Governor of the province (as the city had now become).
In 1974, Based on the Act No. 5 of 1974 relating to the Fundamentals of Regional Government, Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of Indonesia's (then) 26 provinces.[tpl]Cite book|publisher=Statistics DKI Jakarta Provincial Office, Jakarta|title=Jakarta in Figures |year=2008[/tpl]

===Municipal finances===

The ability of the regional government to respond to the many problems of Jakarta is constrained by extremely limited finances. In 2013 the total budget available to the Jakarta regional government was approved at around Rp 50 trillion (about $US 5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US 380 per citizen. Priority areas of spending were listed as education, transport, flood control measures, environment programs, and various types of social spending (such as health and housing).Sita W. Dewi, 'Council approves city budget for 2013, higher than proposed', The Jakarta Post, 29 January 2013.
The Jakarta provincial government, like all other provincial governments in Indonesia, relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of budget income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees and so on.'Taxpayer money for the city', The Jakarta Post, 16 July 2011.
In recent years, the Jakarta provincial government has consistently run a surplus of between 15–20% of total planned spending, largely because of delays in procurement procedures and other inefficiencies in the spending process.Sita W. Dewi, 'Jokowi spends less, provides more than Foke, say observers', The Jakarta Post, 9 December 2013. The regular underspending is a matter of frequent public comment but the legal and administrative blockages that cause the underspending problem seem very difficult to overcome.Andreas D. Arditya, '"Procurement failures" to blame for budget surplus', The Jakarta Post, 4 May 2012.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===

Jakarta is located on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, which is an inlet of the Java Sea. Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is [tpl]convert|662|km2|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of land area and [tpl]convert|6977|km2|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of sea area.Based on Governor Decree in 2007, No. 171. taken from Statistics DKI Jakarta Provincial Office, Jakarta in Figures, 2008, BPS, Province of DKI Jakarta The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

Rivers flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, across the city northwards towards the Java Sea; the most important[tpl]Clarify|date=May 2010[/tpl] is the Ciliwung River, which divides the city into the western and eastern principalities. Other rivers include the Pesanggrahan, and Sunter.
All these rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding. Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 centimeters each year, even up to 20 centimeters in the northern coastal areas. To help cope with the threat from the sea, the Netherlands will give $4 million for a feasibility study to build a dike around Jakarta Bay. The ring dike will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater. Additionally, the dike will function as a toll road. The project will be built by 2025.Dutch to study new dike for Jakarta Bay | The Jakarta Post In January 2014, Central Government agreed to build 2 dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2 kilometers tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease Jakarta floods. Construction costs will be paid by Central Government, but land acquisitions is responsibility of Jakarta Authority.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/jakarta/new-ciliwung-river-dams-planned-as-jakarta-struggles-with-latest-floods/ |title=New Ciliwung River Dams Planned as Jakarta Struggles With Latest Floods |date=20 January 2014[/tpl]

===Climate===

Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (Am)[tpl]cite web|title=Climate: Jakarta – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/714756/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=20 September 2013[/tpl] according to the Köppen climate classification system. Despite being located relatively close to the equator, the city has distinct wet and dry seasons. The wet season in Jakarta covers the majority of the year, running from November through June. The remaining four months forms the city's dry season. Located in the western part of Java, Jakarta's wet season rainfall peak is January with average monthly rainfall of [tpl]convert|389|mm[/tpl], and its dry season low point is September with a monthly average of [tpl]convert|30|mm|abbr=on[/tpl].

==Culture==

As the economic and political capital of Indonesia, Jakarta attracts many domestic immigrants who bring their various languages, dialects, foods and customs.
The "Betawi" (Orang Betawi, or "people of Batavia") are the descendants of the people living in and around Batavia and recognized as an ethnic group from around the 18th–19th century. The Betawi people are mostly descended from various Southeast-Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet labor needs, and include people from different parts of Indonesia.The Betawi – due to their diverse origins – play a major role concerning ethnic and national identity in contemporary Jakarta; see Knörr, Jacqueline: Kreolität und postkoloniale Gesellschaft. Integration und Differenzierung in Jakarta, Campus Verlag: Frankfurt a.M. & New York, 2007, ISBN 978-3-593-38344-6 The language and Betawi culture are distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. The language is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau, Chinese, and Arabic. Nowadays, the Jakarta dialect (Bahasa Jakarta), used as a street language by people in Jakarta, is loosely based on the Betawi language.
Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi have moved to the suburbs of Jakarta, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of Gambang Kromong (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music) or Tanjidor (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music) or Marawis (a mixture between Betawi and Yaman music). However, some festivals such as the Jalan Jaksa Festival or Kemang Festival include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to give performances.[tpl]Cite book|last=Knörr |first=Jacqueline |title=Kreolität und postkoloniale Gesellschaft.

There has been a significant Chinese community in Jakarta for many centuries. The Chinese in Jakarta traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in old chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. Officially, they make up 5.5% of the Jakartan population, although this number may be under-reported.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4312805.stm |title=Chinese diaspora: Indonesia |work=BBC News  |publisher=BBC  |author=Johnston, Tim |date=3 March 2005[/tpl] Chinese culture also had influenced Betawi culture, such as the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers, to Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.
Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performances can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata theater near Senen bus terminal. As the nation's largest city and capital, Jakarta has lured much national and regional talent who hope to find a greater audience and more opportunities for success.
Jakarta hosts several prestigious art and culture festivals, and exhibitions, such as the annual Jakarta International Film Festival (JiFFest), Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival, Jakarta Fashion Week, Jakarta Fashion & Food Festival (JFFF), Jakarta Fair, Indonesia Creative Products and Jakarta Arts and Crafts exhibition. Flona Jakarta is a flora-and-fauna exhibition, held annually in August at Lapangan Banteng Park, featuring flowers, plant nurseries, and pets. The Jakarta Fair is held annually from mid-June to mid-July to celebrate the anniversary of the city and is largely centred around a trade fair. However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local bands and musicians.
Several foreign art and culture centres are also established in Jakarta, and mainly serve to promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries, and art galleries. Among these foreign art and cultural centres are China Confucius Institute, Netherlands Erasmus Huis, UK British Council, France Centre Culturel Français, Germany Goethe-Institut, Japan Foundation, and the Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Centre.

===Museums===

The museums in Jakarta cluster around the Central Jakarta Merdeka Square area, Jakarta Old Town, and Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.
The Jakarta Old Town contains museums that are former institutional buildings of Colonial Batavia. Some of these museums are: Jakarta History Museum (former City Hall of Batavia), Wayang Museum (Puppet Museum) (former Church of Batavia), the Fine Art and Ceramic Museum (former Court House of Justice of Batavia), the Maritime Museum (former Sunda Kelapa warehouse), Bank Indonesia Museum (former Javasche Bank), and Bank Mandiri Museum (former Nederlandsche Handels Maatschappij).
There is also a very famous museum in Jakarta, dedicated to the famous music producer MOBZERO. It feature lots of his music and artworks. 
Several museums clustered in central Jakarta around the Merdeka Square area include: National Museum of Indonesia (also known as Gedung Gajah ("the Elephant Building"), Monas (National Monument), Istiqlal Islamic Museum in Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, and Jakarta Cathedral Museum on the second floor of Jakarta Cathedral.

The recreational area of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah in East Jakarta contains fourteen museums, such as Indonesia Museum, Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum, Asmat Museum, Bayt al-Qur'an Islamic Museum, Pusaka (heirloom) Museum, and other science-based museum such as Research & Technology Information Centre, Komodo Indonesian Fauna Museum, Insect Museum, Petrol and Gas Museum, plus the Transportation Museum. Other museums are Satria Mandala Military Museum, Museum Sumpah Pemuda, and Lubang Buaya.

===Cuisine===

Jakarta has a vast range of food available at hundreds of eating complexes located all over the city, from modest street-side foodstalls and traveling vendors to the high-class expensive restaurants. One of the most popular local dishes in Jakarta is Soto Betawi, which is a cow milk or coconut milk broth with beef tendons, intestines, tripe. However since Jakarta is regarded as the 'melting-pot' and a miniature of Indonesia, many traditional food from other regions of Indonesia can be easily found in Jakarta. For example, traditional Padang restaurants and low-budget Javanese Warteg (Warung Tegal) foodstalls are ubiquitous in the capital. Next to a myriad of selections of Indonesian food and regional specialties from all over Indonesia, there is also international food, especially Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Indian, American, French, Italian, Vietnamese, Middle Eastern, and modern fusion food.[tpl]cite web|author=By A Yahoo!

==Economy, governance and infrastructure==

===Economy===

Jakarta's economy depends heavily on financial service, trade, and manufacturing. Industries in Jakarta include electronics, automotive, chemicals, mechanical engineering and biomedical sciences manufacturing.
The economic growth of Jakarta in 2007 was 6.44% up from 5.95% the previous year, with the growth in the transportation and communication (15.25%), construction (7.81%) and trade, hotel and restaurant sectors (6.88%). In 2007, GRP (Gross Regional Domestic Product) was Rp. 566 trillion (around $US 56 billion). The largest contributions to GDRP were by finance, ownership and business services (29%); trade, hotel and restaurant sector (20%), and manufacturing industry sector (16%). In 2007, the increase in per capita GRDP of DKI Jakarta inhabitants was 11.6% compared to the previous year
Both GRDP by at current market price and GRDP by at 2000 constant price in 2007 for the Municipality of Central Jakarta (Jakarta Pusat), which was Rp 146 million and Rp 81 million, was higher than other municipalities in DKI Jakarta.

===Governance===

A new law in 2007 forbids the giving of money to beggars, buskers and hawkers, bans squatter settlements on river banks and highways, and prohibits spitting and smoking on public transportation. Unauthorized people cleaning car windscreens and taking tips for directing traffic at intersections will also be penalized. Critics of the new legislation claim that such laws will be difficult to enforce and it tends to ignore the desperate poverty of many of the capital's inhabitants.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6989211.stm; "Condemned Communities: Forced Evictions in Jakarta" Human Rights Watch September 2006.

===Water supply===

Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water supply in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. 80% of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River [tpl]convert|70|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] southeast of the city. Water supply had been privatized by government of then President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both foreign companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the 7 first years of the concessions had been lower than before, despite substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005 tariffs were frozen, leading the private water companies to cut down on investments.
According to PALYJA in its western half of the concession the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010.[tpl]cite web|last=PALYJA|title=Key Figures|url=http://en.palyja.co.id/profile/key-figures/|accessdate=20 November 2011[/tpl] According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004, but stagnated after that.[tpl]cite web|last=Iwan|first=Renalia|title=Ten Years of Public Private Partnership in Jakarta Drinking Water Service (1998–2007) Eastern Jakarta Drinking Water Service by Thames PAM Jaya|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/978/thesis.pdf?sequence=1|work=Master Thesis|publisher=School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand|accessdate=20 November 2011|pages=42–44|date=November 2008[/tpl] However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: One study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[tpl]cite web|last=Karen Bakker, Michelle Kooy, Nur Endah Shofiani, and Ernst-Jan Martijn|title=Disconnected: Poverty, Water Supply and Development in Jakarta, Indonesia|url=http://waterwiki.net/images/8/80/Poverty%2CWaterSupplyAndDevelopmentJakarta.pdf|work=Human Development Report 2006, Occasional Paper|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=20 November 2011|year=2006|quote=quoting a Personal Communication from Kris Tutuko, Technical Director PAM JAYA, Jakarta, Indonesia[/tpl] while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=KRuHA People's coalition for the rights to water|title=Poor Water Service, Most of Jakarta People Threatened by E-Coli|url=http://www.kruha.org/page/en/dinamic_detil/50/194/Press_Releases/Poor_Water_Service__Most_of_Jakarta_People_Threatened_by_E_Coli.html|accessdate=20 November 2011|date=7 June 2011[/tpl] Those without access to piped water supply get water mostly from wells that are often salty and polluted with bacteria.

==Parks==

Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field Park) is located in Central Jakarta near the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, Jakarta Cathedral, and the Jakarta Central Post Office. It is about 4.5 hectares. Initially it was called Waterlooplein of Batavia and functioned as the ceremonial square during the Netherlands Indies colonial period. A number of colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993 the park was turned into a public space again. It has become a recreation place for people and is occasionally also used as an exhibition place or for other events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/v70/index.php/en/taman-kota/523-taman-lapangan-banteng |title=Taman Lapangan Banteng (Indonesian) |work=deskominfomas |publisher=Jakarta.go.id[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] The Jakarta Flona (Flora dan Fauna), the flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.

In 2011, Jakarta again hosted the Southeast Asian Games, but this time as co-hosts with Palembang.
Jakarta's most popular home football club is Persija, which plays its matches in their home stadium at Bung Karno Stadium. The home match of Persija often draws its large fan – cladded with Persija's typical orange kit – to watch the match in the main stadium. The large spectators flocking to the main stadium usually worsen the traffic congestion in Jakarta. Another premiere division team is Persitara which plays its matches in the Kamal Muara Stadium in Kamal area.
The biggest stadium in Jakarta is the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium with a capacity of 88,083 seats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fussballtempel.net/afc/IDN.html |title=Football stadiums of the world – Stadiums in Indonesia |publisher=Fussballtempel.net |accessdate=27 April 2010[/tpl] The Senayan sports complex has several sport venues, including the Bung Karno football stadium, Madya Stadium, Istora Senayan, aquatic arena, baseball field, basketball court, badminton court, a shooting range, several indoor and outdoor tennis court and a golf driving range.

===Road===

A structured road network had been developed in the early 19th century as a part of the Java Great Post Road by former Governor-General Daendels, which connects most major cities throughout Java. During the following decades, the road network was expanded to a great extent, although it could not keep up with the rapidly increasing numbers of motorized vehicles, resulting in highly congested traffic.
A notable feature of Jakarta's present road system is the toll road network. Composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards, the network provides inner as well as outer city connections.
The outer ring road is under construction, but it is largely in use. Six elevated toll roads are in tender progress.
The five radiating toll roads are the:
Throughout the years, several attempts have been made to reduce traffic congestion on Jakarta's main arteries. Implemented solutions include a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers are prohibited from driving on the main avenues. Another example is the ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]

====Public road transportation====

In 1966, an estimated 160 thousand pedicabs (becak) operated in the city; as much as 15% of Jakarta's total workforce was engaged in becak driving. In 1971, becak were banned from major roads, and shortly thereafter the government attempted a total ban, which substantially reduced their numbers but did not eliminate them. A campaign to eliminate them succeeded in 1990 and 1991, but during the economic crisis of 1998, some returned amid less effective government attempts to control them.Azuma, Yoshifumi (2003). Urban peasants: beca drivers in Jakarta. Jakarta: Pustaka Sinar Harapan.
"Auto rickshaws", called bajaj, provide local transportation in the back streets of some parts of the city. From the early 1940s to 1991 they were a common form of local transportation in the city.
The TransJakarta bus rapid transit service (known as Busway) was developed in the context of development reforms (or reformasi) and used Bogota's TransMilenio system as a model.[tpl]cite web|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/ |title=Lo, Ria Hutabarat (2010). "The City as a Mirror: Transport, Land Use and Social Change in Jakarta" Urban Studies 47(3): 529–555 |publisher=Usj.sagepub.com |accessdate=14 March 2011[/tpl] Jakarta's first busway line, from Blok M to Jakarta Kota opened in January 2004 and as of 14 February 2013, twelve out of fifteen corridors are in use. Currently TransJakarta has the world's longest bus rapid transit routes (172 km in length) and has more than 669 buses in operation.
The Kopaja and MetroMini economy minibus systems also provide important services for Jakarta commuters with numerous routes throughout the city.
Although ojeks are not an official form of public transport, they can be found throughout Indonesia and in Jakarta. They are especially useful on the crowded urban roads and narrow alleyways, which other vehicles cannot reach. In November 2011, Taxijek was launched in Jakarta. It is essentially a taxi, but with a motorcycle instead of an automobile. Besides a taximeter and the company's driver identity card, the passenger has access to a helmet, disposable shower caps to use underneath the helmet and an extra raincoat. Contrary to common ojeks, Taxijeks are allowed to enter gated communities and they usually charge a lower fare.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/22/meet-taxijek-motorcycle-taxi-with-a-meter.html |title=Meet Taxijek: Motorcycle taxi with a meter |date=22 February 2012[/tpl]

====Electronic Road Pricing====

Due to the city's acute gridlock, the Jakarta administration will implement Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) in 10 districts: Tanah Abang, Menteng, Setiabudi, Tebet, Matraman, Senen, Gambir, Tambora, Sawah Besar and Taman Sari. The projects will initiate once approved by the Finance Ministry.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/02/10-districts-prepared-electronic-road-pricing-policy-trial-run-jakarta.html |title=10 districts prepared for electronic road pricing policy trial run in Jakarta |date=2 September 2011[/tpl] The ERP will be implemented in the three-in-one zone and along Jl.

Vehicles passing through the ERP areas will be charged Rp 21,072.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/19/city-teams-with-police-erp.html |title=City teams up with police for ERP |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=19 October 2013 |accessdate=10 December 2013[/tpl]

===Railways===

Long-distance railways and local tram services were first introduced during the Dutch colonial era. While the trams were replaced with buses in the post-colonial era, long-distance railways continued to connect the city to its neighbouring regions as well as cities throughout Java. The surrounding cities of Jakarta are served by KRL Jabotabek, a mass rapid transit system which serves commuters both in and around Jakarta. The major rail stations are Gambir, Jakarta Kota, Jatinegara, Pasar Senen, Manggarai, and Tanah Abang. During rush hours, the number of passengers greatly exceeds the system's capacity, and crowding is common.
There had been plans for a monorail and part of it was already under construction, but the project stalled in 2004 and was officially abandoned as of 2008, mostly due to a lack of investors to fund it all. The monorail project was relaunched in 2013 and the groundbreaking was done in October 2013[tpl]cite web|first=Monorel Bisa Dinikmati Warga DKI Tahun 2016|title=Monorail can be enjoyed by Jakartans in 2016|url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2013/10/16/1045344/Monorel.Bisa.Dinikmati.Warga.DKI.Tahun.2016|publisher=Kompas.com|accessdate=16 October 2013|language=Indonesian|date=16 October 2013[/tpl]
A two-line metro (MRT) system is under construction, with a north-south line between Kota and Lebak Bulus; and an east-west line, which will connect to the north-south line at Sawah Besar Station. In the end the JMRT will be a combination of both subways and elevated rails.

The Jakarta Capital City Government had decided to build rail-based mass transits because this type of transport is capable of carrying passengers in large quantities quickly and cheaply.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beritajakarta.com/2008/en/newsview.aspx?idwil=0&id=19300 |title=Rail-based Transportation, Main Component of Metropolitan City |publisher=Berita Jakarta=16 June 2011[/tpl] As of 2013 plans were underway to invest $4 billion in mass transit over the next few years including commencement of a subway.

===Air===

Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport serving the greater Jakarta area. The airport is named after the first President of Indonesia, Soekarno, and the first vice-president, Mohammad Hatta. The airport is often called Cengkareng or Soetta by Indonesians. The airport's IATA code, CGK, originates from the name of the Cengkareng locality, Tangerang, Banten, although the location of this airport is located outside of the city, it is used as a gate out by the Jakartans and citizen of the surrounding areas, therefore at the main gate of the airport, there is an inscription "Jakarta Airports".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.poskotanews.com/2012/01/12/tol-bandara-dijamin-tak-kebanjiran/|title=Tol Bandara |publisher=Poskotanews=12 January 2012[/tpl] It is Indonesia's busiest airport handling over 50 million passengers annually.Tender-Indonesia.com – 10 Bandara di wilayah barat over capacity A second airport, Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) serves domestic flight of low cost airline, private and VIP/presidential flights. Other airports in the Jakarta metropolitan area include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago.

===Waterway===

On 6 June 2007, the city administration introduced the Waterway (officially Angkutan Sungai), a new river boat service along the Ciliwung River.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=119260 |title=Jakarta gets its first klong taxis |work=Bangkok Post |publisher=The Post Publishing Public Co[/tpl] However, because of the large amount of floating garbage which kept jamming the propeller, it is no longer in service. The varying water levels during the dry and wet seasons were also a contributing factor to the close-down.

===Sea===

Jakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok serves many ferry connections to different parts of Indonesia. Tanjung Priok is the largest seaport in Indonesia, with an annual traffic capacity of around 45 million tonnes of cargo and 4,000,000 TEU's.
The port is also an important employer in the area, with more than 18,000 employees who provide services to more than 18,000 ships every year.
The Port of Jakarta has 20 terminals: general cargo, multipurpose terminal, scraps terminal, passenger terminal, dry bulk terminal, liquid bulk terminal, oil terminal, chemicals terminal and three container terminals, 76 berths, a quay length of 16,853 metres, a total storage area of 661,822 m2 and a storage capacity of 401,468 tonnes.Port of Jakarta facilities
