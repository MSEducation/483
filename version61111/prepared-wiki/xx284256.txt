His fame came with his remix of Asaf Avidan & The Mojos song "Reckoning Song" that he heard during a visit to the United States. In winter 2011, he remixed it at Ableton Live, cutting, filtering and adding a simple 4/4 groove to the song into "One Day / Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Rmx)" adding it to his Soundcloud account.Ego FM: Wie Wankelmut mit seinem „One Day“ remix einen hit landet The remix went viral and through support by various blogs and spinning of the remix in various clubs all over Europe. After being approached by a number of labels, it was released by Four Music, who already held the rights to the original song by Asaf Avidan & the Mojos. It became one of house music's biggest hits of 2012 internationally topping the charts many European countries including in Germany. An official music video was released as well. In 2012, he was nominated for "best single" for the song at 1 Live Krone and in 2013 was nominated for "Hit of the Year (national and international)" at 2013 Echo Awards.
Wankelmut put his university studies on hold as he engaged on a pan-European tour. He also worked on various remixes for his first proper solo-release, a remix of "Jungle", a song from Emma Louis. The remix release under the title "My Head Is a Jungle" credits Wankelmut & Emma Louise.
While on holiday in Australia in January 2013, Dilßner spontaneously played a free show, stating: "I’ve made enough money in Europe recently. I’ve had huge support from fans in Melbourne and I’d like to play a show for them. Get me two CDJs and a mixer and I’ll make a party." http://union.unimelb.edu.au/farrago/farrago-articles/-one-day-in-melbourne-with-wanklemut
