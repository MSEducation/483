During the early years of his career he focused mainly on the history of crime, urbanization and justice. More recently, he has written about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Presently, Johnson is mainly concerned with two projects: first genocide, murder and history in world perspective (along with Pieter Spierenburg of Erasmus University Rotterdam) and secondly the issue of downed American pilots during the Second World War. Next to this research, he is writing a personal memoir of Germany in the year of re-unification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/220895.Eric_A_Johnson |title=Eric A.
