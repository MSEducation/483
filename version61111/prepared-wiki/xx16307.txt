Proline (abbreviated as Pro or P) is an α-amino acid, one of the twenty DNA-encoded amino acids. Its codons are CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG. It is not an essential amino acid, which means that the human body can synthesize it. It is unique among the 20 protein-forming amino acids in that the amine nitrogen is bound to not one but two alkyl groups, thus making it a secondary amine. The more common L form has S stereochemistry.

==Biosynthesis==

Proline is biosynthetically derived from the amino acid L-glutamate and its immediate precursor is the imino acid (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C).  Enzymes involved in a typical biosynthesis include:[tpl]Lehninger3rd[/tpl].

==Properties in protein structure==

The distinctive cyclic structure of proline's side chain gives proline an exceptional conformational rigidity compared to other amino acids.  It also affects the rate of peptide bond formation between proline and other amino acids.  When proline is bound as an amide in a peptide bond, its nitrogen is not bound to any hydrogen, meaning it cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor, but can be a hydrogen bond acceptor.
Peptide bond formation with incoming Pro-tRNAPro is considerably slower than with any other tRNAs, which is a general feature of N-alkylamino acids.[tpl]citation | first1 = Michael Y | last1 = Pavlov | first2 = Richard E | last2 = Watts | first3 = Zhongping | last3 = Tan | first4 = Virginia W | last4 = Cornish | first5 = Måns | last5 = Ehrenberg | first6 = Anthony C | title = Slow peptide bond formation by proline and other N-alkylamino acids in translation | year = 2010 | journal = PNAS | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–54 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0809211106 | pmid = 19104062 | last6 = Forster | pmc = 2629218[/tpl].  Peptide bond formation is also slow between an incoming tRNA and a chain ending in proline; with the creation of proline-proline bonds slowest of all.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Buskirk |first=Allen R. |last2=Green |first2=Rachel |title=Getting Past Polyproline Pauses | url=http://uwo.academia.edu/PaulSzpak/Papers/827788/Fish_Bone_Chemistry_and_Ultrastructure_Implications_for_Taphonomy_and_Stable_Isotope_Analysis |journal=Science |year=2013 |volume=339 |issue=6115 |pages=38–39 |doi=10.1126/science.1233338[/tpl]
The exceptional conformational rigidity of proline affects the secondary structure of proteins near a proline residue and may account for proline's higher prevalence in the proteins of thermophilic organisms.  Protein secondary structure can be described in terms of the dihedral angles φ, ψ and ω of the protein backbone.  The cyclic structure of proline's side chain locks the angle φ at approximately −60°.
Proline acts as a structural disruptor in the middle of regular secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets; however, proline is commonly found as the first residue of an alpha helix and also in the edge strands of beta sheets.  Proline is also commonly found in turns (another kind of secondary structure), and aids in the formation of beta turns.  This may account for the curious fact that proline is usually solvent-exposed, despite having a completely aliphatic side chain.
Multiple prolines and/or hydroxyprolines in a row can create a polyproline helix, the predominant secondary structure in collagen. The hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydroxylase (or other additions of electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine) increases the conformational stability of collagen significantly.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Szpak |first=Paul |title=Fish bone chemistry and ultrastructure: implications for taphonomy and stable isotope analysis | url=http://uwo.academia.edu/PaulSzpak/Papers/827788/Fish_Bone_Chemistry_and_Ultrastructure_Implications_for_Taphonomy_and_Stable_Isotope_Analysis |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |year=2011 |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=3358–3372 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.07.022 [/tpl]  Hence, the hydroxylation of proline is a critical biochemical process for maintaining the connective tissue of higher organisms.  Severe diseases such as scurvy can result from defects in this hydroxylation, e.g., mutations in the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase or lack of the necessary ascorbate (vitamin C) cofactor.
Sequences of proline and 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) also form a helical turn structure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

==Cis-trans isomerization==

From a kinetic standpoint, cis-trans proline isomerization is a very slow process that can impede the progress of protein folding by trapping one or more proline residues crucial for folding in the non-native isomer, especially when the native protein requires the cis isomer.  This is because proline residues are exclusively synthesized in the ribosome as the trans isomer form.  All organisms possess prolyl isomerase enzymes to catalyze this isomerization, and some bacteria have specialized prolyl isomerases associated with the ribosome.  However, not all prolines are essential for folding, and protein folding may proceed at a normal rate despite having non-native conformers of many X-Pro peptide bonds.

==Uses==

Proline and its derivatives are often used as asymmetric catalysts in organic reactions. The CBS reduction and proline catalysed aldol condensation are prominent examples.
L-Proline is an osmoprotectant and therefore is used in many pharmaceutical, biotechnological applications.
In brewing, proteins rich in proline combine with polyphenols to produce haze (turbidity).K.J. Siebert, "Haze and Foam",http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/fst/faculty/siebert/haze.html Accessed July 12, 2010.

==Specialties==

Proline is one of the two amino acids that do not follow along with the typical Ramachandran plot, along with glycine. Due to the ring formation connected to the beta carbon, the ψ and φ angles about the peptide bond have fewer allowable degrees of rotation. As a result it is often found in "turns" of proteins as its free entropy (ΔS) is not as comparatively large to other amino acids and thus in a folded form vs. unfolded form, the change in entropy is less. Furthermore, proline is rarely found in α and β structures as it would reduce the stability of such structures, because its side chain α-N can only form one hydrogen bond.
Additionally, proline is the only amino acid that does not form a blue/purple colour when developed by spraying with ninhydrin for uses in chromatography. Proline, instead, produces an orange/yellow colour.

==History==

Richard Willstätter synthesized proline by the reaction of sodium salt of diethyl malonate with 1,3-dibromopropane in 1900. In 1901, Hermann Emil Fischer isolated proline from casein and the decomposition products of γ-phthalimido-propylmalonic ester.[tpl]Citation |author= R.H.A. Plimmer |editor= R.H.A. Plimmer & F.G.
