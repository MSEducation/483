Patricia Rhomberg (born 15 September 1953) is an Austrian former pornographic film actress from the 1970s.
She was working as a medical assistant when she met the German director Hans Billian and began a relationship with him. In 1975, she starred in the first full hardcore German porn movie, Bienenstich im Liebesnest (the soft version was named Im Gasthaus zum scharfen Hirschen and was also known as Zimmermädchen machen es gerne) directed by Billian, where she played "Graziella Schill", a woman chasing the elderly husband who cheated. In this film, she did not perform hardcore action: the most explicit sexual act is a brief footjob.
In 1976, Billian gave her the lead role (in part because she had the proper dialect for it[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tv-kult.com/kritiken/670-heidi-das-luder-von-der-alm.html|title=Heidi, das Luder von der Alm|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 September 2013[/tpl]) in the first part of the porn classic Josefine Mutzenbacher – Wie sie wirklich war (known in English as Sensational Janine),[tpl]cite book|author1=Kent Smith| author2=Darrell W.

This film brought her to fame in Germany: Rhomberg has sexual intercourse with ten men (eight in the shorter version of the German DVD), including Frithjof Klausen, who plays her stepfather, except for two on which performs only fellatio and/or handjobs. Josefine's age is 14 years old in the novel, but no age is mentioned in the script of the film. Jim Holliday has described this film as "easily the best and most accurate of several films based on the life and adventures of legendary Viennese madam Josephine Mutzenbacher" and his "all time foreign favorite" adult film.[tpl]cite book|author=Jim Holliday|authorlink=Jim Holliday|title=Only the Best: Jim Holliday's Adult Video Almanac and Trivia Treasury|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pIqGAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 August 2013|year=1986|publisher=Cal Vista Direct|page=84[/tpl] Sensational Janine was "one of the most successful foreign x-rated films ever to cross the Atlantic",[tpl]cite book|title=The Film Journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ngXsAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=20 August 2013|date=January 1984|publisher=Pubsun Corporation|page=26[/tpl] and the movie is "today seen as one of the best porns of all time".
In 1977, she starred in Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber. Her role was "Larissa Holm", a "fun loving" young woman who agrees with "Kasimir Zwickelhuber" (played by Sepp Gneißl) to go into prostitution in order to pay off some debts. Around this period as well, she starred in numerous hardcore loops directed by Billian, such as Venus in Seide and Schwarzer Orgasmus, which were among the first examples of interracial pornography on the German porn scene.
In addition to her acting work, she also worked as a fluffer for other Billian films. She made a brief appearance in the film Heiße Locher, geile Stecher, which was apparently shot before Josefine Mutzenbacher ... wie sie wirklich war? or even before Bienenstich im Liebesnest but which came out much later.
In 1978, she broke with Billian and returned to her original profession.
