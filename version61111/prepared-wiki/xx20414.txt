[[Uniform convergence]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus, Mathematical series, Topology of function spaces, Convergence (mathematics)

In the mathematical field of analysis, uniform convergence is a type of convergence stronger than pointwise convergence. A sequence {fn} of functions converges uniformly to a limiting function f if the speed of convergence of fn(x) to f(x) does not depend on x. 
The concept is important because several properties of the functions fn, such as continuity and Riemann integrability, are transferred to the limit f if the convergence is uniform. 
Uniform convergence to a function on a given interval can be defined in terms of the uniform norm.

==History==

Some historians claim[tpl]who?|date=January 2014[/tpl] that in 1821 Augustin Louis Cauchy  published a false statement, but with a purported proof, that the pointwise limit of a series of continuous functions is always continuous; however,  Lakatos offers a re-assessment[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] of Cauchy's approach.  Niels Henrik Abel in 1826 found purported counterexamples to this statement in the context of Fourier series, arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]  Cauchy ultimately responded in 1853 with a clarification of his 1821 formulation.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]

Later Gudermann's pupil Karl Weierstrass, who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839–1840, coined the term gleichmäßig konvergent ([tpl]lang-de|uniformly convergent[/tpl]) which he used in his 1841 paper Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen, published in 1894. Independently a similar concept was used by Philipp Ludwig von Seidel[tpl]cite book |last=Lakatos |first=Imre |authorlink=Imre Lakatos |title=Proofs and Refutations|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=141 |isbn=0-521-21078-X[/tpl] and George Gabriel Stokes but without having any major impact on further development.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] G. H. Hardy compares the three definitions in his paper "Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence" and remarks: "Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis."
Under the influence of Weierstrass and Bernhard Riemann this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by Hermann Hankel, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Ulisse Dini, Cesare Arzelà and others.
== Definition == 
Suppose [tpl]math|S[/tpl] is a set and [tpl]math|fn : S → R[/tpl] is a real-valued function for every natural number [tpl]math|n[/tpl]. We say that the sequence [tpl]math|(fn)n∈N[/tpl] is uniformly convergent with limit [tpl]math|f : S → R[/tpl] if for every [tpl]math|ε > 0[/tpl], there exists a natural number [tpl]math|N[/tpl] such that for all [tpl]math|x ∈ S[/tpl] and all [tpl]math|n ≥ N[/tpl] we have {{math|[tpl]![/tpl]fn(x) − f(x)[tpl]![/tpl] Consider the sequence [tpl]math|αn [tpl]=[/tpl]  supx [tpl]![/tpl]fn(x) − f(x)[tpl]![/tpl][/tpl] where the supremum is taken over all [tpl]math|x ∈ S[/tpl]. Then [tpl]math|fn[/tpl] converges to [tpl]math|f[/tpl] uniformly if and only if [tpl]math|αn[/tpl] tends to 0.
The sequence [tpl]math|(fn)n∈N[/tpl] is said to be locally uniformly convergent with limit [tpl]math|f[/tpl] if for every [tpl]math|x[/tpl] in some metric space [tpl]math|S[/tpl],  there exists an [tpl]math|r > 0[/tpl] such that [tpl]math|(fn)[/tpl] converges uniformly on [tpl]math|B(x,r) ∩ S[/tpl].

===Notes===

Note that interchanging the order of "there exists [tpl]math|N[/tpl]" and "for all [tpl]math|x[/tpl]" in the definition above results in a statement equivalent to the pointwise convergence of the sequence. That notion can be defined as follows: the sequence (fn) converges pointwise with limit [tpl]math|f : S → R[/tpl] if and only if 
Here the order of the universal quantifiers for [tpl]math|x[/tpl] and for [tpl]math|ε[/tpl] is not important, but the order of the former and the existential quantifier for [tpl]math|N[/tpl] is.
In the case of uniform convergence, [tpl]math|N[/tpl] can only depend on [tpl]math|ε[/tpl], while in the case of pointwise convergence [tpl]math|N[/tpl] may depend on both [tpl]math|ε[/tpl] and [tpl]math|x[/tpl]. It is therefore plain that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence. The converse is not true, as the following example shows: take [tpl]math|S[/tpl] to be the unit interval 0,1 and define [tpl]math|fn(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] xn[/tpl] for every natural number [tpl]math|n[/tpl]. Then [tpl]math|(fn)[/tpl] converges pointwise to the function [tpl]math|f[/tpl] defined by [tpl]math|f(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl] if [tpl]math|x < 1[/tpl] and [tpl]math|f(1) [tpl]=[/tpl] 1[/tpl]. This convergence is not uniform: for instance for [tpl]math|ε [tpl]=[/tpl] 1/4[/tpl], there exists no [tpl]math|N[/tpl] as required by the definition. This is because solving for [tpl]math|n[/tpl] gives [tpl]math|n > log ε / log x[/tpl]. This depends on [tpl]math|x[/tpl] as well as on [tpl]math|ε[/tpl]. Also note that it is impossible to find a suitable bound for [tpl]math|n[/tpl] that does not depend on [tpl]math|x[/tpl] because for any nonzero value of [tpl]math|ε[/tpl], [tpl]math|log ε / log x[/tpl] grows without bounds as [tpl]math|x[/tpl] tends to 1.

===Generalizations===

One may straightforwardly extend the concept to functions S → M, where (M, d) is a metric space, by replacing |fn(x) − f(x)| with d(fn(x), f(x)).
The most general setting is the uniform convergence of nets of functions S → X, where X is a uniform space. We say that the net (fα) converges uniformly with limit f : S → X if and only if
The above mentioned theorem, stating that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, remains correct in these settings.

===Definition in a hyperreal setting===

==Examples==

Given a topological space X, we can equip the space of bounded real or complex-valued functions over X with the uniform norm topology. Then uniform convergence simply means convergence in the uniform norm topology.

===Exponential function===

Here is the series:
This is trivial:
The ratio test can be used here:

==Properties==

==Applications==

===To continuity===

This theorem is important, since pointwise convergence of continuous functions is not enough to guarantee continuity of the limit function as the image illustrates.
More precisely, this theorem states that the uniform limit of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous; for a locally compact space, continuity is equivalent to local uniform continuity, and thus the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

===To differentiability===

===To integrability===

Similarly, one often wants to exchange integrals and limit processes. For the Riemann integral, this can be done if uniform convergence is assumed:
Much stronger theorems in this respect, which require not much more than pointwise convergence, can be obtained if one abandons the Riemann integral and uses the Lebesgue integral instead.

===To Analyticity===

If a sequence of analytic functions converges uniformly in a region S of the complex plane, then the limit is analytic in S. This demonstrates an example that complex functions are more well-behaved than real functions, since the uniform limit of analytic functions on a real interval need not even be differentiable.

===Extended Results to Series===

i) pointwise on E if and only if the sequence sn converges where s'n(x) is the sequence of partial sums.
ii) uniformly on E if and only if sn''(x) converges uniformly as n goes to infinity.
With this definition comes the immediate result that comes naturally from the theorems about sequences:

==Almost uniform convergence==

If the domain of the functions is a measure space then the related notion of almost uniform convergence can be defined. We say a sequence of functions converges almost uniformly on E if the sequence of functions converges uniformly almost everywhere on E, that is, if the set of points for which the sequence does not converge uniformly has an arbitrarily small measure.
Note that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly almost everywhere as might be inferred from the name.
Egorov's theorem guarantees that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges almost everywhere also converges almost uniformly on the same set.
Almost uniform convergence implies almost everywhere convergence and convergence in measure.
