Goudie was a glam rock band from Austin, Texas fronted by Johnny Goudie.
Goudie started in 1996 as a solo project of frontman Johnny Goudie.  In 1997 Johnny's friend Einar Pedersen (who was also a member of Jez Spencer with Johnny Goudie) joined on bass and Bill Lefler replaced the original drummer Kyle Schneider, and Jimmy Messer was brought in as lead guitarist.
In the Spring of 1998, after only being together nine months, and still without a band name, the group played a showcase during the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.  Rather than playing a single showscase at a traditional venue, the band rented rehearsal space and played seven showcases throughout the day.  The strategy proved successful, and they caught the attention of Dan McCarroll, who was working with Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich to scout for bands to sign to a new record label Ulrich was forming as a subsidiary of Elektra Records.  After a second showcase in Los Angeles, California, Ulrich quickly signed the band, making Goudie the second band to be signed to the label (Canadian band DDT being the first). The band decided to simply call themselves Goudie and the label decided to call itself "The Music Company" or TMC.
In July 2000 Goudie released their debut album, Peep Show, to critical praise.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]  The band toured the country with such acts as Blur, Supergrass and Unified Theory, building what would become a large and loyal fan base.  The second single from the album, "Drag City", was featured on the compilation album ASCAP's EAR Volume 3.
In 2001 Bill Lefler left the band to pursue session work in Los Angeles.  The band took a short break from touring, but in April 2001 Nina Singh (formerly of The Borrowers) replaced Lefler and the band continued to tour and write new songs.
In June 2001 while recording their second album, Goudie, along with every other artist who hadn't sold a million records, was dropped from their recording contract with Elektra in the wake of corporate reshuffling following Elektra Records' parent company Time Warner's merger with AOL.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2001-07-06/82279/|title=Goudie, Too, Shoos!|date=2001-07-06|author=Ken Lieck[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hitrockbottom.org/8stops7.html Interview with Evan from 8Stops7|title=Rock Bottom Interview: 8Stops7|date=2008-04-27|author=Tim Nydell|publisher=Rock Bottom[/tpl] Shortly thereafter, The Music Company label was dissolved.  The band played on, quickly signing with independent label India Records. In July, Jimmy Messer played his last show with Goudie, and Sean Mullens replaced him on lead guitar.
Goudieâ€™s second album, Effects of Madness, was released March 5, 2002 and was extremely well received, garnering comparisons to Kiss, Bob Dylan, The Pretenders, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
After five years together, Goudie finally disbanded in the Spring of 2002.  Their music continues to be influential in the Austin music scene, and Johnny Goudie still performs many of the songs with his new band Johnny Goudie and the Little Champions.
