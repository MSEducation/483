Don Giovanni Tenorio, o sia Il convitato di pietra"Don Giovanni (i)" by Mary Hunter, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed. Stanley Sadie [tpl]Subscription[/tpl] gives: Don Giovanni, o sia Il convitato di pietra and Don Giovanni Tenorio (English: Don Giovanni Tenorio, or The Stone Guest) is the most famous opera by the Italian composer Giuseppe Gazzaniga. It belongs to the genre of dramma giocoso and is in one act. Don Giovanni Tenorio was first performed at the Teatro San Moisè, Venice, on February 5, 1787. The libretto, by Giovanni Bertati, is based on the legend of Don Juan, leading to comparisons with Mozart's Don Giovanni, which had its premiere later in 1787. Mozart's librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, certainly knew the earlier opera. Gazzaniga's work is much shorter than Mozart's, however, and originally formed part of a double-bill with another piece, Il capriccio drammatico.
