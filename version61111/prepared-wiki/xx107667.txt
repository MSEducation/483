Tormato is the ninth studio album from the English progressive rock band Yes, released in September 1978 on Atlantic Records. 

==Overview==

Tormato is Yes' last studio album to feature both singer Jon Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman in the band's line-up before Yes disbanded in 1981. 
The album received a mixed response upon its release;[tpl]Cite web|last=Emerson|first=Ken|title=Yes: Tormato|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=28 December 1978|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/yes/albums/album/186457/review/6212977/tormato|accessdate=24 October 2009[/tpl] the main subject of criticism for the album is the quality in production, which led to a compressed and dull sound.Chris Welch, Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes, pg. 174, Omnibus Press (2003), ISBN 0-7119-9509-5
Rick Wakeman has said that Yes never got the best out of some of the material on Tormato, while Steve Howe admitted that Yes were unsure of themselves musically at the time. It would be the final studio album to feature Rick Wakeman until his return in 1991 (on the Union album), and the last to feature Jon Anderson until the band's 1983 reformation.
Nonetheless, Tormato – which was the subject of another Hipgnosis cover design – was still a Top 10 hit worldwide, and produced the minor hit single, "Don't Kill the Whale".
The original album title was to be Yes Tor, referring to a geological formation in southern England. The photographs taken by Hipgnosis for the album cover were seen as so unimpressive that Rick Wakeman, in frustration, threw a tomato at the pictures. The cover and title were adjusted accordingly.[ref]

==Chart performance==

Released on 20 September 1978, Tormato peaked at number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US.

==Track listing==

"Madrigal" contains a string arrangement by Andrew Pryce Jackman from an original idea by Wakeman.

==Reissues and bonus tracks==

The 2004 reissue includes several bonus tracks. "Everybody's Song" is an early version of what became "Does It Really Happen?" on Drama. A solo on the piece sounds more like the work of Patrick Moraz than Wakeman, dating the song to sessions from before Going for the One; in a 2006 interview for Notes from the Edge, Moraz agreed that it probably was him. "Days", an a cappella recording, and "Some Are Born" would later be re-worked by Anderson for his solo album Song of Seven. "Countryside" would be re-worked by Howe as "Corkscrew" for the album Turbulence. "High" would be re-worked by Howe as the instrumental "Sketches in the Sun", later released on GTR. "Money" was previously released on Yesyears. It features a satirical voice-over by Wakeman pretending to be Denis Healey, Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer 1974–9 and disliked by more than one successful rock musician for his policies of high taxation rates for the wealthy. "Picasso" is a song about famous artist Pablo Picasso and would later be re-worked for Anderson's yet to be released musical Chagall.
