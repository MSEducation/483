[[Odontites]]

CATEGORIES: Orobanchaceae

Odontites is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. One of its species, the Odontites granatensis, endemic to the Sierra Nevada in Spain, was so threatened that in 1993 only 1,500 plants survived in two locations; due to conservation efforts the plant has made a comeback, numbering over 100,000 in 2006.[ref]
