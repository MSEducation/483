==Club career==

He began his career with Bayern Munich, and made his debut for the reserve team in August 2005, as a substitute for Daniel Sikorski in a 0–0 draw with VfR Aalen. From the 2007–08 season, Yılmaz established himself as a regular in Bayern's reserve team, and was named in the first-team squad for the 2008–09 Champions League. He was named on the subs bench for the first time in a Bundesliga game against VfL Wolfsburg in October 2008. This proved to be his last involvement with Bayern's team, however, despite finishing as the top scorer for the second string in 2009–10, with thirteen goals. He was joint top scorer the following year, along with Boy Deul and Steffen Wohlfarth, but each player only managed six goals and Bayern II were relegated from the 3. Liga in last place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.weltfussball.de/zuschauer/3-liga-2010-2011/1/ |title=3.
