55 Water Street is a [tpl]convert|687|ft|adj=on[/tpl] tall skyscraper in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City, on the East River. It was completed in 1972 and has 53 floors. Emery Roth & Sons designed the building, which is tied with 277 Park Avenue as the 40th tallest building in New York City. When it was completed it was the largest office building in the world, and is still the largest in New York by floor area. In an arrangement with the Office of Lower Manhattan Development, it was built on a superblock created from four adjoining city blocks, suppressing the western part of Front Street.
Its closest competitors in square footage are the Met Life Building at [tpl]convert|3140000|sqft[/tpl] and 111 Eighth Avenue at [tpl]convert|2900000|sqft[/tpl].  When One World Trade Center opens in 2014 it will have roughly the same square footage (3.5 million square feet).  The now-destroyed World Trade Center was also bigger when it opened in 1970-71.

==Description==

On the north side of the tower is a 15-story wing with a sloping facade and terraces facing the river. The largest terrace forms a privately owned public space known as the "Elevated Acre", about 30 feet above street level and accessible via escalator and stairs from the sidewalk on Water Street.  The creation of public space allowed the developers to increase the total square footage of 55 Water Street beyond what zoning regulations would otherwise have allowed on the site.  The Elevated Acre was originally planned as part of a series of high-level public spaces along East River, to be connected with walkways running above the street level.  The Elevated Acre is available for rental as venue for special events and weddings and during the summer months occasionally hosts free movie screenings open to the community. The original [tpl]convert|4800|m2|sqft[/tpl] plaza was designed by M. Paul Friedberg & Associates, and had the same red brick tiles as his Jeannette Park to the south of the tower.  In early 2001, Goldman Sachs briefly considered leasing space in 55 Water Street and proposed building a 13 story, 240 foot addition on the plaza site which would included seven large trading floors.  The plan also proposed adding 35 feet to the north tower.  To compensate for the loss of public space Goldman Sachs proposed paying for various improvements of public space nearby.  The plans were quickly dropped and Goldman Sachs cited economic conditions as the reason although some neighborhood residents had begun to voice opposition.  The building, its plazas and Jeannette Park have been renovated and redesigned by Lee S. Jablin of Harman Jablin Architects. The Elevated Acre was renovated in 2005 by Rogers Marvel Architects and Ken Smith Landscape Architects.[tpl]cite news| last=Dunlap | first= David W. | title= Putting a Shine on a Memorial Long Forlorn | publisher= The New York Times| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/24/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-putting-shine-memorial-long-forlorn-project-will-reshape.html?pagewanted=all |date= May 24, 2000 |accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news| first= David W. |last= Dunlap |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/28/nyregion/commercial-real-estate-a-plaza-few-use-but-everyone-wants.html |title=Commercial Real Estate; A Plaza Few Use But Everyone Wants |publisher=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2001 |accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=David W.|last= Dunlap |date=March 7, 2001 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/07/nyregion/goldman-sachs-drops-plans-for-new-tower-at-plaza-site.html |title=Goldman Sachs Drops Plans For New Tower at Plaza Site |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_128/7millionplazareachingahigh.html |title=$7 million plaza reaching a higher level reopens |publisher=DowntownExpress.com |accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl]
