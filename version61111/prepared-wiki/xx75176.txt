CATEGORIES: Districts of Bavaria, Landshut (district)

Landshut is a district in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Kelheim, Straubing-Bogen, Dingolfing-Landau, Rottal-Inn, Mühldorf, Erding and Freising. The city of Landshut is enclosed by, but does not belong to the district. It is nonetheless its administrative seat.

==History==

The city of Landshut was founded in 1204 by the ruling Wittelsbach family of Bavaria. Since then the region has always been a part of Bavaria.
The present district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Landshut, Rottenburg and Vilsbiburg and adding some municipalities of surrounding districts.

==Geography==

The district comprises plain countryside on both banks of the Isar river.

==Economy==

Many residents work at the Dingolfing BMW (formerly Glas) car plant which expanded massively during the 1970s.   Others commute daily to Munich, which is about 46 miles (74 km) to the southwest.
The first research nuclear power plant at Niederaichbach was torn down and returned to greenfield status in 1995.   Two other nuclear reactors, known as Isar I und Isar II, in the Essenbach district remain operational: nuclear power generation remains a significant local employer.
