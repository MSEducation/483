[[Candiru]]

CATEGORIES: Trichomycteridae, Parasitic animals

Candiru (English and Portuguese or candirú in Spanish), Vandellia cirrhosa, also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family Trichomycteridae native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
The definition of candiru differs between authors. The word has been used to refer to only Vandellia cirrhosa, the entire genus Vandellia, the subfamily Vandelliinae, or even the two subfamilies Vandelliinae and Stegophilinae.[tpl]FishBase species|genus=Vandellia|species=cirrhosa|year=2007|month=July[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.wemjournal.org/wmsonline/?request=get-abstract&issn=0953-9859&volume=002&issue=04&page=0304|title=Candiru: Amazonian parasitic catfish|first=J.L.|last=Breault|journal=Journal of Wilderness Medicine|volume=2|issue=4|pages=304–312|format=|doi=10.1580/0953-9859-2.4.304|year=1991[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.mnhn.fr/sfi/cybium/numeros/pdf/272pdf/01.analysecarvalho.pdf|title=Analyse D'Ouvrage|first=Marcelo R.|last=de Carvalho|journal=Cybium|year=2003|volume=27|issue=2|page=82|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-22[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=The Genus Henonemus (Siluriformes: Trichomycteridae) with a Description of a New Species from Venezuela|first=Carlos|last=DoNascimiento|coauthors=Provenzano, Francisco|journal=Copeia|year=2006|issue=2|pages=198–205|doi=10.1643/0045-8511(2006)6198:TGHSTW2.0.CO;2|volume=2006[/tpl]
Although some candiru species have been known to grow to a size of [tpl]convert|40|cm|in[/tpl] in length, others are considerably smaller. These smaller species are known for an alleged tendency to invade and parasitise the human urethra; however, despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century,[tpl]cite book|title=Killers of the Seas: The Dangerous Creatures That Threaten Man in an Alien Environment|last=Ricciuti|first=Edward R.|authorlink=Edward R. Ricciuiti|coauthors=Bird, Jonathan|publisher=The Lyons Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58574-869-3[/tpl] the first documented case of the removal of a candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997, and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy.

==Physical description==

Candirus are small fish. Adults can grow to around [tpl]convert|40|cm|in[/tpl] with a rather small head and a belly that can appear distended, especially after a large blood meal. The body is translucent, making it quite difficult to spot in the turbid waters of its home. There are short sensory barbels around the head, together with short, backward pointing spines on the gill covers.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press, ISBN 978-0-313-33922-6.

==Location and habitat==

Candirus (Vandellia) inhabit the Amazon and Orinoco basins of lowland Amazonia, where they constitute part of the Neotropical fish fauna.  Candirus are hematophagous and parasitize the gills of larger Amazonian fishes, especially catfish of the family Pimelodidae (Siluriformes).

==Attacks on humans: myth vs. fact==

Although lurid anecdotes of attacks on humans abound, very few cases have been verified, and some alleged traits of the fish have been discredited as myth or superstition.

===Historical accounts===

The earliest published report on this candiru attacking human hosts comes from German biologist C. F. P. von Martius in 1829, who never actually observed it, but rather was told about it by the native people of the area, including that men would tie a ligature around their penis while going into the river to prevent this from happening. Other sources also suggest that other tribes in the area used various forms of protective coverings for their genitals while bathing, though it was also suggested that these were to prevent bites from piranha.  Martius also speculated that the fish were attracted by the "odor" of urine.von Martius, C. F. P. 1829.Preface, p. viii, of van Spix, J. B., and Agassiz, L. Selecta Genera et Species Piscium ouos in Itinere ocr Brnsiliam annis 1817-20 Collcgit ... Dr. J. B. de Spix, etc. Monachii, 1829. Later experimental evidence showed this to be false, as the fish actually hunt by sight and have no attraction to urine at all.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes|volume=60|pages=459–464|year=2001|title=Experiments on the feeding behavior of the hematophagous candiru|first=Stephen|last=Spotte|coauthors=Petry, Paulo; Zuanon, Jansen A.S.|doi=10.1023/A:1011081027565|issue=4[/tpl]
Another report from French naturalist Francis de Castelnau in 1855 relates an allegation by local Araguay fisherman, saying that it is dangerous to urinate in the river as the fish "springs out of the water and penetrates into the urethra by ascending the length of the liquid column."CASTELNAU, FRANCIS DE. 1855. Expedition dans les Partics Cent&es de I'AmPrique du Sud, 1843 a 1847. Animaux Nouveaux ou Rares-Zoology. Paris, 3: 50, p1. 24, fig. 4. While Castelnau himself dismissed this claim as "absolutely preposterous," and the fluid mechanics of such a thing occurring defy the laws of physics, it remains one of the more stubborn myths about the candiru.  It has been suggested this claim evolved out of the real observation that certain species of fish in the Amazon will gather at the surface near the point where a urine stream enters, having been attracted by the noise and agitation of the water.
In 1836 Eduard Poeppig documented a statement by a local physician in Pará, known only as Dr. Lacerda, who offered an eyewitness account of a case where a candiru had entered a human orifice. However, it was lodged in a native woman's vagina, rather than a male urethra. He relates that the fish was extracted after external and internal application of the juice from a Xagua plant (believed to be a name for Genipa americana). Another account was documented by biologist George A. Boulenger from a Brazilian physician named Dr. Bach, who examined a man and several boys whose penises had been amputated. Bach believed this was a remedy performed because of parasitism by candiru, but he was merely speculating as he did not speak his patients' language.BWLENGER, G. A. 1898a. Exhibition of specimens, and remarks upon the habits of the siluroid fish, Vandellia cirrhosu. Proc. Zool. Sot. London 1897, p. 90 I. American biologist Eugene Willis Gudger noted the area the patients were from did not have candiru in its rivers, and suggested the amputations were much more likely the result of having been attacked by piranha.
In 1891, naturalist Paul Le Cointe provides a rare first-hand account of a candiru entering a human body, and like Lacerda's account, it involved the fish being lodged in the vaginal canal, not the urethra. Le Cointe actually removed the fish himself, by pushing it forward to disengage the spines, turning it around and removing it head-first.Le Cointe, Paul. 1922. L'Amazonie Bresilienne: Le Pays; Ses Inhabitants, scs Ressources. Notes et Statistiques jusqu'en 1920. Paris, II: 365.
Gudger, in 1930, noted there have been several other cases reported wherein the fish entered the vaginal canal, but not a single case of a candiru entering the anus was ever documented. According to Gudger, this lends credence to the unlikelihood of the fish entering the male urethra, based on the comparatively small opening that would accommodate only the most immature members of the species.[tpl]cite journal|last= Gudger |first= E.W. |date=January 1930 |title= On the alleged penetration of the human urethra by an Amazonian catfish called candiru with a review of the allied habits of other members of the family pygidiidae |journal= The American Journal of Surgery |volume= 8 |issue= 1 |pages= 170–188 |publisher= Elsevier Inc. |type= Print |issn= 00029610|doi= 10.1016/S0002-9610(30)90912-9[/tpl]
It was also once thought that the fish was attracted to urine, as the candiru's primary prey emits urea from its gills, but this was later discredited in formal experimentation.  Indeed, the fish appears not to have any response to any chemical attractants, and primarily hunts by visual tracking.

===Modern cases===

To date, there is only one documented case of a candiru entering a human urethra, which took place in Itacoatiara, Brazil in 1997.Spotte, p.211"this was the only documented evidence of an accident involving humans." Anoar Samad, "Candiru inside the urethra". Google translation from Portuguese, with pictures.  In this incident, the victim (a 23-year-old man known only as "F.B.C.") claimed a candiru "jumped" from the water into his urethra as he urinated while thigh-deep in a river.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.straightdope.com/columns/010907.html |title=Can the candiru fish swim upstream into your urethra (revisited)? |work=The Straight Dope |date=7 September 2001[/tpl]  After traveling to Manaus on October 28, 1997, the victim underwent a two-hour urological surgery by Dr. Anoar Samad to remove the fish from his body.
In 1999, American marine biologist Stephen Spotte traveled to Brazil to investigate this particular incident in detail.  He recounts the events of his investigation in his book Candiru: Life and Legend of the Bloodsucking Catfishes.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Spotte | first1 = Stephen. | title = Candiru : life and legend of the bloodsucking catfishes | year = 2002 | publisher = Creative Arts Book Co. | location = Berkeley, Calif. | isbn = 0-88739-469-8 | pages =  [/tpl]  Spotte met with Dr. Samad in person and interviewed him at his practice and home.  Samad gave him photos, the original VHS tape of the cystoscopy procedure, and the actual fish's body preserved in formalin as his donation to the INPA.Spotte, p.217  Spotte and his colleague Paulo Petry took these materials and examined them at the INPA, comparing them with Samad's formal paper.  While Spotte did not overtly express any conclusions as to the veracity of the incident, he did remark on several observations that were suspicious about the claims of the patient and/or Samad himself.
When subsequently interviewed, Spotte stated that even if a person were to urinate while "submerged in a stream where candiru live", the odds of that person being attacked by candiru are "(a)bout the same as being struck by lightning while simultaneously being eaten by a shark."

==In popular culture==

William S. Burroughs wrote about the candiru in his 1959 novel Naked Lunch, describing it as "a small eel-like fish or worm about one-quarter inch through and two inches long patronizing certain rivers of ill repute in the Greater Amazon Basin, will dart up your prick or your asshole or a woman's cunt faute de mieux, and hold himself there by sharp spines with precisely what motives is not known since no one has stepped forward to observe the candiru's life-cycle in situ."Burroughs, William S. Naked Lunch, the restored text edition, edited by James Grauerholtz and Barry Miles, 2001. Page 38
Burroughs also mentioned it in The Yage Letters: "At that time I was stationed at the remote jungle outpost of Candiru, so named from a tiny eel like fish that infests the rivers of that area. This vicious fish introduces itself into the most intimate parts of the human body, maintaining itself there by poisonous barbs while it feeds on the soft membranes".Burroughs, William S. and Allen Ginsberg. The Yage Letters.  San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1963. ISBN 0-87286-004-3 Page 92.
In the television show Grey's Anatomy, the doctors extract a candiru fish from a patient's urethra in the episode Desire.
In the BBC Series Last Chance to See (while seeking the Boto and the Amazonian manatee) Mark Carwardine warns Stephen Fry not to urinate into the water surrounding an offshore platform describing to Fry how the candiru attacks its victim and the dire consequences of the attack.
