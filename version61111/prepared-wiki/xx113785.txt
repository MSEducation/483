[[Breakdown in Paradise]]

CATEGORIES: 1979 albums, Chilliwack (band) albums, Mushroom Records albums

Breakdown in Paradise  is the eighth album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack, released in 1979.  The album was originally intended to be called Road to Paradise, but the death of Mushroom Records head Shelly Siegel in January 1979 made the collapse of the label, which had released each of Chilliwack's last three albums, all but certain.  As a result, three of the longstanding band members left the group, leaving only Bill Henderson and Brian MacLeod from the prior lineup.  Because of the label's financial problems, there were no real hits from the album.

Between the time of the album's completion and the making of the sleeve photography, Berger had left and was replaced by Rick Taylor.  Consequently, Taylor appears on the back cover but the liner notes credit Berger as drummer.
