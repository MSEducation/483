The Agreed Statement of the parties to the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996 states that: "It is understood that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Treaty or the Berne Convention."Travis, p. 373. This language may mean that Internet service providers are not liable for the infringing communications of their users. Critics claim that the convention does not mention any other rights of consumers of works except for fair use.There Can Be No 'Balance' In The Entirely Unbalanced System Of Copyright – Techdirt, Mike Masnick, 1 March 2012

==History==

The Berne Convention was developed at the instigation of Victor Hugo of the Association Littéraire et Artistique Internationale. Thus it was influenced by the French "right of the author" (droit d'auteur), which contrasts with the Anglo-Saxon concept of "copyright" which only dealt with economic concerns. Under the Convention, copyrights for creative works are automatically in force upon their creation without being asserted or declared. An author need not "register" or "apply for" a copyright in countries adhering to the Convention. As soon as a work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium, its author is automatically entitled to all copyrights in the work and to any derivative works, unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them or until the copyright expires. Foreign authors are given the same rights and privileges to copyrighted material as domestic authors in any country that signed the Convention.
Before the Berne Convention, national copyright laws usually only applied for works created within each country. So for example a work published in United Kingdom by a British national would be covered by copyright there, but could be copied and sold by anyone in France. Dutch publisher Albertus Willem Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1899 in opposition to the convention over concerns that its international restrictions would stifle the Dutch print industry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IGtNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA597&lpg=PA597&dq=Albertus+Willem+Sijthoff|title=The Netherlands and the Berne Convention|page=597|work=The Publishers' circular and booksellers' record of British and foreign literature, Vol. 71|publisher=Sampson Low, Marston & Co.|accessdate=2010-08-29|year=1899[/tpl]
The Berne Convention followed in the footsteps of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883, which in the same way had created a framework for international integration of the other types of intellectual property: patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
Like the Paris Convention, the Berne Convention set up a bureau to handle administrative tasks. In 1893 these two small bureaux merged and became the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (best known by its French acronym BIRPI), situated in Berne. In 1960, BIRPI moved to Geneva, to be closer to the United Nations and other international organizations in that city. In 1967 it became the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and in 1974 became an organization within the United Nations.
The Berne Convention was revised in Paris in 1896 and in Berlin in 1908, completed in Berne in 1914, revised in Rome in 1928, in Brussels in 1948, in Stockholm in 1967 and in Paris in 1971, and was amended in 1979. 
The World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty was adopted in 1996 to address the issues raised by information technology and the Internet, which were not addressed by the Berne Convention.
=== Adoption and implementation === 
The UK signed in 1887 but did not implement large parts of it until 100 years later with the passage of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
The United States initially refused to become a party to the Convention, since that would have required major changes in its copyright law, particularly with regard to moral rights, removal of the general requirement for registration of copyright works and elimination of mandatory copyright notice. This led first to the U.S. ratifying the Buenos Aires Convention (BAC) in 1910, and later to the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) in 1952 to accommodate the wishes of the United States. But on 1 March 1989, the U.S. Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 was enacted, and the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, making the United States a party to the Berne Convention,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/21/arts/senate-approves-joining-copyright-convention.html | title=Senate Approves Joining Copyright Convention | first=Irvin | last=Molotsky | work=The New York Times | date=21 October 1988 | accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] and making the Universal Copyright Convention nearly obsolete.[tpl]cite book |last=Fishman |first=Stephen |title=The Copyright Handbook: What Every Writer Needs to Know |year=2011 |publisher=Nolo Press| isbn=978-1-4133-1617-9 |oclc=707200393 |page=332 |quote=The UCC is not nearly as important as it used to be. Indeed, it's close to becoming obsolete[/tpl] Except for extremely technical points not relevant, with the accession of Nicaragua in 2000, every nation that is a member of the Buenos Aires Convention is also a member of Berne, and so the BAC has also become nearly obsolete and is essentially deprecated as well.
Since almost all nations are members of the World Trade Organization, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights requires non-members to accept almost all of the conditions of the Berne Convention.
As of September 2013, there are 167 states that are parties to the Berne Convention. This includes 166 UN member states plus the Holy See.
