Like many countries in the world, the modern history of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) does not reveal a current population of Jews. However, over the millennia of Jewish history in the Middle East and in the History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula, there are recorded meetings with Jewish communities in areas that are today in the geographic territories of the United Arab Emirates.
The modern UAE has sponsored controversial programs at American universities that have been denounced for their anti-Zionism/Anti-Israel contents.
