Some European governments, fearful of a future pensions crisis, have developed natalist policies to attempt to encourage more women to have children.  Measures include increasing tax allowances for working parents, improving child-care provision, reducing working hours/weekend working in female-dominated professions such as healthcare and a stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination measures to prevent professional women's promotion prospects being hindered when they take time off work to care for children. Over recent years, the fertility rate has increased to around 2.0 in France and 1.9 in Britain and some other northern European countries, but the role of population policies in these trends is debated.Suddenly, the old world looks younger. The Economist, June 14th 2007.
Attempts to increase the fertility rate among working women bring difficult political dilemmas: how far to alter traditional working practices so that women who are juggling work and child-raising responsibilities are not disadvantaged in their careers compared with men (for example, by legislating for compulsory paternity leave, flexible working and/or limiting total weekly working hours for men as well as women) and above all the question of whether the problem of sub-replacement fertility is so serious that unmarried women should also now be encouraged to have more children.
Giving women paid maternity leave can have the unintended negative consequence of dissuading employers from hiring women because they may fear having to pay a pregnant woman wages for a job she isn't doing. This may increase the gender-wage gap, the income disparity between men and women in the labor force.  This disincentive can be ameliorated by giving parental leave to both men and women.
European analysts hope, with the help of government incentives and large-scale change towards family-friendly policies, to stall the population decline and reverse it by around 2030, expecting that most of Europe will have a slight natural increase by then. C. D. Howe Institute, for example, tries to demonstrate that immigration can not be used to effectively counter population ageing.Immigration (Guillemette_Robson).qxp

==Cases of fertility rate increases in individual countries==

===United States===

While much of the world has experienced declining fertility rates over the last twenty years, the total fertility rate in the United States has remained relatively stable.[tpl]citation | url = http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Total%20Fertility%20Rate,%20History%20plus%20Forecast%22&HistFor=True&GrpOp=0&Dim1=175&File=0 |title= Total Fertility Rate of the United States, History plus Forecast |publisher=International Futures | accessdate = 2012-04-26[/tpl] This is largely due to the high fertility rate among communities such as Hispanics, but it is also because the fertility rate among non-Hispanic whites in the US, after falling to about 1.6 in the 1970s and early 1980s, had increased and is now around 1.89, or slightly below replacement level, rather than collapsing to the 1.3–1.5 level common in Europe.
New England has a rate similar to most Western European countries, while the South, Midwest, and border states have fertility rates considerably higher than replacement. States where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a strong presence, most notably Utah, also have higher-than-replacement fertility rates, especially among the LDS population. Heaton and Goodman (1985) found that LDS women average about one child more than women in other religious groups.[tpl]cite jstor|3511049[/tpl]

===Other developed countries===

Israel is the only developed country that has never had sub-replacement fertility; a declining Arab and Bedouin fertility rate is countered by religious Jewish groups (mostly Haredim) with higher than average fertility rates. In addition, the (mostly non-religious)[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] aliyah Jews from the former USSR shifted from a 1 child per woman fertility rate to an average fertility rate close to 2.2 children per woman. As of 2008, Israel's Jewish fertility rate is the highest among the industrial nations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theettingerreport.com/OpEd/General/Demographic-Optimism,-Not-Pessimism.aspx|title=Demographic Optimism, Not Pessimism -Yoram Ettinger|date=January 2013[/tpl]
