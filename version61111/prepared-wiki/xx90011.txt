Lemon & Paeroa, also known as L&P, is a sweet soft drink manufactured in New Zealand. Traditionally made by combining lemon juice with carbonated mineral water from the town of Paeroa, it is now manufactured by multi-national Coca-Cola.
Lemon & Paeroa can be found in New Zealand, in specialty New Zealand stores abroad and in the Gourmet Burger Kitchen[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gbk.co.uk/menu/drinks/ | title = Gourmet Burger Kitchen | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Gourmet Burger Kitchen Drinks Menu[/tpl] chain of restaurants within the UK, and now at Coles supermarkets in Australia.http://shop.coles.com.au/online/national/l-p-soft-drinks-lemon-paeroa The comically pretentious advertising slogan "World famous in New Zealand" has become a popular New Zealand saying; it is used to describe items that though famous within New Zealand are unknown in the rest of the world, whereas similar items and people in larger countries would have a far higher media profile and would therefore be famous worldwide.
Over the years attempts have been made to market variations, such as L&P dry.  In 2005 "Sweet As L&P" with artificial sweetener aspartame was introduced with the modified slogan "World Famous in New Zealand since quite recently", the traditional product now being advertised as "World Famous in New Zealand since AGES ago".[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=20954 | title = L&P Stubbies Advert | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | date = 2005-02-26 | publisher = Visit4 Limited | location = London W5 2ZS, United Kingdom | quote = World famous in New Zealand since ages ago.[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSFCvG6curE | title = L & P Stubbies Ad (NZ) | accessdate = 2010-01-24 | publisher = YouTube | location = San Bruno, CA 94066, United States | quote = World famous in New Zealand since ages ago.[/tpl]
L&P is also often used as a mixer in New Zealand bars, particularly with Southern Comfort.
Although L&P itself is now made on the same production line as Coke's other beverages, an L&P Kiwiana shop and café remains in Paeroa.
Analysis of Paeroa mineral water by Arthur Wohlman in 1904 revealed magnesium bicarbonate in a concentration of 73 grains to the gallon (1040 mg/L). In 1908 the property containing the mineral spring was purchased by Robert Fewell and his brother-in-law Frank Brinkler.[ref]
