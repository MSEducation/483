 Legendre symbol (a/p) for various a (along top) and p (along left side). Only 0 ≤ a 

In number theory, the Legendre symbol is a multiplicative function with values 1, −1, 0 that is a quadratic character modulo a prime number p: its value on a (nonzero) quadratic residue mod p is 1 and on a non-quadratic residue (non-residue) is −1. Its value on zero is 0.
The Legendre symbol was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1798A. M. Legendre Essai sur la theorie des nombres Paris 1798, p 186 in the course of his attempts at proving the law of quadratic reciprocity. Generalizations of the symbol include the Jacobi symbol and Dirichlet characters of higher order. The notational convenience of the Legendre symbol inspired introduction of several other "symbols" used in algebraic number theory, such as the Hilbert symbol and the Artin symbol.

==Definition==

Let p be an odd prime number. An integer a is a quadratic residue modulo p if it is congruent to a perfect square modulo p and is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p otherwise. The Legendre symbol is a function of a and p defined as follows:
Legendre's original definition was by means of an explicit formula:
For typographical convenience, the Legendre symbol is sometimes written as (a|p) or (a/p). The sequence (a|p) for a equal to 0,1,2,... is periodic with period p and is sometimes called the Legendre sequence, with {0,1,−1} values occasionally replaced by {1,0,1} or {0,1,0}.Jeong-Heon Kim and Hong-Yeop Song, "Trace Representation of Legendre Sequences," Designs, Codes, and Cryptography 24, p. 343–348 (2001).

==Properties of the Legendre symbol==

There are a number of useful properties of the Legendre symbol which, together with the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to compute it efficiently. 

==Legendre symbol and quadratic reciprocity==

Let p and q be odd primes. Using the Legendre symbol, the quadratic reciprocity law can be stated concisely: 
Many proofs of quadratic reciprocity are based on Legendre's formula
In addition, several alternative expressions for the Legendre symbol were devised in order to produce various proofs of the quadratic reciprocity law.

==Computational example==

The above properties, including the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to evaluate any Legendre symbol. For example:
Or using a more efficient computation:
The article Jacobi symbol has more examples of Legendre symbol manipulation.
