The Leduc 0.10 was a research aircraft built in France, one of the world's first aircraft to fly powered solely by a ramjet.  

==Design and development==

Designed by René Leduc in 1938, it was built at the Breguet Aviation factory after a protracted, semi-secret construction phase kept at arm's length from German occupation authorities, and was finally completed in 1947. The aircraft featured a double-walled fuselage, with the pilot controlling the aircraft from within the inner shell. The circular gap between this and the outer, cylindrical shell provided the inlet for the ramjet. 

==Testing==

It could not take off unassisted (ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed and thus cannot move an aircraft from a standstill) and was therefore intended to be carried aloft by a Sud-Est Languedoc mothership and released at altitude. Following test flights of the Languedoc/0.10 composite, independent unpowered tests began on 21 October 1947. After three such flights, the first powered flight was made on 21 April 1949 over Blagnac at the hands of Jean Gonord. Released in a shallow dive at an altitude of [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], the engine was tested at half power for twelve minutes, propelling the aircraft to [tpl]convert|680|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl].
In subsequent tests, the 0.10 reached a top speed of Mach 0.85 and demonstrated the viability of the ramjet as an aviation powerplant, with a rate of climb that exceeded that of the best jet fighters of the time—[tpl]convert|39.6|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on[/tpl].
Of the two 0.10s originally built, one was destroyed in a crash in 1951 and the other severely damaged in another crash the following year.  Both pilots survived with serious injuries.

==0.16==

In addition to these, a third aircraft was built, designated 0.16. Generally similar to the 0.10, it featured a Turbomeca Marbore I turbojet on each wingtip, to provide better control during landings. This first flew on 8 February 1951, but was converted back to 0.10 standards a few months later after the powerplant synchronization and wing deflection issues caused by the turbojets proved insurmountable. The engines were replaced by inert mass balances. This aircraft is preserved at Le Bourget.
