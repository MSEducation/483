Belleville High School East is a public high school in Belleville, Illinois that is part of Belleville Township High School District.

==History==

Prior to 1966, Belleville Township School District operated only one school, Belleville Township High School, which was the old Belleville West campus (a new campus has since been built). The growth of the district, however, prompted the local board of education to construct a new campus and divide the student body between the two schools. The new campus was built in a college format with many different buildings. The newly commissioned Belleville Area College (now Southwestern Illinois College) occupied half of the campus while the new high school occupied the other. However, enrollment in the school increased rapidly and the college was forced to move to a new location. Major renovations were completed in 2009. These included new landscaping, more classrooms, remodeled classrooms and buildings, new lockers, and a new cafeteria.[tpl]cite web|last=Cousins|first=Scott|title=Renovations nearly complete at Belleville East|url=http://www.stltoday.com/suburban-journals/illinois/article_301086b4-0b2e-59e3-b42d-3f85414cbafd.html|publisher=Suburban Journals|accessdate=23 July 2012[/tpl]
