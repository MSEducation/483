The Finsbury Park Mosque is a mosque located in Finsbury Park, London, England. 
The mosque was affected by leadership disputes in the 1990s, allowing extremist Islamist preachers (many of whom were refugees from the Algerian Civil War) to take it over.  In 1996 they installed Abu Hamza al-Masri as imam of the mosque, which subsequently developed a reputation as a centre of radical Islamism in London.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7096244.stm|author=BBC News, |title=Abu Hamza could face extradition|date=15 November 2007|publisher=British Broadcast Corporation[/tpl]
