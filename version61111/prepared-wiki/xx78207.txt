The flag of Kenya (Swahili: Bendera ya Kenya) was officially adopted on December 12, 1963.

==Symbolism==

The Kenyan flag is based on that of Kenya African National Union and was adopted in December 12th 1963 as the country's flag. The colour black represents the people of the Republic of Kenya, red for the blood shed during the fight for independence, green for the country's landscape; the white fimbriation was added later to symbolize peace and honesty. The black, red, and white traditional Maasai shield and two spears symbolize the defense of all the things mentioned peace and honesty.

==Design==

The colours of the flag have been specified by the Kenya National Archives. 

==History==

The Kenyan flag is based on the black over red over green flag of Kenya African National Union (KANU), the political party that led the fight for freedom and independence of Kenya. Upon independence, the white fimbriation, symbolizing peace and unity, and the shield were added. The meaning of the colours of the flag of Kenya match closely to those of the Pan-African flag adopted by the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League in 1920. http://www.unia-acl.com/history-black,red,%20green.html
