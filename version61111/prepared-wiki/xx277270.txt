Brianna Rollins has set the event on fire all season long, winning the NCAA Championships in the fastest time in the last 20 years and Sally Pearson the defending champion and Olympic champion, who had that same honor before Rollins.  In the final it was Pearson out first, but Rollins did what she has done all year, run faster than everybody else.  Pearson equalled her season best from the semis in second, Tiffany Porter put in a personal best 12.55 to push Dawn Harper off the medal stand only the second time at a major since the 2008 Olympics.
