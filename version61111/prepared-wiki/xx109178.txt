Koliwada refers to a colony of Kolis (fishermen) in India. Several places named Koliwada are located across the Mumbai city in India:

==Fish market==

A machhi market or fish market is usually located near the entrance of the Koliwada locality, or the nearest bus stand or main road. In Mumbai, very few Koli communities can afford to build dedicated market reserved for Koli fisherfolk, and therefore, most fish markets are open for sellers from other communities as well.

==Bandar/Port==

A bandar is the sea shore near boat jetty where fishing boats are anchored. Many fishing nets and other accessories are stored around this area. This area usually is open area and also a location for gathering of many folks in special events. In summer, this area is also used for drying out the fish.
