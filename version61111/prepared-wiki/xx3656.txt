As a result of the lack of space and demand for construction, few older buildings remain, and the city is becoming a centre for modern architecture. The International Commerce Centre (ICC), at [tpl]convert|484|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high, is the tallest building in Hong Kong and the third tallest in the world, by height to roof measurement. The tallest building prior to the ICC is Two International Finance Centre, at [tpl]convert|415|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high. Other recognisable skyline features include the HSBC Headquarters Building, the triangular-topped Central Plaza with its pyramid-shaped spire, The Center with its night-time multi-coloured neon light show; A Symphony of Lights and I. M. Pei's Bank of China Tower with its sharp, angular façade. According to the Emporis website, the city skyline has the biggest visual impact of all world cities. Also, Hong Kong's skyline is often regarded to be the best in the world,[tpl]cite web|title=The world's top 20 city skylines, CNNGo.com|url=http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/play/worlds-top-20-skylines-691351|accessdate=1 March 2011[/tpl] with the surrounding mountains and Victoria Harbour complementing the skyscrapers.[tpl]cite web|title=Best Skyline Poll|url=http://www.snappoll.com/view_results.php?poll_id=159740|accessdate=8 February 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=The World's Best Skylines |url=http://homepages.ipact.nl/~egram/skylines.html |first1=Egbert |last1=Gramsbergen |author2=Paul Kazmierczak|accessdate=8 February 2008[/tpl] Most of the oldest remaining historic structures, including the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower, the Central Police Station, and the remains of Kowloon Walled City were constructed during the 19th and early 20th centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/en/monuments_53.php|title=Declared Monuments in Hong Kong – Hong Kong Island|publisher=Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Hong Kong Government|date=13 January 2010|accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amo.gov.hk/en/monuments_43.php |title=Declared Monuments in Hong Kong – Kowloon Island |publisher=Leisure and Cultural Services Department, Hong Kong Government|date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=31 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Sinn |first=Elizabeth |title=Kowloon Walled City: Its Origin and Early History |journal=Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=27 |pages=30–31 |year=1990 |url=http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/4401608.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]
