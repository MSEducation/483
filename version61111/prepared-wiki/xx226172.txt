Komfon organized live newspaper readings with musical concerts. These events would attract 200-300 workers. Kazakevitch was known as a good public speaker at these events.
Komfon was one of two main Soviet Yiddish publications at the time (the other being the Moscow-based Der Emes). It was later replaced by the Kharkov-based Shtern.[tpl]cite book|author1=Elissa Bemporad|author2=Stanford University.
