A pilaf, it is described as a typical Greek country dish that may be eaten warm or cold.Diane Kochilas, The Food and Wine of Greece: More Than 250 Classic and Modern Dishes from the Mainland and Islands (Macmillan, 1993), p. 158.
A typical recipe includes long-grain rice and fresh spinach along with dill, cumin, salt, black pepper, red wine vinegar, onion, and olive oil, often topped with a fried egg and served with feta cheese and lemon.Vilma Chantiles, Food of Greece: Cooking, Folkways, and Travel in the Mainland and Islands of Greece (Simon & Schuster, 1992), p. 106.
