The Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert was a benefit concert held in memory of music executive Ahmet Ertegün at The O2 Arena in London on December 10, 2007.  The headline act was the English rock band, Led Zeppelin, who performed their first full-length concert since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, in a one-off reunion. Bonham's son Jason Bonham played drums during the band's set, and also provided backing vocals on two songs.
According to Guinness World Records 2009, the concert holds the world record for the "Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert" as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online.Staff.

"Led Zeppelin broke the world record for the Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert when 20 million requests came through for the one-time reunion show in December 2007."
In October 2012, Celebration Day, a concert film documenting the event, was released. Both the film and performance by Led Zeppelin have been highly acclaimed. A shortened version of the concert was broadcast by the BBC in the UK on 8 December 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Led Zeppelin Live in London 2007: Celebration Day|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0125wzk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 December 2012[/tpl]

==Background==

On September 12, 2007, it was confirmed during a press conference by promoter Harvey Goldsmith that the surviving members of Led Zeppelin would reunite for the show, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums.[tpl]cite news |title=Led Zeppelin confirm reunion gig |url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6990704.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2007-09-12 [/tpl] The concert was originally scheduled to take place on November 26, 2007. It was to help raise money for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, which pays for university scholarships in the UK, US and Turkey.
Tickets were made available via a lottery system through the website Ahmettribute.com, costing £125 / $250,[tpl]cite news |title=Led Zeppelin Takes Flight, For One Night Only |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049356/led-zeppelin-takes-flight-for-one-night-only |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2007-09-12 [/tpl] with all proceeds going to Ahmet's own charity. The website exceeded its bandwidth allowance and crashed almost immediately following the announcement, with the promoter predicting that the gig would cause the "largest demand for one show in history".[tpl]cite news |title=demand for tickets crashes site |url=http://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/31084 |publisher=NME |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2007-09-13 [/tpl] The promoter claimed that one million people registered for fewer than 20,000 available tickets.Nagara, Bunn.

"Today they play a one-off concert at London’s O2 Arena, in aid of the late Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun’s education fund. More than two million fans chased nearly 20,000 tickets, and with more than a billion page views the website soon crashed." Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page later commented:
On November 1, 2007, it was announced that Page fractured the little finger on his left hand after a fall in his garden and the reunion show was postponed to December 10, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/01/led-zeppelin-reunion-concert-postponed-due-to-fractured-finger/ |title=Led Zeppelin Reunion Concert Postponed Due to Fractured Finger[/tpl]

===Opening acts===

The show opened with a band consisting of Keith Emerson, Chris Squire, Alan White and Simon Kirke[tpl]cite web|url=http://nyc.brightestyoungthings.com/articles/byt-interview-yes.htm|title=BYT Interview[/tpl]] with the brass section from Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. They played Emerson, Lake & Palmer's version of "Fanfare for the Common Man", including sections from Yes' "The Fish" and Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir". Initially the openers should have been Squire, White and Rick Wakeman but Wakeman was unavailable for the rescheduled date due to prior commitments and Emerson was called in as a last-minute replacement.[tpl]cn|date=July 2013[/tpl]
The show also featured Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings, Paul Rodgers, Paolo Nutini, and Foreigner as supporting acts. The majority of the performance was by the Rhythm Kings, with Nutini and Rodgers both guesting on two songs each. The performance billed as "Foreigner" was in fact only Mick Jones performing "I Want to Know What Love Is" with St. Lukes C of E secondary school as the choir and Brian Tichy (former Foreigner drummer) and the Rhythm Kings as the backing band. Other guests on the Rhythm Kings set included Maggie Bell and Alvin Lee.Led Zep To Record New Material? | News @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/music/news/e3ic4b4426aaea0ba2fbdfea3e2cf8beff2 | title=Rodgers ready to rock Ertegun tribute | deadurl=yes | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first1=Gary | last1=Graff[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]  Pete Townshend was scheduled to perform as a supporting act, but he pulled out when he heard Led Zeppelin was performing, saying, "They really don't need me."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thewho.com/index.php?module=news&news_item_id=43|title= "Pete Townshend pulls out of Ahmet Ertegun concert[/tpl] Other acts considered for the show included a reunited Cream.

The concert was also recorded by many fans. Sophisticated bootleg versions of the show are available on the Internet, including a wide-screen DVD with a surround sound audio track mixed from 10 different audience recordings of the show.
The historic concert attracted nearly 20 million fans from all corners of the globe.  Because of the enormous demand for tickets, an online lottery system was implemented in which fans entered a random drawing.  Eight thousand fans were selected and allowed to purchase the 16,000 tickets that were made available to the public.  To combat fears of ticket scalping, lottery winners had to be present in London with ID to pick up their tickets and wristbands for entry. Hundreds of fans with General Admission tickets arrived at the O2 Arena days in advance with the hopes of being front and center for such a landmark occasion.

==Critical response==

Music critics in attendance were unanimous in their praise for Led Zeppelin's performance. New Musical Express proclaimed, "what they have done here tonight is proof that they can still perform to the level that originally earned them their legendary reputation...We can only hope this isn't the last we see of them."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/led-zeppelin/33079|title=Led Zeppelin reunion: the review [/tpl]
The New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones, who attended the concert wrote, "The failed gigs of the nineteen-eighties and nineties have been supplanted by a triumph, and the band should be pleased to have done Ertegun proud with such a spirited performance."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/12/24/071224crmu_music_frerejones|title= Stairway to Here: Musical Events: The New Yorker[/tpl]
Members of the band have also expressed their satisfaction with the concert. Page commented that "it was a wonderful celebration of the music, a celebration of the fact that the essence of it, the energy, was still there,". He also reflected that "It’s great that we did it. I look back on that night with a great amount of fondness, but Jason Bonham was the hero. For me that gig was about him."James Jackson, "Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's good times, bad times and reunion rumours", The Times, January 8, 2010.
