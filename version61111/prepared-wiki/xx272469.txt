In 2011 he was also entrusted with responsibility for the intermediates after Karen Barnes stepped down and coached both to the All Ireland championship.Enniscorthy Echo: Camogie boss JJ to double job in 2011 His fellow selectors were Tommy Roche (Marshalstown), Ger O’Reilly (GlynnBarntown), Joe Brennan (Naomh Éanna), Geraldine Murphy (Ferns St Aidan’s) and trainer Gerry McQuaid (Monaghan). The only player not available was Caroline Murphy, the Ferns St Aidan’s player who was away working in Canada.
In 2011 he and his backroom team achieved history by coaching both senior and Intermediate teams to victory in the All Ireland championship, and the seniors to win the National League as well.
The 2011 All Ireland campaign got off to an inauspicious start with a surprise first round defeat to Galway by 11 points.Galway 2-14 Wexford 0-9 report on RTÉ Online Irish Times Standard Galway Independent In the aftermath of the victory he referred to the severe criticism the team and management had faced in the aftermath of this defeat.
 
 “People had said a lot of things about Wexford camogie, especially the senior team. People questioned our girl's hunger. People questioned our desire, said that Galway were going to be hungrier than us. They questioned a lot of things about the team. We wanted to get the opportunity to answer them. Thankfully we have done that.”
