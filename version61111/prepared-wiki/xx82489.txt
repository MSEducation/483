[[Gounki]]

CATEGORIES: Board games introduced in 1997, Abstract strategy games

Gounki is an abstract strategy game in which pieces can combine and disperse to affect their movement possibilities. Played on an eight-by-eight square grid, the goal is to move one of your own pieces off the opposite end of the board while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
It was invented by Christophe Malavasi in 1997.

==Rules==

===Starting position===

Gounki is played on an eight-by-eight square.
Each player has eight round pieces and eight square pieces,
placed alternatively on his first two rows (square pieces are on
black squares of a classic chessboard.)

===Course of the game===

On each turn, the player chooses whether to make a movement or a deployment.
Rounds pieces move one step in diagonal, always forward.
Squares pieces move one step on the left, on the right, or forward.

===Movement===

When a player moves his pieces, he may stack them above some of his other pieces, as long as he does not try to combine more than three elementary pieces altogether. If a combined piece comprises X rounds and Y squares, it may move up to X steps like a round, or up to Y steps like a square.
Combined pieces cannot :

====Captures====

Just like in chess: if an opponent piece is where you mean to go during a movement, it is captured.

===Deployments===

The second (and last) kind of move is the deployment.
When deploying a piece, you separate all the simple pieces making a composed pieces. You separate a simple piece by moving its parent composed piece like this simple piece.
After this movement, the simple piece is separated from its parent piece.
All the rounds are deployed, then all the squares, or all the squares followed by all the rounds.
It means you should not, for instance, deploy a round, a square, then a round again.
You can deploy above your own pieces, as long as you don't build bigger than triple pieces.
You should not :

===Bounds===

Pieces mays rebound against the side during their movements or
deployments.
