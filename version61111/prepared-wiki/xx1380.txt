 At the fall of Troy, Cassandra sought shelter in the temple of [[Athena]] and there she embraced the wooden statue of Athena in supplication for her protection, where she was abducted and brutally raped by [[Ajax the Lesser]]. Cassandra was clinging so tightly to the statue of the goddess that Ajax knocked it over from its stand as he dragged her away.<ref name="maicar1"/> One account claimed that even Athena, who had worked hard to help the Greeks destroy Troy, was not able to restrain her tears, burned her cheeks with anger.  In one account, this caused her image to give forth a sound that shook the floor of the temple at the sight of Cassandra’s rape before her image turned its eyes away as Cassandra was violated, although others found this account to be too bold.<ref name="maicar1"/> Ajax committed sacrilege since as Cassandra was a supplicant of Athena he should have left her alone for supplicants were untouchable in the sanctuary of a god under the protection of that god and he did commit another sacrilege since he raped her inside the temple Athena despite it being strictly forbidden for people to have intercourse in the temple of a god.<ref name="Cassandra, Ancient princess of Troy, priestess and Prophetess">[tpl] cite web | title=Cassandra, Ancient princess of Troy, priestess and Prophetess | url=http://www.fjkluth.com/cassandra.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203230234/http://www.fjkluth.com/cassandra.html | archivedate=February 3, 2014 | accessdate=March 24, 2014[/tpl]</ref> [[Odysseus]] demanded to the other Greek leaders that Ajax should be stoned to death for his crimes which had enraged Athena and the other gods, but Ajax ended up saving himself from their wrath as none of them had dared to punish him as he had clung as a suppliant to Athena’s altar proclaiming his innocence of his crimes with an oath.
 Athena was furious over the Greeks’ failure to punish Ajax for his crime over his rape of Cassandra in her temple and she gravely punished them with the help of Poseidon and Zeus as Poseidon sent storms and strong winds for her to destroy much of the Greek fleet on their way home from Troy. She punished Ajax herself by causing him to have a terrible death though the sources of his death differ. The Locrians had to atone for Ajax's great sacrilege against Cassandra in Athena's temple as they were obliged to send two maidens to Troy every year to serve as slaves in Athena's temple there for a thousand years, but if they were caught by the inhabitants before they reached the temple they were executed.
Some versions told that Cassandra had intentionally left a chest behind in Troy which she had placed a curse on it to whichever Greek would open it first. Inside the chest was an image of Dionysus, made by Hephaestus and presented to the Trojans by Zeus. It was given to the Greek leader Eurypylus as a part of his share of the victory spoils of Troy for when he opened the chest; on seeing the image of the god, he went mad.
Cassandra was then taken as a concubine by King Agamemnon of Mycenae. Unbeknownst to Agamemnon, while he was away at war, his wife, Clytemnestra, had begun an affair with Aegisthus.   Clytemnestra and Aegisthus then murdered both Agamemnon and Cassandra. Some sources mention that Cassandra and Agamemnon had twin boys, Teledamus and Pelops, both of whom were killed by Aegisthus.
Cassandra had been sent to the Elysian Fields after her death as her soul was one of the ones judged worthy enough from her dedication to the gods and her religious nature during her life to be there.[tpl]cite book| title=Westmoreland[/tpl][tpl]rp|p. 179[/tpl][tpl]full|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Cassandra was buried either at Amyclae or Mycenae for the two towns disputed the possession of it. She had been buried most likely in Mycenae. Heinrich Schliemann was certain that he had discovered Cassandra’s tomb when he had excavated Mycenae since he had found the remains of a woman and two infants in one of the circle graves at Mycenae.
