[[Blackwood Detective Agency]]

CATEGORIES: Cthulhu Mythos organizations, Fictional agencies

The Blackwood Detective Agency is a fictional organization from the Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game.
It was presumably founded by Norman Harvey Blackwood Sr. in the beginning of the 20th century as a reaction to the rise of activity around the Cthulhu Mythos in Arkham. Soon an entire, worldwide network of intrepid investigators was created around it, with people from all walks of life from politicians to criminals that work together to stop the threat of the Mythos.
Most of the people that work in this network fall under the 'The Agency' faction; However, The Agency has strong ties with 2 allied factions 'The Syndicate' representing the criminal underworld and 'Miskatonic University' representing scientists investigating all aspects of The Mythos.
At the beginning of Arkham Edition set, Norman Harvey Blackwood Sr. is missing and his son, Norman Blackwood Jr., takes over his role, hoping to find out what happened to his father.
At the end of the Arkham Block, in the cardset 'Forbidden Relics' Norman finds his father. This, however, would not last. In the 'Eldritch Edition' block a new character is introduced, simply known as 'The Man,' who tries to influence all actions of the Blackwood Agency and their connections. He is introduced as an old friend of Blackwood Sr. 
Norman Jr. doesn't like or trust him though, and it is later revealed that The Man is an Avatar of Nyarlathotep, who tries to set up an intricate plan by infiltrating all of the game's factions.
Towards the end of the Eldritch Edition block, Blackwood Sr. disappears to the Dreamlands and gives up his life to find information about a place called Gray Dragon Island. Blackwood Jr. takes the Agency there, as well as Jack 'Brass' Brady from the Syndicate because they think the place must be really important if Blackwood Sr. would lay down his life to find the location.
