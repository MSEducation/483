Copyhold tenure was a form of feudal tenure of land common in England from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, and surviving in residual form until 1922. The land was held according to the custom of the manor, and the mode of landholding took its name from the fact that the "title deed" received by the tenant was a copy of the relevant entry in the manorial court roll. A tenant who held land in this way was known as a copyholder.

==Principles==

The privileges granted to each tenant, and the exact services he was to render to the Lord of the Manor in return for them, were described in the roll or book kept by the Steward, who gave a copy of the relevant entry to the tenant. Consequently these tenants were afterwards called copyholders, in contrast to freeholders.Bland, W., Enclosure of Commons and Waste Lands, formerly in the townships of Belper, Duffield, Hazelwood, Heage, Holbrooke, Turnditch, and elsewhere in the old Parish of Duffield, jjb.uk.com The actual term "copyhold" is first recorded in 1483, and "copyholder" in 1511-12.[tpl]OED|copyhold, copyholder [/tpl] [tpl]subscription[/tpl] The specific rights and duties of copyholders varied greatly from one manor to another and many were established by custom, though generally they laid out rights to use various resources of the land such as wood and pasture, and copyholds very commonly required payment of a type of death duty called a heriot upon the decease of the copyholder.

==Inheritance==

Two main kinds of copyhold tenure developed:
Copyhold land often did not appear in a will. This is because its inheritance was already pre-determined, as just described. It could not therefore be given or devised in a will to any other person. In many instances, the executor of the estate held the copyhold for the term of one year after the decease of the testator, which was called the "executor's year", in parallel with the same concept in common law. Language regarding the disposal of the profits of the executor's year or of a heriot often indicates a copyhold.

==Abolition==

Copyholds were gradually enfranchised (turned into ordinary holdings of land â€“ either freehold or 999-year leasehold) as a result of the Copyhold Acts during the 19th century. By this time, servitude to the Lord of the Manor was merely token, discharged on purchasing the copyhold by payment of a "fine in respite of fealty". Part V of the Law of Property Act 1922 finally extinguished the last of them.
