The biological half-life of caffeine – the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of the total amount of caffeine – varies widely among individuals according to such factors as age, liver function, pregnancy, some concurrent medications, and the level of enzymes in the liver needed for caffeine metabolism. It can also be significantly altered by drugs or hormonal states. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life has been measured with a range of results. Some measures get 4.9 hours, and others are at around 6 hours.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hammami, M. M., Al-Gaai, E. A., Alvi, S., & Hammami, M.

In newborn infants the half-life can be 80 hours or more; however it drops very rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by the age of 6 months. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and prolongs its elimination half-life more than tenfold; from 4.9 hours to 56 hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/druginteractions?drug_408=Caffeine%20Oral&drug_1049=Fluvoxamine%20Oral |title=Drug Interaction: Caffeine Oral and Fluvoxamine Oral |publisher=Medscape Multi-Drug Interaction Checker[/tpl]

A 2011 analysis published by PLoS Genetics reviewed five studies covering more than 47,000 subjects of European descent. Researchers determined that habitual caffeine intake is associated with variations in two genes that regulate how quickly the body processes caffeine.

==Detection in biological fluids==

Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.[tpl]cite book|author=Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=236–9 |isbn=0-931890-08-X[/tpl]

==Decaffeination==

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce decaffeinated coffee and caffeine, is an important[tpl]quantify|date=March 2014[/tpl] industrial process and can be performed using a number of solvents. Benzene, chloroform, trichloroethylene, and dichloromethane have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:
"Decaffeinated" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases — some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10 mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85 mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.[tpl]cite journal|author=McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ |title=Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=611–3 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17132260 |doi=10.1093/jat/30.8.611 |laysummary=http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ |laysource=University of Florida News[/tpl]

Use of the kola nut, like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, individually or in a social setting, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. In 1911, kola became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was "injurious to health".[tpl]cite journal|author=Benjamin LT, Rogers AM, Rosenbaum A |title=Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911 |journal=J Hist Behav Sci |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=42–55 |year=1991 |pmid=2010614 |doi=10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:13.0.CO;2-1[/tpl] Although the judge ruled in favor of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 to amend the Pure Food and Drug Act, adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances, which must be listed on a product's label.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/jarvis/jarvis17.html |title=The Rise and Fall of Cocaine Cola |website=Lewrockwell.com |accessdate=25 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility |date=February 2012[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility |date=February 2012[/tpl]
The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency.[tpl]citation needed |date=October 2011[/tpl]
Xocolatl was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. It was used in alchemical processes, where it was known as "black bean".[tpl]citation needed |date=October 2011[/tpl]

===Discovery===

In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it "Kaffebase" (i.e. a base that exists in coffee).[tpl]cite book|last=Runge |first=Friedlieb Ferdinand |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&pg=P146 |year=1820 |publisher=G. Reimer |location=Berlin |pages=144–159 |trans_title=Latest phytochemical discoveries for the founding of a scientific phytochemistry |accessdate=8 January 2014[/tpl] According to Runge, he did this at the behest of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.[ref]In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject.  Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that:  "Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. "Auch diese können Sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen," sagte Goethe.  Er hatte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein."  (After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man I'd rescued serving in Napoleon's army by apparent "black star" amaurosis, blindness as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  "You can also use these in your investigations," said Goethe.  He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.) 
This account appeared in Runge's book Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen (Domestic Letters personal correspondence) of 1866.  It was reprinted in:  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with F.W. von Biedermann, ed., Goethes Gespräche, vol. 10:  Nachträge, 1755–1832 (Leipzig, (Germany):  F.W. v. Biedermann, 1896), pages 89–96; see especially page 95.[/ref][tpl]cite book|author=Bennett Alan Weinberg, Bonnie K.

Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work.[tpl]cite journal|year=1825 |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |volume=4 |page=180 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XJI8AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA180 |language=German |trans_title=Annual report on the progress of the physical sciences by Jacob Berzelius |last=Berzelius |first=Jöns Jakob[/tpl]  From page 180:  "Caféin ist eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte."  (Caffeine is a material in coffee, which was discovered at the same time, 1821, by Robiquet and by Pelletier and Caventou, by whom however nothing was made known about it in the press.)  However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating:[tpl]cite book|title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iGs1AAAAcAAJ&pg=P270 |volume=7 |year=1828 |trans_title=Annual Report on the Progress of the Physical Sciences by Jacob Berzelius |language=German |page=270 |author=Berzelius JJ[/tpl] From page 270:  "Es darf indessen hierbei nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass Runge (in seinen phytochemischen Entdeckungen 1820, p. 146-7.) dieselbe Methode angegeben, und das Caffein unter dem Namen Caffeebase ein Jahr eher beschrieben hat, als Robiquet, dem die Entdeckung dieser Substanz gewöhnlich zugeschrieben wird, in einer Zusammenkunft der Societé de Pharmacie in Paris die erste mündliche Mittheilung darüber gab." (However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.) "However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."

In 1895, German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from raw materials (i.e. a "total synthesis"), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound.[ref]Fischer began his studies of caffeine in 1881; however, understanding of the molecule's structure long eluded him.  In 1895 he synthesized caffeine, but only in 1897 did he finally fully determine its molecular structure.

===Legality===

==Religion==

Some Seventh-day Adventists, Church of God (Restoration) adherents, and Christian Scientists do not consume caffeine.[tpl]citation needed |date=December 2011[/tpl] Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: "With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided."[tpl]cite book|title=Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual: Religion 324 and 325 |publisher=LDS Church |location=Salt Lake City |year=2001 |page=209 |url=http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/dc-in/dc-in-081.htm |accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]
