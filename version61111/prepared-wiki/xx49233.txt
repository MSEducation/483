The Freedom Party was a right wing political party in the United Kingdom.
The party was founded in December 2000 by former members of the British National Party (BNP), dubbed "ultra-Tories" by BNP leader Nick Griffin, who were disaffected with the party's refusal to moderate its position on race. They were expelled following a feud with the BNP leadership and allegations of financial irregularities and misconduct. Most prominent were two party activists in the West Midlands, husband and wife Steve Edwards (who became Freedom Party agent) and Sharron Edwards (formerly deputy chairman of the BNP and then deputy chairman of the Freedom Party). Adrian Davies was Party Chairman and Michael Newland was the  treasurer. Most of the leadership were prominent in the Bloomsbury Forum, a right-wing discussion group.
The party was primarily anti-immigration, although it claimed to place more of an emphasis on culture rather than race.  It was more mainstream on issues such as race than the British National Party, with which it had a stormy relationship. The party aimed to appeal to 'reasonable people'.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1667_285/ai_n13807439/|title=The dangers of wearing glasses: intellectual opposition to liberalism in contemporary Britain|last=Dutton|first=Edward|date=December 2004|work=Contemporary Review|accessdate=10 February 2010[/tpl] It believed in a Keynesian approach to the economy, and was also protectionist.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
