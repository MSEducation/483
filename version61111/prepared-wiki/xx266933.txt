A hybrid lovebird is a generic term that describes the result of two lovebirds being cross-bred. Hybrids produced by the pairing of a Rosy-faced Lovebird (or Peach-faced Lovebird) with one of the 'eye ring' species (i.e. those species which have a prominent area of white bare skin encircling the eye area, Fischer's Lovebird being a typical example) are usually sterile - whereas crosses between the 'eye ring' species are often fertile.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.albsaustralia.com/hybridlovebirds.htm |title=Hybrid Lovebirds - The African Lovebird Society of Australia Inc |publisher=African Lovebird Society of Australia |year=2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl]
