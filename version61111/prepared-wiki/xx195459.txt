==Population==

==History==

The area in which the village is found has been continuously populated for at least the past 400 years, according to both Venetian and Byzantine records, but had never numbered more than a handful of families. The village experienced a steady increase in inhabitants prior to and after the Greek War of Independence.
Since the end of the Second World War and the Greek Civil War a significant portion of the local population resettled in Athens or immigrated to Australia, the United States and Canada.

==Today==

The community currently has two small cafes, or kafeneia as they are known in Greek, a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and a smaller chapel of St. John which served as a krifo scholio ("secret school") during Ottoman rule.  There are two churches and a big square.  The former public school has been converted into a meeting place for its inhabitants.  At the entrance of the village, the Avaros spring is situated.
