==Biography==

She got her first viol while studying music at Reading University, and went on to study at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels with Wieland Kuijken and, later, with Jordi Savall at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis. She has made around ninety recordings - mostly with the Consort of Musicke, the Dowland Consort, Musica Antiqua of London, and the Rose Consort of Viols - but also featuring as a soloist on two discs of Marais, and more recently with Laurence Cummings, on a recording of the three Bach gamba sonatas, and playing Italian virtuoso divisions on renaissance viols with Musica Antiqua on their 'Word Play' CD. 
She is President of the Viola da Gamba Society of Great Britain, and is Professor of Viola da gamba at Trinity College of Music in London. She directs many courses for viol players, including the International Viol Summer School, attracting players from all over the world, and has had published a series of graded music books centred around her highly acclaimed textbook 'Play the Viol' - now in its fifth reprint. Her second book, 'The Viol Rules' was published in November 2009.
