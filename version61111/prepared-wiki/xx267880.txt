[[Emergency planning in Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Emergency management

Emergency planning in Wales is carried out in line with the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 however as a result of devolution it is managed with its own ‘welsh flavour.’ For instance there are unique bodies operating in Wales like The Joint Emergency Services Group (JESG) and there is involvement from The Welsh Government.[tpl]cite web|title=Wales Resilience website|url=http://wales.gov.uk/resilience/home/wales-resilience/;jsessionid=2NhbT86fHJ8plytbQj49ppMt75p6pPRSQwrn6MTVpTKjNkSQ5TQf!1441443736?lang=en|publisher=The Welsh Government|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl]
