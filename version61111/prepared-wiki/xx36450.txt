The statement in [tpl]Bibleref2|Romans|8:3-4|nrsv[/tpl] that God sent his Son "in the likeness of sinful flesh" has been interpreted as meaning merely that Jesus was externally just like any other human being, supported by Paul's remark elsewhere that Christ "knew no sin".[tpl]Bibleref2c|2Cor|5:21||2 Cor 5:21[/tpl] Others suggest a contradiction between Paul's notion of being "in the likeness of sinful flesh" and his having been born of a virgin.
In [tpl]Bibleref2|1Timothy|1:4[/tpl], the author urges people not to "occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations...".  Some scholars see this passage as reflecting a negative view of the developing virgin birth stories and their variant genealogies.Barrett, J. Edward (1988). "Can Scholars Take the Virgin Birth Seriously?" Bible Review, October, pp. 10-15, 29.

===Gospels===

The accounts of the birth of Jesus appear in only two of the four Canonical Gospels, the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew. Luke's story centers on Mary, while Matthew's story centers on Joseph, and in both gospel accounts (Luke 2:1-7 and Matthew 2:1) Jesus is conceived without a human father.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 ISBN 0-86554-373-9 page 556Jesus and the Gospels by Clive Marsh, Steve Moyise 2006 ISBN 0-567-04073-9 page 37The Gospel according to Matthew by Leon Morris ISBN 0-85111-338-9 page 26
While Luke's introduction does assert that its author has "carefully investigated everything",[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk.|1:3[/tpl] neither Luke nor Matthew attribute their birth narratives to the direct testimonies of either Mary or Joseph.Lord Jesus Christ by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0-8028-3167-2 page 322 James Hastings and separately Thomas Neufeld have expressed the view that the circumstances of the birth of Jesus were deliberately kept restricted to a small group of early Christians, and were kept as a secret for many years after his death.A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels: Volume II by James Hastings 2004 ISBN 1-4102-1788-4 page 805Recovering Jesus: the witness of the New Testament Thomas R. Yoder Neufeld 2007 ISBN 1-58743-202-1 pages 116-123 Ronald Brownrigg suggests that the narrative in Luke was obtained via a path from Mary, while the narrative in Matthew was obtained from a path on Joseph's side.Who's Who in the New Testament by Ronald Brownrigg 2001 ISBN 0-415-26036-1 page 99

====Matthew====

[tpl]quote|18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child  from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus,for he will save his people from their sins." 22  All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 23 "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us). 24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, 25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.|[tpl]Bibleref2|Matthew|1:18-25[/tpl][/tpl]
The Gospel of Matthew (c 80-85) begins with a genealogy leading from Abraham to Joseph, but then calls Joseph "the husband of Mary, of whom (Mary) was born Jesus, who is called Christ."[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:16[/tpl] The Greek text, which has "ἐξ ἧς" (feminine singular), shows that the phrase "of whom" refers to Mary, not to Joseph or to Mary and Joseph together.[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:16[/tpl] It then states that, when Mary was found to be pregnant, she had not lived with Joseph, to whom she was engaged,[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:18[/tpl] and that he did not have marital relations with her before the child was born.[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:25[/tpl]
Matthew then states: "That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit",[tpl]Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:20[/tpl] in fulfillment of the prophecy of the prophet: "A virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."[tpl]Bibleref2c|Mt.|1:22-23[/tpl] Scholars interpret "prophet" as a reference to [tpl]Bibleref2|Isaiah|7:14[/tpl]."In three details Matthew departs from the Septuagint form of Isa. 7:14 ... (1) the use of hexei rather than lēpsetai; (2) the third person plural 'they will call', rather than 'you sing. will call'; (3) the supplied interpretation of Emmanuel as 'God with us'" (Raymond E. Brown: The Birth of the Messiah 0-385-05405-X, p. 150) Some 5th- and 6th-century manuscripts read "Isaiah the prophet".Barbara Aland, et al. Latin New Testament 1983, American Bible Society. ISBN 3-438-05401-9 page 3
The text of Isaiah in Hebrew, as given in both the Masoretic text and the Great Isaiah Scroll found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, uses the word עַלְמָה (almah), meaning an unmarried young woman of the age of puberty. David Strauss in The Life of Jesus, suggests that Isaiah was referring to events of his own time, and that the young woman in question may have been "perhaps the prophet's own wife".Strauss, D.F. The life of Jesus, Calvin Blanchard, NY, 1860, p. 114. The Encyclopedia Judaica calls the interpretation as referring to a virgin "a two-millennium misunderstanding of Isaiah 7:14", which "indicates nothing concerning the chastity of the woman in question".Skolnik, F., Encyclopedia Judaica, 2nd Edition, 2006, Volume 20, p. 540.
Matthew 1:22 ("Behold the virgin shall be with child") uses the Greek term παρθένος (parthenos), meaning a virgin, as in the Septuagint translation of Isaiah,Brown, Raymond E.; Achtemeier, Paul J. (1978). Mary in the New Testament: A Collaborative Assessment by Protestant and Roman Catholic Scholars. Paulist Press. p. 92. ISBN 0-8091-2168-9. which "alters or refines" the meaning of the Hebrew word,Diarmaid MacCulloch, A History of Christianity, 2009 (Penguin 2010, p. 81). ISBN 978-0-14-102189-8 perhaps understanding, as Raymond Brown suggests, the Hebrew word עַלְמָה to mean "virgin" in this context.

====Luke====

The Nativity is a prominent element of the Gospel of Luke (c 85-90), and comprises over 10% of the text, being three times the length of the Nativity text in the Gospel of Matthew.The people's New Testament commentary by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 ISBN 0-664-22754-6 page 177 In [tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|1:30-35[/tpl] Mary asks how she is to conceive and bear a son, since she is a virgin; and she is told it will happen by the power of God. [tpl]Bibleref2|Luke|3:23-38[/tpl] gives a genealogy, different from that given by Matthew. Scholars differ on which of the two, Matthew or Luke, is the legal genealogy via Joseph, and which the physical descent via Mary.John Gresham Machen Virgin Birth of Christ 1987 Page 218 "We shall still be able to say that the difference between the two genealogies, taken broadly, is due to the fact that for the most part — perhaps even in every link except one — the Lucan genealogy traces the actual physical ancestors."
When the angel Gabriel tells Mary that she will bear a son conceived by the Holy Spirit,[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk.|1:26-38[/tpl] she responds with what is known as the Magnificat,[tpl]Bibleref2c|Lk.|1:46-55[/tpl] a prayer of joy.

==Isaiah==

[tpl]quote|Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel. Cream and honey he shall eat when he knows to reject bad and choose good. For, when the lad does not yet know to reject bad and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread, shall be abandoned."|[tpl]bibleref|Isaiah|7:14-16|JPR[/tpl][/tpl]
In this passage from the Book of Isaiah the prophet predicts to King Ahaz that a young woman will give birth to a son who will be called "Immanuel", meaning "God with us", and that Ahaz's enemies will be destroyed before this child learns the difference between good and evil, i.e., before he reaches maturity. The Hebrew word is "עלמה" (almah), which scholars agree means a young woman of child-bearing age, without any connotation of virginity, and the context of the passage makes it clear that Isaiah has in mind events in his and Ahaz's near future. The Greek-speaking author of Matthew, however, used the Greek translation of Isaiah, in which the word is given as "[tpl]lang|grc|παρθένος[/tpl]", parthenos, meaning a virgin.[tpl]sfn|Sweeney|1996|p=161-162[/tpl]

==The Qur'an==

The Qur'an says that Jesus was the result of a virgin birth. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Sura 3 (Al Imran) and 19 (Maryam) wherein it is written that God sent an angel to announce that she could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.Sarker, Abraham.Understand My Muslim People. 2004 ISBN 1-59498-002-0 page 260
The account in Sura 19 [tpl]Quran-usc|19|1[/tpl] of the Qur'an is close to that in the Gospel of Luke.Jackson, Montell. Islam Revealed. 2003 ISBN 1-59160-869-4 page 73 The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In one case, the bearer of the news, who is believed to be archangel Gabriel, delivered the news in (3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (19:16-22). The details of the conception are not discussed but when Mary asks how she can bear a son in view of her chastity she is told that God creates what he wills and that these things are easy for God. However, elsewhere the Quran states (21:91 and 66:12) that God breathed "His Spirit" into Mary while she was chaste.Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians by F. E. Peters 2005 Princeton University Press ISBN 0-691-12233-4 page 23 http://books.google.it/books?id=HYJ2c9E9IM8C&pg=PA23&dq=angel+breathed+Mary+islam&hl=en&ei=z6XoTqKgNpCrsgaI1fmQBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=falseHoly people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia, Volume 1 by Phyllis G. Jestice 2004 ISBN 1-57607-355-6 pages 558-559
Although not specifically mentioned in the Quran, Muslims believe that Jesus and Mary were the only two children not to be touched by Satan at the moment of their birth, for God placed a veil between them and Satan.Rodwell, J. M. The Koran. 2009 ISBN 0-559-13127-5 page 505

==Critical analysis==

===Historicity===

The modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth "rests on very slim historical foundations."Frederick Bruner, "Matthew: The Christbook, Matthew 1-12", p.37 Some writersGeoffrey Bromiley, 1995, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Eerdmans Publishing ISBN 978-0-8028-3784-4 page 991Craig S. Keener, The Gospel of Matthew (Eerdmans 2009 ISBN 978-0-8028-6498-7), p. 83Donald A. Hagner, Matthew 1-13 (Paternoster Press 1993 ISBN 978-0-8499-0232-1), pp. 14-15, cited in the precedingMillard Erickson, Christian Theology (Baker Academic 1998 ISBN 978-0-8010-2182-4), p. 761Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe, Christmas (Wiley-Blackwell 2010 ISBN 978-1-4443-3090-8), p. 28 take it as significant that two separate gospels attest to the virgin birth, although their details vary. In this view, the virgin conception and birth constitute a tradition that fits within the criterion of multiple attestation. The accounts of Matthew and Luke are taken as independent testimonies of the tradition.Frederick Dale Bruner, Matthew: The Christbook (Eerdmans 2004 ISBN 9780802811189), p. 41 The mutual independence of the two attestations is shown by the differences between the accounts of Matthew and Luke regarding Jesus' birth, to which scholars have drawn attention.Samuel Lachs, 1987, A rabbinic commentary on the New TestamentKTAV Press, ISBN 978-0-88125-089-3 page 5Geoffrey Ashe, 1988 The Virgin Routledge Press ISBN 978-1-85063-100-2 page 49
According to Matthew, an unnamed angel informs Joseph of the virginal conception; in Luke the angel Gabriel informs Mary before the conception occurs. There are at least two rival explanations for the "double attestation" of Matthew and Luke regarding the virgin birth of Jesus:Eugene Laverdiere, 2006, The Annunciation to Mary Liturgy Training Press ISBN 978-1-56854-557-8 page 48Gresham Machen, 1987, Virgin Birth of Christ Ingram Press ISBN 978-0-227-67630-1 page 252
Among other hypotheses that have been proposed as explanations of the origin of the accounts in Matthew and Luke of the birth of Jesus from a virgin is that of Stephen L Harris, who proposed that these were written to answer Jewish slanders about Jesus' illegitimate birth,Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. of which there is evidence from the 2nd century, but which may have been a subsequent polemical Jewish response to the account in Matthew and Luke.Brown, Raymond E., The Birth of the Messiah. Doubleday & Company. 1977, Appendix V: The Charge of Illegitimacy, p. 537 Helmut Köster sees the narratives of Jesus' virgin birth as having roots in Hellenistic mythology.Köster, Helmut Ancient Christian gospels: their history and development Edition 7, Trinity Press, 2004, pg 306

===Psilanthropism===

Psilanthropists argue against the virgin birth and contend that Jesus was a "mere human".The Westminster handbook to patristic theology by John Anthony McGuckin 2004 ISBN 0-664-22396-6 page 286 Psilanthropism existed among early Jewish Christian groups such as Ebionites who considered Jesus the Messiah, but rejected Apostle Paul as an apostate.Angels and Principalities by A.

Marthaler 2007 ISBN 0-89622-537-2 page 129
In the 2nd century, Celsus, a pagan anti-Christian Greek philosopher wrote that Jesus's father was a Roman soldier named Pantera. The views of Celsus drew responses from Origen who considered it a fabricated story.Contra Celsum by Origen, Henry Chadwick 1980 ISBN 0-521-29576-9 page 32Patrick, John The Apology of Origen in Reply to Celsus 2009 ISBN 1-110-13388-X pages 22–24 Raymond E.

In the Middle Ages as part of the conflicts with Christians, a satirical parody of the Christian gospels called the Toledot Yeshu was written by the Jews, perhaps as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.Michael J. Cook Jewish Perspectives on Jesus Chapter 14 in the "The Blackwell Companion to Jesus" edited by Delbert Burkett 2011 ISBN ISBN 978-1-4443-2794-6 The book referred to the name Pantera, or Pandera as the father of Jesus, and also portrayed Judas Iscariot as a hero.Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research by Bruce Chilton, Craig A.

Robert E. Van Voorst states that the literary origins of Toledot Yeshu cannot be traced with any certainty, and its medieval composition without a fixed form, it is "most unlikely" to have reliable historical information.Van Voorst, Robert E (2000).

ISBN 0-8028-4368-9 pp. 122, 127 and 128 The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the Toledot Yeshu has no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.Michael J. Cook Jewish Perspectives on Jesus Chapter 14 in the "The Blackwell Companion to Jesus" edited by Delbert Burkett 2011 ISBN 978-1-4443-2794-6
Historically notable psilanthropists have included figures such as the translator of the first Bible in Byelorussian, Symon Budny (who was excommunicated by the Polish UnitariansThe Jews in old Poland, 1000-1795 ed. Antony Polonsky, Jakub Basista, Andrzej Link-Lenczowski - 1993 p32 "Budny rejected the eternality of Christ and, in the notes to his translation of the New Testament, denied the Virgin birth, assenting that Jesus was Joseph's son.

===Analogies and explanations===

As part of the conflicts between Christians and other groups during the 1st and 2nd centuries, statements were made by both Jews and pagans that the Christian virgin birth narratives had been derived from pagan sources.A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels: Volume I by James Hastings 2004 ISBN 1-4102-1786-8 page 784 Early Christians such as Justin Martyr countered the argument about pagan connections to the virgin birth of Jesus. In the 2nd century, Justin presented these arguments in The First Apology of Justin, and in Dialog with Trypho.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 ISBN 0-8028-3785-9 page 271 Justin argued at length against the pagan connection and noted that the word virgin does not even occur in the pagan sources.Virgin Birth of Christ by J Gresham Machen 1987 ISBN 0-227-67630-0 page 335 He also addressed the Old Testament issues in his debates with a Jew called Trypho.Roman world, 44 B.C.-A.D. 180 by Martin Goodman, Jane Sherwood 1997 ISBN 0-415-04969-5 page 326
Followers of Mithraism have proposed, from Persian sources, that Mithra might have been born of the union of Mother Earth and Ahuramazda, and that his story influenced both Christianity and Chinese mythology, where he became known as "The Friend".The mysteries of Mithras by Payam Nabarz 2005 ISBN 1-59477-027-1 page 5 Christian authors have argued that no historical basis for the connection to Christianity has been presented by the Mithraists.The Catholic Answer Book of Mary by Peter M. J. Stravinskas 2000 ISBN 0-87973-347-0 page 105
The early Christian document, the Ascension of Isaiah, which may date to the 2nd century, also has a narrative of the virgin birth of Jesus.Virgin Birth of Christ by J Gresham Machen 1987 ISBN 0-227-67630-0 page 42 However, the date and origin of this document is questionable, given that the author disguised his identity behind Isaiah.Lord Jesus Christ by Larry W. Hurtado 2005 ISBN 0-8028-3167-2 page 595 The narrative of the virgin birth of Jesus can be found also in other New Testament apocrypha, for instance the Protevangelium of James, perhaps written in the 2nd century.International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 ISBN 0-8028-3781-6 page 182
Parthenogenesis has been hypothesized as a possible biological mechanism for the virgin birth of Jesus.Kessel, E.L. 1983. A proposed biological interpretation of the Virgin birth.

==Christian celebrations and devotions==

Christians celebrate the conception of Jesus on 25 MarchThe Julian Calendar 25 March corresponds at present to 8 April in the Gregorian Calendar. (Lady Day) and his birth at Christmas (25 December) or Epiphany (6 January). Among the many traditions associated with Christmas are the construction of cribs and the performance of re-enactments of elements of the story in the Gospels of the birth of Jesus, a tradition started in the 13th century by the Franciscans.The image of St Francis by Rosalind B. Brooke 2006 ISBN 0-521-78291-0 pages 183-184The vitality of the Christian tradition by George Finger Thomas 1944 ISBN 0-8369-2378-2 page 110-112The tradition of Catholic prayer by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan, St. Meinrad Archabbey 2007 ISBN 0-8146-3184-3 pages 86-87
The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the Western Church notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present by Lukas Vischer 2002 ISBN 0-8028-0520-5 pages 400-401 There has been debate about the reason why Christians came to choose the 25 December date to celebrate the birth of Jesus. One theory is that they did so in order to oppose the existing winter-solstice feast of the Natalis Solis Invicti (Birthday of the Unconquered Sun) by celebrating on that date the birth of the "Sun of Righteousness".Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), article Christmas
Another tradition derived the date of Christmas from that of the Annunciation, the virginal conception of Jesus. Since this was supposed to have taken place on 14 Nisan in the Jewish calendar, calculated to have been either 25 March or 6 April, it was believed that the date of Christ's birth will have been nine months later.Procter and Frere's New History of the Book of Common Prayer (see The Date of Christmas and Epiphany) A tractate falsely attributed to John Chrysostom argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March, a computation also mentioned by Saint Augustine of Hippo.

==Artistic depictions==

This doctrine of the Virgin Birth is often represented Christian art in terms of the annunciation to Mary by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God, and in Nativity scenes that include the figure of Salome. The Annunciation is one of the most frequently depicted scenes in Western art.The encyclopedia of angels by Rosemary Guiley 2004 ISBN 0-8160-5023-6 page 183 Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art.Medieval art: a topical dictionary by Leslie Ross 1996 ISBN 0-313-29329-5 page 99 The depiction of Joseph turning away in some Nativity scenes is a discreet reference to the fatherhood of the Holy Spirit, and the doctrine of Virgin Birth.Christian iconography: a study of its origins by André Grabar 1968 Taylor & Francis page 130
