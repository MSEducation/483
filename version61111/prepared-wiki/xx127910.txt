Working mostly in acrylic on canvas, Agbee focuses almost exclusively on the subject of African women, usually in profile, often drawing on two different motifs for their depiction. Some works, such as Wait A Minute, show them talking in groups, and are characterized by intricate detail of symbols embedded in their clothing or the canvas background. Others, such as Migration, feature the dark, clean profiles of these women on backgrounds of colorful, geometric shapes, somewhat evocative of sand dunes.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Agbee has participated in several collective and individual exhibitions in Accra, other locations in Ghana, the Netherlands, the United States, New Zealand and other locations internationally. His work is featured annually in the Contemporary African Art calendar published by Avalanche Publishing along with other luminaries such as Ethiopian modern artist Wosene Worke Kosrof.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl]
