The Los Quiroga Dam (in Spanish, Dique Los Quiroga) is a dam on the course of the Dulce River, in the province of Santiago del Estero, Argentina. It is located near the provincial capital Santiago del Estero and the city of La Banda. It was finished in 1956.
Los Quiroga is both a level-keeping and a diversionary dam, consisting of a reinforced concrete wall that is 390 m long and 7 m tall, continued by a 1,200 m long earth wall. It has 32 floodgates.
The dam creates a reservoir (artificial lake) that is employed mainly for fishing and attracts tourism due to its natural beauty. Near the dam lies the Los Quiroga hydroelectric power plant, which was inaugurated in 1963.
