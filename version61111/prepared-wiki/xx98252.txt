Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor is a science fiction animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, which ran on CBS from 1967 to 1969. Despite Moby's name coming first, he had only one short per half-hour episode, sandwiched between two with Mightor; the same structure was used the previous season for H-B's Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles.

==Segments==

===Mightor===

One day, while on a hunting trip, a teenage caveman named Tor, along with his winged pet dinosaur Tog, rescue an old man who, as a reward, gives Tor a magical club. When Tor raises his club to the sky, he transforms into the masked and muscular Mightor, a prehistoric superhero very much in the Space Ghost mold who possesses superhuman strength and the power of flight through his club, which can also fire energy blasts.
Mightor protects his village from evil-doers. Amongst the villagers are the chief, Pondo, and his daughter, the beautiful redhaired Sheera. Sheera has a younger brother named Little Rok, who loves pretending to be Mightor. The characters have several pets, including Little Rok's dodo bird Ork and Sheera's mammoth calf Bollo.
Tor is voiced by Bobby Diamond, while Mightor is voiced by Paul Stewart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2014/02/16/wiki-worries/ |author=Mark Evanier |title=Wiki Worries |publisher=News From ME |date=2014-02-16 |accessdate=2014-02-16[/tpl] Pondo, Tog, Ork and Bollo are voiced by John Stephenson.
