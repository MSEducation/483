Loughborough University (abbreviated as Lough)[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/gazette/documents/universitycalendar/Calendar_Style_Guide_2012.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2012[/tpl] is a public research university located in the market town of Loughborough, Leicestershire, in the East Midlands of England. In March 2013, the university announced it had acquired the former broadcast centre at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park which it plans to open as a second campus in 2015.  It was a member of the 1994 Group until the group was dissolved in November 2013. The university recently won its seventh Queen's Anniversary Prize, awarded for the relevance of its research.http://www.lboro.ac.uk/about/achievements/qap.html
It has been a university since 1966, but the institution dates back to 1909, when the then Loughborough Technical Institute began with a focus on skills and knowledge which would be directly applicable in the wider world. Loughborough ranks particularly highly for engineering and technology[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/loughborough-university|title=QS Top Universities:Loughborough University|publisher=http://www.topuniversities.com/|accessdate=20 December 2012[/tpl] and is noted for its sports-related courses and achievements.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-loughborough-uni |title=Guardian University Guide 2013: Loughborough University |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=22 August 2012 |location=London |date=10 May 2009[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

The university traces its roots back to 1909 when a Technical Institute was founded in the town centre. There followed a period of rapid expansion during which the institute was renamed Loughborough College and the development of the present campus began.
In the early years, efforts were made to mimic the environment of an Oxbridge college (e.g. requiring students to wear gowns to lectures) whilst maintaining a strong practical counterbalance to academic learning. During World War I, the institute served as an "instructional factory", training workers for the munitions industry.Loughborough University 40th Anniversary Pages History

===The Loughborough colleges===

Following the war, the institute fragmented into four separate colleges:
The last was to become the nucleus of the present university. Its rapid expansion from a small provincial college to the first British technical university was due largely to the efforts of its principals, Herbert Schofield who led it from 1915 to 1950 and Herbert Haslegrave who oversaw its further expansion from 1953 to 1967, and steered its progress first to a College of Advanced Technology and then a university.175 Heroes Herbert Haslegrave
In 1966, the College of Advanced Technology as it had then become received university status. In 1977, the university broadened its range of studies by amalgamating with Loughborough College of Education (formerly the Training College). More recently, in August 1998, the university merged with Loughborough College of Art and Design (LCAD). Loughborough College is still a college of further education.

===The influence of Herbert Schofield===

Schofield became principal in 1915 and continued to lead the College of Technology until 1950. Over his years as principal, the college changed almost beyond recognition.  He purchased the estate of Burleigh Hall on the western outskirts of the town, which became the nucleus of the present 433 acre (1.75 km2) campus. He also oversaw the building of the original Hazlerigg and Rutland halls of residence, which are now home to the university's administration and the vice chancellor's offices.

===From college to university===

An experienced educationist, Herbert Haslegrave took over as college principal in 1953, and by both increasing the breadths and raising standards, gained it the status of Colleges of Advanced Technology in 1958.  He further persuaded the Department of Education to buy further land and began a building programme.
In 1963, the Robbins Report on higher education recommended that all colleges of advanced technology should be given the status of universities. Consequently, Loughborough College of Technology was granted a Royal Charter on 19 April 1966 and became Loughborough University of Technology (LUT), with Haslegrave as its first vice-chancellor.
It gradually remodelled itself in the image of the plate glass universities of the period, which had also been created under Robbins.

===Later history===

In 1977, Loughborough Training College (now renamed Loughborough College of Education) was absorbed into the university. The Arts College was also amalgamated with the university in 1998. These additions have diluted the technological flavour of the institution, causing it to resemble more a traditional university with its mix of humanities, arts and sciences. Consequently in 1996, the university dropped the "of Technology" from its title, becoming "Loughborough University".
The shortened name "Lufbra" is commonly used by the students' union,Welcome to Lufbra Students Union the alumni associationAlumni association and others.
The university has also been housing the Nike Football Academy since August 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/news-releases/2011/97_Nike-Academy.html |title=Nike Football Academy starts the new season at a new home |publisher=Loughborough University |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2012[/tpl]

==Campus==

The university's main campus is in the Leicestershire town of Loughborough and until 2003 it was developing a secondary campus at Peterborough. The Loughborough campus (once the estate of Burleigh Hall) covers an area of 433 acres (1.75 km2), and includes academic departments, halls of residence, the Students' Union, two gyms, gardens and playing fields.
Of particular interest are the walled garden, the "garden of remembrance", the Hazlerigg-Rutland Hall fountain-courtyard and the Bastard Gates.
In the central quadrangle of the campus stands a famous cedar, which has often appeared as a symbol for the university. Unfortunately a heavy snowfall in December 1990 led to the collapse of the upper canopy which gave the tree its distinctive shape.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]

The motto of the university is veritate scientia labore ("with truth, wisdom and labour", or, alternatively, "with truth, knowledge and work", depending on the translation).[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
The university has a strong tradition in both engineering and sporting.

In keeping with this tradition, Loughborough University students have won the British Universities Sports Association championship every year for over three decades.

The phonetic spelling "Lufbra" is sometimes used amongst students, graduates, and in Students' Union publications, and the name is also often abbreviated to "lboro" both casually as well as within more formal/academic circles, stemmed from the university's URL of "www.lboro.ac.uk".
There is a one week break between semester one and semester two. Normally little to no exams are scheduled in this week therefore students are presented with a week free from studies. This week is referred to as Refreshers Week by most students.
