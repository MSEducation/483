WLPA switched from Fox Sports Radio (which it had carried since July 2005) to ESPN Radio on August 1, 2013. The station had attempted to affiliate with ESPN Radio for some years beforehand, but was unable to do so due to its geographic proximity to WGLD in Manchester Township; however, that station joined CBS Sports Radio in early 2013, making the ESPN affiliation available to WLPA.[tpl]cite news|last=Stark|first=Eric|title=WLPA drops FOX in favor of ESPN|url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/864034_WLPA-drops-FOX-in-favor-of-ESPN.html|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=Sunday News (Lancaster)[tpl]![/tpl]Sunday News|date=June 23, 2013[/tpl]
