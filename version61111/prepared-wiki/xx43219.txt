==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Sean Lennon was born in New York City on October 9, 1975, his father's 35th birthday. He is of English and Irish descent on his father's side, and Japanese descent on his mother's side. Julian Lennon is his half-brother and Kyoko Chan Cox is his half-sister. After Sean's birth, John became a "house husband", doting on his young son until John's murder in 1980. Sean attended kindergarten in Tokyo,[tpl]cite news| author=Dekel, Jonathan| url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/10/08/sean-lennon-interview-john-yoko-plastic-ono-band/ | work=Spinner | title=Sean Lennon on Singing John's Songs, Making Music and Yoko Ono's Legacy | date=October 8, 2010[/tpl] and was also educated at the exclusive private boarding school Institut Le Rosey in Rolle, Switzerland, and earlier at New York's private Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Dalton School.  He later attended Columbia University, though for only three semesters before dropping out to focus on his music career.
In January 1984, when Steve Jobs was visiting Manhattan, he attended a party that Yoko was throwing for him, and Jobs gave him one of the very first Macintosh computers.[tpl]cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|pages=180[/tpl]
His parents kick-started his musical career: his debut into the music world came at age  five, when he recited a story on his mother's 1981 album, Season of Glass. From childhood into his teen years, Sean continued to collaborate with his mother, contributing vocals and  receiving production credit on her solo albums It's Alright (I See Rainbows), Starpeace and Onobox.  At 16 Sean co-wrote the song "All I Ever Wanted" with Lenny Kravitz for his 1991 album Mama Said.  By 1995 Sean had formed the band IMA (with Sam Koppelman and Timo Ellis) to play alongside his mother on her album Rising.  Sean also made appearances in film, featured in the cast of Michael Jackson's 1988 Moonwalker and  portraying a teenager experiencing visions of various M. C. Escher paintings in Sony's 1990 promotional short-film Infinite Escher.

===Cibo Matto and Into The Sun===

In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto were invited by Ono to remix the song "Talking to the Universe" for a Rising remix EP Rising Mixes. They met Sean and invited him to join them on tour as a bass player. This eventually led to Sean's contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming a member of the group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP Super Relax. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of the Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Lennon has said:
Lennon's solo début Into the Sun, was released in 1998. A music video for "Home", a single from the album, was directed by Spike Jonze and enjoyed extended airplay on MTV. The album was produced by fellow Cibo Matto member Yuka Honda, who Lennon claimed was his inspiration for the album. They struck up a personal relationship as well as a creative one.
He would go on to tour (often backed by Cibo Matto) supporting Into the Sun. During this period he appeared on radio programs such as The Howard Stern Show and KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic. He later recalled promoting the album as a bitter experience due to the media focus on his family rather than his own music. In 1999, Sean's EP Half Horse, Half Musician was released featuring new tracks such as "Heart & Lung" and "Happiness" as well as remixes of songs from Into The Sun. Along with Half Horse Half Musician, 1999 saw the release of Cibo Matto's second album Stereo Type A. Sean stepped out of his traditional role as the group's bass player, this time playing a much wider range of instruments (such as drums, guitars and synthesizers). Despite being well received, Stereo Type A was the final Cibo Matto album and the group disbanded.
In 2000, Lennon contributed vocals to Del tha Funkee Homosapien (a single stanza on the Deltron 3030 track 'Memory Loss'), Handsome Boy Modeling School and Jurassic 5. In 2001 on national television, Sean performed several classics by The Beatles, "This Boy", "Across the Universe" and "Julia" alongside Robert Schwartzman, Rufus Wainwright and Moby for Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music. In the following years Sean faded out of the spotlight. However he collaborated with various bands and artists as a session musician and producer.

===Return and Friendly Fire===

After the demise of Grand Royal Records in 2001, Sean signed with Capitol Records, yet no solo material surfaced until February 2006, when "Dead Meat" was released as the first single from his new album, Friendly Fire. A promotional trailer for the CD/DVD package of Friendly Fire was leaked online in early 2006. The trailer featured scenes from the film version of the album, a DVD of music videos comprised into a film. The videos were actually screen tests for Coin Locker Babies, another project on which Lennon is working which became a cinematic counterpart to his new album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.musicbox-online.com/interviews/sean-lennon-05212007.html|title=Taking Friendly Fire with Sean Lennon|accessdate=May 23, 2007|year=2007|author=Parish, Matt|work=The Music Box[/tpl]
Friendly Fire was released in October 2006. The theme of the album is love and betrayal, and it is dedicated to the memory of a close friend who died. The night the album was released, Lennon made his first major television appearance in five years, performing "Dead Meat" live on the Late Show with David Letterman. Lennon has since appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Sharon Osbourne Show. When questioned about the eight-year gap between solo albums in interviews, Lennon expressed that he did not feel like a solo artist during those years and that he wanted to experience music anonymously without the spotlight on him.
Since the release of Friendly Fire, Lennon has toured extensively around the world and while in France, he remixed his song "Parachute" in collaboration with French artist -M-. The remix is entitled "L'éclipse"[tpl]cite web|url=http://leclipse.emi-artistes.com|title=Sean Lennon & -M- en duo|accessdate=May 23, 2007|year=2007|work=L'eclipse |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070522104558/http://leclipse.emi-artistes.com/  |archivedate = May 22, 2007[/tpl] and was featured as a bonus track on the French release of Friendly Fire.
While reestablishing himself as a solo artist, Lennon continued his work as a session musician and producer, lending his talent to the likes of Dopo Yume, Albert Hammond, Jr. (of The Strokes) and model/singer Irina Lazareanu.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/irina-lazareanu-way-more-karl-lagerfelds-muse|title=Irina Lazareanu: Way More Than Karl Lagerfeld's Muse[/tpl], The New York Observer In October 2007, Sean joined Mark Ronson in the BBC Electric Proms where he sang "Sail on, Sailor", as well as "We Can Work It Out" alongside Daniel Merriweather, and Tawiah.
Along with girlfriend Charlotte Kemp Muhl, Lennon started a record label, Chimera Music, and stepped into the world of film scores in 2009 with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead, directed by long-time friend and school mate Jordan GallandGoldstein, Greg. “Lennon to Score Undead”, Hollywood Reporter, February 21, 2008. In the same year, Lennon produced a second album on Chimera for his mother, "Between My Head and the Sky," by Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band. Lennon has again collaborated with friend Jordan Galland, as he contributed the score to Jordan Gallands 2012 film "Alter Egos", and he appears as the character "Electric Death."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nylonmag.com/?section=article&parid=7672 |title=The Insiders: Sean Lennon + Jordan Galland - Nylon Magazine |publisher=Nylonmag.com |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 24, 2012[/tpl]
