Sinhala (සිංහල [tpl]Unicode|siṁhala[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-si|ˈsiŋɦələ|[/tpl]), also known as Sinhalese [tpl]IPAc-en|s|ɪ|n|ə|ˈ|l|iː|z[/tpl],Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student’s Handbook, Edinburgh is the native language of the Sinhalese people, who make up the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka, numbering about 16 million. Sinhala is also spoken, as a second language by other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, totalling about 3 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/PDF/Population/p9p11%20Speaking.pdf |title=Census of Population and Housing 2001 |publisher=Statistics.gov.lk |accessdate=2013-11-16[/tpl] It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages. Sinhala is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka. Sinhala, along with Pali, played a major role in the development of Theravada Buddhist literature.
Sinhala has its own writing system, the Sinhala alphabet, which is a member of the Brahmic family of scripts, and a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script.
The oldest Sinhala Prakrit inscriptions found are from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE following the arrival of Bhuddhism in Sri Lanka,[tpl]cite book|last=Danesh Jain, George Cardona|title=Indo-Aryan Languages|publisher=Routledge|page=847[/tpl] the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century CE.
The closest relative of Sinhala is the language of the Maldives and Minicoy Island (India), Dhivehi.

==Etymology==

Sinhala ([tpl]IAST|Siṃhāla[/tpl]) is a Sanskrit term; the corresponding Middle Indic word is Sīhala; the actual Sinhala term is heḷa or (h)eḷu. The Sanskrit and the Middle Indic words have as their first element (siṃha and sīha) the word "lion" in the respective languages.[tpl]Cite journal| last=Caldwell | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Caldwell | title=A comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages | publisher=Trübner & Co. | place=London | year=1875 | postscript=.[/tpl], pt. 2 p. 86. According to legend, Sinhabahu or Sīhabāhu ("Lion-arms"), was the son of a Vanga princess and a lion. He killed his father and became king of Vanga. His son Vijaya would emigrate from north India to Lankā and become the progenitor of the Sinhala people. Taking into account linguistic and mythological evidence, we can assume that the first element of the name of the people means "lion".Geiger, Wilhelm: Culture of Ceylon in Mediaeval Times. 2nd edition, Stuttgart 1986. ISBN 3-515-04447-7. §21.
As for the second element la, local tradition connects it to the Sanskrit root lā- "to seize",Carter, Charles: A Sinhalese-English Dictionary. Reprint, New Delhi 1996. ISBN 81-206-1174-8. p678. as to translate it "lion-seizer" or "lion-killer", or to Sanskrit loha/Sinhala lē "blood", to have it mean "lion blood". From a linguistic point of view, however, neither interpretation is convincing, so that we can only safely say that the word Sinhala is somehow connected to a term meaning "lion".

==History==

According to the chronicle Mahavamsa, written in Pali, Prince Vijaya and his entourage merged with the native tribes known as Yakkha and Naga. In the following centuries, there was substantial immigration from Eastern India (Kalinga, Magadha)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/books/sinhala_history.htm |title=WWW Virtual Library Sri Lanka : Sri Lanka: A Short History of Sinhala Language |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16[/tpl] which led to an admixture of features of Eastern Prakrits.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]

===Stages of historical development===

The development of the Sinhala language is divided into four periods:

===Phonetic development===

The most important phonetic developments of the Sinhala language include

===Western vs. Eastern Prakrit features===

An example for a Western feature in Sinhala is the retention of initial /v/ which developed into /b/ in the Eastern languages (e.g. Sanskrit [tpl]Unicode|viṃśati[/tpl] "twenty", Sinhala visi-, Hindi bīs). An example of an Eastern feature is the ending -e for masculine nominative singular (instead of Western -o) in Sinhala Prakrit. There are several cases of vocabulary doublets, e.g. the words mässā ("fly") and mäkkā ("flea"), which both correspond to Sanskrit [tpl]Unicode|makṣikā[/tpl] but stem from two regionally different Prakrit words macchiā and makkhikā (as in Pali).

==Ecology==

===Substratum influence in Sinhala===

According to Geiger, Sinhala has features that set it apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of the parent stock of the Vedda language.[tpl]Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=4[/tpl] Sinhala has many words that are only found in Sinhala, or shared between Sinhala and Vedda and not etymologically derivable from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan.  Common examples are kola for leaf in Sinhala and Vedda, dola for pig in Sinhala and offering in Vedda. Other common words are rera for wild duck, and gala for stones (in toponyms used throughout the island).[tpl]Harvnb|Van Driem|2002|page=230[/tpl] There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhala, such as olluva for head, kakula for leg, bella for neck and kalava for thighs, that are derived from pre-Sinhala languages of Sri Lanka.[tpl]Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=45[/tpl] The author of the oldest Sinhala grammar, Sidatsangarava, written in the 13th century CE, recognized a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. The grammar lists naramba (to see) and kolamba (ford or harbor) as belonging to an indigenous source. Kolamba is the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.[tpl]Harvnb|Indrapala|2007|page=70[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Gair|1998|page=5[/tpl]

===Affinities to neighbouring languages===

In addition to many Tamil loanwords, several phonetic and grammatical features present in neighbouring Dravidian languages, setting today's spoken Sinhala apart from its Northern Indo-Aryan siblings, bear witness to the close interactions with Dravidian speakers. However, formal Sinhala is more similar to Pali and medieval Sinhala. Some of the features that may be traced to Dravidian influence are
"I know that it is new."
"I do not know whether it is new."

===Foreign influences===

As a result of centuries of colonial rule, contemporary Sinhala contains some Portuguese, Dutch and English loanwords.

===Influences on other languages===

Macanese language or Macau Creole (known as Patuá to its speakers) is a creole language derived mainly from Malay, Sinhala, Cantonese, and Portuguese, which was originally spoken by the Macanese community of the Portuguese colony of Macau. It is now spoken by a few families in Macau and in the Macanese diaspora.
The language developed first mainly among the descendants of Portuguese settlers who often married women from Malacca and Sri Lanka rather than from neighboring China, so the language had strong Malay and Sinhala influence from the beginning.

==Numerals==

Sinhala shares many features common to other Indo-European languages. Shared vocabulary includes the numbers up to ten:

==Accents and dialects==

Sinhala spoken in the Southern province of Sri Lanka (Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts) uses several words that are not found elsewhere in the country; this is also the case for the Central province, North-Central province and south-eastern part (Uva & the surrounding area). For native speakers all dialects are mutually intelligible, and they might not even realize that the differences are significant.[tpl]cite web|title=Sinhalese Language|url=http://www.alsglobal.net/languages/sinhalese.php|publisher=American Language Services|accessdate=20 August 2011[/tpl]
The language of the Veddah people resembles Sinhala to a great extent, although it has a large number of words which cannot be traced to another language.  Rodiya people use another dialect of Sinhala.

==Diglossia==

In Sinhala there is distinctive diglossia, as in many languages of South Asia. The literary language and the spoken language differ from each other in many aspects. The written language is used for all forms of literary texts but also orally at formal occasions (public speeches, TV and radio news broadcasts, etc.), whereas the spoken language is used as the language of communication in everyday life (see also Sinhala slang and colloquialism). As a rule the literary language uses more Sanskrit-based words.
The most important difference between the two varieties is the lack of inflected verb forms in the spoken language.
The situation is analogous to one where Middle or even Old English would be the written language in Great Britain. The children are taught the written language at school almost like a foreign language.
Sinhala language also has diverse slang. Some is regarded as taboo and most is frowned upon as non-scholarly.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2007[/tpl]

==Writing system==

The Sinhala alphabet, Sinhala hodiya, is based on ancient Brahmi, as are most Indo-Aryan scripts. In design, the Sinhala alphabet is what is called an "abugida" or "alphasyllabary", meaning that consonants are written with letters while vowels are indicated with diacritics (pilla) on those consonants, unlike English where both consonants and vowels are full letters, or Urdu where vowels need not be written at all. Also, when no diacritic is used, an "inherent vowel", either [tpl]IPA|/a/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/ə/[/tpl], is understood, depending on the position of the consonant within the word. For example, the letter ක k on its own indicates ka, either [tpl]IPA|/ka/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/kə/[/tpl]. The various vowels are written කා kā, කැ kä, කෑ kǟ (after the consonant), කි ki, කී kī (above the consonant), කු ku, කූ kū (below the consonant), කෙ ke, කේ kē (before the consonant), කො ko, කෝ kō (surrounding the consonant). There are also a few diacritics for consonants, such as r. For simple [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] without a vowel, a vowel-cancelling diacritic (virama) called hal kirīma is used: ක් k. Several of these diacritics occur in two forms, which depend on the shape of the consonant letter. Vowels also have independent letters but these are only used at the beginning of words where there is no preceding consonant to add a diacritic to.
The complete alphabet consist of 54 letters, 18 for vowels and 36 for consonants. However, only 36 (12 vowels and 24 consonants) are required for writing colloquial spoken Sinhala (suddha Sinhala). The rest indicate sounds that have gotten lost in the course of linguistic change, such as the aspirates, are restricted to Sanskrit and Pali loan words.
Sinhala is written from left to right and the Sinhala character set (the Sinhala script) is only used for this one language.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] The alphabetic sequence is similar to those of other Brahmic scripts:

==Phonology==

==Morphology==

===Nominal morphology===

The main features marked on Sinhala nouns are case, number, definiteness and animacy.

====Cases====

Sinhala distinguishes several cases. Next to the cross-linguistically rather common nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and ablative, there are also less common cases like the instrumental. The exact number of these cases depends on the exact definition of cases one wishes to employ. For instance, the endings for the animate instrumental and locative cases, atiŋ and laᵑgə, are also independent words meaning "with the hand" and "near" respectively, which is why they are not regarded to be actual case endings by some scholars. Depending on how far an independent word has progressed on a grammaticalization path, scholars will see it as a case marker or not.
The brackets with most of the vowel length symbols indicate the optional shortening of long vowels in certain unstressed syllables.

====Number marking====

In Sinhala animate nouns, the plural is marked with -o(ː), a long consonant plus -u, or with -la(ː). Most of the inanimates mark the plural by subtractive morphology. Loan words from English mark the singular with ekə, and do not mark the plural. This can be interpreted as singulative.
On the left hand side of the table, plurals are longer than singulars. On the right hand side, it is the other way round, with the exception of paːrə "street". Note that +animate lexemes are mostly in the classes on the left-hand side, while -animate lexemes are most often in the classes on the right hand.

====Indefinite article====

The indefinite article is -ek for animates and -ak for inanimates. The indefinite article exists only in the singular, where its absence marks definiteness. In the plural, (in)definiteness does not receive special marking.

===Verbal morphology===

Sinhala distinguishes three conjugation classes.
Spoken Sinhala does not mark person, number or gender on the verb (literary Sinhala does). In other words there is no subject–verb agreement.

==Syntax==

==Semantics==

===Discourse===

Example: The sentence [tpl]IPA-si|koɦed̪ə ɡie|[/tpl], literally "where went", can mean "where did I/you/he/she/we... go".
