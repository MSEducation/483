In May 2009, 300 guests and staff members at the Metropark Hotel Wanchai in Wan Chai were quarantined, suspected of being infected or in contact with the H1N1 virus during the 2009 swine flu outbreak. A 25 year old Mexican man who had stayed at the hotel was later found to have the viral infection. He had traveled to Hong Kong from Mexico via Shanghai.Cheng, Jonathan; Ye, Juliet; Stein, Peter, "Hong Kong Orders Quarantine of Hotel", Wall Street Journal, May 2, 2009Dasgupta, Saibal, "Swine flu scare: China puts 460 in isolation", The Times of India, 3 May 2009.

Today Wan Chai is sometimes described as the heart of the city, representing the epitome of the Hong Kong lifestyle: there is a well-established arts centre, the large exhibition and conference complexes, luxury apartments, five-star and non-five-star hotels, shopping malls, metropolitan office towers and a large government building cluster - along with a multitude of home decoration shops, bars and Mahjong centres filled with gamblers. The largest Muslim mosque in Hong Kong is located in Wan Chai, next to a number of cemeteries for several different faiths. Five minutes away from the noisy polluted streets is Bowen Drive, one of the more popular places for jogging.  Top law-makers, movie stars, and government officials can be seen jogging there.

==Entertainment and shopping==

The numerous bars and strip joints in the red-light district part of Wan Chai are still popular with tourists and visiting US sailors - who arrive on Fenwick Pier. Fenwick Pier was once the location of the only McDonald's that served alcohol in Hong Kong, but it was closed in 2004 and replaced by an up-market restaurant. Johnston Road and Queen's Road East are the two major streets in the area. Export clothing shops line the streets of Johnston and Luard Road and offer some of the best value in Hong Kong. Queen's Road East has many stores selling Chinese style wooden furniture whilst Spring Garden Lane and Tai Wo Street are also lined with stalls, but for vegetables, fruit and household items. Tai Yuen Street is famous for shops and stalls selling various kinds of toys.
