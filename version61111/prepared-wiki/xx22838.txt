The University of Virginia (often abbreviated as UVA, UVa, or Virginia) is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819.  UVA's initial Board of Visitors included former Presidents of the United States Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Monroe owned the initial site of the University, which was mostly farmland. His law office and farmhouse are now the site of Brown College at Monroe Hill, a residential college at UVA.HistArch An Account of James Monroe's Land Holdings Retrieved 25 January 2012
UVA is the only university campus in the United States that is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/us/|title=United States of America|accessdate=February 23, 2013[/tpl] designating Monticello and the Academical Village of Thomas Jefferson. UVA's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Virginia Cavaliers. They compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

==History==

In 1802, while serving as President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new university would be "on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet".Alf J. Mapp, Jr., Thomas Jefferson: Passionate Pilgrim, p. 19. Virginia was already home to The College of William & Mary, but Jefferson lost confidence in his alma mater, partly because of its religious stances and lack of courses in the sciences.Phillips Russell, Jefferson, Champion of the Free Mind, p. 335. Although Jefferson flourished under the tutelage of College of William & Mary professors William Small and George Wythe, his concerns with the College became great enough by 1800 that he wrote: "We have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it".Circular of Information, State Board of Education, United States Bureau of Education. Washington (State) Superintendent of Public Instruction. Published by State Board of Education, 1888. p. 48.  Thus, he began planning a university more aligned with his educational ideals.Higher Education in Transition: A History of American Colleges and Universities by John Seiler Brubacher, Willis Rudy. Published by Transaction Publishers, 1997.  p. 148
Farmland just outside Charlottesville was purchased from James Monroe by the Board of Visitors as Central College in 1817. The school laid its first building's cornerstone in late 1817, and the Commonwealth of Virginia chartered the new university on January 25, 1819. John Hartwell Cocke collaborated with James Madison, Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the University. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction.[tpl]cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:179274/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8139-0904-X |page=3[/tpl] The University's first classes met on March 7, 1825.[tpl]cite book|last=Bruce |first=Philip Alexander |title=History of the University of Virginia, vol.

Other universities of the day allowed only three choices of specialization: Medicine, Law, and Religion. Under Jefferson's guidance, the University of Virginia became the first in the United States to allow specializations in such diverse fields as Astronomy, Architecture, Botany, Philosophy, and Political Science. An even more controversial direction was taken for the new university based on a daring vision that higher education should be completely separated from religious doctrine. One of the largest construction projects in North America up to that time, the new Grounds were centered upon a library (then housed in the Rotunda) rather than a church – further distinguishing it from peer universities of the United States, most of which were still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular religion or another.Joseph J. Ellis, American Sphinx, p. 283. Jefferson even went so far as to ban the teaching of Theology altogether. In a letter to Thomas Cooper in October 1814, Jefferson stated, "a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution" and, true to form, the University has never had a Divinity school; it was established independent of any religious sect. 
The School of Engineering and Applied Science opened in 1836, making it the first engineering school in the United States to be attached to a comprehensive university.
Jefferson was intimately involved in the university, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students until his death. So taken with the import of what he viewed the University's foundations and potential to be, and counting it amongst his greatest accomplishments, Jefferson insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his presidency and national accomplishments in favor of being remembered for the newly established university.
In 1826, poet Edgar Allan Poe enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/rotunda/prefire/poe.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe at the university|author=  |work= |publisher=University of Virginia Library |accessdate=September 18, 2012[/tpl] The Raven Society, an organization named after Poe's most famous poem, continues to maintain 13 West Range, the room Poe inhabited during the single semester he attended the University (he left because of financial difficulties).[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/28/edgar-allan-poes-universi_n_854897.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe's University of Virginia Room to Undergo Renovation|author=Sampson, Zinie Chan  |date=April 28, 2011  |work= |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=September 18, 2012[/tpl]
At the onset of the American Civil War, the University of Virginia was the largest in the Southern United States and second nationwide only to Harvard University in its scope.Encyclopædia Britannica, University of Virginia, retrieved June 20, 2006. Unlike many other colleges in the South, the university was kept open throughout the conflict, an especially remarkable feat with its home state being the site of more battles than any other. In March 1865, Union General George Armstrong Custer marched troops into Charlottesville, where upon faculty and community leaders convinced him to spare the university. Though Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational routines.
Jefferson had originally decided that the University of Virginia would have no President. Rather, this power was to be shared by a Rector and a Board of Visitors. As the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks that had become necessary to support the growing University.Encyclopedia Virginia President Edwin Alderman "By the turn of the 20th century the administrative affairs had grown to such an extent that the old form of government became too cumbersome. The appointment of Alderman brought a new era of progressivism to the university and service to Virginia." Retrieved 25 January 2012 In 1904, Edwin Alderman resigned as President of Tulane University to take the same position at the University of Virginia. As the university's first president, he embarked on a number of reforms for both the university and the state of Virginia's public educational systems in general. A reform specific to the University of Virginia was one of the first school-sponsored financial aid programs in all of higher learning[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] and, though primitive by today's standards, it included a loan provision for needy men who were unable to pay.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Initially controversial and opposed by many at what had become a very traditional school, Alderman's progressive ideas stood the test of time. He remains the longest-tenured president in the university's history, having served for twenty-six years until his death in 1931. Alderman Library is named in his honor.
The University of Virginia began the process of integration even before the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision mandated school desegregation for all grade levels, when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university's law school in 1950.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/100yearslawn/HarrisonI/Road.htmlhttp:// |title=The Road to Desegregation: Jackson, NAACP, and Swanson|author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA like other southern schools continued to resist full integration until well into the 1960s.
The university first admitted a few selected women to graduate studies in the late 1890s and to certain programs such as nursing and education in the 1920s and 1930s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/coeducation1.htmlhttp:// |title=Breaking and Making Tradition: Women at U VA|author= |work=|publisher=University of Virginia Library |accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] In 1944, Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates. In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational, and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.University of Mary Washington: History and Development of the University. Women were officially allowed to matriculate at UVA in 1970 after a court suit prompted the Board of Visitors to adopt full coeducation over a two-year period.  In 1970, the first class of 450 undergraduate women entered UVA (39 percent), while the number of men admitted remained constant. By 2003 women comprised 55 percent of the undergraduate student body. The University of Virginia established its first and only branch campus at Wise, Virginia, in 1954. The UVA Wise campus currently enrolls 2,000 students.
In 2004, resulting from a stark decrease in state support, the University of Virginia became the first public university in the United States to receive more of its funding from private sources than from the state with which it is associated. Thanks to a Charter initiative that passed the Virginia General Assembly and was signed into law by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2005,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/restructuring/legislation.html |title=Legislation |work=Restructuring Higher Education |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] the university—and any other public universities in the state that choose to do so (currently Virginia Tech and William & Mary) – will have greater autonomy over its own affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/restructuring/legislation.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |work=Restructuring Higher Education |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl] The university was subject to an audit by the state, which found that while the school met most of the goals established by the deal, the number of minority students enrolled in the university declined.[tpl]cite news|last=Wang|first=Marian|title=Breaking Away: Top Public Universities Push for 'Autonomy' From States|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/public-universities-autonomy-pro-publica_n_4058962.html?ir=College|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2013-10-07[/tpl]
Also in 2004, at the 100th anniversary of Alderman becoming President, UVA announced the AccessUVa financial aid program. This program guarantees the University will meet 100% of a U.S. student's demonstrated need. It also provides low-income students (up to 200% of the poverty line – as of 2009, about $44,000 for a family of four) with full grants to cover all of their educational needs, and it caps the level of need-based loans for all other students. This program was the first to guarantee full grants to students of low-income families at any public university in the United States. Today, minority students are particularly successful at the University of Virginia. According to the Fall 2005 issue of Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,Comparing Black Enrollments at the Public Ivies. The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. 2005 UVA "has the highest black student graduation rate of the Public Ivies at 86 percent". The journal goes on to state that "by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates".
In 2010 the University welcomed Teresa A. Sullivan as the University's first woman President.de Vise, Daniel, "Teresa Sullivan Is First Female President to Lead University of Virginia" Washington Post, January 19, 2010. Two years later, during the Spring of 2012, the first woman Rector Helen Dragas decided to remove President Sullivan. Instead of convening the Board of Visitors to discuss firing the President, Ms. Dragas secretly lobbied Board members in one-on-one phone calls, and then surprised President Sullivan in her office on June 8, 2012, with a demand for her resignation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/magazine/teresa-sullivan-uva-ouster.html?pagewanted=all |title=Anatomy of a Campus Coup|author=Rice, Andrew |date=September 11, 2012 |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=17 September 2012[/tpl] Rector Dragas convened a three member Executive Committee meeting to accept the forced resignation, and then required Sullivan's subordinates to report directly to the Rector's office, effectively removing President Sullivan from any remaining management role.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/104355/ouster-aftermath-timeline-uva-tumult |title=Sullivan Oustermath: A Timeline of UVA in Tumult|author=Spencer, Hawes|date=June 28, 2012 |work= |publisher=The Hook |accessdate=17 September 2012[/tpl] The resignation elicited strong protests, including a faculty Senate vote of no confidence in the Board of Visitors and Rector Dragas,[tpl]cite news |author=Daily Progress Staff |title= UVa Faculty Senate issues vote of no confidence in rector, Board of Visitors|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/uva-faculty-senate-issues-vote-of-no-confidence-in-rector/article_456d9a37-0930-5be6-9b95-8c47947cdcf3.html |quote= |work=The Daily Progress |date=June 14, 2012 |accessdate=2013-05-22 [/tpl] and demands from the student government for an explanation for Sullivan's ouster.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2012/jun/15/uva-student-council-seeks-full-explanation-ouster-ar-1990754/ |title=U.Va.

==The Grounds (Campus)==

Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique Jeffersonian architecture. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, The New York Times said that the design of the University of Virginia "was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century".Architectural Record," 4 (January–March 1895), pp. 351–353  In the United States Bicentennial issue of their AIA Journal, the American Institute of Architects called it "the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years".AIA Journal, 65 (July 1976), p. 91 Today, the University of Virginia remains an architectural landmark and popular tourist destination. In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the University as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States."America's most beautiful college campuses" Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)
Jefferson's original architectural design revolves around the "Academical Village", and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of The Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, The Range, and the larger University surrounding it. The principal building of the design, The Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the University. It is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the model for many similar designs of "centralized green areas" at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area.  The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson's ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.
Most notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by Rotunda-like buildings built at: Duke University in 1892; Johns Hopkins University in 1902; Rice University in 1910; Dallas Hall, the central building at Southern Methodist University (1912); Peabody College of Vanderbilt University in 1915; the Green at the University of Delaware in 1916; Killian Court at MIT in 1916 (which was founded by William Barton Rogers, who immediately prior had been a Natural Philosophy professor at the University of Virginia for 19 years); the "Grand Auditorium" of Tsinghua University in Beijing built in 1917; the campus of Yale Divinity School (the Sterling Quad, 1932); and the new grounds of the University's own Darden School of Business (designed by Robert A.M. Stern).
Flanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called "serpentine" because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility. Frank E. Grizzard, Jr., a former scholar at the University, has written the definitive book on the original academic buildings at the University.Grizzard, Frank E.Documentary history of the construction of the buildings at the University of Virginia, 1817–1828. University of Virginia Libraries. 1996–2002.
Jefferson financed the building of the University through personal loans from James Monroe and General John Hartwell Cocke II. Monroe, Cocke, and Jefferson each put up a third of the money to procure the land and build the initial buildings.  Gen. Cocke was a General in the War of 1812, a local plantation owner, and friend of Thomas Jefferson.  He owned Bremo Plantation, located southwest of Charlottesville near where Bremo Bluff, Virginia, is today. These loans were never repaid by Jefferson.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
On October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the unfortunate help of overzealous faculty member William "Reddy" Echols, who attempted to save it by throwing roughly 100 pounds (45 kg) of dynamite into the main fire in the hopes that the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson's own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. (Perhaps ironically, one of the University's main honors student programs is named for him.) University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect Stanford White to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interior—making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a President's House. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were now moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.
The White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge "quadrangle", albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the University of Cambridge or University of Oxford.
In concert with the United States Bicentennial in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976.
Though student enrollment has grown well beyond the original Lawn facilities, the University further distinguishes itself by extending the original Academical Village ideal with two exclusively First-year (freshman) living areas: The Old Dorms (Bonnycastle, Dabney, Echols, Emmet, Hancock, Humphreys, Kent, Lefevre, Metcalf, Page), located on McCormick Road, and The New Dorms (Cauthen, Courtenay, Dunglison, Fitzhugh, Kellogg, Balz-Dobie, Tuttle-Dunnington, Shannon, Watson-Webb, Woody), adjacent to Scott Stadium, both situated wholly on Grounds and considered integral to establishing peer discourse. The common bonding experience proves such a fixture to the University experience, students often identify themselves by individual "Old" or "New" dormitory. First-year living areas also include Hereford College, International Residential College, and Brown College at Monroe Hill.
In 2001, John Kluge donated [tpl]convert|7,378|acre|km2[/tpl] of additional lands to the University. Kluge desired the core of the land to be developed by the University, and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. A large part of the gift was soon sold to musician Dave Matthews, of the Dave Matthews Band, to be utilized in an organic farming project. It is unknown what the University will do with its "core" portion of the land.
The Virginia Department of Transportation maintains the roads through the University grounds as State Route 302.[tpl]PDFlink|Virginia Route Index|239 KB[/tpl], revised July 1, 2003
The University, together with Jefferson's home at Monticello, is a World Heritage Site, one of only three modern sites so listed in the 50 states, the others being the Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall. It was the first collegiate campus worldwide to be awarded the designation.

===Student housing===

The bulk of University housing serves first year students. As of August 2013, there are two main areas for first year housing and another dormitory complex to maintain enrollment growth during ongoing dormitory construction. The first and oldest area is the site of the McCormick Road Dormitories, often referred to as "Old Dorms." The dorms were built after World War II to accommodate a national growth in college enrollment, due in part to the G.I. Bill."http://www.arch.virginia.edu/housinghistory/Grounds/McCormickRoad.htm." McCormick Road Dormitories. Retrieved on August 31, 2013. Although older and without modern amenities like central air conditioning, the dorms are located closer to Central Grounds and the rooms are slightly larger. The houses that make up the McCormick Road Dormitories are Bonnycastle, Dabney, Echols, Emmet, Hancock, Humphreys, Kent, Lefevre, Metcalf, and Page."http://www.virginia.edu/housing/options.php?id=mccormick&type=fy." McCormick Road Residence Area. Retrieved on August 31, 2013. All of the dorms feature hall-style living.
The other main area for first year housing is the Alderman Road Dormitories. Although the original houses were built in the 1960s and featured suite-style living, the area was referred to as "New Dorms". Since then, the University has embarked on a project to replace the structures with newer dorms that will facilitate a growth in enrollment and provide incoming first years with modern amenities."http://www.virginia.edu/housing/projects.php?id=alderman." Alderman Road Replacement Project. Retrieved on August 31, 2013. As of August 2013, the University has demolished eleven of the original structures and completed five larger dormitories to take their places. The newest dorms are Balz-Dobie, Watson-Webb, Lile-Maupin, Tuttle-Dunnington, and Shannon. Additionally, Kellogg was completed in 2008 and served as a model for the Alderman Road Replacement Project. Cauthen and Woody were added to the area as well during the 1990s. All of the newest dorms feature hall-style living, unlike their predecessors.
Casa Bolivar, named in honor of Simon Bolivar, houses about two dozen upper class undergraduates students, providing them with an atmosphere to improve their Spanish and to earn one academic credit in the process. It is located on Jefferson Park Avenue, between la Maison Française and the Shea House.
Due to the ongoing construction, the University has converted the Gooch-Dillard upperclassmen dormitories into first year housing. These two houses are suite-style, where each suite holds up to six or seven students. Gooch-Dillard is the only housing that features permanent triples, although sparingly. Gooch-Dillard is farthest from Central Grounds, but is close to a smaller dining hall called "Runk".
Upperclassmen can apply for on-grounds housing as well, although their options are limited. The chances of receiving a housing assignment diminish as students advance into later years. Second years will almost certainly have on-grounds housing if they choose to apply. Upperclassmen can be assigned to Lambeth, Bice, Faulkner, Copeley, Johnson, Malone, and Weedon. Lambeth is made up of on-grounds apartments for groups of four or six students and is closest to Central Grounds. Near the new South Lawn Commons area, Bice is a single apartment building that also offers units for four or six students. Faulkner and Copeley are far removed from Central Grounds, sitting on newer University property that is generally referred to as "North Grounds". Lastly, Johnson, Malone, And Weedon (JMW) are dormitories that were created along with the Hereford Residential College. They are behind Gooch-Dillard and are somewhat far from Central Grounds.

===Admissions statistics===

For the Class of 2017, the University of Virginia received 29,005 applications, accepting 8,528, for an acceptance rate of 29 percent.

The University has seen steady increases in the applicant pool throughout the past decade. For example, the Class of 2011 received a then-record 18,013 applications. The University saw increased interest from various groups of students, as applications rose by 13 percent for African American applicants, 20 percent for Asian Americans, 16 percent for Hispanic Americans, and 26 percent for international students. The University enrolled 70 more first-years than it did the previous year, as it continued to expand the scope of the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

==Academics==

Degrees from the University of Virginia must be earned academically – there has never been an honorary degree offered.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/records/95gradrec/greg.html#honor | title = Chapter 4: University Regulations: Honorary Degrees | year = 1995 |accessdate=2006-05-07 |author = Rector and Visitors of The University of Virginia | publisher = Rector and Visitors of The University of Virginia[/tpl] "The University of Virginia does not award honorary degrees. In conjunction with the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, the University presents the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Architecture and the Thomas Jefferson Award in Law each spring. The awards, recognizing excellence in two fields of interest to Jefferson, constitute the University's highest recognition of scholars outside the University." The policy was instituted by Thomas Jefferson. When the Virginia Legislature's Committee of Schools and Colleges was reconsidering it in 1845, then-U.Va. professor and future Massachusetts Institute of Technology founder William Barton Rogers wrote, "The legislators of the University have, we think, wisely made their highest academic honor – that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia – the genuine test of diligent and successful literary training, and, disdaining such literary almsgiving, have firmly barred the door against the demands of spurious merit and noisy popularity." When MIT was chartered in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1861, Rogers carried the U.Va. policy through to the new institute.[tpl]cite web | author =  | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/commdegrees.html | title = No honorary degrees is an MIT tradition going back to ...

Faculty were originally housed in the Academical Village among the students, serving as both instructors and advisors, continuing on to include the McCormick Road Old Dorms, though this has been phased out in favor of undergraduate student resident advisors (RAs). Several of the faculty, however, continue the University tradition of living on Grounds, either on the Lawn in the various Pavilions, or as fellows at one of three residential colleges (Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, and the International Residential College).
Some of the University of Virginia's faculty have become well-known national personalities during their time in Charlottesville.

==Athletics==

The University of Virginia's athletics program competes in Division I (and the Football Bowl Subdivision for football), and has been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference since 1953. The current Athletic Director at Virginia is Craig Littlepage. The Virginia Cavaliers, also called "Wahoos" or "Hoos", have won 21 recognized national championships, 16 of them since 1980. Virginia has won multiple national titles in seven different sports, including four men's sports (lacrosse, 7; soccer, 6; boxing, 2; and tennis, 1) and three women's sports (lacrosse, 3; rowing, 2; and cross country, 2). It also holds a national championship in track and field. The men's college basketball team has won either the ACC regular season (1981, 1982, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2013) or ACC Tournament (1976) titles seven times and has been to the Final Four twice, while the women's squad has been three times.
The football team won a share of the ACC Championship in both 1989 and 1995 (both before the conference had a championship game). After never reaching a bowl before 1984, the team has played in 17 bowl games since. The program is also notable for its recent high draft picks in the National Football League, including the #4 overall pick of 2006, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, and the #2 overall pick of 2008, Chris Long.  The program is a party to three major rivalry games in the conference: the longest series in the ACC, the South's Oldest Rivalry with North Carolina; the Commonwealth Cup with Virginia Tech (part of the greater Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry); and the Beltway Brawl with Maryland. While the Cavaliers have played UNC more times (114) than any other rival, all of these opponents – North Carolina, Virginia Tech, and Maryland – each list Virginia as their schools' longest-standing football rivals.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
In 2006, the men's lacrosse team won its fourth NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship, and sixth including the pre-tournament era. In the title game, Virginia defeated UMass 15–7 in front of a record crowd of 47,062 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, the first lacrosse crowd to surpass the crowd size of the men's basketball Final Four and the largest crowd to witness any NCAA Championship during the year.[tpl]cite news | title = Virginia Claims National Title, and a Victory for Lacrosse | publisher = The New York Times | date = May 30, 2006 | page = D5[/tpl] The team finished the season a perfect 17–0, the best record in NCAA lacrosse history. Five years later the Cavaliers won the 2011 championship behind eventual Tewaaraton Trophy winner Steele Stanwick, bringing their tournament era championship total to 5, which puts them fourth amongst NCAA Division I teams and first amongst ACC Teams.
The new John Paul Jones Arena opened in the fall of 2006 for men's and women's basketball. It seats 14,593 fans, making it the third largest on-campus basketball facility in the ACC and the largest arena not located in a major metropolitan area. The arena's inaugural year witnessed the Virginia men's basketball team's first place finish in the ACC.
Davenport Field, where the UVa baseball team plays, is also new, opening in 2002. In Brian O'Connor's first 4 seasons at the helm after being made the head baseball coach in July 2003, the team has averaged 44 wins per year and become a nationally ranked power. The team has led the ACC in team ERA for four consecutive years. In 2009, the baseball team won a place in the College World Series for the first time.
The soccer teams are also national powers, with men's soccer having won 6 national championships to date including its most recent in December 2009. The women's team is regularly ranked in the top 10 nationally. The teams play their home matches at Klöckner Stadium, the largest soccer stadium in the ACC. The men's team has been invited to the NCAA Tournament for 26 consecutive years and made the College Cup many times. Former Coach Bruce Arena has coached the U.S. national team and currently coaches the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer.
The Aquatics and Fitness Center (webcam) has been popular among University students for working out and swimming since its opening in Fall 1996, and it is also where the Swimming & Diving teams compete in home meets. The men's swimming and diving team won 8 consecutive ACC Championships between 1999 and 2006. The women's swimming team won its fourth consecutive ACC Championship on February 19, 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/021911aaa.html |title=Virginia Rallies To Clinch Fourth Consecutive Title At 2011 ACC Women's Swimming & Diving Championship – The Official Athletic Site of the Atlantic Coast Conference |publisher=Theacc.com |date=2011-02-19 |accessdate=2012-08-10[/tpl]
Also winning consecutive ACC titles has been the men's tennis team, which has won 4 consecutive regular season ACC Championships. Playing their home matches at the Sheridan Snyder Tennis Center, the men's tennis team had their best season ever in 2007, finishing with a 30–4 record and a #2 national ranking.  Somdev Devvarman became the first ACC player in conference history to win the NCAA Singles Championship, which he won in two consecutive years. In addition, the tennis team beat Ohio State for the 2008 National Indoor Tennis Championships, 4–1.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Now that Virginia Tech has joined the ACC, the Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry has been strengthened across a number of sports. This rivalry between the University and its larger neighbor to the southwest is followed statewide.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] UVA's athletic teams have bested the Hokies through the years in many of the major sports. The two universities also faced off in the Commonwealth Challenge between 2005 and 2007, with the Cavaliers routing the Hokies in each Challenge: 14.5 to 7.5 in 2005–2006 and 14 to 8 in 2006–2007. The competition was then dropped out of sensitivity following the Virginia Tech massacre.

===Fight song===

The Cavalier Song is the University of Virginia's fight song. The song was a result of a contest held in 1923 by the University. The Cavalier Song, with lyrics by Lawrence Haywood Lee, Jr., and music by Fulton Lewis, Jr., was selected as the winner.Traditions – University of Virginia Cavaliers Official Athletic Site – VirginiaSports.com Generally the second half of the song is played during sporting events. Until the 2008 football season, the entire fight song could be heard during the Cavalier Marching Band's entrance at home football games.

==Student life==

Student life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the University is referred to as "the Grounds". Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years in order to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a never-ending process, rather than one to be completed within four years. Also, students do not "graduate" from the University; instead, they "take" their degrees. Professors are traditionally addressed as "Mr." or "Ms." instead of "Doctor" (although medical doctors are the exception and are called "Doctor") in deference to Thomas Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title.
In 2005, the University was named "Hottest for Fitness" by Newsweek magazine,[tpl]cite news | title = America's 25 Hot Schools | publisher = Newsweek |date=August 2004 (2005 edition) | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/[/tpl] due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, situated across the street from the Alderman Dorms.
The University of Virginia sent more workers to the Peace Corps in 2006 and 2008 than any other "medium-sized" university in the United States. Volunteerism at the University is centered in Madison House which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, and an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville, rather than allowing it to be discarded.
A number of secret societies at the University, most notably the Seven Society, Z Society, and IMP Society, have operated for decades, leaving their painted marks on University buildings. Other significant secret societies include Eli Banana, T.I.L.K.A., the Purple Shadows (who commemorate Jefferson's birthday shortly after dawn on the Lawn each April 13), The Sons of Liberty, and the 21 Society. Not all the secret societies keep their membership unknown, but even those who don't hide their identities generally keep most of their good works and activities far from the public eye.
The student life building on the University of Virginia is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups. Student Council, the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6 p.m. in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or "StudCo", also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the University Programs Council and Class Councils. Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper The Declaration, The Cavalier Daily, and the Consortium of University Publications.
Student Societies have existed on grounds since the early 19th Century. The Jefferson Literary and Debating Society, founded in 1825, is the second oldest Greek-Lettered organization in the nation (the oldest being the Phi Beta Kappa honor fraternity). It continues to meet every Friday at 7:29 PM in Jefferson Hall.  The Washington Literary Society and Debating Union also meets every week, and the two organizations often engage in a friendly rivalry. In the days before social fraternities existed and intercollegiate athletics became popular, these Societies were often the focal point of social activity on grounds. Several fraternities were later founded at the University of Virginia including Pi Kappa Alpha (March 1, 1868) and Kappa Sigma (December 10, 1869). Many of these fraternities are located on Rugby Road.
A national publication's survey recently revealed that UVA's students give their library system higher marks than students at any other school in the United States. The best-known library is Alderman Library for the humanities and social sciences, which contains 10 floors of stacks with many useful study nooks hidden among them. UVA's renowned Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library features one of the premier collections of American Literature in the country as well as two copies of the original printing of the Declaration of Independence. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English graduate student, discovered an unpublished Robert Frost poem from 1918. Clemons Library, next to Alderman, is a popular study spot. Hundreds of students can be found gathered on its various quiet floors on any given night. Clark Hall, home of the Science & Engineering Library, also scores high marks. One of the notable features of Clark Hall is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law. The murals were finished and set in place in 1934."Clark Hall Named to Virginia Landmarks Registry," UVa Today, July 10, 2008 [tpl]As of|2006[/tpl], the University and Google were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.
As at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students. Concerns particularly arose about a past trend of seniors consuming excessive alcohol during the day of the last home football game. President Casteen announced a $2.5 million donation from Anheuser-Busch to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006. A spokesman said: "the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students". However, based on ratings of sex, sports, and nightlife, the college was ranked at number one in Playboy's 2012 list of Top 10 Party Schools.

===Student safety===

While Charlottesville, which typically registers zero to three murders per year, is generally considered a safe city, students have been involved on both sides of homicides in recent history.

===Student events===

One of the largest events at the University of Virginia is called Springfest. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert and various inflatables and games.
Another popular event is Foxfield, a steeplechase and social gathering that takes place nearby in Albemarle County in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia and neighboring colleges.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/24000_plus_descend_on_foxfield_for_annual_steeplechase_social_gathering/20967/ |work=Daily Progress |location=Charlottesville |date=2008-04-27 |last=Borden |first=Jeremy |title=24,000-plus descend on Foxfield for annual steeplechase, social gathering [/tpl]

==Honor system==

 
   HONOR PLEDGE 
 On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.

The University of Virginia has an honor code, formally known as the Honor System.[tpl]cite web | title = The Honor Committee | publisher = University of Virginia | url = http://www.virginia.edu/honor/ | date = 2006-12-11 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 [/tpl] The Honor System is usually student-run (though university administration interference has occurred, as described in the Leggett case below). It was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death.[tpl]cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=2006_01/uvaBook/tei/b000325415.xml&chunk.id=d12&toc.id=d12&brand=default |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8139-0904-X |pages=9–10[/tpl] Originally, the student was expected to hold himself to a gentleman's code of conduct. In the wake of the shooting, law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr., proposed a basic honor pledge as a gesture of confidence in the honor of Virginia students.TUCKER, Henry St. George – Biographical Information In modern times, however, the Honor System is composed of only three tenets: a student will not lie, cheat, or steal. It extends to all matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the University. This is called the "single sanction".
The system is not without its detractors—it has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon.[tpl]cite news | title = Professors Tepid about the Honor System | work = Charlottesville Daily Progress | url = http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/survey_uva_faculty_tepid_about_honor_system/13683/ |last=Kessler |first=Aaron | date = 2006-12-27 | accessdate = 2007-04-21 [/tpl] As the system is entirely student run, a change to the Honor Committee constitution could have the effect of ending the single sanction system of punishment. Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded. Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the Spring of 2007 a non-binding referendum to replace the single sanction with a tiered, multiple sanction system received 49.5% of the votes cast, falling just 62 votes shy of a majority.[tpl]cite news | title =Students decide on referenda | work=Cavalier Daily |last=Madrecki |first=Thomas | url = http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2007/mar/01/students-decide-on-referenda/ | date = 2007-03-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-26 [/tpl]
In theory, the Honor System allows the faculty to do such things as assign timed take-home examinations, and research or studies to be done in a particular way, with the assurance that the strictures placed on the student will be observed. However, no professor is required to extend such courtesies. The student is often required to sign all examinations or assignments with the following pledge: "On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination." The Honor System allows the student to purchase books and supplies on-Grounds upon giving his or her word to pay, and some members of the Charlottesville community accept the word of the student regarding off-Grounds business transactions.
While cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), one large cheating scandal occurred in 2001. Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, had suspicions that some of his students had copied portions of their term papers from fraternity archives in his Introduction to Physics class. After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters. Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the University. Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]
Lawsuits or threats of lawsuits have resulted in university administration pressure or outright interference in Honor system enforcement. The most notable instance was the 1993 case of Christopher Leggett, a student convicted of cheating.[tpl]cite web |url=http://uvamagazine.org/features/article/the_evolution_of_honor_timeline#1990 |title=The Evolution of Honor Timeline |author=Barefoot, Coy|date=Spring 2008 |work=  |publisher=University of Virginia Magazine |accessdate=3 November 2012[/tpl](noting the case "garnered a great deal of media attention and criticism among alumni and students").  The Honor Committee insisted Leggett had received a fair trial but President John Casteen called it flawed, after Leggett's wealthy family hired the major Washington, D.C. law firm Williams & Connolly to threaten a lawsuit.[tpl]cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72266219.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+10%2C+1994&author=Robert+O%27Harrow+Jr.&desc=U-Va.+Accused+of+Applying+Pressure%2C+Paying+Student%27s+Legal+Fees+in+Cheating+Case |title= U-Va.

At least one Honor Committee member resigned because of the administration's interference.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opengovva.org/foi-opinions/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=186&Itemid=5 |title=Redinger v.
