Political scientists have observed that the ideologies of political parties can be mapped along a single left–right axis.Ware, pp. 18-20 Klaus von Beyme categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties. He was able to arrange seven of them from left to right: communist, socialist, green, liberal, christian democratic, conservative and right-wing extremist. The position of agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied.Ware, p. 22 A study conducted in the late 1980s on two bases, positions on ownership of the means of production and positions on social issues, confirmed this arrangement.Ware, pp. 27-29
There has been a tendency for party ideologies to persist, and values and views that were present at a party's founding have survived.  However they have also adapted for pragmatic reasons, making them appear more similar.Ware, p. 47  Lipset and Rokkan observed that modern party systems are the product of social conflicts played out in the last few centuries.Ware, p. 186  They said that lines of cleavage had become 'frozen'.Ware, p. 202
The first modern political parties were liberals, organized by the middle class in the 19th century to protect them against the aristocracy.  They were major political parties in that century but declined in the twentieth century as first the working class came to support socialist parties and economic and social change eroded their middle class base.Ware, p. 29-31  Conservative parties arose in opposition to liberals in order to defend aristocratic privilege.  But in order to attract voters they became less doctrinaire than liberals.  However they were unsuccessful in most countries and generally have only been able to achieve power through cooperation with other parties.Ware, pp. 31-33
Socialist parties were organized in order to achieve political rights for workers and were originally allied with liberals.  However they broke with the liberals when they sought worker control of the means of production.Ware, pp. 33-35  Christian democratic parties were organized by Catholics who saw liberalism as a threat to traditional values.  Although established in the 19th century, they became a major political force following the Second World War.Ware, p. 36-37  Communist parties emerged following a division within socialism first on support of the First World War and then support of the Bolshevik Revolution.Ware, p. 34
Right-wing extremist parties are harder to define, other than being more right-wing than other parties, but include fascists and some extreme conservative and nationalist parties.Ware, pp. 41-42
Green parties were the most recent of the major party groups to develop. They have rejected socialism and they are very liberal on social issues.Ware, p. 43
These categories can be applied to many parties outside Europe.Ware, pp. 44-47 Ware (1996) asserted that in the United States both major parties were liberal, even though there are left–right policy differences between them.Ware, p. 60

==Usage in Western Europe==

In the 2001 book The government and politics of France, Knapp and Wright say that the main factor dividing the left and right wings in Western Europe is class. The Left seeks social justice through redistributive social and economic policies, while the Right defends private property and capitalism.  The nature of the conflict depends on existing social and political cleavages and on the level of economic development.Knapp & Wright, p. 7 Left-wing values include the belief in the power of human reason to achieve progress for the benefit of the human race, secularism, sovereignty exercised through the legislature, social justice, and mistrust of strong personal political leadership. To the Right, this is regularly seen as anti-clericalism, unrealistic social reform, doctrinaire socialism and class hatred. The Right are skeptical about the capacity of radical reforms to achieve human well-being while maintaining workplace competition. They believe in the established church both in itself and as an instrument of social cohesion, and believe in the need for strong political leadership to minimize social and political divisions.  To the Left, this is seen as a selfish and reactionary opposition to social justice, a wish to impose doctrinaire religion on the population, and a tendency to authoritarianism and repression.Knapp & Wright, p. 9Anthony Giddens, Beyond Left and Right, the Future of Radical Politics, "In many continental European countries, for example, 'conservatism' suggests the political influence of Catholicism." p. 22.  "American conservatism, in some of its major forms at least, has almost from its beginnings been aggressively procapitalist in ways that its European counterparts have not." p. 23.  "(However) the basic delemmas now faced by conservative and socialist thought are everywhere similar." p. 23.  "Conservatism, it is often said, opposes rationalism." p. 24., Stanford University Press, 1994, ISBN 978-0-8047-2451-7.
The differences between left and right have altered over time.  The initial cleavage at the time of the French Revolution was between supporters of absolute monarchy (the Right) and those who wished to limit the king's authority (the Left).  During the 19th century the cleavage was between monarchists and republicans.  Following the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, the cleavage was between supporters of a strong executive on the Right and supporters of the primacy of the legislature on the Left.Knapp & Wright, pp. 2-5

==Contemporary usage in the United States==

The terms left-wing and right-wing are widely used in the United States but, as on the global level, there is no firm consensus about their meaning. The only aspect that is generally agreed upon is that they are the defining opposites of the United States political spectrum. Left and right in the U.S. are generally associated with liberal and conservative respectively, although the meanings of the two sets of terms do not entirely coincide. Depending on the political affiliation of the individual using them, these terms can be spoken with varying implications. A 2005 poll of 2,209 American adults showed that "respondents generally viewed the paired concepts liberals and left-wingers and conservatives and right-wingers as possessing, respectively, generally similar political beliefs", but also showed that around ten percent fewer respondents understood the terms left and right than understood the terms liberal and conservative.Right Wing, Left Wing, Chicken Wing | MediaCulture | AlterNet
The contemporary Left in the United States is usually understood as a category including New Deal liberals, Rawlsian liberals, social democrats and civil libertarians, and is generally identified with the Democratic Party. In general, left-wing implies a commitment to egalitarianism, support for social policies that favor the working class, and multiculturalism. The contemporary Left usually defines itself as promoting government regulation of business, commerce and industry; protection of fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion; and government intervention on behalf of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities and the working class.Michael Kazin, "American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation", Knopf, 2011, ISBN 978-0-307-26628-6
The contemporary Right in the United States is usually understood as a category including  social conservatives, Christian conservatives and free market liberals, and is generally identified with the Republican Party. In general, right-wing implies a commitment to conservative Christian values, support for a free-market system, and traditional family values. The contemporary Right usually defines itself as promoting deregulation of banking, commerce, and industry."Every facet of daily life, from what cars we drive to what food we eat is subject to government’s regulatory reach. The costs are inevitably borne by consumers in the form of higher prices, restricted product choices and limited freedom. Policymakers should scrutinize new and existing rules to ensure that each is necessary and to minimize costs." http://www.heritage.org/issues/regulation 
Whether something is considered to be Left or Right depends on one's point of view.  According to liberal commentator David Sirota, writing in Salon.com, "On economic issues, we are often told that right is center, center is left, and left is fringe."http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/5420/right_is_not_center_but_2010_resembles_1984/

==Relevance of the terms today==

Some political scientists have suggested that the classifications of "left" and "right" are no longer meaningful in the modern complex world.  Although these terms continue to be used, they advocate a more complex spectrum that attempts to combine political, economic and social dimensions.Ruypers, p. 56
However, a survey conducted between 1983 and 1994 by Bob Altemeyer of Canadian legislative caucuses showed an 82% correlation between party affiliation and score on a scale for right-wing authoritarianism when comparing right-wing and social democratic caucuses.  There was a wide gap between the scores of the two groups which was filled by liberal caucuses.  His survey of American legislative caucuses showed scores by American Republicans and Democrats were similar to the Canadian Right and liberals, with a 44% correlation between party affilitation and score.The authoritarian specter, Bob Altemeyer (1996), pp.(258-298)
Norberto Bobbio saw the polarization of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s as evidence that the linear left/right axis remained valid.  He thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the Left or Right were weak.  The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences.  He saw the Left and Right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time.  The key distinction was one of equality.  The Right was committed to inequality while the further left one went the more committed to equality one was.  In his view, the left/right axis could be applied to any time period.Left and right: the significance of a political distinction (1996) Norberto Bobbio, Allan Cameron, pp. vi - xiv
The political philosopher Charles Blattberg has proposed response to conflict as the basis of a reinterpreted political spectrum. According to Blattberg, those who would respond to conflict with conversation should be considered as on the left, with negotiation as in the centre, and with force as on the right. See his essay "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies."http://ssrn.com/abstract=1755117
Libertarian writer David Boaz argued that terms left and right are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the "left" typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class, and those on the "right" usually emphasizing their support for individualism and accusing the Left of supporting collectivism. Boaz asserts that arguments about the way the words should be used often displaces arguments about policy by raising emotional prejudice against a preconceived notion of what the terms mean.David Boaz, The Politics of Freedom: Taking on The Left, the Right, and Threats to our Liberties, Cato Institute, 2008, ISBN 978-1-933995-14-4
