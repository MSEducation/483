Ivan Maisel is a senior writer for ESPN, covering college football.  He has been at ESPN since 2002, but had occasional appearances on the network before then.
An alumnus of Stanford University, Maisel was a college football columnist for the Dallas Morning News from 1987 to 1994, then moved to Newsday from 1994 to 1997.  He then joined Sports Illustrated from 1997 to 2002.  He has been on the national college football beat for 23 yearsâ€”the longest unbroken run of any writer in the country.
Ivan Maisel has often joked about his odd background, being a Jewish Alabaman. He hosts a regular podcast (daily during the football season and less frequently during the off-season). His regular guests include Gene Wojciechowski and a series of conference-specific bloggers. Maisel also regularly podcasted with ESPN analyst Beano Cook until Cook's death in October 2012.
