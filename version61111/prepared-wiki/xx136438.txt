Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse is an album of American soul music by artist Eugene McDaniels, released in 1971.
As with McDaniel's previous album, this is not a typical Soul album, which can even be seen by the cover image (a picture of McDaniels screaming between two warring samurai).
This album dabbles in form between soul, Funk, jazz and even folk.  In addition, it has been a collector's item among rap music and rare groove enthusiasts since the early 90s when several of the songs were sampled by many hip hop producers including Pete Rock and Q-Tip.
