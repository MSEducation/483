Tetrafluorohydrazine or dinitrogen tetrafluoride, [tpl]nitrogen|2[/tpl][tpl]fluorine|4[/tpl], is a colourless, reactive inorganic gas. It is a fluorinated analog of hydrazine. It is a highly hazardous chemical. In presence of organic materials it explodes.
Tetrafluorohydrazine is manufactured from nitrogen trifluoride using iron or iron(II) fluoride. It is used in some chemical syntheses, as a precursor or a catalyst.
Tetrafluorohydrazine is used as a high-energy liquid oxidizer in some never flown rocket fuel formulas. In 1959 it was considered new for this application.Tetrafluorohydrazine at DTIC.mil
