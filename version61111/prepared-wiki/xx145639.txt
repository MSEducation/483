Ulmus canescens Melville is a small deciduous tree occasionally known by the common names Grey Elm, Grey-leafed Elm, and Hoary Elm. Its natural range extends through the lands of the central and eastern Mediterranean, from southern Italy,Richens, R.

The tree is typically found amidst the comparatively humid coastal woodlands and scrublands.
The taxonomy of the tree remains a matter of contention, some authorities treating it as a subspecies of Ulmus minor.Richens, R. H. (1983). Elm. Cambridge University Press, England.Melville, R.
