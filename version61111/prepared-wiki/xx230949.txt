Trickle was billed as the winningest short track driver in history[tpl]cite book |title=The Golden Age of Wisconsin Auto Racing |last=Grubba |first=Dale |year=2000 |publisher=Badger Books |location=Oregon, Wisconsin |isbn=1-878569-67-8 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Yxu1tpjJm8YC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=%22dick+trickle%22+1000&source=web&ots=Co6OCZICiP&sig=QInya04Fgd0ccU_XMwyS40nE4wA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA214,M1 |pages=page 214 [/tpl] with estimates of his win total between 1,000 and 1,200 races. Years later, Trickle commented, "I really do treasure that one in 1966. There were a lot of behind-the-scenes things that went on there. Number one, I had never run outside my own backyard, you might say, which is the central Wisconsin area. I never ran somewhere except in my own little circuit, but I had won there. The first time I ever stepped out of the central Wisconsin area was to the Rockford Nationals in 1966."
