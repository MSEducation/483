==Political career==

===MP and minister===

After unsuccessfully contesting the constituency of North Kensington in 1966 and 1970, he was elected to parliament in the general election of February 1974 for Cleveland and Whitby, and became an opposition spokesman in 1976. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1978. Between 1979 and 1981 he was Minister of State at the Home Office, and then was made Chief Secretary to the Treasury, a Cabinet position. At the 1983 election he changed his seat to Richmond. 
Brittan served as Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985. During the UK miners' strike of 1984–85, Brittan was a strong critic of the leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers. He accused them of organising violence by flying pickets, whom he described as "thugs".[tpl]cite news |last= Russell |first= William |title= Brittan keeps up attack on miners' union leaders |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19840813&id=7sJAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AaYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3173,2245632 |accessdate= 13 January 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date= 13 August 1984[/tpl] One factor in why the miners' strike was defeated was that the police action was centrally controlled. As soon as the strike began, Brittan set up a National Reporting Centre in New Scotland Yard to co-ordinate intelligence and the supply of police officers between forces as necessary. Margaret Thatcher's government had carefully planned for a miners' strike and a Whitehall committee had been meeting in secret since 1981, to prepare for a long dispute.[tpl]cite book |last=Boxer |first=Andrew |title=OCR A Level History B: The End of Consensus: Britain, 1945-90 |date=2009 |publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780435312374 |page=192-193 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2XEZbswz2JIC&pg=PT132&dq=leon+brittan+national+reporting+centre&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fkseU4GJH--B7Qb7-ICIAg&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=leon%20brittan%20national%20reporting%20centre&f=false[/tpl] 
In September 1985, Brittan was moved to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.[tpl]cite news |title= Thatcher's biggest-ever cabinet shuffle sees Home Secretary Brittan demoted |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19850903&id=9x8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1KUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5010,76348 |accessdate= 13 January 2014 |newspaper=The Montreal Gazette |date=3 September 1985[/tpl] The reason for his demotion, according to Jonathan Aitken, was that the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher felt that Brittan was "not getting the message across on television".[tpl]cite book |last=Aitken |first=Jonathan |title=Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality (2013) |isbn=9781408831847 |page=514 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bc1LAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA514&dq=%22leon+brittan%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MI4GU8WAFciO7Aas8IDQBw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22leon%20brittan%22&f=false[/tpl] Brittan had been criticised as a poor communicator and for his role in the suppression of a BBC television programme on The Troubles in Northern Ireland, At the Edge of the Union. Brittan stated that transmission of the programme would be against the national interest and in August 1985 he wrote to the BBC Chairman, Stuart Young, asking for the broadcast to be cancelled. The BBC's Board of Governors called an emergency meeting and ruled that the documentary could not be shown. The controversy led to a rift in the BBC between the boards of Management and Governors. It also led to a day of strike action by hundreds of television and radio workers who protested against what they perceived as government censorship.[tpl]cite web |title= The BBC Story: Real Lives 1985 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/bbcandgov/real_lives.shtml |work=BBC |accessdate= 13 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=BBC set for confrontation with Brittan |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19850807&id=oqNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nqUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4565,1222318 |accessdate=16 January 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=7 August 1985[/tpl]

===Resignation over the Westland affair===

Brittan resigned as Trade and Industry Secretary in January 1986, over the Westland affair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/24/newsid_2506000/2506501.stm |title=1986: Leon Brittan quits over Westland|work=On This Day |publisher=BBC |date=|accessdate=28 October 2012[/tpl] Brittan had authorised the leaking of a letter from the Solicitor General that had accused Michael Heseltine of inaccuracies in his campaign for Westland to be rescued by a consortium of European investors. The rest of the Government, led by Margaret Thatcher, supported a deal with the American business Sikorsky Fiat. It was later revealed that Brittan had attempted to persuade British Aerospace and GEC to withdraw from the European consortium.
In October 1986, in a House of Commons debate, Brittan made a bitter attack on Michael Heseltine, accusing him of "thwarting the Government at every turn" in its handling of the Westland affair. Brittan said that Government decisions "should have the support of all its members and should not be undermined from within".[tpl]cite news |last=McGregor |first=Stephen |title=Thatcher accused of Westland plot |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19861030&id=H4JDAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q6UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3208,7658602 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=30 October 1986[/tpl]
In 1989, Brittan revealed in a Channel 4 programme that two senior Downing Street officials, Bernard Ingham and Charles Powell, had approved the leaking of the letter from the Solicitor General. Brittan's claim led to calls from some Labour MPs for there to be a new inquiry into the Westland affair.[tpl]cite news |last=Trotter |first=Stuart |title=Westland affair re-opened by Brittan |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19890406&id=VTFAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QFkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6355,1388601 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=6 April 1989[/tpl] 

===Phone tapping court case===

In September 1986, Brittan was cleared by a High Court Judge of acting unlawfully when he gave MI5 permission to tap the telephone of a leader of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. It was alleged that Brittan had authorised the tapping of John Cox, vice-president of CND, at his home in Gwent, in 1983. Government guidelines restricted this type of surveillance to those thought to pose a risk to national security. It was alleged that the tap was part of an attempt to gain information to discredit CND and that Brittan had acted without authority or power when ordering the tap. The Judge, however, ruled that Brittan had not flouted guidelines on tapping.[tpl]cite news |title=Judge clears Brittan over phone tap on CND leader |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19860903&id=FbZAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qqUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2699,654646 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=3 September 1986[/tpl]
