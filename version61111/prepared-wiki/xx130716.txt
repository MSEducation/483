I Am Legend is a 2007 British-American post-apocalyptic science fiction horror film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith. It is the third feature film adaptation of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name, following 1964's The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man.Before I Am Legends release in cinemas in 2007, the direct -to-DVD I Am Omega was released by The Asylum to cash-in on the adaptation's potential success.

He works to create a remedy while defending himself against mutants created by the virus.
Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994, and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the Making | publisher=Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011204523/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030  |archivedate = October 11, 2007[/tpl] at the Brooklyn Bridge.
I Am Legend was released on December 14, 2007 in the United States and Canada, and opened to the largest ever box office (not counting for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. in December. The film was the seventh-highest grossing film of 2007, earning $256 million domestically and $329 million internationally, for a total of $585 million.

==Plot==

In 2009, Dr. Alice Krippin develops a cure for cancer from a genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus. After initially successful clinical trials, the virus mutates into a lethal strain, transmitted by physical contact then rapidly becoming airborne and killing 5.4 billion people worldwide. Most of the survivors devolved into aggressive, cannibalistic mutants referred to as 'Darkseekers' who have heightened strength, agility and animalistic senses, but suffer acute photosensitivity (exposure to sunlight kills them, making them primarily nocturnal creatures). Attracted by the smell of blood, they hunt and kill the remaining humans who are immune to the virus.
Three years later, military virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville is the last unaffected human in New York City, and possibly the world. Having lost his wife and daughter in a helicopter crash during the chaotic failed quarantine of Manhattan, Robert spends his time experimenting to isolate the gene in his blood that makes him immune to the virus, and ventures into a decaying Manhattan to collect food and supplies. Wild animals, which are immune to the airborne strain of the virus, thrive in the city. Robert spends 30 minutes each noon at the South Street Seaport, waiting for a response to his automated radio broadcast to other survivors. His isolation is broken only by the companionship of his German Shepherd dog Sam and his interactions with various mannequins he has set up around the city.
Robert has transformed his Washington Square Park townhouse into a fortress, including a UV-light perimeter, iron shutters inside the windows, and an armory. Stocked with large amounts of food, there are generators in the house to provide electricity and the basement is now his lab. Robert uses ammonia on his doorsteps and always returns home before nightfall, preventing the Darkseekers from tracking him. One day while Robert is in the city, Sam spots a deer. They chase it to an abandoned building. Sam pursues the deer inside, forcing Robert to reluctantly go in after her. He finds the deer dead and discovers Sam hiding, but the building is full of 'sleeping' Darkseekers who wake and chase them out. 
Needing a new test subject, Robert captures a female Darkseeker. As he does so, a male Darkseeker briefly emerges from the building, screaming in rage and agony as he exposes himself to sunlight. Robert assumes this is due to increased hunger and the further loss of human characteristics in the Darkseekers. In his laboratory, Robert tries his latest experimental serum on the infected woman, but the test seems unsuccessful. 
The next day, he finds one of his mannequins has moved onto the street in front of Grand Central Terminal. He investigates but is caught in a snare trap and passes out. When he awakens, it is dusk. As Robert tries to escape, the male mutant from the day before (who presumably also set the trap) lets loose a pack of infected dogs on them. During the fight, Sam is bitten. Robert brings Sam home and attempts to save her by injecting his serum, but it is ineffective. Sam starts mutating, forcing Robert to kill her. Overwhelmed by grief and hatred, that night Robert waits in the Seaport with his car equipped with UV lights, seemingly as a suicidal last stand. The Darkseekers come and he kills many, but they overwhelm and nearly kill him before he is rescued by an immune woman named Anna and a boy named Ethan, who followed his radio broadcasts from Maryland. Anna and Ethan take Robert back to his home. Anna explains that they are making their way to a survivor’s colony in Vermont but Robert does not believe such a colony exists.
The following night, the alpha male leads a horde of mutants to Robert's house, inadvertently led there by Anna who was unaware of Robert's precautions in covering his scent. Robert stops the first wave with the UV-light perimeter, but the mutants then destroy it. He kills some of them with mines planted in the street outside, but the Darkseekers eventually reach the house. As Anna and Ethan hide, the alpha male and another Darkseeker enter the house, and the alpha male attacks Robert. As they fight, the other Darkseeker gets upstairs and rips a hole in the roof so the rest can get in. Robert drives the alpha male out, but the entire horde of Darkseekers come through the roof. Robert, Anna and Ethan retreat to the basement, sealing themselves in a plexiglass room with the mutant female that Robert was experimenting on. They discover that Robert's cure is actually working on the woman. The Darkseekers break into the basement and the alpha male begins to throw himself against the glass. Robert draws a vial of the infected woman's blood and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. As the alpha male finally breaks through the glass, Robert detonates a grenade, killing the mutants and himself. Anna and Ethan emerge the next morning and make their way to the survivor colony. Once there, Anna hands over the blood containing the cure, stating that the survivors are Robert's legacy as his fight for a cure became legend.

===Alternate ending===

The Blu-ray and DVD releases gave the option to view the film with an alternate ending. In this ending, the Alpha male creates a butterfly on the glass wall with his dirty hands, and Robert notices a Butterfly tattoo on the mutant woman's arm. Robert realizes what they want and that there is still hope for them, and after taking a vial of her blood, he removes the serum to make her infected again. He then slowly brings the woman out. The alpha male growls for infecting her again. The Alpha male takes her and leaves with all the Darkseekers, letting Robert live. The next morning Robert, Anna and Ethan leave New York City and head for the Survivor colony in Vermont.

The late 1990s brought a reemergence of the science fiction horror genre.[tpl]cite book | author=David Hughes | title=The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made | publisher=Chicago Review Press | date=April 22, 2002 | isbn=1-55652-449-8 | chapter=Legend of the Fall: Will Ridley Scott's I Am Legend Rise From The Dead[/tpl] In 1995, Warner Bros. began developing the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970[tpl]cite news | author=Lewis Beale | title=A variation on vampire lore that won't die | publisher=The New York Times | date=January 14, 2007 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/movies/14beal.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin | accessdate=November 6, 2007[/tpl] and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich's first draft took place in the year 2000 in San Francisco, California, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict; as well as the fact that there was a Hemocyte character named Christopher who joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track, attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer.
Actors Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film,[tpl]cite news | author=Anita M.

In July, Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations,[tpl]cite news | author=Anita M.

Parks | url= | title=Arnold's 'Legend' coming here | publisher=Houston Chronicle | date=August 22, 1997[/tpl] Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing, John Logan, with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts. The Scott/Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci-fi and psychological thriller, without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending. The creatures in Logan's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic, barbaric nature. The studio, fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential, began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott – then on a negative streak of box office disappointments – and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay. After an "esoteric" draft by writer Neal Jimenez, Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project, reluctantly working with Scott again.
In December 1997, the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big-budget film.[tpl]cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR111729674.html?categoryid=3&cs=1 | title='Legend' may not live on; Leighton lightens up | publisher=Variety | date=December 4, 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2007[/tpl] Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film's budget by $20 million,[tpl]cite news | author=Chris Petrikin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117469681.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Fox reins in 'Riders' | publisher=Variety | date=April 13, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007[/tpl] but in March 1998, the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns,[tpl]cite news | author= | url= | title=Schwarzenegger's 'Legend' is in peril | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=March 16, 1998[/tpl] and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott's last three films, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, White Squall, and G.I. Jane. Likewise, Schwarzenegger's recent films at the time (Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin) also underperformed, and the studio's latest experiences with big budget sci-fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative as well. In August 1998, director Rob Bowman was attached to the project,[tpl]cite news | author=Benedict Carver | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479598.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Col taps duo for 'Space' | publisher=Variety | date=August 18, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2007[/tpl] with Protosevich hired to write a third all-new draft, far more action-oriented than his previous versions, but the director (who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead) moved on to direct Reign of Fire[tpl]cite news | author=Charles Lyons | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117783821.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Bowman will reign over Spyglass' 'Fire' | publisher=Variety | date=July 17, 2000 | accessdate=May 2, 2007[/tpl] and the project did not get off the ground.
In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend, commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film. Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget.[tpl]cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117864047.html?categoryid=1201&cs=1 | title='Legend' rekindled by Arnold | publisher=Variety | date=March 17, 2002 | accessdate=May 2, 2007[/tpl] However, the project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president, Alan F.

He said, "Something's always really excited me about that... to have experienced that much loss, to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long."
Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man.[tpl]cite news | author = Jeff Jensen | title = Will Smith: Making a 'Legend' | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | date = August 16, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20052055,00.html | accessdate=November 8, 2007[/tpl] A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in sixteen weeks: production was green lit, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion’s film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.

===Casting===

Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006.[tpl]cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942073?cs=1 | title='Legend' reborn again at Warners | publisher=Variety | date=April 25, 2006 | accessdate=August 23, 2006[/tpl] He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like "Gladiator or Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements but also uncompromised artistic value. This always felt like it had those possibilities to me." The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that "when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict." The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes.[tpl]cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = I Am Legend | publisher = Empire | date = October 2007 | pages = 78–81[/tpl] To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).
Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd Dogs, played Neville's dog Sam.[tpl]cite news | author = Adam Markowitz | title = The Dog | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | date = November 2, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20156358,00.html | accessdate=November 5, 2007[/tpl] The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert's wife,[tpl]cite news | author=Wilson Morales | url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20060915/features/iamlegendnews.shtml | title=I Am Legend casting news | publisher=Blackfilm.com | date=September 19, 2006 | accessdate=September 19, 2006[/tpl] and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna.

There were several filler characters with uncredited roles in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President's voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show.

===Filming===

Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, "L.A. looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, but New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives.[tpl]cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Last Man Standing | publisher = Empire | date = January 2008 | pages = 109–114[/tpl] Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue and Washington Square Park.

Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, "I don't think anyone's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career."
A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York's citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was likely the most expensive shot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members.[tpl]cite news | author=Joseph Steuer | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the making | publisher=The Hollywood Reporter | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070428014812/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030  |archivedate = April 28, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Addiego | first = Walter | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/14/DDCFTTNAT.DTL | title = Review: I, human – Will Smith plays last man standing in 'I Am Legend' | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date=December 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 22, 2007[/tpl] Also present were several Humvees, three Strykers, a [tpl]convert|110|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] cutter, a [tpl]convert|41|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] utility boat, and two [tpl]convert|25|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] Response Boat Small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances.[tpl]cite news | author=Joseph Steuer | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2335654320070424 | title=Government agencies cover filmmakers in red tape | publisher=Reuters | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=September 17, 2007[/tpl] Filming concluded on March 31, 2007. CGI was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from over passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island.
Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.'

===Effects===

A week into filming, Francis felt the infected (referred to as "Dark Seekers" or "hemocytes" in the script), who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time and Lawrence explained, "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can’t get out of people in the middle of the night when they’re barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they’re constantly hyperventilating, which you can’t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out." The actors remained on set to provide motion capture.Sony Pictures Imageworks - I Am Legend "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard," so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.[tpl]cite news | last = Harris | first = Chris | title = Mike Patton Hits The Big Screen, Voicing 'I Am Legend' Baddies And Scoring 'Perfect' Indie Flick  | date = December 13, 2007 | url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576342/story.jhtml | accessdate=January 3, 2008[/tpl]
In addition, CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film, and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence: "We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted."

===Alternate ending===

Several scenes were changed before the film's release, especially the stand-off between Neville and the infected in his laboratory. In the ending, the alpha male makes a butterfly-shaped smear on the glass. Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the woman he was experimenting on by a butterfly tattoo, and the alpha male wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the infected woman. Neville and the alpha male both stare each other down; Neville apologizes to the Darkseekers; the alpha male accepts his apology, and the infected leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him. The final shot follows Neville, Anna, and Ethan as they drive away towards the survivor's camp in Vermont with the antidote.Billington, Alex (March 5, 2008). "Must Watch: I Am Legend's Original Ending". FirstShowing.net. Retrieved July 3, 2011.
According to visual effects supervisor Janek Sirrs: "At that point, Neville's — and the audience's — assumptions about the nature of these creatures are shown to be incorrect. We see that they have actually retained some of their humanity. There is a very important moment between the alpha male and Neville."

Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14, 2007 addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:
The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, virologist W. Ian Lipkin, M.D., and Michel Bruneau, PhD, comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: "This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely," Popular Mechanics editor Roy Berendsohn says.
Philosopher Slavoj Zizek criticized the film politically as being the most regressive adaptation from the novel (others being The Last Man on Earth in 1964 and The Omega Man in 1971). He claimed that while the original novel had a progressive multicultural message where Neville became a "legend" to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them (much like vampires were legends to humans); the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent divine intervention. According to Zizek this misses the original message and "openly opts for religious fundamentalism."[tpl]cite book |last=Zizek |first=Slavoj  |authorlink=Slavoj Žižek |title=Living in the End Times |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=MIz6BPT23Q4C&pg=PA61&dq=I+Am+legend+zizek&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JlR9UY_8NJKu4AObpIGgBw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=I%20Am%20legend%20zizek&f=false|accessdate=April 28, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Verso Books |page=64[/tpl]

==Possible sequel/prequel==

Francis Lawrence said in late 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. He stated that the film would reveal what happens to Neville before the infected take over New York. D. B. Weiss was recruited to write the script, while Lawrence would direct "if we figure out the story". Smith stated the film would have Neville and his team going from New York City to Washington, D.C. and back again, as they made their last stand.[tpl]cite news|author=Steve Weintraub|title=Will Smith talks I AM LEGEND prequel|work=Collider.com|date=December 5, 2008|url=http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/10055/tcid/1|accessdate=December 6, 2008[/tpl] The film would again explore the premise of what it's like to be alone, as Lawrence explained, "... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=11673&count=0|title=Director Talks "I Am Legend" Prequel|work=WorstPreviews.com|date=January 16, 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2009[/tpl]
