[[Capital of Norway]]

CATEGORIES: Capitals by country

Oslo is now the capital of Norway.
Trondheim was the capital of Norway until 1217. After 1217 the de facto capital was at Bergen until around 1300 when the capital moved to Oslo. After 1380 Norway was ruled by either Denmark or Sweden and was governed by either of their respective capitals.
During Swedish rule (c.1624) the city was renamed Christiania.
Christiania was designated as capital when Norway became independent again in 1905. The city reverted back to its original name, Oslo, in 1925.
