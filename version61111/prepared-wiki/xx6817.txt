Long Island is an island in the U.S. state of New York. Stretching northeastwards from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island contains four counties, two of which (Brooklyn and Queens) are boroughs of New York City,[ref]The New York City borough of Queens has the same boundaries as the County of Queens. The borough of Brooklyn has the same boundaries as Kings County.
[/ref] and two of which are mainly suburban (Nassau and Suffolk). In popular usage, "Long Island" often refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties in order to differentiate them from New York City, although all four counties are situated on the island and are part of the New York metropolitan area.[ref]About Long Island, LongIsland.com

North of the island is Long Island Sound, across which are the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Two of New York City's major airports, LaGuardia Airport and JFK International Airport, are located on Long Island, in Queens. Nine bridges and 13 tunnels (including railroad tunnels) connect Brooklyn and Queens (and thus Long Island) to the three other boroughs of New York City. Ferries connect Suffolk County northward across Long Island Sound to the state of Connecticut.

==Overview==

The westernmost end of Long Island contains the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens (Queens County). The central and eastern portions contain the suburban Nassau and Suffolk counties. However, colloquial usage of the term "Long Island" usually refers only to Nassau and Suffolk counties. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Long Island District is separate from that of New York City.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/regional/profile_longisland.html | title=Long Island (Nassau-Suffolk Metro Division) | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | accessdate=2012-06-24[/tpl] The more dense and urban Brooklyn and Queens are not usually referred to as "Long Island", since they are a part of New York City, although before those counties amalgamated into the city, they were often so identified; at least as late as 1911, locations in Queens were still commonly referred to as being on Long Island.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9405E0DB1E31E233A25754C0A9649D946096D6CF |title=The Real Estate Field – On Long Island |date=December 11, 1911 | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2011-04-30[/tpl] Some institutions in the New York City section of the island use the island's names, like Long Island University and Long Island Jewish Medical Center. The New York Islanders National Hockey League team intends to retain its name after their move from Nassau County to Brooklyn in 2015.
Nassau County is more developed than Suffolk County, and has pockets of rural affluence within the Gold Coast of the North Shore and the Five Towns area on the South Shore. South Shore communities are built along protected wetlands of the island and contain white sandy beaches of Outer Barrier Islands fronting on the Atlantic Ocean. Dutch and English settlers from the time before the American Revolutionary War, as well as communities of Native Americans, populated the island. The 19th century saw the infusion of the wealthiest Americans in the so-called Gold Coast of the North Shore, where wealthy Americans and Europeans in the Gilded Age built lavish country homes. Today, although many of the massive estates have been demolished, many others remain their original state or have become parks, arboretums, universities and museums.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]
Owing to economic growth and the suburbanization after World War II, Nassau was the fastest growing county in the United States from the 1950s to the 1970s.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]  Suffolk County remains less congested, despite substantial growth in the high technology and light manufacturing sectors since 1990, although traffic has been increasing in recent years.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] In its easternmost sections, Suffolk remains small-town rural, as in Greenport on the North Fork and some of the outward areas of The Hamptons, although summer tourism swells the population in those areas. Western Suffolk, such as the towns of Huntington and Babylon, are becoming increasingly populated and are beginning to resemble towns in Nassau.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
According to the US Census Bureau's 2008 American Community Survey, Nassau and Suffolk counties have the 10th and 26th highest median household incomes in the nation, respectively.[tpl]cite web|last=Levy |first=Francesca |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/108999/americas-richest-counties |title=americas-richest-counties: Personal Finance News from Yahoo! Finance |publisher=Finance.yahoo.com |date=March 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-01-02[/tpl]
Additionally, Nassau County is the third-richest county per capita in New York State and the 30th richest in the nation, and it has the second-highest property taxes in the United States.
Suffolk County has redeveloped North Fork potato fields into a burgeoning wine region.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]  The South Fork is known for beach communities, including the world-renowned Hamptons, and for Montauk Point Lighthouse at the eastern tip of the island.

==Geography==

===Geology===

Long Island, as part of the Outer Lands region, is formed largely of two spines of glacial moraine, with a large, sandy outwash plain beyond. These moraines consist of gravel and loose rock left behind during the two most recent pulses of Wisconsin glaciation during the Ice Ages some 21,000 years ago (19,000 BC). The northern moraine, which directly abuts the North Shore of Long Island at points, is known as the Harbor Hill moraine. The more southerly moraine, known as the Ronkonkoma moraine, forms the "backbone" of Long Island; it runs primarily through the very center of Long Island, roughly coinciding with the length of the Long Island Expressway.
The land to the south of this moraine to the South Shore is the outwash plain of the last glacier. One part of the outwash plain was known as the Hempstead Plains, and this land contained one of the few natural prairies to exist east of the Appalachian Mountains.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080415230214/http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs105a,0,5519292.story|publisher=Newsday.com|title=Long Island History: The Prairie That Was|first=George|last=DeWan|accessdate=2009-01-04[/tpl]
[/ref]
The glaciers melted and receded to the north, resulting in the difference between the North Shore beaches and the South Shore beaches. The North Shore beaches are rocky from the remaining glacial debris, while the South Shore's are crisp, clear, outwash sand. Jayne's Hill, at [tpl]convert|401|ft|m[/tpl], within Suffolk County near its border with Nassau County, is the highest hill along either moraine; another well-known summit is Bald Hill in Brookhaven Town, not far from its geographical center at Middle Island. The glaciers also formed Lake Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County and Lake Success in Nassau County, each a deep  kettle lake.

===Climate===

Long Island has a climate similar to that of other coastal areas of the Northeastern United States; it has warm, humid summers and cool, wet winters. Under the Koppen climate classification, Long Island lies in a transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a humid continental climate (Dfa).[tpl]cite journal | author=Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the Köppen–Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. | volume=11 | pages=1633–1644 |doi=10.5194/hess-11-1633-2007 | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.html | issn = 1027-5606[/tpl] (direct: Final Revised Paper)
The Atlantic Ocean helps bring afternoon sea breezes that temper the heat in the warmer months and limit the frequency and severity of thunderstorms. Long Island has a moderately sunny climate, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc | accessdate=2011-04-30[/tpl]
Due to its coastal location, Long Island temperatures are somewhat mild compared to the rest of New York state. The coldest month is January, when average temperatures range from [tpl]convert|30 to 35|F|C[/tpl], and the warmest month is July, when average temperatures range from [tpl]convert|70 to 80|F|C[/tpl]. Temperatures seldom fall below [tpl]convert|5|F|C[/tpl] or rise above [tpl]convert|95|F|C[/tpl]. Long Island temperatures vary from west to east, with the western part (Nassau County, Queens, and Brooklyn) generally warmer than the east (Suffolk County). This is due to two factors: the western part is closer to the mainland and more densely developed, causing the "urban heat island" effect. The eastern part is cooler on most occasions due to moderation of the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound, and its being less developed. On dry nights with no clouds or wind, the Pine Barrens in eastern Suffolk County can be almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius) cooler than the rest of the island due to radiational cooling.
Precipitation is distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year, with approximately [tpl]convert|3-4|inch|mm[/tpl] on average during each month. Average yearly snowfall totals range from approximately [tpl]convert|20|to|35|in|cm[/tpl], with the north shore and western parts averaging more than the south shore and the east end. In any given winter, however, some parts of the island could see up to [tpl]convert|75|in|cm[/tpl] of snow or more. There are also some very quiet winters, in which most parts of the island could see less than [tpl]convert|10|in|cm[/tpl] of snow.
Long Island is somewhat vulnerable to hurricanes.[ref][tpl]cite web| title=Vulnerable Cities: Long Island|url=http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/longisland.html|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=2005-12-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060410111625/http://www.weather.com/newscenter/specialreports/hurricanes/vulnerablecities/longisland.html  |archivedate =2006-04-10 |accessdate = 2011-04-30[/tpl]

Its northern location and relatively cool waters tend to weaken storms to below hurricane strength by the time they reach Long Island; nonetheless, some storms have made landfall at Category 1 or greater strength, including two unnamed Category 3 storms: the 1938 New England Hurricane (also known as the Long Island Express) and another in 1944. Named hurricanes that crossed Long Island include Hurricane Donna in 1960, Hurricane Camille in 1969, Hurricane Belle in 1976, Hurricane Gloria in 1985, Hurricane Bob in 1991 (brushed the eastern tip) and Hurricane Floyd in 1999. (There is debate among climatologists as to whether Hurricane Floyd made landfall as a Category 1 or as a very strong "almost hurricane strength" tropical storm. The official records note it as the latter.) In August 2011, portions of Long Island were evacuated in preparation for Hurricane Irene, a Category 1 hurricane which turned into a tropical storm before it reached Long Island.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-08-28/irene-makes-nyc-landfall-as-tropical-storm-with-rain-flooding.html|title=Irene Makes NYC Landfall as Tropical Storm With Rain, Flooding|work=Bloomberg Business Week|date=August 28, 2011|accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]
On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy, a slow-moving "superstorm," reached the area causing 90% of Long Island households to lose power and an estimated $18 billion in damages in Nassau & Suffolk Counties alone.[ref][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2012/10/30/superstorm-sandy-sparks-floods-blackouts-on-long-island|title=Superstorm Sandy Sparks Floods, Blackouts on Long Island|work=Long Island Press|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]
[/ref]
The extent of Sandy's damages is second only to those caused by the 1938 Long Island Express (even though Sandy's barometric pressure was lower and set a record).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/30/us/sandy-records/index.html|title=Superstorm Sandy Breaks Records|work=CNN.com|date=October 30, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-08[/tpl]

===Additional Islands===

In addition to the main island, several smaller islands comprise what is collectively considered Long Island.  These islands include Fire Island, Plum Island, Robins Island, Gardiners Island, Fishers Island and Shelter Island.
