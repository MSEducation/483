==History==

The flag was adopted when the northern portion of Korea became a socialist republic supported by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union following the Korean Revolution and the surrender of the Empire of Japan. The colors of the Korean Empire flag were white, blue, and a pale shade of red bordering on orange. North Korea retained these colors for its new flag, with more prominence given to the red, per communist symbolism, and added a red star on a white disk.
A 270-kg (600 lb) North Korean national flag flies from the world's third tallest flagpole, which is located at Kijŏng-dong, on the North Korean side of the Military Demarcation Line within the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The flag-pole is [tpl]convert|160|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] tall.
There are several other known flags in use.

There is also a flag of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea, modeled after similar communist party flags, and a flag for the Supreme Commander of the KPA used by Kim Jong-un, which has the Supreme Commander's Arms on a red field.
