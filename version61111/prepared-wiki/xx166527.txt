CATEGORIES: Mobile phones, Mobile telecommunications

A dual SIM mobile phone is one which holds two SIM cards.
Devices that use more than two SIM cards have also been developed and released, notably the LG A290 triple SIM phone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/lgs_first_triplesim_phone_to_be_released_next_month-news-3749.php|title=LG's first triple-SIM phone to be released next month - GSMArena.com news|work=GSMArena|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl] and even handsets that can run on four SIMs,[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.gsmarena.com/otech-f1-phone-phone-has-quad-sim-support-probably-glows-in-the-dark-too/|title=OTECH F1 phone has Quad SIM support, probably glows in the dark, too|work=GSMArena|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/OTECH-F1-the-First-Quad-SIM-Mobile-Phone-Comes-with-12-1MP-Camera-162783.shtml|title=OTECH F1 the First Quad-SIM Mobile Phone Comes with 12.1MP Camera|work=Softpedia|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/otech-f1-quad-sim-cellphone-is-probably-overkill-22109819/|title=OTECH F1 quad-SIM cellphone is probably overkill|work=SlashGear|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl] such as the Cherry Mobile Quad Q70.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yugatech.com/mobile/cherry-mobile-quad-q70-is-first-quad-sim-phone/|title=Cherry Mobile Q70 Quad is first quad-SIM phone?|publisher=YugaTech|accessdate=7 August 2013[/tpl]

==History==

The first phone to include dual SIM functionality was the Benefon Twin, released by Benefon in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/benefon-and-vlp-introduce-a-world-innovation-benefon-twin-dual-sim-utilizes-two-sim-cards-156306185.html|title=BENEFON AND VLP INTRODUCE A WORLD INNOVATION: BENEFON TWIN DUAL SIM UTILIZES TWO SIM CARDS -- October 19, 1999 /PR Newswire UK/|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] It wasn't until the late 2000s, however, when more dual SIM phones entered the marketplace and started to attract mainstream attention, most of them coming from small Chinese firms producing phones using Mediatek system-on-chips.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/shanzhai-ji-all-you-need-to-know-about-fake-phones-339297258.htm|title=Shanzhai ji: All you need to know about fake phones - Mobile Phones|publisher=CNET|accessdate=5 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/dual_sim-review-154p2.php|title=Dual SIM review: Mobiles go two-in-one - page 2|date=3 August 2007|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]
Such phones were initially eschewed by major manufacturers due to potential pressure from telecommunications companies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/dual_sim-review-154.php|title=Dual SIM review: Mobiles go two-in-one|date=3 August 2007|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] but it wasn't until recently when Nokia, Samsung, Sony and several others followed suit, with the Nokia C2-00, Nokia C1-00 and most notably the Nokia X,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.talkandroid.com/197558-nokia-unveils-3-new-android-handsets-nokia-x-nokia-x-and-nokia-xl/|title=Nokia unveils 3 new Android handsets: Nokia X, Nokia X+, and Nokia XL|last=Nazarian|first=Robert|work=TalkAndroid.com|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dual SIM Nokia C2 revealed|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/06/03/dual-sim-nokia-c2-revealed-photo-gallery/|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=18 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Nokia C1 unleashed with double-SIM functionality|url=http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/06/03/nokia-c1-unleashed-with-double-sim-functionality-photo-gallery/|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=18 August 2010[/tpl] phones from Samsung's Duos series,[tpl]cite web|url=http://culturemob.com/samsung-galaxy-duos-2-samsung-galaxy-core-specs-price-comparison|title=Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2 vs Samsung Galaxy Core â€“ Specs and Price Comparison|work=CultureMob|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] and the Sony Xperia C[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Sony-Xperia-C-Review_id3524|title=Sony Xperia C Review|first=11 December 2013|work=Phone Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] and tipo dual.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Sony-Xperia-tipo-dual_id7152|title=Sony Xperia tipo dual specs|work=Phone Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esato.com/phones/Sony-Xperia+Tipo+Dual-932|title=Sony Xperia Tipo Dual specifications and reviews|work=Esato|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]

==Types==

===Adapters===

Prior to the introduction of dual SIM phones, adapters were made for phones to accommodate two SIMs, and to switch between them when required.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cellphonebeat.com/duo-sim-d2-converts-a-standard-mobile-phone-to-dual-sim-phone-in-minutes.html|title=Duo SIM D2 converts a standard mobile phone to dual SIM phone in minutes|work=CELLPHONEBEAT|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]

===Passive/Standby===

Dual SIM switch phones, such as the Nokia C1-00, are effectively a single SIM device as both SIMs share the same radio, and thus are only able to place or receive calls and messages on one SIM at the time. They do, however, have the added benefit of alternating between cards when necessary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_c1_00-review-517.php|title=Nokia C1-00 review: Dual SIM-phony|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] A variant of this called dual standby allows both SIMs to be accessed, but only one of the SIMs can be used at a time when making calls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shoutmeloud.com/nokia-dual-sim-phones.html|title=Nokia Dual SIM Phones: Which one to buy?|work=Shout Me Loud|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]

===Active===

Dual SIM active phones, however, come with two transceivers, and are capable of receiving calls on both SIM cards, at the cost of increased battery consumption.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/glossary.php3?term=dual-sim|title=Dual-SIM - Mobile terms glossary|work=GSM Arena|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gadgetstouse.com/gadget-tech/dual-sim-dual-standby-and-dual-sim-dual-active/8985|title=What is Dual SIM Dual Standby and Dual SIM Dual Active|work=Gadgets To Use|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] An example of this is the Samsung Galaxy S Duos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://androidcommunity.com/samsung-galaxy-s-duos-unveiled-with-dual-sim-capabilities-20120820/|title=Samsung GALAXY S DUOS unveiled with dual-SIM capabilities|date=20 August 2012|work=Android Community|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] and the HTC Desire 600.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/HTC-Desire-600-Review_id3386/page/2|title=HTC Desire 600 Review - Interface, Functionality, Dual SIM and Internet|date=9 August 2013|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]

==Reception==

Dual SIM phones have become popular especially with business users[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.clove.co.uk/2013/12/14/htc-one-dual-sim/|title=HTC One Dual-SIM|date=14 December 2013|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] due to reduced costs and added network coverage, as well as negating the need for having two or more separate devices. Some sub-contract Chinese companies supply inexpensive dual SIM handsets, mainly in Asian countries. The phones, which also usually include touch screen interfaces and other modern features, typically retail for a much lower price than branded models. While some such phones are sold under generic names or are rebadged by smaller companies under their own brand, numerous manufacturers, especially in China, produce dual SIM phones under counterfeit trademarks such as those of Nokia or Samsung,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/01/features/shanzai|title=Shanzai! (Wired UK)|work=Wired UK|accessdate=5 August 2013[/tpl] either as cosmetically-identical clones of the originals, or in completely different designs, with the logo of a notable manufacturer present in order to take advantage of brand recognition or brand image.
Dual SIM phones are common in developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, with local firms like Karbonn Mobiles, Micromax and Cherry Mobile releasing feature phones and smartphones incorporating multiple SIM slots.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yugatech.com/mobile/cherry-mobiles-uber-cheap-dual-sim-phones/|title=Cherry Mobile's uber cheap dual SIM phones|date=9 June 2009|work=YugaTech|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/karbonn-launches-four-budget-android-dual-sim-smartphones-under-rs-7500-432545|title=Karbonn launches four budget Android dual-SIM smartphones under Rs. 7,500|last=Pratap|first=Ketan|date=15 October 2013|work=NDTV|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl]
