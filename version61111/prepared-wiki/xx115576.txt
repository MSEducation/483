Six were produced as the Pembroke C(PR).1 photographic reconnaissance aircraft. these saw use by No. 81 Squadron RAF during the Malayan Emergency.  The RAF's Pembrokes were modified to extend their lifespan in 1970.  The last unit to use them was No. 60 Squadron RAF based at RAF Wildenrath in Germany, these were withdrawn from use in 1988 and were replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Andover.
The Finnish Air Force operated two aircraft for aerial photography between 1956 to 1968, on behalf of the National Land Survey of Finland. One of the aircraft was destroyed when it hit a snow wall during landing in 1965. The other aircraft is currently stored at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland.Keskinen et al.: Suomen museolentokoneet p. 48, (1981), Forssa, Tietoteos, ISBN 951-9035-60-5
