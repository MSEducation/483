[[List of cities and towns in Iceland]]

CATEGORIES: Populated places in Iceland, Lists of cities by country, Iceland geography-related lists

This is a list of cities and towns in Iceland. Some of Iceland’s larger cities and towns are also self-contained municipalities whose geography and populations are therefore equal. However, most of Iceland’s municipalities, which are semi-autonomous administrative zones, contain several disparate towns or cities, each of whose population contributes to that of its respective municipality. 
In addition to Iceland's many independent towns, this article includes cities and towns whose municipalities consist of one, self-contained city of the same name, such as Hafnarfjörður and Akranes. Municipalities that are not also cities or towns, such as Árborg, are not included here, but their constituent towns and cities are. For Árborg, these include the towns of Selfoss, Eyrarbakki, and Stokkseyri.
