The Soviets turned the city of Kabul into their command centre during the 10-year conflict between pro-Soviet Afghan government and the Mujahideen rebels, who were funded by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Kabul remained relatively calm during that period as fighting was mostly in the countryside and in other major cities. In April 1988, the Geneva Accords were signed between Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the United States and the Soviet Union serving as guarantors. In August 1988, President Zia-ul-Haq, General Rahman and other top Pakistani officials, including U.S. Ambassador Arnold Lewis Raphel, were killed in a mysterious plane crash in neighboring Pakistan. The American Embassy in Kabul closed in January 1989.

===Civil war and Taliban regime===

"The Mujahideen continued to fight against the government of Najibullah, the Soviet puppet president who had replaced Babrak Karmal in 1986. Najibullah had proposed cease fires during those years, but the rebels said they would not negotiate with puppets - and they gained ground strategically until the Soviets admitted defeat and left." After the fall of Najibullah's Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in April 1992, leaders of the different mujahideen factions were unable to form a government so they resorted to fighting.
Pakistan supplied Hezbi Islami forces of Hekmatyar, Iran supported the Shi'a Hezbe Wahdat forces of Abdul Ali Mazari, and Saudi Arabia backed Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. "Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held hotly contested meetings with the ISI chief, his other ministers, and the Mujahideen in Peshawar and the Hezbi Islami faction, headed by Hekmatyar, who was deeply loyal to the Pakistani military dictatorship. Hekmatyar's troops started firing mortats into Kabul. Najibullah took refuge in the UN compound after being stopped by General Dostum's forces from boarding a United Nations airplane at the Kabul airport. On April 24, the Afghan army and the Mujahideen took Kabul peacefully, and throughout the city the various factions staked out zones of control."Bowersox (p.192)
The 1992 Peshawar Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed Burhanuddin Rabbani, an ethnic Tajik, as head of a transitional government to be followed by general elections.[tpl]cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = Human Rights Watch |quote=During most of the period discussed in this report, the sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in "The Islamic State of Afghanistan," an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah government... With the exception of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, all of the parties listed above were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992 (but as described below, Wahdat later changed sides, in late 1992, and allied with Hezb-e Islami)... Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally. (Mazari's Wahdat forces joined in these efforts in late 1992.)[/tpl] Another ethnic Tajik, Ahmad Shah Massoud, became Defense Minister and the Pashtun Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as Prime Minister. After the interim period expired, Rabbani, founder and leader of Jamiat-e Islami, which is connected to Pakistan's Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, refused to step down and a full-scale civil war began. Amin Saikal explains that under Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif "Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in Central Asia. ... Islamabad could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders ... to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions.
In December 1992, the last of the 86 city trolley buses in Kabul came to a halt because of the conflict. A system of 800 public buses continued to provide transportation services to the city. By 1993 electricity and water in the city was completely out. Initially the factions in the city aligned to fight off Hekmatyar but diplomacy inside the capital quickly broke down.Nazif M Shahrani, "War, Factionalism and the State in Afghanistan" in American Anthropologist 104:3 (Arlington, Virginia: American Anthropological Association, 2008), 719.

Additionally to the bombardment campaign conducted by Hekmatyar and Dostum, tension between the Shi'a Hazara forces of Abdul Ali Mazari and the Wahabi Ittihad-i Islami of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf soon escalated into a second violent conflict. The fighting between the two factions quickly took on aspects of "ethnic cleansing".Sidky, "War, Changing Patterns of Warfare, State Collapse, and Transnational Violence in Afghanistan: 1978–2001", 870. According to Human Rights Watch, numerous Iranian agents were assisting Hezbe Wahdat, as "Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence in the new government".GUTMAN, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington D.C.

In January 1994, Dostum joined an alliance with Hekmatyar and conducted the worst bombardment of Kabul during that period, but were eventually repelled by forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud who also bombarded the city to gain control . In late 1994, bombardment of the capital came to a temporary halt.[tpl]cite web |year=2005|url=http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |title =Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978-2001 | publisher = Afghanistan Justice Project[/tpl]Amnesty International.

The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

===NATO presence and the Karzai administration===

In October 2001, US-led forces provided air support to the Northern Alliance (United Front) forces during Operation Enduring Freedom. The Taliban began abandoning Kabul while the United Front was heading to take control of the government. In December 2001, the Karzai administration under President Hamid Karzai officially took over the government.
In early 2002, a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in the city and from there they spread to other parts of the country. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as millions of ex-pats returned to the country. The city's population has grown from about 500,000 in 2001 to 3 million by 2007. Many foreign embassies re-opened, including the U.S. Embassy. Afghan government institutions were also renovated. Since 2008 the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are in charge of security in the city.
While the city is being developed, it is the scene of occasional deadly suicide bombings and explosions carried out by the Haqqani network, Taliban's Quetta Shura, Hezbi Islami, al-Qaeda, and other anti-government elements who are claimed to be supported and guided by Pakistan.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-isi-urged-attacks-u-targets-officials-002201562.html |title=U.S. blames Pakistan agency in Kabul attack |publisher=Reuters |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=September 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/17/us-pakistan-usa-haqqani-idUSTRE78G1RM20110917 |title=U.S. links Pakistan to group it blames for Kabul attack |date=September 17, 2011 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=September 21, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/09/18/clinton-presses-pakistan-to-help-fight-haqqani-insurgent-group/ |title=Clinton Presses Pakistan to Help Fight Haqqani Insurgent Group |publisher=Fox News |date=September 18, 2011 |accessdate=September 21, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-condemns-us-comments-spy-agency-044440789.html;_ylt=A2KJ3vVYX3xOdRkA9EZXNyoA?rnd=005681253004174930714413 |title=Pakistan condemns US comments about spy agency |agency=Associated Press |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=September 23, 2011[/tpl] For example, in September 2011, heavily armed Taliban insurgents wearing suicide vests struck the U.S. Embassy and NATO headquarters.

Ordinary Afghans may have taken cues from their leaders and taken more offense at the incident than they otherwise might have. As the Afghan government rushes into taking over security responsibility from NATO the security situation in the country is deteriorating. In 2012, it forced the United States to hand over control of the Parwan Detention Facility where thousands of militants are held. The United States had favored a gradual transition of the facility until 2014.

==Geography, climate and environment==

Kabul serves as the nation's cultural and learning center, situated [tpl]convert|1791|m|ft|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River.

Autumn features warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are cold, with a January daily average of [tpl]convert|−2.3|°C|1[/tpl]. Spring is the wettest time of the year, though temperatures are generally amiable. Sunny conditions dominate year-round. The annual mean temperature is [tpl]convert|12.1|°C|1[/tpl].

==Demographics==

The population of Kabul has fluctuated since the early 1980s to the present period. It was believed to be around 500,000 in 2001 but then many Afghan expats began returning from Pakistan and Iran where they had taken refuge from the decades of wars.Urban Development In Kabul: An Overview Of Challenges And Strategies by Dr. Annette Ittig In 2009, the World Factbook estimated that Kabul's population was little over 3.5 million.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html According to Afghan government statistics, it was estimated around 3,289,000 in the year 2012.Afghanistan Statistical Yearbook 2012/13 (PDF), Central Statistics Office Afghanistan It should be noted that many Afghans from other provinces stay in Kabul on temporary bases, to spend time with relatives due to fighting or for other reasons.
The population of the city reflects the general multi-ethnic and multi-lingual characteristics of Afghanistan. There is no official government report on the precise ethnic make-over but according to a 2003 map found in the National Geographic Magazine, the population of the city was estimated at 45% Tajiks, 25% Hazaras, 25% Pashtuns, 2% Uzbeks, 1% Baloch, 1% Turkmen, and 1% Hindu.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0311/feature2/images/mp_download.2.pdf |title=2003 National Geographic Population Map |format=PDF |work=Thomas Gouttierre, Center For Afghanistan Studies, University of Nebraska at Omaha; Matthew S.

Regional airlines such as Turkish Airlines, Gulf Air, Indian Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Iranian Airlines, and others also make frequent stops at Kabul International Airport. A new international terminal was built by the government of Japan and began operation since 2008, which is the first of three terminals to be opened so far. The other two will open once air traffic to the city increases. Passengers coming from most foreign nations use mostly Dubai for flights to Kabul. Kabul Airport also has a military terminal and a section of airport is used by the United States armed forces and the Afghan National Air Force. NATO also uses the Kabul Airport, but most military traffic is based at Bagram Airfield, situated north of Kabul. The Afghan Border Police and the Afghan National Police are in charge of the airport security.
Airports in Kabul include;

====Railways====

Kabul has no train service yet but the government plans to build rail lines to connect the city with Mazar-i-Sharif in the north and Jalalabad-Torkham in the east. It also plans to build a metro rail in the future.

====Bus====

Long distance road journeys are made by private Mercedes-Benz coach buses or various types of vans, trucks and cars. Although a nation wide bus service is available from Kabul, flying is safer, especially for foreigners. The city's public bus service (Milli Bus / "National Bus") was established in the 1960s to take commuters on daily routes to many destinations. The service currently has about 800 buses, but it is gradually expanding and upgrading the fleet. The Kabul bus system has recently discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from MTN similar to "bus wrap" advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There is also an express bus that runs from the city centre to Kabul International Airport for Safi Airways passengers.

====Automobiles====

Private vehicles are on the rise in Kabul, with Toyota, Nissan, and other dealerships in the city. Most drivers in Kabul prefer owning a Toyota Corolla, one of Afghanistan's most popular cars. It has been reported that up to 90% of cars in Kabul are Corollas.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/26/AR2010082606430_2.html?g=0 |work=The Washington Post |title=In Afghanistan, a car for the masses |first=David |last=Nakamura |date=2010-08-27[/tpl]Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Dodgy cars clogging Kabul's roads Gas stations are mainly private-owned and the fuel comes from Pakistan, Iran and Kazakhstan.

==Development projects==

Kabul is a symbol of international cooperation as well as the spirit the Afghan people. It sits in the heart of resource rich region, and it has the potential to turn into a major commercial hub for all of Afghanistan. After 2002, new geo-political dynamics and the resultant expansion of business opportunities, along with rapid urban population growth, triggered plans for expansion and modernization in Kabul.
City officials want to see the poorly built residential houses situated on mountains to be demolished so that trees and other plants can be grown on the hills. They call for a greener city and to provide residents with a more suitable place to live, on a flat surface. Once implemented it will provide water supply and electricity to each house. All the city roads will also be paved under the plan, which is to solve transportation problems. A $1 billion USD contract was signed in 2013 to commence work on the "New Kabul City", which is a major residential scheme that would accommodate 1.5 million people.[tpl]cite news |title=$1b contract signed to begin work on New Kabul City plan |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/09/04/1b-contract-signed-begin-work-new-kabul-city-plan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News -|editor=Muhammad Hassan Khetab |date=4 September 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dcda.gov.af/ |title=Welcome to our Official Website |publisher=DCDA |accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl] In the meantime, many high rise buildings are being constructed in order to control the overcrowding and also to modernize the city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://onyx.af/developmenteam.htm |title=Onyx Construction Company |publisher=Onyx.af |accessdate=2012-08-17[/tpl]
Mayor Muhammad Yunus Nawandish has brought many municipal reform efforts by the USAID's "Kabul City Initiative" project, the World Bank, Japanese's JICA and other international donors to build municipal capacity, improve service delivery and infrastructure, and increase municipal revenue for a cleaner and greener Kabul. The city's major projects include a Kabul cable car, connecting the city to Shirdarwaza mountain, a tunnel though mountains close to Kabul University to reduce traffic jams, building more flyovers in the city with the city's first fly-over being built with the help of Turkey; in addition to providing more trucks and lorries for the municipality.
An initial concept design called the City of Light Development, envisioned by Dr. Hisham N. Ashkouri, for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul, along the southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,Kabul – City of Light Project...link revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City.
