[[Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers]]

CATEGORIES: Triangle centers, Mathematical databases

The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC) is an online list of more than 5,000 points or "centers" associated with the geometry of a triangle. It is maintained by Clark Kimberling, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Evansville.
[tpl]As of|2014|3|12[/tpl], the list identifies 5,641 triangle centers.
Each point in the list is identified by an index number of the form X(n)â€”for example, X(1) is the incenter. The information recorded about each point includes its trilinear and barycentric coordinates and its relation to lines joining other identified points. Links to The Geometer's Sketchpad diagrams are provided for key points. The Encyclopedia also includes a glossary of terms and definitions.
Each point in the list is assigned a unique name. In cases where no particular name arises from geometrical or historical considerations, the name of a star is used instead. For example the 770th point in the list, is named point Acamar.
