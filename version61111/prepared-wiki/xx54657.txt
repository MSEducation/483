The Plymouth Brethren is a conservative, low church, nonconformist, Evangelical Christian movement, whose history can be traced to Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s, originating from Anglicanism.[tpl]cite web|first=Shawn |last=Abigail |date=June 2006 |title=What is the history of the 'Brethren'? |url=http://brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm#3 |work="Plymouth Brethren" FAQ |accessdate=12 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|first=Harold |last=Mackay |title=Assembly Distinctives |publisher=Everyday Publications |location=Scarborough, Ontario |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-88873-049-7 |oclc=15948378[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Among other beliefs, the group emphasizes sola scriptura, the belief that the Bible is the supreme authority for church doctrine and practice over tradition.  The churches are all independent, self-governing, local congregations, and there are no central headquarters or formal affiliation with any denomination.  Although the group is notable for not taking any official "church name" to itself, the title "The Brethren," is one that many of their number are comfortable with in that the Bible designates all believers as "brethren". "Brethren assemblies" are commonly perceived as being divided into at least two branches, the "Open Brethren" and the "Exclusive Brethren".

==History==

The origins of the Brethren are usually traced to Dublin where several groups of Christians met informally to celebrate the Lord's Supper together in the Dublin in 1827–8. Of these the central figures were Anthony Norris Groves, a dentist studying theology at Trinity College, Edward Cronin, studying medicine, John Nelson Darby, then a curate in County Wicklow and John Gifford Bellett, a lawyer, who brought them together. "A circle was to be drawn just wide enough to include 'all the children of God,' and to exclude all who did not come under that category."[tpl]harvnb|Neatby|1901|p=17[/tpl] They did not require ministers or even an order of service. Their guide was to be the Bible alone.
An important early stimulus was in the study of prophecy which was the subject of a number of annual meetings at Powerscourt House in County Wicklow starting in 1831. Lady Powerscourt had attended Henry Drummond's prophecy conferences at Albury Park and Darby in 1831 was espousing the same pre-tribulational view of the future as the charismatic but unreliable Edward Irving. Many of those who were to be important in the English movement came to these meetings, including Benjamin Wills Newton and George Müller.
The two main but conflicting aspirations of the movement were to create a holy and pure fellowship on one hand, and to allow all Christians into fellowship on the other. Following decades of dissent, and the expansion of Methodism and political revolutions in the United States and France, believers in the movement felt that the established Church of England had abandoned or distorted many of the ancient traditions of Christendom. To get away from the sectarianism of dissenters, people in the movement wanted simply to meet together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ without reference to denominational differences. Early meetings included Christians from a variety of denominations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The first meeting in England was held in December 1831[tpl]Cite book|first=Jonathan D. |last=Burnham |year=2004 |title=A Story of Conflict: The Controversial Relationship Between Benjamin Wills Newton and John Nelson Darby |chapter=The Emergence of the Plymouth Brethren |publisher=Paternoster Press |location=Carlisle |isbn=978-1-84227-191-9 |oclc=56336926[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] in Plymouth. It was organised primarily by George Wigram, Benjamin Wills Newton and John Nelson Darby.[tpl]Cite book|first=Elizabeth A. |last=Livingstone |year=2000 |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280057-2 |oclc=46858944[/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The movement soon spread throughout the United Kingdom. By 1845, the assembly in Plymouth had over 1,000 people in fellowship.[tpl]Cite book|first=Napoleon |last=Noel |year=1936 |title=The History of the Brethren |publisher=Knapp |location=Denver |page=46 |oclc=2807272[/tpl] They became known as "the brethren from Plymouth" and were soon simply called "Plymouth Brethren". The term "Darbyites" is also used, especially when describing the "Exclusive" branch where the influence of John Nelson Darby is more pronounced. Many within the movement refuse to accept any name other than "Christian".
In 1845, Darby returned from an extended visit to Switzerland where he had achieved considerable success in planting churches. Returning to Plymouth, where Newton was firmly in control, he disagreed with some details of the tribulation that was coming in a book that Newton had published. He also objected to Newton's place as an elder in the Plymouth meeting. But several attempts to settle the quarrel in the presence of other brethren failed to produce any clear result.Neatby comments "The important point is that the Brethren in their first great emergency found themselves absolutely unprepared to grapple with it. They had no constitution of any kind. They repudiated congregationalism, but they left their communities to fight their battles on no acknowledged basis and with no defined court of appeal."[tpl]harvnb|Neatby|1901|p=61[/tpl] Two years later, Darby attacked Newton over notes taken by hearers of a lecture Newton had given on the 6th Psalm. A fierce exchange of tracts followed and although Newton retracted some of his statements, he eventually left Plymouth and established another chapel in London.
Darby had instituted a second meeting at Plymouth, and in 1848 he complained of the Bristol Bethesda assembly, in which George Müller was prominent, that they had accepted a member from Ebrington Street, Newton's original chapel. After investigation of the individual, Bethesda defended their decision, but Darby was not satisfied. He issued a circular on August 26, 1848, cutting off not only Bethesda but all assemblies who received anyone who went there. This defined the essential characteristic of "exclusivism" that he was to pursue for the rest of his life.[tpl]harvnb|Neatby|1901|pp=61–84[/tpl]
The Exclusive Brethren have suffered many subsequent splits. McDowell records at least six. The Open Brethren also suffered one split (due to the autonomy of assemblies) which occurred at different times in different parts of the world. But both sides continued to expand their congregations, with the opens, with their emphasis on faith missions, expanding more rapidly than the exclusives.[ref]
e.g. in the US in 1916, the Open Brethren accounted for 71% of a total of 13,700 brethren, though only 61% of 473 assemblies.

The Brethren and other evangelical churches have been in decline in the UK since the 1950s, but the assemblies with more progressive approaches have grown. There has been a blurring of distinctions between some assemblies and other non-denominational and house church congregations. Some groups have abandoned earlier principles, such as rejection of a salaried ministry and insistence on women's silence.G.Brown. "Whatever Happened to the Brethren?" Partnership, Paternoster Press. 2003.[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] However those assemblies that have abandoned these principles, by allowing paid ministry and allowing women to teach openly from the pulpit, are often referred to as "Bible" churches by those retaining older Brethren views.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] The "Bible" churches look more like traditional non-denominational congregations.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]
Some fellowships maintain these distinctive principles while updating many traditions and practices, while others continue in much the same way as they have for most of the 20th century. The more traditional assemblies in the UK today can be found in Northern Ireland (where other denominations refer to them as 'Plyms'), Scotland, Northern England and parts of the South of England, like Hampshire. Outside the British Isles, the brethren have a large presence in the Faroe Islands, forming the largest non-conformist group amongst a population that predominantly belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark.[tpl]cite web | title = "Plymouth Brethren in the Faroes" |url=http://www.visitfaroeislands.com/Default.aspx?ID=8946[/tpl]
The Brethren movement is widespread in the United States and Canada, where it has spread through evangelistic endeavours, immigration from the UK and Commonwealth countries, and by attracting Christians from other backgrounds with its emphasis on Biblicism, centrality of the Lord's Supper and equality of all male believers under Christ, as well as its avoidance of denominational governance. Open Brethren congregations in America often are barely distinguishable from other evangelical denominations on the outside and often engage in joint efforts with other Christians in their communities. On the other hand, some previously thriving Brethren assemblies have seen dwindling attendances in recent years due in part to the lack of strong denominational loyalties and cultural discomfort with some brethren practices, such as head covering for women and silence of women in preaching and teaching in main services.  In America, the designation of the building in which Open Brethren assemblies meet most often include the word "Chapel" in their formal name, combined with a biblical place name or principle or otherwise a local geographic feature—for instance, Bethany Chapel, Central Gospel Chapel, Park Road Bible Chapel, Riverview Believers Chapel. But unlike many other Christian groups, the names of Christian saints, (e.g. Paul, Luke) are rarely or never used.  Closed groups, however, avoid "taking a name" to their group.  A Closed group building is referred to as a "Meeting Room" or "Gospel Hall", and the word "Chapel" is avoided.

==Worldwide expansion==

The expansion of the Plymouth Brethren outside of the UK started early, when Anthony Norris Groves left to become a missionary in 1829, first in Baghdad and then in India. Although his work as a dentist in the Godavari delta area of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu progressed slowly, it produced in time a flourishing movement of Indian Brethren with a particular emphasis in Kerala.
JN Darby's visits to Switzerland between 1835 and 1840 with critiques of Methodist perfectionism resulted in the establishment of meetings in Vevey in 1838 and Lausanne in 1840 drawn from some of the dissenting churches.[tpl]harvnb|Neatby|1901|p=41[/tpl] Later he moved to France establishing outposts in the Montpellier region. During this time he was also translating the New Testament into French. "During the five years that followed Darby’s arrival in Lausanne, his principles spread far and wide in French Switzerland, and obtained some successes in Berne and Bâle."[tpl]harvnb|Neatby|1901|p=44[/tpl]
The next move came from a visit by George Müller to a Baptist church in Stuttgart in 1843 at the invitation of a lady who had visited him in Bristol. "One or two of the elders having determined to reject him, a meeting "for the breaking of bread" was started in his private room the same evening. Seventeen persons were present." In 1854, Darby visited Germany with meetings being set up at Elberfeld and Düsseldorf among others.
Itinerant preachers carried both the open and exclusive brethren to North America after the middle of the 19th century. Darby made a number of visits in the 1870s and his emphasis on prophecy was influential. They continued to multiply and divide and currently number around 120,000 in 1,250 assemblies.
Because there is little central organization, it is very difficult to know how many there are today and estimates vary from 1 million[ref][tpl]cite web | last = Abigail | first = Shawn | title = "Plymouth Brethren" FAQ |year=2006| url=http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-19 [/tpl]
[/ref] to as many as 2.5 million attenders in 25,000 congregations. The vast majority of these are Open Brethren. The number of Taylor-Hales brethren is given as 46,000 and there are possibly as many again in other Exclusive groups. Piepkorn estimated the number of Open Brethren in North America in 1970 as 60,000 in 1,050 assemblies, with a total maximum of 10,000 Exclusives in 300 assemblies. In Germany there are a total of 40-45,000.:de:Brüderbewegung
Brethren missionaries are still active in many parts of the world (1,223 from England, North America and Australasia[tpl]harvnb|Abigail|2006[/tpl]) and there are assemblies in Chile, Dominican Republic, Peru and South Africa, among others.

==Characteristics==

thumb|200px|right|Cregagh Street Gospel Hall, Belfast.The Plymouth Brethren are generally dispensational, pre-tribulational, premillennial in their theology and have much in common with other conservative evangelical Christian groups. They believe in the "Eternal Security" of the true Bible-believing Christian with each believer being subject to "grace" and not "law".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gracebeliever.com/articles/articles/stronger.htm |title=Which Is Stronger: Law Or Grace?|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] In Open Brethren meetings each local assembly is independent and autonomous, so the characteristics of each may differ to a greater or lesser degree, which makes it difficult to describe distinctive characteristics. Exclusive Brethren meetings are more affiliated to one another, but characterising their meetings is made difficult because over the years they have split many times into many divisions.
Essentially, therefore, the Brethren have no central hierarchy to dictate a statement of faith, and even local assemblies tend not to give tacit adherence to any of the historic "Creeds" and "Confessions of Faith" such as are found in many Protestant denominations. This is not because they are opposed to the central sentiments and doctrines expressed in such formulations but rather because they hold the Bible as their sole authority in regard to matters of doctrine and practice. Like many non-conformist churches, Brethren observe only the two ordinances of Baptism and Communion.
Their notable differences from other Christian groups lie in a number of doctrinal beliefs that affect the practice of their gatherings and behaviour. These differences can be summarised as follows:

===Avoidance of traditional symbols===

Traditionally, meetings do not have a cross displayed inside or outside their place of worship as the focus is on Christ and the Word of God.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.assemblycare.org/library/books/WHTFOUND.pdf|title=What foundation|publisher=Assembly Care|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The Plymouth Brethren view an unembellished room as more effective.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pembrokebiblechapel.com/pdf/TheBrethrenAndrewMiller.pdf |title=The Brethren|last=Miller|first=Andrew|page=10|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://cnview.com/churches_today/what_i_have_found.htm |title=What I have Found|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] Crosses are not typically placed inside homes or worn around the neck by these believers. Other symbols such as stained glass windows for their normal meeting hall have been traditionally discouraged. Their meeting places sometimes have Bible names, e.g., "Ebenezer," "Hebron," "Shiloh" and "Bethel"; sometimes they are named after the street on which they are found, e.g. Curzon Street Gospel Hall, Derby; sometimes after the locality, e.g. Ballynagarrick Gospel Hall. Some use the name Chapel instead of Gospel Hall.
Meetings do not follow a set liturgy nor the liturgical calendar of "High Church" groups, such as the Anglican or Lutheran churches.
The Brethren do not generally name their meeting rooms or Halls except by reference perhaps to the road, e.g. Galpins Road Meeting Room, Mallow Street Hall. The meeting room or Hall  is often referred to as "The Room" or "The Hall". Notice boards give the times of Gospel Preachings with a formula such as "If the Lord will, the Gospel will be preached in this room Lord's Day at 6.30." Symington/Taylor/Hales meeting rooms have notice boards which indicate that it is a place registered for public worship and give a contact number for further information - see photograph.

===Fellowship, not membership===

Traditionally the assemblies have rejected the concept of anyone "joining" as a member of a particular local gathering of believers and the maintenance of any list of such members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.believershome.com/html/who_are_the_brethren.html |title=Who are the Brethren?|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] Brethren emphasise the Christian doctrine of the one "Church" made up of all true believers and enumerated in Heaven in "Lamb's Book of Life",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13:8&version=NASB |title=Revelation 13:8 |accessdate=2009-12-28[/tpl] rather than by humans. However, as a practical matter, in the late 20th century many American Open assemblies began maintaining informal lists of those in regular attendance at meetings. This was often to comply with secular governance issues or to offer a directory of attendees for internal use. The Open Brethren emphasise that meeting attendance for the nonbeliever has no direct spiritual benefit (though it is hoped the individual may be influenced to convert). Nonbelievers are not to partake of the "Breaking of Bread", though this proves generally difficult to enforce in larger Open assemblies. Regardless, regular attendance for believers is felt to be an act of obedience to the New Testament command that they should not neglect the assembling of themselves together.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10:23-25&version=NASB |title=Hebrews 10:25 |accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl] Despite the Brethren's rejection of the term 'member', many observers use the term to refer to those who attend meetings.  The concept of not having an official membership is not so clear cut among the Exclusives, as people who wish to break bread must be affiliated with a "home assembly" to which they are responsible in terms of lifestyle choices.  Visiting brethren are usually expected to bring a "letter of commendation" from their "home assembly", assuring the group they are visiting that they are in fellowship and not under any form of discipline.

===No clergy===

While much of typical Brethren theology closely parallels non-Calvinist English and American Baptist traditions on many points, the view on clergy is much closer to the Quakers in rejecting the idea of clergy. Many Protestant denominations claim adherence to the New Testament doctrine of the priesthood of all believers[tpl]Bibleref2c|1Pet|2:9–10[/tpl] to varying extents. The Plymouth Brethren embrace the most extensive form of that idea in that there is no ordained or unordained person or group employed to function as minister(s) or pastor(s). The spiritual leaders of certain Plymouth Brethren assemblies or meetings are termed "Elders" (though this is never used as a title in any sense, particularly it is never used as a title of address), and sometimes more practical leaders, called "Deacons", are identified. The term "Elder" is based on the same Scriptures that are used to identify "Bishops" and "Overseers" in other Christian circles,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.days.org/eldersandbishops.html |title=Elders and Bishops|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] and some claim that the system of recognition of elders by the assembly means that the Plymouth Brethren as a movement cannot claim full adherence to the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.batteredsheep.com/priesthood.html |title=The Priesthood of All Believers|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl] However, this reveals a mistaken understanding of the priesthood of all believers which in the Assemblies has to do with the ability to directly offer worship, whether silently or audibly, to God and His Christ, at the Lord's Supper without any human mediator being necessary – which is in accordance with 1Tim 2:5 where it is stated that Christ Jesus Himself is the sole Mediator between God and men ("men", being used here generically of mankind, and not referring simply and solely to "males").  There is usually more than one elder in an assembly and although officially naming and recognizing "eldership" is common to Open Brethren (cf. 1Thess 5:12–13), there are many Exclusive assemblies that believe recognizing a man as an "elder" is too close to having clergy, and therefore a group of "leading brothers", none of whom has an official title of any kind, attempts to present issues to the entire group for it to decide upon, believing that the whole group must decide, not merely a body of "elders". (As in all Exclusive Brethren meetings, women are generally not permitted to speak at meetings at which the entire group makes "assembly decisions", and in many groups women may not attend these affairs.) As autonomous chapels there is no single doctrine on female participation in chapel services - some chapels allow women to take part on an equal footing to men, others do not.
Plymouth Brethren groups generally recognise from the teachings of the Apostle Paul's epistles that not all the believers in any one fellowship are suited to give public ministry such as teaching and preaching.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Eph&c=4&v=11&t=NKJV#s=1101011 |title=Ephesians IV, 11|accessdate=2013-10-12[/tpl]
As a practical matter, many Open as well as Exclusive assemblies have come to embrace the need to financially compensate an individual who has made preaching and teaching his full-time occupation, and these people are sometimes salaried or, perhaps more commonly, variously compensated as the Lord's people provide. Such an individual may be termed a "full-time worker" (or a "labouring brother" or "on the Lord's work"). At a given assembly, there may be no full-time workers, or one or several. It is generally up to the elders and dependent on the availability of such an individual and the financial means of the assembly. Some Exclusive assemblies "commend" men who are dedicated to the work of preaching. Although they usually do not receive a salary, gifts are often given to them by the separate assemblies where they preach and teach.  This practice is also quite common among the Open assemblies.
Traditionally, the assemblies have recognized New Testament passages that seem to deny speaking and teaching roles to women, except when working with children or with other women. Some women may also be full-time workers, but their efforts are often limited to these mentioned areas or to supporting roles. Women are generally not allowed to participate in individual speech during the "Breaking of Bread" meeting (i.e., gathering). (see Separate Roles of Men and Women)
As autonomous chapels there is no single doctrine on female participation in chapel services - some chapels allow women to take part on an equal footing to men, others do not.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
It is not strictly accurate to say that the assemblies reject the ordination of women. The assemblies reject the concept of ordination altogether. As a substitute practice, a male full-time worker often receives a "commendation" to the ministry, or work, of preaching and/or teaching that demonstrates the blessing and support of the assembly of origin, but that does not connote a transfer of any special spiritual authority. In some groups, both men and women may be commended to various forms of ministry, or work, but again the role of women is limited. In recent years some American assemblies have loosened the rules on women participating, such as women singing, or performing, special music during the "family Bible hours" at their assemblies, though others have reacted by placing more emphasis on this traditional teaching.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

===Weekly "Remembrance" meeting===

A distinctive practice of the Brethren is a separate weekly Communion meeting, referred to as the "Breaking of Bread" or "The Lord's Supper". Although specific practices will vary from meeting to meeting, there are general similarities.

===Other Sunday meetings===

Following the Remembrance meeting there may be one other Sunday meeting, or perhaps more. Whereas the purpose of the Lord's Supper is predominantly for worship, recalling the person and work of Christ, other meetings involve Bible teaching, evangelism and gospel preaching (among young and old). Sunday Schools and Bible classes are common. In ministry and Gospel meetings the congregation, seated in rows facing a pulpit or platform, sing hymns and choruses and listen to Scripture readings and a sermon preached by one of the brethren called to "preach". Bible teaching may be given either in the form of a ministry meeting in which a sermon is delivered or in a "Bible reading" or "Bible study" in which the men discuss a portion of Scripture.

===Low-key offerings taken===

The assemblies do not take an offering during the time their Sunday sermons are preached; but some, not all, do take an offering at the Breaking of Bread meetings. Only those in fellowship are expected to give. Tithing, giving 10 percent of one's income, is seen as commandment for Israel from the Old Testament law and not applicable to the Church. Instead, the amount given is left to the giver and is a private matter between the individual and the Lord.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.preciousseed.org/search_articles.php?search_phrase=church+finance |title=Precious Seed|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl]
One reason for not taking up an offering at all meetings is to avoid causing any unbelievers who may be present to think that they might gain a spiritual benefit by making a donation. Some assemblies never send an offering bag round the congregation, even at the Breaking of Bread meeting. They prefer to simply have a box or two located at the back of the meeting hall, thus avoiding even the appearance of solicitation for funds. Many assemblies operate a "back seat" or "guest row" during the Breaking of Bread so that neither the offering bag nor the emblems of bread and wine will pass down the row of those not in fellowship.

===The role of "pastor"===

See the comments on "No Clergy" above. Brethren assemblies are led by the local church elders within any fellowship and there is no office of "pastor" among Brethren churches, because the term "pastor" is not found anywhere in the original koine Greek language of the New Testament. So, there is no formal ordination process for those who preach, teach, or lead, within their meetings. Men who become elders, or those who become deacons and overseers within the fellowship, are ones whom have been recognized by others within the individual assemblies and have been given the blessing of performing leadership tasks by the elders.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icrf.com/articles/casino.htm |title=Defining Religion In American Law|accessdate=2009-07-18[/tpl]
Conversely, an elder should be able and ready to teach when his assembly sees the "Call of God" on his life to assume the office of elder (1 Timothy 3:2). As stated in the New Testament, Brethren elders conduct many other duties that would be typically performed by "the clergy" in other Christian groups, including: counselling those who have decided to be baptized, performing baptisms, visiting the sick and giving spiritual counsel in general. Some Open assemblies, especially the larger assemblies in North America, have some men who are in salaried full-time ministry within the assembly, particularly if it's an elder who regularly preaches. Normally, sermons are given by both the elders and other members of the meeting, but only men who the elders, again, recognize have the "Call of God" on those men's lives. Visiting speakers, however, are usually paid to cover expenses such as the cost of travel and provided for with Sunday meals following the meetings.

===Separate roles of men and women===

No distinction is made in Brethren teaching between men and women in their individual relation to Christ and his "vicarious atonement" for them on the cross, or their individual position before God as believers. However, in most Brethren meetings the principle of "male headship" is applied in accordance with teaching found in several passages in the Bible, including 1 Corinthians 11:3, which says:
"1 The Head of every man is Christ – no equality. 2 The head of the woman is the man – equality and subjection. 3 The Head of Christ is God – equality, yet subjection."Crawford, N. (October 2003). Gathering Unto His Name.Gospel Tract Publications. ISBN 0-948417-07-2, p.76
Thus most Brethren meetings reserve public leadership and teaching roles to men, based on 1 Timothy 2:11,12...:
Also, 1 Corinthians 14:34,35 states, "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church." (The reason for this has to do with acknowledging Headship: Headship and the head covering are seen by many as inseparable since the head covering is intended to teach the meaning of headship. See below for information on the head covering).
From this, Brethren teaching traditionally (there are regional exceptions) outlines a system in which the men take the "vocal" and leadership roles and the women take supportive and "silent" roles. In practical terms, what is traditionally seen is that the men are fully responsible for all preaching, teaching and leading of worship. Therefore, in most Brethren groups women will be heard to sing the hymns along with the group, but their voices will not otherwise be heard during the meeting. Often the men are, practically speaking, the only ones involved fully and vocally in all discussions leading up to administrative decision making as well. Within Exclusive groups in particular, matters up for debate may be discussed at special meetings attended solely by adult males called, in some groups, "Brothers Meetings".
The Head Covering:
[''As to the reason behind women covering their heads at meetings in some groups, 1 Corinthians 11:5,6 says:
For this reason, some meetings will be characterized by the women wearing head coverings ("loaners" in some assemblies are available at the back for women who have come without a covering). Head coverings typically take the form of a tam, beret or similar hat which can be more aptly described as a "head topping," rather than as covering the head in any real way. Sisters in Exclusive ('Jimite') gatherings quite commonly wear a headscarf or "mantilla" (a lace/doily-like Spanish veil) on their heads. It is a fairly common misconception that Exclusive women characteristically wear a shawl over their heads, though no doubt some women have sometimes resorted to this.
While that is an overly-simplified view of the head covering, understanding the purpose for the head covering comes from looking at 1 Corinthians 11:3&4, which says:
"3But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head."
Here is the "picture" that the head covering displays: the Head of the man is Christ, so the man's physical head needs to be uncovered to honor his Head, Christ is displayed. The head of the woman is the man, so the woman's physical head must be covered, men are not on display in the church. The woman's head covering and silence in the church shows that the men participating are not on display but rather that Christ is on display.
Over recent years the practice in some Open and Closed Brethren assemblies throughout the world have developed to leave questions of head coverings, levels of female participation and responsibility mainly to the discretion of individuals and groups.  Concerning levels of female participation in prayer at the Lord's Supper: this is particularly true of assemblies in India which can trace their heritage back to the so-called brother Bakht-Singh assemblies where women are permitted to offer prayer at the Lord's Supper.
Some Brethren of both Open and Exclusive persuasion seek to be completely untouched by changing attitudes within society regarding the role of women. They view the abandonment of the traditionally practised doctrine of Headship as evidence of an overall apostasy (or moral deterioration) within Christendom and as leading to disorder and eventual anarchy within their fellowships.

==Other practices==

===Gatherings and meetings===

Assemblies prefer to use the term "meeting" to describe their gatherings rather than "service". The term "service", to some, is normally associated with a service or something which is offered for a fee.  Assemblies might also have weekly meetings which might include: preaching/teaching meetings, missionary reports, Bible studies and prayer meetings. There is frequently a Sunday School for children and youth groups for teens. Although women do not (usually) verbally participate in the Breaking of Bread meeting, in some groups they take part in Sunday School, teach classes, conduct ladies meetings and are generally very active in "Camping" ministry.

===Music===

During the weekly Breaking of Bread meeting, hymns are traditionally sung unaccompanied by any musical instrument, though some assemblies may have instrumental accompaniment. In some assemblies, hymns sung during the other types of meetings are accompanied by piano or electronic organ, though this practice varies among assemblies. Other musical instruments are used at some assemblies. Some assemblies blend traditional hymns with contemporary "Praise & Worship" music accompanied by bands. One of the unifying features in each of the different branches of the Brethren is a common hymnbook. The first collection used among the united assemblies was, "Hymns for the Poor of the Flock," from 1838 and again in 1840. Another such hymnbook, used by Exclusive Brethren (Tunbridge-Wells and Ames) dating back to 1856 is called, "Hymns and Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock," the first edition of which was compiled by G.V. Wigram. A revision was made in 1881 by J.N. Darby. The Little Flock hymnbook has gone through many different editions in different languages. In modern times one of the more commonly-used English hymn books in British and North American assemblies is The Believers Hymn Book.

=="Open" and "Exclusive" Brethren==

The term "Exclusive" is most commonly used in the media to describe one separatist group known by other groups as "Taylor-Hales Brethren", who now call themselves the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church. The majority of Christians known as "Brethren" are not in any way connected with the Taylor-Hales group, who are known for their extreme interpretation of separation from evil and their belief of what constitutes fellowship.  In their view, fellowship includes dining out, business and professional partnerships, membership of clubs etc., rather than just the act of Communion (Lord's Supper), so these activities are done only with other members.  What other groups refer to as the "Raven" Brethren (named for prominent Exclusive leader Mr. Raven) seceded from the Raven-Taylor-Hales group and are less strict and isolationist.  Exclusive Brethren groups that are not in any way affiliated with, nor as isolationist as the PBCC (the "Kelly-Lowe-Glanton" groups, for instance) are happier being called "Closed" rather than "Exclusive" brethren, so as to avoid any connection with these more militant groups.
There is also a distinction to be recognized between the Open assemblies, called "Chapels," and the Closed assemblies (not exclusive), called "Gospel Halls." To reiterate, neither of these groups is exclusive, but the Gospel Halls regard reception to the assembly as an important matter. One is not received to the Lord's Supper, but to the fellowship of the assembly. This is important because the Lord's Supper is for believers, not unbelievers. Some Chapels, on the other hand, will allow practically anyone who walks in and says he is a Christian to participate, based on the newcomer's profession of faith. The Gospel Halls would generally not use musical instruments in their services, whereas some Chapels use them and may have singing groups, choirs, "worship teams" of musicians, etc.  The Gospel Halls would be more conservative in dress—women would not wear trousers in meetings and would always have their heads covered, while in most Chapels women may wear whatever they wish, though modesty in dress serves as a guideline and many continue to wear a head covering.
With the exception of the separatist PBCC, Exclusive Brethren differ on few theological issues. Some Exclusives hold to "Household Baptism" as opposed to "Believers' Baptism", which is practised by the Open Brethren. With the exception of the Lord's Supper, all assemblies welcome visitors to Gospel meetings and other gatherings. Some Open Brethren assemblies allow any believer to "break bread" with them, and are said to have an "open table" approach to strangers. Others believe that only those formally recognised as part of that or another equivalent assembly should break bread. Similarly, practices of reception among "Exclusive" assemblies vary, many tending to operate a cautious or "guarded" approach to reception and others being more liberal. It is felt by many Brethren that the mutual fellowship with bread and wine can be tainted by the inclusion of those whose hearts are not pure before God. Fellowship in the Lord's Supper is not considered a private matter but a corporate expression, "Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf." (1 Corinthians 10:17) A further verse that Brethren refer to is, "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?" (Amos 3:3) Many, both Closed and Open Brethren, hold that association with evil defiles and that sharing the Communion meal can bring that association. Their support text is from 1 Corinthians 15:33, "Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."
A clearer difference between Open and Exclusive assemblies is in the nature of relationships between meetings. Open Brethren meetings are generally local assemblies that are autonomous but often informally linked with each other. Exclusive Brethren are generally "connexional" and so feel under obligation to recognise and adhere to the disciplinary actions of other associated assemblies. Disciplinary action normally involves denying the individual the breaking of bread (taking of communion) on Sunday mornings, and to varying degrees, dependant upon which kind of Brethren group it is, may also involve forms of formal social ostracism or shunning.  (For instance, people placed "under discipline" may be asked not to attend any group functions which are purely social, and people may decline to eat with and shake hands with members who are under discipline.)  One practical result of this might be that among Open Brethren, should a member be "disciplined" in one assembly other assemblies may feel free to allow the member to break bread with them (if they are not concerned by whatever caused the disciplinary action of the one in question). A numerically small movement known as the Needed Truth Brethren emerged from the Open Brethren, around 1892, partly in an attempt to address the problem of making discipline more effective.
Reasons for being put "under discipline" by both the Open and Exclusive Brethren include refusing to recant and disseminating what is, in the eyes of the fellowship, gross Scriptural or doctrinal error, and/or being involved in what is deemed sexual immorality (including adulterous, homosexual, or premarital sex). Being accused of irregular or illegal financial dealings may also result in being put under discipline.  In Exclusive meetings, a member "under discipline" in one assembly would not be accepted (allowed to "break bread" or play an active teaching and worshipping role) in another assembly, as the Assembly generally respects the decisions made by the other Assembly. As Exclusives have developed into a number of different branches, often when there was not universal agreement among the assemblies in a specific case of excommunication, a particular act of discipline may not be recognised by all assemblies.  Exclusives are also much more adherent to the shunning (or "shutting up") of the offending party, using instructions given for dealing with a "leprous house" in Leviticus 14:34–48 as guidance.  In extreme cases, members may be asked to shun or divorce members of their immediate families (as described in Ngaire Thomas[tpl]cite web|author=Ngaire Thomas |url=http://www.behind-closed-doors.org |title=Behind Closed Doors |publisher=Behind Closed Doors |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl]' book Behind Closed Doors).
Another less clear difference between assemblies lies in their approaches to collaborating with other Christians. Some Open Brethren will hold Gospel meetings, youth events, or other activities in partnership with Evangelical Christian churches, while others (and perhaps the majority of Exclusive Brethren) tend not to support activities outside their own meetings.
Since the formation of the Exclusives in 1848, there have been a great number of subdivisions into separate groups, but most groups have since re-joined with the exception of the separatist Taylor-Hales (otherwise known as 'Jimite' from their following of James Taylor Jnr at the division in 1970) groups who practise extreme separation and whom other Brethren generally believe to be a cult. This, and other Exclusive groups (Closed Brethren), prefer not to be known by any name and are only given such designations by non-members.
Both Open and Exclusive assemblies generally maintain relations within their respective groups through common support of missionaries, area conferences and the ministry of travelling "Commended Workers" or "Labouring Brothers."

==Influence==

The influence of the Plymouth Brethren upon evangelical Christianity exceeds their relatively small numerical proportion. The movement today has many congregations around the world.
Christian Missions in Many Lands (CMML), in the United States, Missionary Service Committee (MSC), in Canada, and Echoes of Service, in the United Kingdom, serve as support agencies for Brethren missionaries, helping with logistics and material support. These agencies help to equip and support those sent from local churches. Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, kept strong ties with the Open Brethren, even though he was raised a Methodist and later was a member of a Baptist Church. The concept of "Faith Missions" can be traced back through Hudson Taylor, to the example of the early Brethren missionary, Anthony Norris Groves.
J.N. Darby, one of the original members and perhaps the most well known of the movement, wrote over 50 books including a translation of the New Testament and is often credited with the development of the theology of "dispensationalism" and "pretribulationism" which have been widely adopted in evangelical churches outside of the brethren movement. In the early twentieth century, Darby's writings have the greatest influence on the Little Flock of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee.
Many leaders of the contemporary evangelical movement came from Brethren backgrounds. These include England-born Dr. D. Stuart Briscoe, author, international speaker and former senior pastor of Elmbrook Church (one of the 50 largest churches in the U.S.), in Brookfield, Wisconsin; Dr. Geoff Tunnicliffe, CEO of the World Evangelical Alliance; the late British scholar F.F. Bruce; 1956 Auca missionary martyrs Ed McCully, Jim Elliot and Peter Fleming; Walter Liefeld, NT professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; the late preacher Dr. Harry A. Ironside, who wrote the Historical Sketch of the Brethren Movement. Radio personality Garrison Keillor was raised among the Plymouth Brethren, whom he sometimes refers to as the "sanctified brethren" in his News from "Lake Wobegon" monologues. Peter Maiden, the current leader of Operation Mobilization, also came from the Brethren.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.om.org/about/who-is-peter-maiden.html |title=Who is Peter Maiden? – OM International |publisher=Om.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl]  Tony Evans, the widely-syndicated radio broadcaster and pastor of Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, Texas comes from the brethren assemblies.http://www.emmaus.edu/files/Documents/History%20of%20Brethren%20Mvt/history_6.htm  William MacDonald, the popular author and Bible commentator was also with the Open Brethren group.William MacDonald (Christian author) In Asia, Dr G D James (1920-2003), known for his widespread evangelistic ministry and the founder of Asia Evangelistic Fellowship (AEF)[tpl]cite web|title=Asia Evangelistic Fellowship International|url=http://www.aefi.org.au/|accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl]  was associated with the Brethren movement.[tpl]cite book|last=James-Nathan|first=Violet|title=That Asia May Know" Perspectives on Missions in Asia|publisher=Asia Evangelistic Fellowship International|isbn=0-646-39763-X|pages=11-13|edition=40th Anniversary Commemorative Volume|authorlink=The Man, the Vision and the Mission: The Life of Gnanamuthu Dixon James|editor=Jonathan James and Malcolm Tan|chapter=One|year=2000[/tpl] 
Since 2004 the separatist Raven–Taylor–Hales Exclusive Brethren have become politically active. Formerly, they embraced non-involvement "in the things of the world", because they are "citizens of heaven". These heterodox Taylor Exclusive Brethren have been responsible for the production and distribution of political literature in the Australian, American, Swedish, Canadian and New Zealand national elections.[tpl]Cite news|first=David|last=Marr|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-influence-of-hidden-prophets/2006/07/01/1151174401719.html|title=Hidden prophets|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2006-07-01|accessdate=2006-07-01[/tpl] For more details, see Exclusive Brethren. These Taylor Brethren are atypical of other streams of Plymouth Brethren, which distance themselves from the "Taylorites".
Many mainstream assemblies discourage political involvement, sometimes to the extent of judging anyone in fellowship who opts to exercise their voting rights in democratic, free elections. This teaching is based on the premise that the Bible teaches that Christians are citizens of heaven, only sojourners here on earth, and therefore ought not to become involved in activities which could be deemed as being too worldly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.preciousseed.org/search_articles.php?search_phrase=my+responsibility+to+civil+authorities |title=Precious Seed |publisher=Precious Seed |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24[/tpl] A criticism could be leveled that the movement, with its upper-class roots, lacks compassion for the plight of the underprivileged. For example, it was left to William Wilberforce, Lord Shaftesbury, and other politically active Christians to work toward the abolishment of slavery and toward improving the welfare of factory children in the 19th century. This can be viewed as unfair criticism when reflecting on George Müller's ministry caring for homeless orphans and also on some of the sacrifices of its missionaries such as Anthony Norris Groves. It is more reasonable to state that the Brethren are more concerned with people's spiritual rather than their physical condition. However, where physical help is given, it is tended to be given directly and not through secular organisations.

==Major collection of literature==

The "Christian Brethren Archive" is housed at the John Rylands University Library in Oxford Road, Manchester. It contains a large collection of materials, including books and manuscripts, relating to assemblies or meetings of Christians often called Plymouth Brethren, with particular reference to the British Isles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/brethren/ |title= Christian Brethren Printed Book Catalogue and Archive List[/tpl]

==Film portrayal==

The Exclusive Hales branch of the Plymouth Brethren are portrayed in the film Son of Rambow as trying to restrict the creativity and freedom of the film's main character. The Plymouth Brethren are also featured in the book Oscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey, and in the film adaptation. Oscar is raised by a strict Plymouth Brethren father and rebels by becoming an Anglican priest. Sir Edmund Gosse wrote the book Father and Son about his upbringing in a Plymouth Brethren household.

==Criticism==

Some have suggested that certain subgroups within the Exclusive Brethren and the Taylorites in Australia can be categorized as cults because of their tendency to separate themselves from other orthodox denominations and the fact that some Exclusive Brethren groups discourage radio, computers, television, or socializing with those outside the movement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=201&Itemid=8|title=The Plymouth Brethren[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brethrenonline.org/faqs/Brethren.htm|title=Plymouth Brethren FAQ[/tpl]  These practices, however, do not represent the beliefs and practices of open brethren assemblies which tend to affiliate themselves more with mainstream conservative evangelical churches.
