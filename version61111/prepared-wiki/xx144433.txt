Since Quincoces was a Basque pelota pala player before of being a football professional, when his career finished, he was chosen by the Francoist authorities as the President of the Valencian Pilota Federation, believing that Basque and Valencian handball sports were the very same. Quincoces declared to the press several times that he was unwilling of this task, but while he was in charge (last 60s and first 70s) he promoted new measures that resulted in profit for the Valencian pilota, such as the beginning of the Youth Championships, compulsory for the trinquets that wanted to host professionals tournaments, this was the way pilotaris as Genovés I and Xatet de Carlet began.
