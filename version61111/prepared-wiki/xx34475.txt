==Style==

Ringo Lam's first four films were comedies not written by Lam.Stokes, 1999. p. 64 When Lam began to shoot the films he wanted to make after the success of Aces Go Places IV, he began his On Fire series. Lam chose the English titles for these films stating that it gave them "a sense of energy, of action". The films City on Fire, Prison on Fire and School on Fire do not share any characters or situations, but all have a common bleak view on Hong Kong society.Stokes, 1999. p. 64 In these films, Lam looks at controversial issues such as street violence and the abuse of street, prison and school systems.
Lam rarely uses Cantopop in his films. Lam's films often have Western music, such as City on Fire which features a blues oriented saxophone score and Full Contact uses American rock music.West, 2006. p. 170
