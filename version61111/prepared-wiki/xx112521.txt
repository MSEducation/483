CATEGORIES: Lakes of Chile, Geography of Arica y Parinacota Region

Chungará is a lake situated in the extreme north of Chile, in the Altiplano of Arica y Parinacota Region in the Lauca National Park. It is the 29th highest lake in the world (and the 10th highest in South America).http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html It is near the volcanos Parinacota ([tpl]convert|20827|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and Pomerape ([tpl]convert|20413|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]).http://lava.nationalgeographic.com/cgi-bin/pod/PhotoOfTheDay.cgi?day=21&month=03&year=06 It was formed 8000 years ago, when a major collapse of the edifice of Parinacota produced an avalanche of 6 km³ of debris which blocked drainage pattern, thus creating the lake.
The pencil catfish Trichomycterus chungarensis and the pupfish Orestias chungarensis are endemic to the lake basin.
