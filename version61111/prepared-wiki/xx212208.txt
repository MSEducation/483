The Ministry of Water and Power is a federal government agency in Pakistan. The ministry is headed by the Minister for Water and Power. Khawaja Muhammad Asif is the current minister. 
The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) is an agency within the Ministry that was created in 1977 in response to severe flooding by the Indus River. The FFC has been charged to execute flood control projects and protect lives and property from the impact of floods. By 2010 the FFC had received Rs 87.8 billion since its inception, and its own documents demonstrate  that numerous projects were initiated, paid for, and seemingly completed. However, after the devastating 2010 Pakistan floods the agency has been severely criticized as apparently very little actual work had been done on the ground and it was accused of ineffectiveness and corruption.
