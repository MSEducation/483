==Convention at Olympia==

The 1991 International Pop Underground Convention took place in Olympia, Washington. It was organized largely by Calvin Johnson, founder of the Olympia record label K Records. (Johnson also performs on the album as part of the group Beat Happening.) The six-day festival centered around a series of performances at the Capitol Theater. The theme of the Convention focused on the independence of artists and a "fierce resistance to corporate takeover."[tpl]Cite news |title=Various artists: International Pop Underground |author=Margasak, Peter |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=10 December 1992 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-10/features/9204220588_1_nurturing-star-musical |accessdate=16 June 2012 [/tpl]
