===Micronesia===

The concept of spirit possession appears in Chuuk State, one of the four states of Federated States of Micronesia. Although Chuuk is an overwhelmingly Christian society, traditional beliefs in spirit possession by the dead still exist, usually held by women, and "events" are usually brought on by family conflicts. The supposed spirits, speaking through the women, typically admonish family members to treat each other better.Hezel, Francis X. 1993 Spirit Possession in Chuuk: Socio-Cultural Interpretation.

==Christianity==

Roman Catholic doctrine states that angels are non-corporeal, spiritual beingsCatechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 328. with intelligence and will.Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraph 330. Fallen angels, or demons, are able to "demonically possess" individuals without the victim's knowledge or consent, leaving them morally blameless.p.33, An Exorcist Tells his Story by Gabriele Amorth translated by Nicoletta V. MacKenzie; Ignatius Press, San Francisco, 1999.

==Islam==

No verses in the Quran clearly support stories of spirit possession. One verse in the Quran describes the behavior of those who earn interest on borrowings, acting as if they were possessed or controlled by a satanic touch. Muslims are told to "seek refuge in Allah from the accursed devil" but the meaning of this prayer relates to the fear Muslims should have of the wrath of God, as the purpose of Shaitan is to mislead humans and make them disobey God. It is also stated in the Quran that the devil has no power of influence over those who God has guided. In the Quran, these facts are referred in:

==Judaism==

Although forbidden in the Hebrew Bible, magic was widely practiced in the late Second Temple Period and well documented in the period following the destruction of the Temple into the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries C.E.Gideon Bohak Ancient Jewish magic: a history 2008Clinton Wahlen Jesus and the impurity of spirits in the Synoptic Gospels 2004 p19 "The Jewish magical papyri and incantation bowls may also shed light on our investigation.79 However, the fact that all of these sources are generally dated from the third to fifth centuries and beyond requires us to exercise particular ..." In Jewish folklore, a Dybbuk is a disembodied spirit that wanders restlessly until it inhabits the body of a living person. The Baal Shem could expel the harmful dybbuk through exorcism.[tpl]Citation| contribution=Dybbuk| contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174964/dybbuk| title=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online| url=http://www.britannica.com/| accessdate=2009-06-10[/tpl]
Jewish magical papyri were inscriptions on amulets, ostraca and incantation bowls used in Jewish magical practices against shedim and other unclean spirits.

==Shamanism==

==Spiritism and Spiritualism==

In Spiritism and in some schools of Spiritualism, the Spiritist author Allan Kardec and the Spiritualist author Paschal Beverly Randolph wrote that the undue influence exerted by spirits upon new and imperfectly trained mediums is considered a distinct danger to both the mediums themselves and to the communities they serve. In modern Spiritism and Spiritualism, the concept of deleterious spirit possession is generally referred to as spirit obsession, to distinguish it from African-influenced traditions of spiritual possession.

==Wicca==

Wiccans believe in voluntary possession by the Goddess, connected with the sacred ceremony of Drawing Down the Moon. The high priestess solicits the Goddess to possess her and speak through her.Margo Adler, Drawing Down the Moon. Penguin, 1997.

==Scientific views==

===Cultural anthropology===

The anthropologist I.M. Lewis noted that women are more likely to be involved in spirit possession cults than men are, and postulated that such cults act as a means of compensation for their exclusion from other spheres within their respective cultures.

===Physical anthropology===

Anthropologists Alice B. Kehoe and Dody H. Giletti argued that the reason that women are more commonly seen in Afro-Eurasian spirit possession cults is because of deficiencies in thiamine, tryptophan-niacin, calcium, and vitamin D. They argued that a combination of poverty and food taboos cause this problem, and that it is exacerbated by the strains of pregnancy and lactation. They postulated that the involuntary symptoms of these deficiencies affecting their nervous systems have been institutionalized as spirit possession.

===Psychology===

Spirit possession is not recognized as a psychiatric or medical diagnosis by the DSM-IV or the ICD-10. People alleged to be possessed by spirits sometimes exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with mental illnesses such as psychosis, hysteria, mania, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia, or dissociative identity disorder,How Exorcism WorksJ. Goodwin, S. Hill, R. Attias "Historical and folk techniques of exorcism: applications to the treatment of dissociative disorders",Journal of Personality Assessment (abstract) including involuntary, uncensored behavior, and an extra-human, extra-social aspect to the individual's actions.Michel Strickmann (2002), Chinese Magical Medicine, edited by Bernard Faure, Stanford University Press. p. 65. In cases of dissociative identity disorder in which the alter personality is questioned as to its identity, 29% are reported to identify themselves as demons.Microsoft Word - Haraldur Erlendsson 1.6.03 Multiple Personality Physicians regard this as a mental disease called demonomania or demonopathy, a monomania in which the patient believes that he or she is possessed by one or more demons.Demonomania
