React Music Limited was a London based independent record label that was formed in 1990 by James Horrocks and Thomas Foley. James Horrocks was initially involved with successful dance music independent Rhythm King, and React pursued a similar approach - specifically electronic dance music, house music, acid house, techno and rave along with newer 'dance' orientated sub-genres which emerged throughout the '90's - including hard house, tech house, trance, hardbag, happy hardcore, drum and bass and chill out.

==Artists==

As dance music dominated the UK Singles Chart throughout the 1990s React also enjoyed both underground and commercial success within the dance/club scene. In common with most 'dance' orientated labels the artists at React varied from short-term 'one hit wonders' to longer-term acts which released numerous singles/albums and included:

==Success with Compilation Albums==

React was also immensely successful with a wide variety of compilation albums which crossed a wide spectrum of the dance/club scenes. Notable releases included;
A series of DJ-mix compilations were also developed by React. These were well received by the dance/club scene and notable releases included;

==Administration / Resist Music==

In July 2004, the company was owed in excess of Â£1,000,000 in distributed income from the Beechwood Music groups that went into voluntary administration in June of that year. React was then forced into voluntary administration as it was unable to extract any monies owed.
React's James Horrocks and Melissa Kemp set up Resist Music in its place. It acquired the staff, rights and catalogue of React.
In November 2007 Resist Music was put into liquidation and the assets were sold to Phoenix Music International Ltd.
