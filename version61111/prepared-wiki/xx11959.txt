Wuxia, which literally means "martial hero", is a broad genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists. Although wuxia is traditionally a form of literature, its popularity has caused it to spread to diverse art forms such as Chinese opera, manhua, films, television series and video games. It is a component of popular culture in many Chinese-speaking communities around the world.
The word "wuxia" is a compound word composed of the words wu (lit. "martial", "military", or "armed") and xia (lit. "honourable", "chivalrous", or "hero"). A martial artist who follows the code of xia is often referred to as a xiake (lit. "follower of xia") or youxia (lit. "wandering xia"). In some translated works of wuxia, the martial artist is sometimes termed as a "swordsman" or "swordswoman" even though he or she may not necessarily wield a sword.
Typically, the heroes in wuxia fiction do not serve a lord, wield military power or belong to the aristocratic class. They are often from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society. Wuxia heroes are usually bound by a code of chivalry that requires them to right wrongs, fight for righteousness, remove an oppressor, redress wrongs and bring retribution for past misdeeds. The Chinese xia traditions can be compared to martial codes from other countries, such as the Japanese samurai's bushido tradition, the chivalry of medieval European knights and the gunslingers of America's Westerns.

==History==

===Earlier precedents===

Even though the term "wuxia", as the name of a genre, is a recent coinage, stories about xia date back more than 2,000 years. Wuxia stories have their roots in some early youxia tales from 300–200 BCE . The Legalist philosopher Han Fei spoke disparagingly of youxias in his book Han Feizi in the chapter On Five 'Maggot' Classes (韩非子·五蠹) about the five social classes in the Spring and Autumn Period.Quote from the chapter in Han Feizi: (侠以武犯禁，而人主兼礼之，此所以乱也。夫离法者罪，而诸先生，以文学取；犯禁者诛，而群侠以私剑养。) Some well-known stories include Zhuan Zhu's assassination of King Liao of Wu, and most notably, Jing Ke's attempt on the life of the King of Qin (who became Qin Shi Huang later). In Volume 86 of the Records of the Grand Historian (Shi Ji''), Sima Qian listed five notable assassins (Cao Mo, Zhuan Zhu, Yu Rang, Nie Zheng and Jing Ke) from the Warring States period, who undertook tasks of conducting political assassinations of aristocrats and nobles.[tpl]Cite book|last=Teo |first=Stephen |title=Chinese Martial Arts Cinema: The Wuxia Tradition |year=2009 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |pages=17–19 |isbn=978-0-7486-3286-2[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E5%8F%B2%E8%A8%98/%E5%8D%B7086#.E8.A9.95.E8.AB.96 |title=史記/卷086 - 維基文庫，自由的圖書館 |language=[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] |publisher=Zh.wikisource.org |date=2013-12-06 |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl]
These assassins were known as cike (刺客; lit. "stabbing guests"). They usually rendered their loyalties and services to feudal lords and nobles in return for rewards such as riches and women. In Volume 124 of the Shi Ji, Sima Qian detailed several embryonic features of xia culture from his period. These popular phenomena were also documented in other historical records such as the Book of Han and the Book of the Later Han.
Xiake stories made a turning point in the Tang Dynasty and returned in the form of chuanqi (傳奇; lit. "legendary tales"). Stories from that era, such as Nie Yinniang (聶隱娘),[tpl]cite web|url=http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/culture/chinese/cul_kungfu/c/2-1-21.htm |title=唐傳奇 : 聶隱娘 |publisher=Edu.ocac.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl] The Kunlun Slave, Thirteenth Madame Jing (荆十三娘),See Chapter 8 in Trivial Matters, Northern Dreams《北夢瑣言》editor Sun Guangxian (孫光憲) Red String (紅線)See 《甘泽谣》editor 袁郊 and The Bearded Warrior (虬髯客),「《虬髯客传》一文虎虎有生气，或者可以说是我国武侠小说的鼻祖。」金庸,《卅三剑客图》 served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories.「唐代著名的武侠小说有《红线传》、《虬髯客传》、《刘无双传》、《昆仑奴传》、《聂隐娘传》，等等（空空儿、精精儿则是附在《聂隐娘传》中）。」梁羽生：“风尘三侠”, 一九六五年五月 They featured fantasies and isolated protagonists, usually loners, who performed daring heroic deeds. During the Song Dynasty, similar stories circulated in the huaben, short works that were once thought to have served as prompt-books for shuochang (traditional Chinese storytelling).Teo (2009), pp. 19-20[tpl]Cite book|last=Liu Damu|editor1-last=Lau Shing-hon|editor2-last=Leong Mo-Ling|title=A Study of the Hong Kong Swordplay Film (1945-1980)|publisher=Urban Council of Hong Kong|year=1981|chapter=From Chivalric Fiction to Martial Arts Film|pages=47–48[/tpl]
The genre of the martial or military romance also developed during the Tang Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty, Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai'an wrote Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin respectively, which were later ranked among the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. The former is a romanticised historical retelling of the events in the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, while the latter criticises the deplorable socio-economic status of the late Northern Song Dynasty. Water Margin is often seen as the first full-length wuxia novel: the portrayal of the 108 heroes, and their code of honour and willingness to become outlaws rather than serve a corrupt government, played an influential role in the development of jianghu culture in later centuries. Romance of the Three Kingdoms is also seen as a possible early antecedent, and contains classic close-combat descriptions that were later borrowed by wuxia writers in their works.[tpl]cite book|last=Hamm |first=John Christopher |title=Paper Swordsmen: Jin Yong and the Modern Chinese Martial Arts Novel |year=2006 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |pages=17, 263 |isbn=0-8248-2895-X[/tpl]Teo (2009), p. 20
In the Qing Dynasty, further developments were the gong'an (公案; lit. "public case") and related detective novels, where xia and other heroes, working with a judge or magistrate, solved crimes and battled injustice. The Justice Bao stories from Sanxia Wuyi (三俠五義; later extended and renamed to Qixia Wuyi) and Xiaowuyi (小五義), incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories. Xiayi stories of chivalrous romance, which frequently featured female heroes and supernatural fighting abilities, also surfaced during the Qing Dynasty. Novels such as Shi Gong'an Qiwen (施公案奇聞) and Ernü Yingxiong Zhuan (兒女英雄傳) have been cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels.Teo (2009), pp. 20-21Hamm (2006), p. 19
The term "wuxia" as a genre label itself first appeared at the end of the Qing Dynasty, a calque of the Japanese "bukyō", a genre of oft-militaristic and bushido-influenced adventure fiction. The term was brought to China by writers and students who hoped that China would modernise its military and place emphasis on martial virtues, and it quickly became entrenched as the term used to refer to xiayi and other predecessors of wuxia proper, while in Japan itself, however, it faded into obscurity.Teo (2009), pp. 2–3Hamm (2006), pp.11, 262
Many wuxia works produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to the governments' strong crackdown and banning of such works.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heroic-cinema.com/eric/xia.html |title=An Introduction to the Wuxia Genre |publisher=Heroic-cinema.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl] Wuxia works were deemed responsible for brewing anti-government sentiments, which led to rebellions during those eras.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati, which led to the stifling of the development of the wuxia genre. Nonetheless, the wuxia genre remained enormously popular with the common people.Liu (1981), pp. 49-50

===20th century===

The modern wuxia genre rose to prominence in the early 20th century after the May Fourth Movement of 1919. A new literature evolved, calling for a break with Confucian values, and the xia emerged as a symbol of personal freedom, defiance to Confucian tradition, and rejection of the Chinese family system.
The early 20th century and the period from the 1960s–80s were often regarded as the golden ages of the wuxia genre.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Xiang Kairan (pen name Pingjiang Buxiaosheng) became the first notable wuxia writer, his maiden work being The Peculiar Knights-Errant of the Jianghu (江湖奇侠传).A selective guide to Chinese literature: 1900–1949.

Wuxia fiction was banned at various times during the Republican era and these restrictions stifled the growth of the genre. In spite of this, wuxia writing prevailed in other Chinese-speaking regions, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. Writers such as Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha (Jin Yong) spearheaded the founding of a "new school" of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors. They wrote serials for newspapers and magazines. They also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures. In Taiwan, Wolong Sheng, Sima Ling, Zhuge Qingyun (诸葛青云), Xiao Yi (萧逸) and Gu Long became the region's most famous wuxia writers. After them, other writers such as Wen Rui'an and Huang Yi rose to prominence in a later period. Chen Yu-hui is a contemporary female wuxia novelist who made her debut with the novel The Tian-Guan Duo Heroes (天觀雙俠).[tpl]cite web|url=http://gb.cri.cn/12764/2007/08/29/2905@1737819.htm |title=台湾“女金庸”坐月子写巨著 - 世界新闻报 - 国际在线 |publisher=Gb.cri.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl]
There have also been works created after the 1980s which attempt to create a post-wuxia genre. Yu Hua, one of the more notable writers from this period, published a counter-genre short story titled Blood and Plum Blossoms, in which the protagonist goes on a quest to avenge his murdered father.

==Themes, plots and settings==

Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or premodern China. The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story, to being vaguely-defined, anachronistic, or is only used as a backdrop for the action. Fantasy elements, ranging from fantastic martial arts to ghosts and monsters, are common elements of a wuxia story but not a prerequisite. However, the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale, as its characters must know some form of martial arts. Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales. 
A typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy, such as losing his loved ones, and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations throughout his adventures in order to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters. At the end of the story, the protagonist emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal. He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu. For instance, the opening chapters of some of Louis Cha's works follow a certain pattern: a tragic event occurs, usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters, and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story.[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Other stories use different structures. For instance, the protagonist is denied being accepted into a martial arts sect. He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis. The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis. These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti-Qing revolutionaries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Certain stories have unique plots, such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi. Gu Long's works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories. The protagonist, usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem-solver, embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case. Huang Yi's stories are blended with science fiction.
Despite these genre-blending elements, wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction. Notwithstanding this, wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist's progression from childhood to adulthood instead.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] The progression may be symbolic rather than literal, as observed in Louis Cha's The Smiling, Proud Wanderer, where the young Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master.

===Code of xia===

Eight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence, justice, individualism, loyalty, courage, truthfulness, disregard for wealth and desire for glory. Apart from individualism, these characteristics are similar to Confucian values such as ren (仁; "benevolence", "kindness"), zhong (忠; "loyalty"), yong (勇; "courage", "bravery") and yi (義; "righteousness"). The code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of en (恩; "grace", "favour") from others, as well as seeking chou (仇; "vengeance", "revenge") to bring villains to justice. However, the importance of vengeance is controversial, as a number of wuxia works stress Buddhist ideals, which include forgiveness, compassion and a prohibition on killing.
In the jianghu, martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master (sifu). This gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master-apprentice relations as well as the various sects such as Shaolin and Wudang.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] If there are any disputes between fighters, they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Skills and abilities===

The martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life Chinese martial arts. In wuxia tales, however, the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess.
The following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter or martial artist in a wuxia story possesses:
In wuxia stories, characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise, but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his inner energy to them. The instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as miji (秘笈). In some stories, specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters.

===Jianghu===

The "jianghu" (江湖; lit. "rivers and lakes") refers to a community of martial artists. The term "wulin" (武林; lit. "martial forest") is another commonly used term which refers to this community. The jianghu is made up of several martial artists who are usually congregated in sects, clans, disciplines and various schools of martial arts. It is also inhabited by others such as youxia ("wandering martial artists"), nobles, thieves, beggars, priests, healers, merchants and craftsmen.
A common aspect of the jianghu is that the courts of law are dysfunctional and that all disputes and differences can only be resolved by use of force, predicating the need for the code of xia and acts of chivalry. Law and order within the jianghu are maintained by the various orthodox and righteous sects and heroes. Sometimes these sects may gather to form an alliance against a powerful evil organisation in the jianghu.
A leader, called the "wulin mengzhu" (武林盟主; lit. "master of the wulin alliance"), is elected from among the sects in order to lead them and ensure law and order within the jianghu. The leader is usually someone with a high level of mastery in martial arts and a great reputation for righteousness who is often involved in some conspiracy and/or killed. In some cases, the leader may not be the greatest martial artist in the jianghu while in others, the position of the leader is hereditary. The leader is an arbiter who presides and adjudicates over all inequities and disputes. The leader is a de jure chief justice of the affairs of the jianghu.
The term "jianghu" is linked to cultures other than those pertaining to martial arts in wuxia stories. It is also applied to anarchic societies. For instance, the triads and other Chinese secret societies use the term "jianghu" to describe their world of organised crime. Sometimes, the term "jianghu" may be replaced by the term "underworld", with reference to the "criminal underworld".
In modern terminology, "jianghu" may mean any circle of interest, ranging from the entertainment industry to sports. Colloquially, retirement is also referred to as "leaving the jianghu" (退出江湖). In wuxia stories, when a reputable fighter decides to retire from the jianghu, he will do so in a ceremony known as "washing hands in the golden basin" (金盆洗手). He washes his hands in a golden basin filled with water, signifying that he will no longer be involved in the affairs of the jianghu. When a reclusive fighter who has retired from the jianghu reappears, his return is described as "re-entering the jianghu" (重出江湖).

==Books and writers==

Notable modern wuxia writers include:

==Comics==

New and original wuxia writings have dwindled significantly in the last 25 years,[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] particularly so as patronage and readerships of the genre decimated due to readily available alternatives in entertainment such as DVDs, affordable gaming consoles and so forth. The genre has proliferated in manhua (Chinese comics) in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan, with the core essentials of the wuxia genre living on in weekly editions equivalent to the Japanese manga.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Some notable comic artists are listed as follows:

==Films==

The earliest wuxia films date back to the 1920s. Films produced by King Hu and the Shaw Brothers Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped-up camera techniques. The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Cheng Pei-pei and Jimmy Wang are among the notable wuxia movie stars of the 1960s-70s, when films made by the Shaw Brothers Studio and King Hu were most prominent. Cantonese screen idol Connie Chan grew up starring in wuxia films and was famous for her male roles. Jet Li is a more recent star of wuxia films, having appeared in Swordsman II and Hero, as are Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Brigitte Lin. Yuen Woo-ping is a choreographer who achieved fame by crafting action-sequences in films of the genre.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Mainland Chinese director Zhang Yimou's foray into wuxia films, Hero, was distinguished by the imaginative use of vivid colours and breathtaking background settings.
Wuxia was introduced to the Hollywood studios in 2000 by Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Following Ang Lee's footsteps, Zhang Yimou made Hero, targeted for the international market in 2003, and House of Flying Daggers in 2004. American audiences are also being introduced to wuxia through Asian television stations in larger cities, which feature miniseries such as Warriors of the Yang Clan and Paradise, often with English subtitles.
Western attempts at the genre have been limited, such as the 2008 film, The Forbidden Kingdom, starring Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michael Angarano. However, a major exception is DreamWorks Animation's media franchise Kung Fu Panda. Created as an earnest, if humorous, emulation by producers who were knowledgeable admirers of the genre, the series has been particularly hailed in China as an excellent contribution to the form.[tpl]cite web|last=Downes |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/03/arts/AS-MOV-China-Kung-Fu-Panda.php |title=The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Lee |first=Min |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-07-03-kungfupanda_N.htm |title='Kung Fu Panda' reaches Chinese box office milestone |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2008-07-03 |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl]

==Video games==

Some notable wuxia video games of the action RPG genre include The Legend of Sword and Fairy, Sword of Xuan Yuan, Jade Empire, and Kingdom of Paradise, all of which blend wuxia with elements of Chinese mythology and fantasy. The Legend of Sword and Fairy, in particular, expanded into a franchise of eight video games, two of which were adapted into the television series Chinese Paladin (2005) and Chinese Paladin 3 (2009).
There are also MMORPGs such as Heroes of Kung FuOfficial site of Heroes of Kung Fu[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] and Age of Wulin,[tpl]cite web|url=http://wulin.gpotato.eu |title=Age of Wulin – Legend of the Nine Scrolls is set in medieval China and based on the lore surrounding martial arts |publisher=Wulin.gpotato.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl] as well as hack and slash games such as Bujingai and Heavenly Sword.
Games adapted from the works of wuxia writers include Heroes of Jin Yong, an RPG based on characters in Jin Yong's novels; Dragon Oath, an MMORPG inspired by Jin Yong's Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils; Martial Kingdoms, a strategy game featuring several martial arts sects which commonly appear in wuxia fiction.
