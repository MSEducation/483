From 1933 to 1935 Spohrer shared catching duties with Shanty Hogan who had been obtained from the New York Giants. In February 1936, Spohrer was released to the Columbus Red Birds of the American Association.[tpl]cite news |title=Playing Square |agency= |work=The Evening Independent |page=6 |date=29 February 1936 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EvZPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2519,2946402&dq=al+spohrer&hl=en[/tpl] He decided to retire as a baseball player at the age of 32 rather than play in the minor leagues.[tpl]cite news |title=By Harry Grayson |agency= |work=The Bulletin |page=2 |date=31 March 1936 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mE9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UyEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4430,5835124&dq=al+spohrer&hl=en[/tpl]
Spohrer is remembered for a game in [tpl]By|1929[/tpl] against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field when, he tried to distract one of baseball's greatest hitters during an at bat. Rogers Hornsby, who had been Spohrer's teammate on the Braves in [tpl]By|1928[/tpl] before being traded to the Cubs, was known for his love of a good steak dinner. As Hornsby stepped up to home plate to take his turn at bat, Spohrer made an attempt to distract him from his hitting by talking about the great steaks available from a butcher back home in Boston. Hornsby replied, "Is that so?" as the first pitch was a called strike. Spohrer proceeded to tell Hornsby that his wife was also an extremely capable cook as strike two was called. Spohrer continued with his ruse by telling Hornsby that during his next visit to Boston, he was welcome to the Spohrer household to try one of these steaks whereupon, Hornsby proceeded to hit the next pitch out of the park for a home run. After rounding the bases and touching home plate, Hornsby was said to have asked Spohrer, "What night shall we make it, Al?"[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jS0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA17&dq=al+spohrer+baseball+digest&hl=en&ei=waRjTcmRAsOhtwew_K20DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Rogers Hornsby's Epitaph: For Five Straight Years He Hit .402! |author=Meany, Tom |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=March 1963 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=22 February 2011 [/tpl]
