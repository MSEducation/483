==Voting process==

The voting procedure differs from other voting processes, due to the use of an "Ebony Sphere" or "Black Ball" to decide the fate of other cast members. Each player places a BlackBall in the corresponding box labeled with an opposing players name. At that time, the two (or more) players with the most votes are taken in front of Mr. Fonzworth Bentley. The chosen players are then assessed, and Mr. Bentley alone makes the final decision.
