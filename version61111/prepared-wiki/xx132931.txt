==Football career==

===Early career===

After the abolition of the non-EU quota per team in 2000–01 season,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=28321.html|title=Italians bar non-EU imports|date=17 July 2002|accessdate=27 January 2010|publisher=UEFA.com[/tpl] Eliakwu joined Reggiana, where he played along with countrymen Stephen Makinwa, Akande Ajide, Adewale Wahab, Obafemi Martins and Saidi Adeshokan. At that time FIFA had not yet restricted youth player's international transfers.
In June 2002, he was signed by A.S. Roma, but in pure financial tricks to raise profit, which the net asset of the club was just increased in terms of player contract value. Eliakwu and Akande Ajide were exchanged with Daniele De Vezze and Fabio Tinazzi in co-ownership deal, all 4 were valued €2 million thus the 50% registration rights "worth" €1 million each. Tinazzi and De Vezze created false profit of €2 million and €1.93 million for Roma alone.AS Roma SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2002 [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
About August 2002, Eliakwu was sold back to Reggiana for free, as well as Ajide was signed outright for Roma for another €1 million.AS Roma SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2003 [tpl]it icon[/tpl]

The sale of Triestina's leading scorer Denis Godeas to Palermo was followed by injuries to the remaining strikers at the club giving Eliakwu the opportunity to play regularly for the first team until the end of the season. In the final 16 games Isah scored 8 goals, endearing himself to the fans and receiving the fan's player of the season award.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]

In the first half of the season, along with Francesco Ruopolo, Eliakwu played as 4th striker, and Eliakwu had to compete with former Inter team-mate Federico Piovaccari to be the third striker in a formation which used 3 front men, to partner with Mattia Graffiedi and Emiliano Testini. He did not feature in Triestina's 2 strikers formation. After the arrival of Luigi Della Rocca in mid-season, Piovaccari and Eliakwu were once became 4th choice strikers, but soon after the arrival of the new coach Franco Varrella and injuries to Della Rocca and Graffiedi, Eliakwu regained his regular place to rotate with Piovaccari as Testini's partner in 2 strikers formation.

At Spezia, he joined with two other Inter-owned players Luca Ceccarelli and Sebastián Ribas. During the first half of the season he was often substituted for Corrado Colombo and Massimiliano Guidetti. Coach Antonio Soda even preferred a 4–5–1 formation when Colombo was not available instead of letting Eliakwu play. After of Colombo left, Eliakwu played more regularly and scored 7 goals. He played 29 league matches in 2007–08 season, started 14 games, all in the second half of season.http://www.gazzetta.it/speciali/serie_b/2008_nw/giocatori/76496.shtml
