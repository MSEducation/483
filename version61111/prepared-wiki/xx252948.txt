The John Player Classic was the richest golf tournament in Britain between 1970 and 1973. In 1972 and 1973 it was an event on the fledgling European Tour.
The John Player Classic was first played in 1970 at Notts Golf Club (Hollinwell), when Ireland's Christy O'Connor Snr triumphed by one stroke over England's Tony Jacklin to collect the Â£24,375 first prize.[tpl]cite news |title=O'Connor Captures Player Golf Classic |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |date=7 September 1970 |page=23 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=FmktAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9YkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6613,1429830&dq=john-player-classic&hl=en[/tpl] Having not been held in 1971, the tournament returned as part of the new European Tour in 1972. It also had a change of venue, being moved to Turnberry on the west coast of Scotland.
The tournament was played just once more, in 1973, when American Charles Coody took the title. It was cancelled the following year because of conflicting tournament schedules in the United States.[tpl]cite news |title=Golf |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=6 March 1974 |page=6D |url=http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=jkg0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=32YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7241,2462514&dq=john-player-classic&hl=en[/tpl]
