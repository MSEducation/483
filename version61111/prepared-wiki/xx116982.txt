Recuerdos de la Alhambra (Memories of the Alhambra) is a classical guitar piece composed in 1896 in Granada by Spanish composer and guitarist Francisco Tárrega.Library of Guitar Classics, AMSCO Publications, 1998 It uses the classical guitar tremolo technique often performed by advanced players.
Recuerdos de la Alhambra shares a title with the Spanish language translation of Washington Irving's 1832 book, Tales of the Alhambra, written during the author's four-year stay in Spain. 

==Performance notes==

The piece showcases the challenging guitar technique known as tremolo, wherein a single melody note is plucked consecutively by the ring, middle and index fingers in such rapid succession that the result is an illusion of one long sustained tone.[tpl]cn|date=May 2013[/tpl]  The thumb plays a counter-melody on the bass between melodic attacks. Many who hear this piece initially in a non-live setting can mistake it for a duet rather than a challenging solo effort.[tpl]cn|date=May 2013[/tpl]
The A-section of the piece is written in a minor key, and the B-section is written in the major key of the same root (more specifically, A-minor and A-major).  This gives the song a melancholy feel in the beginning, and then it resolves to an uplifting feel.  This device is used in other Spanish guitar songs as well, such as the anonymous Spanish Romance (also known simply as Romance or Spanish Folk Song).Library of Guitar Classics, AMSCO Publications, 1998
