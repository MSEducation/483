==Packaging==

Aquafina is distributed in [tpl]convert|12|USfloz|l[/tpl], [tpl]convert|500|ml|USfloz[/tpl], [tpl]convert|20|USfloz|l[/tpl], [tpl]convert|24|USfloz|l[/tpl], [tpl]convert|1|l|USfloz[/tpl], [tpl]convert|1.5|l|USfloz[/tpl] bottles. The bottled water industry has drawn criticism for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumes additional petrochemicals.[tpl]cite news|last=Gunther|first=Marc|title=Bottled water: No longer cool?|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/24/news/economy/pluggedin_gunther_water.fortune/index.htm|accessdate=January 20, 2011|newspaper=CNN Money / Fortune Magazine|date=April 25, 2007[/tpl]
The packaging has evolved from its original iteration for the purpose of partially offsetting environmental impacts of production and shipment. This has primarily involved packaging weight reduction. The weight of Aquafina bottles was reduced by approximately 50%, to [tpl]convert|10.9|g|oz[/tpl], with a packaging redesign in 2009 which, according to the company, resulted in the use of 75 million fewer pounds of plastic during the production process.

==Sponsorship==

Since shortly after its inception, the promotion of Aquafina has involved sports sponsorships. As of 2011, it is listed as being an official sponsor of Major League Soccer, the Professional Golf Association, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Carolina Panthers.[tpl]cite web|title=Aquafina (Sports Sponsorship)|url=http://www.bottledwaterweb.com/bottlersdetail.do?k=659|publisher=Bottled Water Web|accessdate=January 21, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110103101530/http://bottledwaterweb.com/bottlersdetail.do?k=659| archivedate= January 3, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Its packaging also states that it is the "official water of Major League Baseball", which has been the case since the beginning of the 2008 MLB season.[tpl]cite news|last=Lefton|first=Terry|title=It’s clear: Aquafina now Pepsi’s lead brand with MLB sponsorship|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/Archive/Marketingsponsorship/2008/03/Its-Clear-Aquafina-Now-Pepsis-Lead-Brand-With-MLB-Sponsorship.aspx|accessdate=January 21, 2011|newspaper=Sports Business Daily|date=March 17, 2008[/tpl]

==Litigation==

Charles Joyce and James Voigt won a $1.26 billion judgment against PepsiCo after saying that the company had created Aquafina by stealing their idea to sell purified bottled water.[tpl]cite web |url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/market-dispatches.aspx?post=1341021&_blg=1,1341021 |title=PepsiCo hit with $1.26 billion judgment |publisher=msn.com |last=Blaine |first=Charlie |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091101060809/http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/market-dispatches.aspx?post=1341021&_blg=1,1341021| archivedate= November 1, 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This judgment was vacated on November 6, 2009, when it was discovered that PepsiCo had failed to respond to the lawsuit due to a misplacement of the paperwork.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/69437027.html |title=Judge scraps $1.26 billion judgment against Pepsi |publisher=jsonline.com |last=Vielmetti |first=Bruce |date=November 6, 2009[/tpl]
