Mkwasine is a place in the South Eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe. This place, like many in its region, is synonymous with sugar cane used to grow sugar cane at a large scale where there were about 8000 hactares   of the sugar cane crop. this place used to be a cotton growing area till the late 70s. 
Mkwasine area is owned by Mkwasine Estates and is in turn jointly owned by Triangle and Hippo Valley Estates. There are now only left 500 has of cane left after the land resettlement. The other is now in the hands of new A2 farmers.
In the herald of 10 June 2010, a tender was floated calling for bidders to submit tenders for the taking over of virtually all the remaining operations of Mkwasine Estate. This marks the end of the long fought struggle to survive the estate by the hard working and now confused junior employees of the Company. Now they do not know their fate. Are they going to be given retreanchment packages, are they going to be relocated to their sister companies Hippo and Triangle or are they going to be left bihind to rout just like what befell the empoleeys of former white farmers J Taylors, Brysons Naudes et
