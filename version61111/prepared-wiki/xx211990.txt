[[HLA-DQB3]]

Major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 3, also known as HLA-DQB3, is a human gene and also denotes the genetic locus which contains this gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: HLA-DQB1 major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3121| accessdate = [/tpl] While the overall sequence of the protein encoded by this gene is similar to other HLA class II beta chains, the translated protein is lacking several domains and therefore it is not clear that this gene encodes a functional protein.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ando A, Kawai J, Maeda M, Tsuji K, Trowsdale J, Inoko H | title = Mapping and nucleotide sequence of a new HLA class II light chain gene, DQB3 | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 243â€“9 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2571586 | doi = 10.1007/BF02421327| url =  [/tpl]
