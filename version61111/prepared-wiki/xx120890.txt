==History==

On August 5, 1986, J.R. Gordon, representing a company to be incorporated (would be known as Atlantic Stereo Ltd.) was given approval to operate a new FM station at Moncton. The new facility would broadcast on a frequency of 103.1 MHz and have an effective radiated power of 46,800 watts. The format would be album-oriented rock (Group II harder pop and rock) aimed at the 18 to 34 age group. Competing applications by Radio One Ltd. (CIHI-AM Fredericton) and Radio-Aboiteux Ltee (the former CHLR-AM Moncton) were denied.

CJMO-FM was owned by a group of Moncton businessmen, headed by Rick Gordon, then an 18 year veteran of broadcasting. The studio building, in a new facility on Arsenault Court in the Moncton Industrial Park, provided 8,400 square feet of space on two floors. In addition to being owner, Rick Gordon was also general manager. He named Michael Leaman, engineering director and Larry McCaw, program director. Paul Wiggins was brought in from Vancouver's CFMI-FM (Rock 101) as Music Director and Assistant Program Director for CJMO. Paul Wiggins was CFMI's programming innovator for Discumentary, a one-hour musical documentary of programming featuring a particular artist or a particular theme, which was syndicated throughout Canada, and broadcast internationally on the Anik D satellite.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/radio/histories.php%3Fid%3D633%26historyID%3D448|title=CJMO-FM history|publisher=Canadian Communications Foundation|accessdate=2012-02-04|last=Dulmage|first=Bill|date=December 2009[/tpl]

==Official signed-on==

A few months prior to the CJMO officially commenced broadcasting launched on June 19, 1987, the station started test transmissions at its frequency of 103.1 MHz, by which it played non-stop album tracks. 
The first song played on its official launch at 1:03 on June 19, 1987 was April Wine's "I Like to Rock".

Branded as "Rock 103 FM", CJMO signed on the air with an album-oriented rock format, which was a first for New Brunswick. Halifax CFRQ-FM 104.3 (Q-104) was the only other station in the Canadian Maritime provinces which had a similar format (AOR). Noteworthy, within its first six months on the air, Moncton's ROCK 103 was nominated as Medium Market FM Station of the Year at the annual Canadian Music Week.

==Original on-air personality==

Some of the original on-air personality: Al Roberts from CKTS in Sherbrooke was morning host; Gerry Proctor was news director; and Marty Kingston (from CKEY Toronto and formerly of CKCW/CFQM) was sports director. Later, John Pearce (CHNS Halifax), Robin Sauve (CJCH Halifax and CHAM Hamilton) and Eric Stafford (CIHI Fredericton) joined Rock 103. Eric Stafford came on board in 1988 as program director and temporary drive host.
Mitch (1988-2007) initially debuted as evening host in January 1988.

==From Rock 103 to C103==

The Rock 103 slogan changed to C103 within three years to a mainstream lite rock/classic rock mandate, one which catered to the audience and advertisers.

==NewCap Radio transition==

In 1990, NewCap Broadcasting bought 40% of Atlantic Stereo Ltd. NewCap executive vice president Jim Macleod said the partnership would open new opportunities for staff and a program exchange between CJMO and NewCap's CFRQ-FM.
In 1997, NewCap Broadcasting (currently doing business as Newcap Radio) purchased control in Atlantic Stereo Ltd.http://ncc.ca/
On August 24, 2000, the CRTC awarded a licence to operate a sister station on 96.9 MHz, with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. CJXL-FM “XL 96.9 FM” signed on the air in 2001.
