Lenin Higher Party School despite a lack of formal higher education.

She was forced to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic Front in December 1990, and was replaced by Prime Minister Adil Çarçani.  She was arrested and sentenced to prison for misuse of Albanian government funds during her husband's regime, but later released.My Father, Enver Hoxha by Nexhmije's son Ilir
