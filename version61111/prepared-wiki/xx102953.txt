==History==

Originated in 1951, the center operates 58 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges, and other specialized units. Currently, AEDC's prime contractor is the Aerospace Testing Alliance.
The center has helped to develop most aerospace systems in the U.S. government's inventory, including the Atlas, Titan, Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBMs, the Space Shuttle, space station, and Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/units/ | title=Arnold Air Force Base Units | accessdate=2008-06-29 | author=US Air Force | publisher=AEDC| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080604041746/http://www.arnold.af.mil/units/| archivedate= 4 June 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
It is named for General Henry "Hap" Arnold, the father of the US Air Force and an air power visionary.  The University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) is located adjacent to AEDC.
The center lies near Manchester, Tennessee and Tullahoma, Tennessee, and occupies much of the site of the former Camp Forrest, a U.S. Army base and World War II POW camp. It is unique in that the majority of the workforce are contract personnel, with a small contingent of active-duty assigned.

==Environmental Issues==

Several areas of the facility are contaminated by substances including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds and spills of jet and rocket fuel, chlorofluorocarbon solvents, nitric acid and other materials.  PCBs from the site have been detected in local creeks, in the water, sediment and in fish.[tpl]cite web | title=NPL Site Narrative for Arnold Engineering Develop. Ctr.

The site was proposed for addition to the Superfund National Priorities List in August 1994 though, as of May 2010, the site has not been added to the NPL.[tpl]cite web | title=Arnold Engineering Development Center (USAF) Superfund Site Progress Profile | publisher=EPA | url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=0404166 | accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl]  The Environmental Protection Agency believes that human exposure to contaminants and contaminated groundwater migration are under control.
