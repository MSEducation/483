"You're The Top" is a Cole Porter song from the 1934 musical Anything Goes. It is about a man and a woman who take turns complimenting each other. The best-selling version was Paul Whiteman's Victor single, which made the top five.
It was the most popular song from Anything Goes at the start with hundreds of parodies.[tpl]cite book|last=Redmond|first=James|title=Drama, Dance and Music|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-22180-1|page=60[/tpl]
The lyrics are particularly significant because they offer a snapshot as to what was highly prized in the mid-1930s and demonstrate Porter's rhyming ability.
Some of the lyrics were re-written by P. G. Wodehouse for the British version of Anything Goes.

==Parodies==

Porter biographer William McBrien wrote that at the height of its popularity in 1934 to 1935 it had become a "popular pastime" to create parodies of the lyrics.[tpl]cite book|last=McBrien|first=William|title=Cole Porter : a biography|year=1998|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-58235-1|edition=1 |pages=169–171[/tpl] Porter, who himself had called the song "just a trick" the public would get bored by was flooded with hundreds of parodies with one reportedly written by Irving Berlin. Despite the "ribald" nature of some of the parodies, McBrien believes few, including a "King Kong" parody were written by Porter or Berlin.[tpl]cite web|last=Noah|first=Timothy|title=Farewell to Berlin|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2005/06/farewell_to_berlin.html|publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=13 February 2012|date=18 June 2005[/tpl]
