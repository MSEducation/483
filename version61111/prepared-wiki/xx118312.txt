Lodge Manufacturing is a manufacturer of cast iron cookware based in South Pittsburg, Tennessee.

==History==

Founded in 1896 by Joseph Lodge, Lodge Manufacturing is one of America's oldest cookware companies in continuous operation.  It is still owned and managed by the descendants of the Lodge family.  Most cast iron sold by Lodge is produced in its foundry in South Pittsburg, which has been in operation since the company was founded.

==Products==

Lodge Manufacturing produces a range of cast iron cookware and bakeware, including skillets, griddles, and dutch ovens.  In 2002, Lodge developed a method to produce pre-seasoned cast iron cookware, which now accounts for the majority of its sales.  Lodge recently introduced a line of enamel-coated cast iron cookware that is made in China.
