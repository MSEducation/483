Ã/ã (a-tilde) is a letter used in some languages, generally considered a variant of the letter A.
In Portuguese, Ã/ã represents a nasal central unrounded vowel, [tpl]IPA-pt|ɐ̃|[/tpl] (its exact height varies from open to mid according to dialect). The combination [tpl]angle bracket|ãe[/tpl] represents the diphthong [tpl]IPA|ɐ̃ĩ̯[/tpl] in most dialects ([tpl]IPA|ɐ̃ɪ̯̃[/tpl] in Brazil's RS, SC, PR, SP, MS and among caipira speakers), and [tpl]angle bracket|ão[/tpl] represents [tpl]IPA|ɐ̃ũ̯[/tpl] in most dialects ([tpl]IPA|ɐ̃ʊ̯̃[/tpl] in Brazil's RS, SC, PR, SP, MS and among caipira speakers, while in hinterland European northern dialects of Portuguese it represents [tpl]IPA|aŋ[/tpl] and in some reintegrationist Galician orthographies it may represent [tpl]IPA|oŋ[/tpl]). Because Ã is a typically Portuguese character, it is sometimes used as a symbol of the Portuguese language.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
This symbol is also used in the Aromanian, Guaraní, Kashubian and Vietnamese languages. In Vietnamese, it represents [tpl]IPA|aː[/tpl] in a high breaking-rising tone. This also used in !Xóõ.
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, [tpl]IPA|/ã/[/tpl] stands for a nasal open front unrounded vowel, found for example in Quebec French mam'an and ''J'''ean.
