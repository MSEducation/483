==Family==

The Tharreau family originated in the Upper Poitou region of France and after the French Revolution it divided into two branches.  One lived in Cholet and the other in Châtillon-sur-Thouet. The family in Cholet had three sons: François, who served in the legislature as a deputy from Maine-et-Loire in 1806; Augustin, who was a doctor; and a third who died young.  The Châtillon branch also had three sons: Pierre-Jean-François, born 1760, who became a legislative deputy, and a jurist; Jean-Victor, who became a general in Napoleon's army; and a third who died young.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Émile Monnet, Archives politiques du département des Deux-Sèvres, 1789–1889, Niort, L.

==Career==

At the outbreak of the French Revolution, Tharreau enthusiastically adopted the revolutionary cause.  In 1792, he joined the Maine-et-Loire volunteers and later that year he was an adjutant major of the 2nd battalion of volunteers of Mayence. In 1794, at the height of the French terror, he was a General of Brigade in the Army of the Ardennes.Joseph Fr. Michaud, Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne, Paris: Michaud frères, 1811–1862. V. 84 (1854), pp. 8–9. In 1799, Jean Victor Tharreau was a brigade commander in the French Army of the Danube, and fought at the battles of Ostrach and First Stockach.. Smith, Digby, The Napoleonic Wars Data Book, London: Greenhill, 1998. ISBN 1-85367-276-9, pp. 147–148.  On 20 April, he was promoted to General of Division. André Masséna placed him command of the forward line, for the defense of the Swiss city of Zurich, in 1799; the insubordination of Jean-de-Dieu Soult at the Battle of Winterthur in May 1799 contributed to Tharreau's inability to hold the forward line, forcing a French retreat on Zurich and the subsequent defeat of the French at the First Battle of Zurich on 4–7 June.Jomini, Antoine Henri, baron de, Mountain warfare illustrated by the campaign of 1799 in Switzerland: being a translation of the Swiss narrative, compiled from the works of the Archduke Charles, Jomini, and other...London: Henry S. King, 1875. p. 110.
In 1801, he was appointed commandant of the city of Strasbourg. A firm believer in the revolutionary principles, he was dismayed by Napoleon's acquisition of absolute power, although he admired the man's military talents.Michaud, pp. 8–9.

In 1812, he served as General of the 23rd Division, and later replaced Dominique Vandamme who commanded the 8th Army, after Vandamme's recklessness and rudeness had strained his relationship with Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, beyond repair.Gallagher, pp. 217–218.
