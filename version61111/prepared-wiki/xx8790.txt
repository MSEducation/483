[[Double negative elimination]]

CATEGORIES: Rules of inference, Theorems in propositional logic

In propositional logic, double negative elimination (also called double negation elimination, double negative introduction, double negation introduction, or simply double negationCopi and CohenMoore and ParkerHurley) are two valid rules of replacement. They are the inferences that if A is true, then not not-A is true and its converse, that, if not not-A is true, then A is true. The rule allows one to introduce or eliminate a negation from a logical proof. The rule is based on the equivalence of, for example, It is false that it is not raining. and It is raining.
The double negation introduction rule is:
and the double negation elimination rule is:

==Formal notation==

The double negation introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:
The double negation elimination rule may be written as:
In rule form:
and
or as a tautology (plain propositional calculus sentence):
and
These can be combined together into a single biconditional formula:
Since biconditionality is an equivalence relation, any instance of ¬¬A in a well-formed formula can be replaced by A, leaving unchanged the truth-value of the well-formed formula.
In set theory also we have the negation operation of the complement which obeys this property: a set A and a set (AC)C (where AC represents the complement of A) are the same.
