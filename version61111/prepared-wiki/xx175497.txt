BMC Racing Team (UCI Team Code: BMC) is a UCI ProTeam title sponsored by BMC, a Swiss-based bicycle frame manufacturer. The team is co-owned by American cyclist Jim Ochowicz, who founded the 7-Eleven Cycling Team, and is the team manager.

==History==

The team signed a number of major international riders for the 2010 season, including 2009 World Champion, two-time Tour de France runner-up and 2011 winner Cadel Evans, 2009 U.S. Road Race Champion George Hincapie, 2008 World Champion Alessandro Ballan and Spring Classics specialists Karsten Kroon and Marcus Burghardt.
In 2010 the team participated in their first Grand Tours, having been invited to compete in the 2010 Tour de France and the 2010 Giro d'Italia. In 2011, the team attained UCI ProTeam status, the most prestigious classification available. BMC rider Cadel Evans won the 2011 Tour de France, and newly signed 2012 riders Thor Hushovd and Philippe Gilbert, are the 2010 world-champion and the 2011 same-season-winner of all three Ardennes classics, respectively.
In 2012, Evans was unable to defend his title at the Tour de France, finishing in seventh overall, two places behind team mate Tejay van Garderen.
Cadel Evans placed third overall at the 2013 Giro d'Italia.
At the 2013 Tour de France, Cadel Evans finished 39th, Tejay van Garderen 45th, with Steve Morabito the highest placed overall at 35th. Shortly after the end of the Tour, it was announced that John Lelangue, who had been directeur sportif since the team was founded in 2007, was leaving the team "for personal reasons".http://road.cc/content/news/88901-directeur-sportif-john-lelangue-leaves-bmc-racing In September 2013 Jim Ochowicz announced the appointment of Valerio Piva as Lelangue's replacement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bmc-racing.com/int-en/athletes/bmc-racing-team/news/team/bmc-racing-team-hires-piva-as-sport-director/ |title=BMC Racing Team Hires Piva As Sports Director|date=September 2, 2013 |website=BMC Racing Team |accessdate=February 20, 2014[/tpl]
