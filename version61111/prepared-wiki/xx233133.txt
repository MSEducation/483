Ali Selmi is a football manager from Tunisia.
In the 1998 FIFA World Cup finals, he took charge of the Tunisia national football team for their final group match, after original manager Henryk Kasperczak was fired after two losses and saw the team eliminated from contention. Tunisia played Romania to a 1-1 draw in that match. Selmi himself was fired shortly thereafter.http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/07/04/phead.htm He has later coached AS Marsa.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4749119.stm
