Erik founded the first Norse colonies in Greenland, and was based at the family estate Brattahlíð in the so-called Eastern Settlement, where Leif had his upbringing. Leif had two known sons: Thorgils, born to noblewoman Thorgunna in the Hebrides; and Thorkell, who succeeded him as chieftain of the Greenland settlement.

==Early life==

Leif was the son of Erik the Red and his wife Thjodhild, and the grandson of Thorvaldr Ásvaldsson. His year of birth is most often given as c. 970 or c. 980. Though Leif's birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas,[tpl]cite web|url=http://snl.no/Leiv_Eiriksson|work=Store norske leksikon|title=Leiv Eiriksson|accessdate=November 13, 2011|language=Norwegian[/tpl] it is likely he was born in Iceland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visindavefur.hi.is/svar.asp?id=1790 |title=Vísindavefurinn: Var Leifur Eiríksson ekki Grænlendingur sem átti rætur að rekja til Íslands og Noregs? |language=Icelandic |publisher=Visindavefur.hi.is |date=July 14, 2001 |accessdate=February 16, 2010[/tpl] where his parents metSanderson, Jeanette.

Thorvald Asvaldsson was banished from Norway for manslaughter and went into exile in Iceland accompanied by young Erik. When Erik was himself banished from Iceland, he travelled further west to an area he named Greenland, where he established the first permanent settlement in 986.[tpl]cite book|title=Vikings in the attic: in search of Nordic America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AWs-DvreMYoC&dq=|first=Eric|last=Dregni|pages=72–73|year=2011|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-6744-4[/tpl] Tyrker, one of Erik's thralls, had been specially trusted to keep in charge of Erik's children, as Leif later referred to him as his "foster father".[tpl]cite book|page=158|title=Discovering the Global Past|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5hvkfdkal1QC&dq=|first1=Merry E. |last1=Wiesner|first2=Merry E. |last2=Wiesner-Hanks|first3=William Bruce |last3=Wheeler|first4=Franklin |last4=Doeringer|first5=Kenneth R. |last5=Curtis|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-34142-8[/tpl]

==Discovering Vinland==

Leif and his crew travelled from Greenland to Norway in 999. Blown off course to the Hebrides and staying for much of the summer, he arrived in Norway and became a hirdman of King Olaf Tryggvason. He also converted to Christianity and was given the mission of introducing the religion to Greenland.Somerville & McDonald, 2010, pp. 419–420. The Saga of Erik the Red and the Saga of the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200,[tpl]cite book|first=Thomas|last=Lindkvist|page=212|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|chapter=Early political organisation|title=The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Prehistory to 1520|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47299-9[/tpl] contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland.Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 350.Short, 2010, p. 203. The two only known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/history.html|title=Vinland History|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|work=National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=November 23, 2011[/tpl] According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Leif apparently saw Vinland for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.
According to a literal interpretation of Einar Haugen's translation of the two sagas in the book Voyages to Vinland, Leif was not the first European to discover America, nor the first to make landfall there: he had heard the story of merchant Bjarni Herjólfsson who claimed to have sighted land to the west of Greenland after having been blown off course. Bjarni reportedly never made landfall there, however. Later, when travelling from Norway to Greenland, Leif was also blown off course, to a land that he did not expect to see, where he found "self-sown wheat fields and grapevines". He next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country and went back to Greenland (and Christianised the people there).http://www.archive.org/stream/voyagestovinland013593mbp/voyagestovinland013593mbp_djvu.txt Consequently, if this is to be trusted, Bjarni Herjólfsson was the first European to see America beyond Greenland, and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to Europeans to have made landfall there.
Leif then approached Bjarni, purchased his ship, gathered a crew of thirty-five men, and mounted an expedition towards the land Bjarni had described.Short, 2010, pp. 203–204. His father Erik was set to join him but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to set sail, an incident he interpreted as a bad omen.Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 352. Leif followed Bjarni's route in reverse and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named Helluland (Flat-Rock Land; possibly Baffin Island). After venturing further by sea, he landed the second time in a forested place he named Markland (Forest Land; possibly Labrador). Finally, after two more days at sea, he landed in a luscious place with plentiful stores of salmon. As winter approached, he decided to encamp there for the winter, and broke his party into two groups - one to remain at camp and the other to explore the lands. During one of these explorations, Tyrker discovered that the land was full of vines and grapes. Leif therefore named the land  Vinland.Kudeba, N. (2014, April 19). Chapter 5 – Norse Explorers from Erik the Red to Leif Erikson – Canadian Explorers. Retrieved from The History of Canada: http://www.thehistoryofcanadapodcast.com/norse-explorers/ There, he and his crew built a small settlement, which was called Leifsbúðir (Leif's Booths) by later visitors from Greenland. After having wintered over in Vinland, Leif returned to Greenland in the spring with a cargo of grapes and timber.Somerville & McDonald, 2010, pp. 352–354. On the return voyage, he rescued an Icelandic castaway and his crew, earning him the nickname "Leif the Lucky".Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 354.
Research done in the early 1960s by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse settlement located at the northern tip of Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L'Anse aux Meadows, is Leif's settlement of Leifsbúðir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1328355/Helge-Ingstad.html|work=The Telegraph|title=Helge Ingstad|date=March 30, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2011[/tpl]Short, 2010, p. 207. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was a ship repair station and waypoint for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L'Anse aux Meadows with Leifsbúðir[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/archeo.html|title=Vinland Archeology|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|work=National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=November 21, 2011[/tpl] since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The Saga of Erik the Red mentions two other settlements in Vinland: a settlement called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html|title=Vinland Sagas|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|work=National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=November 21, 2011[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Leif was described as a wise, considerate, and strong man of striking appearance. During his stay in the Hebrides, he fell in love with noblewoman Thorgunna who gave birth to their son Thorgils. Thorgils was later sent to Leif in Greenland, but he did not become popular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/vinland/whereisvinland/leif/indexen.html|title=Leif Eiriksson, "Leif the Lucky" (Leifr Eiríksson, nicknamed, Leifr hin heppni)|accessdate=November 21, 2011|work=Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History: Where is Vinland?[/tpl] After his first trip to Vinland, he returned to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders. His father Erik reacted coldly to the suggestion that he should abandon his religion, while his mother Thjóðhildr quickly became a Christian and built a church called Thjóðhild's Church.Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 420. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell.[tpl]cite book|title=The frozen echo: Greenland and the exploration of North America, ca.

==Legacy==

===Norse and medieval Europe===

Leif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, so-called skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries.Schledermann, Peter. (1996). Voices in Stone. A Personal Journey into the Arctic Past. Komatik Series no. 5. Calgary: The Arctic Institute of North America and the University of Calgary.Sutherland, Patricia. (2000). "The Norse and Native Norse Americans". In William W. Fitzhugh and Elisabeth I. Ward, eds., Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga, pp. 238–247. Washington, DC: The Smithsonian Institution. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.Short, 2010, pp. 203–206.

===United States===

Stories of Leif's journey to North America had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic immigrants to the United States. The first statue of Leif (by Anne Whitney)Forbes, Alan and Ralph M. Eastman, "Some Statues of Boston: Reproductions of some of the statues for which Boston is famous, with information concerning the personalities and events memorialized", State Street Trust Company, Boston MA 1946 and Forbes, Alan and Ralph M. Eastman, "Other Statues of Boston", State Street Trust Company, Boston MA 1947. was erected in Boston in 1887, as many believed that Vinland could have been located at Cape Cod; not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee.[tpl]cite book |last1=Buck |first1=Diane M |last2=Palmer |first2=Virginia A |title=Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook |publisher=The State Historical Society of Wisconsin |location=Madison |year=1995 |pages=9–12 |isbn=978-0-87020-276-6[/tpl] A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of a reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway. Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900.[tpl]cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika|encyclopedia=Store norske leksikon|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Leiv_Eiriksson_oppdager_Amerika|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl]
For the centenary of the first official immigration of Norwegians to America, President Calvin Coolidge stated at the 1925 Minnesota State Fair, to a crowd of 100,000 people, that Leif had indeed been the first European to discover America. Further statues of him were erected at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in 1949, near Lake Superior in Duluth in 1956, and in downtown Seattle.
The date October 9 has been used to remember Leif Erikson in the United States. In 1929, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a bill to make October 9 "Leif Erikson Day" in the state; the bill was signed by Governor Walter J. Kohler, Sr. in May of the same year.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.nb.no/leiveriksson/leiv_carl.html|first=Carl G. O.|last=Hansen|title=My Minneapolis|year=1956|chapter=Leif Erikson Comes to the Front|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl] That date was not chosen to commemorate any event in the life of the explorer. Rather, it marked the first organized immigration from Norway to the United States when the ship Restauration, coming from Stavanger, arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825.[tpl]cite press release|title=Leif Erikson Day, 2009|publisher=White House Office of the Press Secretary|date=October 7, 2009|first=Barack|last=Obama|authorlink=Barack Obama|accessdate=November 20, 2011|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamation-leif-erikson-day[/tpl] In 1964 the United States Congress authorized and requested the president to proclaim October 9 of each year as "Leif Erikson Day".

==Leif in fiction==

Leif is a major character in Vinland the Good, a juvenile historical novel by Henry Treece, in a sense the unhappy hero of the story.  Although a fictional account, it is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Greenland Saga.
