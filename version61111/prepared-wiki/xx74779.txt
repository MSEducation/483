Quttinirpaaq National Park is a Canadian national park. Located on the northeastern corner of Ellesmere Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, the most northerly extent of Canada, it is the second most northerly park on Earth after Northeast Greenland National Park. In Inuktitut, Quttinirpaaq means "top of the world". It was established as Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve in 1988, and the name was changed to Quttinirpaaq in 1999,The Canadian Encyclopedia when Nunavut was created, and became a national park in 2000.New Parks North The reserve covers [tpl]convert|37775|km2|0|abbr=on[/tpl], making it the second largest park in Canada, after Wood Buffalo National Park.

==Landscape==

The land is dominated by rock and ice. It is a polar desert with very little annual precipitation.  
Much of the highlands of the park are covered in ice caps.  These ice caps, and the glaciers that descend from them, date back at least to the last episode of glaciation. 
The park includes Barbeau Peak, which at [tpl]convert|2616|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] is the highest mountain in Nunavut.

==Wildlife==

Some wildlife, notably lemming, arctic hare, muskox and arctic wolf live in the park, but sparse vegetation and low temperatures support only small populations. There is a very small Peary caribou population as well.  During summer months, birds nest in the park including semipalmated plovers, red knots, gyrfalcon and long-tailed jaeger.  Common plants include dwarf willow and arctic cotton, in addition to grasses and lichens.  Plant and animal life is more concentrated in the Lake Hazen region, which has a milder climate than the surrounding ice cap covered mountains and valleys.

==Human history==

Due to its high latitude and limited wildlife, there has never been any significant human presence within this part of Ellesmere Island.  The pass from Tanquary Fiord through to Lake Hazen shows evidence of being used by arctic people since about 5000 years ago.  Tent rings and food caches show that the area was visited by pre-Dorset, Dorset and Thule people, the ancestors of modern Inuit.
The east and north end of the island was used as a starting point for various polar explorations.  Fort Conger was an early Arctic exploration research base, and is now maintained as a Federal Heritage Building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nu/quttinirpaaq/natcul/natcul6.aspx|title=Quttinirpaaq National Park of Canada|work=pc.gc.ca|accessdate=27 February 2010[/tpl]

Parks Canada maintains warden stations and gravel air strips at Tanquary Fiord Airport, Lake Hazen and Ward Island.  Tanquary Fiord and Lake Hazen are the main access points for tourists.To Get to Quttinirpaaq National Park - Parks Canada  Beyond these warden stations, there are no facilities within the park itself.  Two backpacking routes are the route between Lake Hazen and Tanquary Fiord, and a loop around the Ad Astra and Viking ice caps, both approximately 100Â km.
In 2004, the park was one of nine sites added to Canada's tentative list of potential World Heritage Sites.http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1943/
