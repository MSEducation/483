Special Branch is a label customarily used to identify units responsible for matters of national security in British and Commonwealth police forces, as well as in Ireland and the Royal Thai Police. A Special Branch unit acquires and develops intelligence, usually of a political nature, and conducts investigations to protect the State from perceived threats of subversion—particularly terrorism and other extremist activity.
The first Special Branch, or Special Irish Branch, as it was known, was a unit of London's Metropolitan Police formed in March 1883 to combat the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The name became  Special Branch as the unit's remit widened.

Similar to their Commonwealth counterparts, the Fijian Special Branch deals with matters of national security. They facilitate Interpol, Counter Terrorism, surveillance, Anti-espionage and VIP Protection units. Entry into Special Branch is usually by recruitment. Even though it is a Police unit, Special Branch originally also recruits from the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.
The unit's name has changed to the Fiji Police Intelligence Bureau on 2009.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091026204044/http://www.connectme.com.fj/news/featured/Special-branch-undergoes-name-change|url=http://www.connectme.com.fj/news/featured/Special-branch-undergoes-name-change|title=Special branch undergoes name change|accessdate=2011-08-14|archivedate=2009-10-26|publisher=Connect Me[/tpl] According to the Fijian government, this was done due to the "impact of modern crimes with other unlawful and illegal activities in national development demands dramatic changes in the Force."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=170:220909-cabinet-approves-name-change-for-special-branch&catid=49:cabinet-releases&Itemid=166|title=22/09/09 - Cabinet approves name change for special branch|accessdate=2011-08-14|publisher=Fijian government[/tpl] This was also done while the police force was being modernized.

==Hong Kong==

The Special Branch of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force (RHKPF) consisted only of the Intelligence Wing and the Security Wing. The division was disbanded in 1995, prior to the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Dqv3Hp7F|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/998947/kmt-spies-infiltrated-colonial-police|title=KMT spies infiltrated colonial police|author=Stephen Seawright|accessdate=2013-01-21|archivedate=2013-01-21|publisher=South China Morning Post[/tpl] Units of SB were re-assigned under the Security Wing (Department B) - Crime and Security.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Dqy6uAFT|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/119636/fbi-style-security-squad-start|title=FBI-style security squad to start up|author=Darren Goodsir|date=1995-06-01|accessdate=2013-01-21|archivedate=2013-01-21|publisher=South China Morning Post[/tpl]
The Security Wing was revived after the 1997 transfer of sovereignty and is now responsible for the Very Important Person Protection Unit. As for the former, it was eliminated and all related information was deleted to prevent it from being transferred to Chinese hands. The RHKPF's Special Branch did not leave any record of their work, owing to their intelligence duties.
Recent declassified documents showed that the RHKPF's Special Branch had problems with infiltration by spies working for the Taiwanese government during the Cold War.

==India==

The Special Branch is a separate wing in the state police forces in India. Like their counterparts in the United Kingdom, they deal with matters of state security. However more serious espionage detection etc., are done by the Intelligence Bureau (IB), India's internal security agency.
There have been many allegations that the Special Branch is used by the ruling government (and the political party) for setting up surveillance on their political opponents. The Special Branch has its own Detective Constables, Head Constables, Inspector rankings and superior police officer rankings. Every police station is to have a Special Branch head constable or Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) (working plain clothes or Mufti), he would be observing the society in general, and also taking reports from the uniformed police constables on general patrol. The special branch staff play a very important role in collecting advance intelligence about law and order matters as well as illegal activities like cannabis plantation/transportation, illicit attacks, etc.  They forward the information to the respective Superintendents of police for necessary action.

==Ireland==

In Ireland, the 'Special Branch' is known officially as the Special Detective Unit (SDU). The counter-terrorist and counterintelligence unit operates under the auspices of the Crime & Security Branch (CSB) of the Garda Síochána (Irish National Police). The SDU is responsible for the investigation of threats to state security and the monitoring of persons and groups who pose a threat on both national and international fronts. The SDU works closely with other special units within the Garda Síochána, such as the National Surveillance Unit (NSU) and Emergency Response Unit (ERU), and Ireland's national and military intelligence agency - the Defence Forces Directorate of Intelligence (G2). The Special Detective Unit has a close working relationship with similar units in other western countries, particularly the United Kingdom, who share information to target, detect and disrupt the activities of terrorists.[tpl]cite web|title=The Crime & Security Branch (CSB) / Special Detective Unit (SDU)|url=http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=40|work=1 January 2014|publisher=An Garda Síochána (Irish National Police)|accessdate=6 February 2014[/tpl]

==Rhodesia==

The BSAP developed its Special Branch in the early 1950s amid growing unrest within black communities protesting slow progress towards racial equality. During the period of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, also known as the Central African Federation (CAF) 1953–63, that brought the self-governing and virtually independent British colony of Southern Rhodesia into a federation with the British protectorates of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland, (Malawi) the political nature of Special Branch became a source of tension between the BSAP and different police forces in the northern territories. Following the dissolution of the CAF and the refusal of the British government to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia without more progress towards multiracial democracy, the predominantly white electorate of Southern Rhodesia backed a Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. London instructed all Southern Rhodesian civil servants, including the police, to stay at their posts while the white settler rebellion was resolved diplomatically. Under Emergency Powers, Special Branch became the principal internal security agency in the "phoney war" with Zimbabwean guerrillas 1966–72, serving as a model for and establishing strong links with South Africa's Special Branch. As the Chimurenga or Bush War gathered force after 1972, Special Branch developed the Selous Scouts, an undercover tracker battalion of 1,500 troops, 80 percent black, many having been recruited from captured guerrillas facing trial and possible execution, and liberation groups such as the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) to disrupt Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) camps across the border in Mozambique.Flower, K.

However, as the war turned against the white settler regime, the lead role of Special Branch was taken over by the Central Intelligence Organisation and Rhodesian Army intelligence. Following the transition to independent Zimbabwe in 1980, some Special Branch members were incorporated within the South African security services, while others found ready employment in the Persian Gulf states.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]

==United Kingdom==

The first Special Branch in the world was formed in London, and it has spread throughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Each British police force went on to form its own Special Branch, the largest being that of the Metropolitan Police until it was merged with the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13) to form Counter Terrorism Command or SO15 in 2006. Special Branch maintained contact with the Security Service. Although they were not part of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), they were entitled to use the prefix "Detective" in front of their ranks.
Special Branch had responsibility for, amongst other things, personal protection of (non-royal) VIPs and performing the role of examining officer at designated ports and airports, as prescribed by the Terrorism Act 2000.
The intelligence work of Special Branch was often overlooked in some circles. This is because its role sat somewhere between that of the Security Service and that of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). Special Branch officers were usually the ones to perform arrests of suspected spies, since MI5 officers are not authorized to take such actions; an example being the Portland Spy Ring.
It was announced, in September 2005, that the Metropolitan Police Special Branch would be merging with the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Metropolitan Police to form a new department called Counter Terrorism Command,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4227476.stm |title=UK | Special Branch to close in merger |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-09 |accessdate=2009-06-11[/tpl] with the new department coming into being on 2 October 2006,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/so/counter_terrorism.htm |title=Metropolitan Police Service - Specialist Operations |publisher=Met.police.uk |accessdate=2009-06-11[/tpl] thus completing a process begun when the investigative wing of the Special Branch X squad became The Anti-Terrorist Branch in 1972.
Most, if not all UK police services still maintain a Special Branch. Strathclyde Police maintained a Special Branch until it was renamed the Counter Terrorist Intelligence Section.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.strathclyde.police.uk/index.asp?locID=1506&docID=-1|title=Small Ports Unit|accessdate=2011-08-14|publisher=Strathclyde Police[/tpl]
