Aamir Khan Productions (AKP) was set up in 1999 by Hindi film actor Aamir Khan with the purpose of producing the film Lagaan. He decided to produce Lagaan after the script was not purchased by any other studio. B. Shrinivas Rao also joined Aamir Khan Productions as the Line Producer on Lagaan. The movie was released in 2001, starring Khan as the lead actor. The film was both a major critical and commercial success, and was nominated for the 74th Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category. It was eventually chosen and nominated in that category along with four other foreign films but lost to No Man's Land. The film won many major awards at several award functions such as Filmfare and IIFA.
B. Shrinivas Rao later served as the Executive Producer on Khan's directorial debut Taare Zameen Par and became the Executive Producer for the production company, supervising all of its productions. Khan also starred in Taare Zameen Par, sharing the screen with the debut of child actor Darsheel Safary and Tisca Chopra. The film was initially conceived of and developed by the husband and wife team, Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia.

Story was based on the suicides committed by the Indian farmers due to bad conditions of theirs financial status. Peepli Live had its Melbourne premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival MIFF 2010 on 6 August 2010 at the Regent Theatre, Melbourne. In 2004, Rizvi asked Amir Khan to read her script and, although he initially refused as he was preoccupied with shooting Mangal Pandey: The Rising, he eventually relented and decided to finance the film after she described the plot to him. In 2011, the English (partly Hindi) Delhi Belly was released, and was a departure from the "clean, family entertainment" tag of Aamir Khan Productions.
