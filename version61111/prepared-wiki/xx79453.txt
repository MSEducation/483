==History==

===First formation===

Mirroring developments in the UK, a group called the National Front evolved out of the New Zealand branch of the League of Empire Loyalists in 1967.Spoonley, Paul The Politics of Nostalgia: racism and the extreme right in New Zealand The Dunmore Press (1987) p157 It was led by Brian Thompson; another notable member was Roger Clare who would later become an activist with the League of St George.Spoonley, Paul The Politics of Nostalgia: racism and the extreme right in New Zealand The Dunmore Press (1987) pp157-158 It published a magazine called Counter-attack. The group dissolved by the beginning of the 1970s, with  Thompson remaining an overseas supporter of the UK National Front.

===Official organisation===

The National Front of New Zealand, commonly known as the "New Zealand National Front" (NZNF) was an initiative of John Tyndall of the British National Front formed in 1977; sister organisations were also formed in Australia and South Africa at the same time.
The party's first Chairman was David Crawford aided by Brian Thompson, with Kerry Bolton joining in 1978. It distributed "large numbers of Holocaust denial pamphlets and books".Joel Stuart Hayward Holocaust Revisionism in New Zealand: The ‘Thinking-man’s Anti-Semitism?

From June 1978 the party jointly published a magazine called Frontline with the National Front of Australia. After the demise of the party, the magazine continued to March 1987 in support of a more general non-party "nationalist cause".

===Current party===

In 1989 Anton Foljambe sought to revive the Frontline title for his "Conservative Front" grouping. This led to the reformation of the NZNF with himself as leader. It published a magazine, edited by Foljambe, called Viewpoint. Foljambe resigned as leader in 1997 establishing the rival National Democrats Party in 1999. Kyle Chapman then led the party until resigning as leader in 2005, with Bolton rejoining in 2004. Its peak strength was in 2003 - 2005, under the leadership of Chapman and Bolton, when it seemed to never be out of the headlines [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]. Membership and support has declined since Chapman's resignation. His replacement, Sid Wilson, was abrasive and struggled to retain the support built up by Chapman.  Wilson was sacked as leader in July 2007. Since 2008 the party has been led by  Colin Ansell. Answell stated that the party was to be a "broad spectrum nationalist movement" with a "strong view on immigration"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/2389206/Former-leaders-move-may-irk-right-wing |title=Former leader's move may irk National Front |author=Neems, Jeff |date=6 May 2009 |work=Waikato Times |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]
In June 2008, the party joined forces with the National Democrats and another international organisation, the 'New Right', to jointly contest the 2008 elections as the Nationalist Alliance.[tpl]cite web |title=New Projects  |url=http://kylechapman.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-projects.html |publisher=Kyle Chapman blog |date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=6 July 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
