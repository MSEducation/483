Poshuouinge  (pronounced "poe-shoo-wingay") is a large ancestral Pueblo ruin[tpl]cite book|last=Koenig|first=Harriet|title=Acculturation in the Navajo Eden: New Mexico, 1550-1750, Archaeology, Language, Religion of the Peoples of the Southwest|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fFibSRzwmhMC&pg=PA22|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=March 2005|publisher=YBK Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0-9764359-1-4|pages=22, 80, 90–[/tpl] located on U.S. Route 84, about [tpl]convert|2.5| mi[/tpl] south of Abiquiu, New Mexico.  Its builders were the ancestors of the Tewa Pueblos who now (2011) reside in Santa Clara Pueblo and San Juan Pueblo. It has also been referred to informally as Turquoise Ruin, although there is no evidence that turquoise has ever been found in the area.[tpl]cite book|last=Morgan|first=William N.|title=Ancient architecture of the Southwest|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QYyCPUN6BbAC&pg=PA213|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=1994|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75159-0|page=213[/tpl] Poshuouinge is situated [tpl]convert|3|mi[/tpl] upstream and due west of another Tewa Pueblo ancestral site, Tsama.

==Geography==

Poshuouinge was built on a high mesa, some [tpl]convert|150|ft[/tpl] above the Chama River, around 1400. There are two springs located about [tpl]convert|500|ft[/tpl] to the south of the ruins which are believed to have been the main water sources for the habitation. It is accessible by a United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service trail.
This city, at its largest, consisted of about 700 ground floor rooms, most being two or even three stories tall.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|first=Richard K.|title=New Mexico Off the Beaten Path, 9th: A Guide to Unique Places|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mNSmdz0x_0wC&pg=PA68|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=10 November 2009|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-5049-8|page=68[/tpl] The city was laid out with two main plazas, and a large kiva near the center of the eastern courtyard. The barrow pits of Poshuouinge were planted with small stone grids in the basement.[tpl]cite book|last=Minnis|first=Paul E.|title=Biodiversity and Native America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qD2Z8Ng0pScC&pg=PA214|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=August 2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3345-4|pages=214–[/tpl]

==History==

The city is believed to have been occupied between 1375 and 1475.[tpl]cite book|last1=Killion|first1=Thomas W.|last2=Meeting|first2=Society for American Archaeology.|title=Gardens of prehistory: the archaeology of settlement agriculture in Greater Mesoamerica|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DikqLo8h_NMC&pg=PA56|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=1992|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-0565-9|page=56[/tpl] The site was abandoned around 1500, well before Coronado and the first Europeans arrived. It is believed that its inhabitants left the banks of the Chama River and relocated nearby around the Rio Grande, where their descendants live today.Noble, David Grant,  Ancient Ruins of the Southwest: An Archaeological Guide, Northland Publishing, Flagstaff, Arizona, pp. 203-205
