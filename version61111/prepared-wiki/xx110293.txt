==History==

===Beginnings===

On December 2, 1905, the Boiling Springs High School was chartered as a result of an initiative sponsored by the Kings Mountain Baptist Association (Cleveland County) and the Sandy Run Baptist Association (Rutherford County). The institution served as a place "where the young...could have the best possible educational advantages under distinctive Christian influence."[tpl]cite web|title=History of Gardner-Webb|url=http://www.gardner-webb.edu/about-gwu/who-we-are/history/index.html|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl] In May 1905 Boiling Springs Baptist Church voted to offer its old church house, five acres of land, and $2,700 to the institution,[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=12[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Dedmond|first=Francis|title=Lengthened Shadows|year=1957|publisher=Gardner-Webb College[/tpl] and on July 10, 1905 Boiling Springs was officially chosen for the site of the school. The location of the High School was essential, as it was located near the border of the school's sponsors, Kings Mountain and Sandy Run, and had easy access to brick building materials.[tpl]cite book|last=Hamrick|first=Oliver|title=Born at the Crossroads|year=1960[/tpl] The institution's name, Boiling Springs High School, was decided on October 27, 1905, and its charter was accepted less than two months later by the school's trustees. The town of Boiling Springs is named after the natural springs that can be found on campus. They provided clean water for the school when it began operation in 1907.
J.D. Huggins was made the High School's first principal on July 25, 1907.[tpl]cite book|last=Dedmond|first=Francis|title=Lengthened Shadows|year=1957|publisher=Gardner-Webb College[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=16[/tpl] The complete faculty, which consisted of only five teachers, including Huggins, was hired by the fall of 1907. Classes started in October of the same year, although the main building, the Huggins-Curtis Building, was not complete. Students lived in various homes in the community and used classrooms from the nearby elementary school until the building's completion in 1908. The building included classrooms, auditoriums, a chapel, library, principal's office, cafeteria, living quarters, literary societies, a music room, and parlors.[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=17[/tpl] Although it burned down in 1957, it signified the promise and progress of the school so far.
Boiling Springs High School focused on Christian education, as evident in the school's motto, Pro Deo et Humanitate (for God and Humanity). These words were inscribed upon "the ageless granite arch" on campus, which still exists today.[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=21[/tpl] Original tuition was $76.05 for a term of nine months, and although the school attracted a wide variety of students with varied interests, its focus centered around ministerial education.[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=24[/tpl]

===Expansion and growth===

The high school became Boiling Springs Junior College in 1928 due to the changing educational needs of the area. The Great Depression created many obstacles for the College, but its survival was secured by the sacrifices of loyal supporters.[tpl]cite web|title=History of Gardner-Webb|url=http://www.gardner-webb.edu/about-gwu/who-we-are/history/index.html|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|accessdate=7 November 2012[/tpl] The college began with seven departments: English, mathematics, natural science, foreign language, social science, Bible, and education.[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=39[/tpl] The first graduating class consisted of roughly 200 students, with one of the earliest graduates being W. J. Cash, author of The Mind of the South.[tpl]cite web|title=North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program|url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=O-43%20-%20GARDNER-WEBB%20UNIVERSITY|publisher=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources|accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl]
In 1942, Governor O. Max Gardner began devoting his energy, time, and wealth to strengthening the College. On June 15, the trustees voted to change the name to Gardner–Webb Junior College in honor of Gardner and his wife, Fay Webb-Gardner. During the following year, the institution embarked on a $300,000 financial campaign. At the conclusion of this initiative the trustees announced the school to be debt-free.[tpl]cite book|last=Jolley|first=Lansford|title=Dreaming, Daring, Doing... The Story of Gardner-Webb University|year=1997|publisher=Gardner-Webb University|pages=61[/tpl]
The decades following World War II were years of physical growth and academic development. New buildings went up as enrollments increased. A major step in the institutions' development was its full accreditation as a senior college in December, 1971. In 1980 the college began a graduate program, which became the Graduate School in the 1990s.[tpl]cite journal|authors=Gardner-Webb University|journal=Gardner-Webb University: Faculty Emeriti|year=2008|issue=2[/tpl] The School of Divinity was also founded during this time. The institution officially became known as Gardner–Webb University in January 1993, culminating years of preparation, and by the early 2000s the school had more than 3,200 students and 135 faculty members.
