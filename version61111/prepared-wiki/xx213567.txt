[[Schütte-Lanz D.I]]

CATEGORIES: German fighter aircraft 1910–1919, Schütte-Lanz aircraft

The Schütte-Lanz D.I was a German single-seat biplane fighter, often said to be Germany's first biplane attack aircraft. The D.I was light-weight and made of wood covered in fabric, apparently based on the British design of the Sopwith Tabloid. 

==Operational history==

After Idflieg testing in 1915, the plane was rejected on the grounds that the biplane design afforded less vision to the pilot than a monoplane and was as such unsuitable for use as a fighter. A modified version, the Schütte-Lanz D.II was produced in the same year.
