Bryan Edmund "Moose" Haas (born April 22, 1956 in Baltimore, Maryland), is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1976-1987. He appeared in the 1982 World Series as a member of the Brewers.
On April 12, 1978, Haas struck out 14 batters, breaking record for strikeouts in a single game for the Brewers. This franchise record stood for 26 years, broken by Ben Sheets.[tpl]Cite web|date=May 17, 2004|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20040517&content_id=745688&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Milwaukee's Ben Sheets named National League Player of the Week|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=February 13, 2010[/tpl]
"Moose" earned his nickname after an unfortunate weekend run-in with a full-grown moose while on vacation in the Appalachian mountains. The confrontation resulted in the [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] moose felled at the hands of Mr. Haas. The head of the moose (who Mr. Haas later named "Wallace") was hung in his dining room as a memento of that infamous meeting and remains on display to this day. (It is noteworthy that Moose has publicly stated that his father gave him that nickname upon birth: "My father gave it to me when I was born. I wasn't that big, only seven and a quarter pounds, but I guess I looked to my father like I was going to be big. It didn't work out."http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/10/sports/sports-of-the-times-limelight-for-2-invisible-brewers.html)
Moose's 1987 Topps Baseball Card states that he is also a locksmith, a magician and a black belt in taekwondo.
