The Solo Collection is a box set detailing the solo career of Freddie Mercury; it includes the material Mercury recorded before joining up with Queen, up through the 1993 No More Brothers remixes. Mercury's singles and two studio albums are included, as well as a disc of instrumentals, numerous rare tracks, and a set of interviews conducted by David Wigg. Also included are two DVDs: a collection of music videos, and a documentary covering Mercury's life.

In early prints of the Solo Collection box, the third chapter of the DVD, "Culture Shock", includes what is described in the audio commentary by the filmmakers, Rudi Dolezal and Hannes Rossacher, as a reconstruction of a Parsi initiation religious ceremony. This segment was completely edited out from all subsequent reprints of the DVD as it was considered potentially offensive. It is also absent from the second version of the documentary, released in 2006 as Disc 1 of Lover of Life, Singer of Songs, the DVD release accompanying the same-titled compilation CD of Mercury solo recordings.

The box set was also released as a three-disc sampler titled Solo. This edition contains Mercury's two original studio albums, as well as a third disc of selected tracks from the twelve-disc box set.
