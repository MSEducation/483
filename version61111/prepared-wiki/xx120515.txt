==History==

With the expansion of the communities of Portlethen and Newtonhill in the 1980s, the Education Committee of Grampian Regional Council decided to build a new six-year Academy in Portlethen. Until then, pupils from the area were bused to Mackie Academy, in near-by Stonehaven. Portlethen Academy opened on 20 April 1987 as a new school for the communities of Portlethen, Newtonhill, Muchalls and Banchory-Devenick. Originally owned by Grampian Regional Council, the school passed to Aberdeenshire Council, when it formed in 1996.  
The school opened with 180 pupils in Years 1 and 2 and a capacity of around 650. It has expanded in numbers each session since April 1987, reaching over 800 pupils. As the roll rose, the school became too small to accommodate all the pupils and staff. Seven temporary classrooms were added to the school prior to closure. The current head master is Neil Morrison.
Aberdeenshire Council commissioned a new school under the PPI2 Scheme.

==Current building==

As early as the turn of the millennium, plans existed for a new school, to be built and managed by Robertson FM, as part of the Government's PPI2 scheme. It was built on the playing fields adjacent to the existing Academy. Construction started in June 2004, and was completed by the end of July 2006. Originally set to open in June 2006, for the start of the new timetable, a burst pipe delayed the school's opening until August.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/news/release.asp?newsID=177| title=Press Release: New Portlethen Academy to open at start of new school year| date=10 May 2006| publisher=Aberdeenshire Council| accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl] The new building opened on 22 August 2006 with a roll of 867.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/area/portlethen_profile2007.pdf| title=Portlethen Profile 2007| format=PDF| publisher=Aberdeenshire Council| accessdate=12 September 2009[/tpl] The old school has been knocked down, and the main car park which forms part of the area along with the all-weather pitch made up stage 2 of the relocation programme.
