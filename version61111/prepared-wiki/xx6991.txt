[[Left-arm unorthodox spin]]

CATEGORIES: Cricket terminology, Bowling (cricket)

Left-arm unorthodox spin, or chinaman, is a type of bowling in the sport of cricket.
frame|right|Trajectory of a left-arm unorthodox spin delivery Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use a wrist hand action to spin the ball which turns from off to leg side of the cricket pitch. The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler; however, the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist. Some left-arm unorthodox bowlers bowl a leg spinner's "googly" (or "wrong'un"), which turns from right to left on the cricket pitch. The ball turns away from the batsman, as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner.

==Origin of the term chinaman==

In cricketing parlance, the word "chinaman" is used to describe the stock delivery of a left-arm "unorthodox" spin bowler (though some reserve it for the googly delivery http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chinaman). The name has its origins in a Test match played between the West Indies and England at Old Trafford, Manchester, in the year 1933. Elliss "Puss" Achong, a player of Chinese origin, was a left-arm orthodox spinner, playing for the West Indies at the time. According to folklore, Achong is said to have had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As he walked back to the pavilion, Robins said to the umpire, "fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!",http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/51098.html leading to the popularity of the term in England, and subsequently, in the rest of the world.
