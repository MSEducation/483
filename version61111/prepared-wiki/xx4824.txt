The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but, as of March 2006, iodine deficiency remained a serious public health problem in the developing world.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_iodine.html|title = Micronutrients – Iodine, Iron and Vitamin A|publisher = UNICEF[/tpl] Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe.

===Toxicity===

Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally.  The lethal dose for an adult human is 30 mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4 grams (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000 mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic in the presence of selenium deficiency.[tpl]cite pmid|14757962[/tpl] Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. Its toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, which make it able to denaturate proteins (including enzymes).
Elemental iodine is also a skin irritant, and direct contact with skin can cause damage, so iodine crystals should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution are capable of causing tissue damage if their use for cleaning and antisepsis is prolonged; similarly, cases have been reported where liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Povidone-iodine-induced burn: case report and review of the literature|author = Lowe, D. O. et al.|journal = Pharmacotherapy|volume = 26|issue = 11|pages= 1641–5|doi = 10.1592/phco.26.11.1641|pmid = 17064209|year = 2006[/tpl]

===Allergic reactions===

Some people develop a hypersensitivity to iodine-containing products and foods. Applications of tincture of iodine or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe.  Parenteral use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions have led to the misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Hypersensitivity reactions to iodine-containing products and foods are apparently related to their other molecular components; thus, a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one iodine-containing food or product should not be assumed to have an allergy to another one. Still, as with all medications, the potential severity of reactions to medical iodine-containing products should prompt questions about a patient's allergy history before they are administered.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Katelaris |first=Constance |year=2009 |title='Iodine Allergy' label is misleading |journal=Australian Prescriber |volume=32 |pages=125–128 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/32/5/125/8/ |issue=5[/tpl]
