 ([http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html orig link])</ref> An object in hydrostatic equilibrium is one that is large enough for its gravity to have overcome its internal rigidity, and so relax into a rounded ([[ellipsoid]]al) shape. The practical meaning of "cleared the neighborhood" is that a planet is comparatively massive enough for its gravitation to control the orbits of all objects in its vicinity. By the IAU's definition, there are eight planets in the [[Solar System]]. Those objects in orbit around the Sun that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium but have not cleared their neighborhoods are called [[dwarf planet]]s, and the remainder are termed [[small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]]. In addition, the Sun itself and a dozen or so [[natural satellite]]s are also massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium.<ref name=mike/> Apart from the Sun, these bodies are included in the term ''planetary-mass object'', or ''planemo''. All known planetary-mass objects in the Solar System, as well as the Sun, are listed below, along with a sample of the largest objects whose shape has yet to be accurately determined. The Sun's orbital characteristics are listed in relation to the [[Galactic Center]]. All other objects are listed in order of their distance from the Sun.

==Sun==

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star. It contains almost 99.9 percent of all the mass in the Solar System.[tpl]cite journal |author=M Woolfson |title=The origin and evolution of the solar system | doi= 10.1046/j.1468-4004.2000.00012.x |year=2000 |journal=Astronomy & Geophysics |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1.12 |bibcode = 2000A&G....41a..12W [/tpl]

==Planets==

 
 Planets are both large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and have cleared their neighborhoods of similar objects. There are four terrestrial planets and four gas giants in the Solar System. The latter combined comprise more than 99 percent of the mass in the Solar System excluding that of the Sun.

==Satellites==

 
 There are 19 natural satellites in the Solar System that are known to be massive enough to be close to hydrostatic equilibrium, which Alan Stern calls satellite planets. However, several of these were once in equilibrium but are no longer: these include all of the moons listed for Saturn apart from Titan and Rhea. Other moons that were once in equilibrium but are no longer very round, such as Saturn's Phoebe, are not included. Satellites are listed first in order from the Sun, and second in order from their parent body.

==IAU dwarf planets==

 
 Dwarf planets are large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but have not cleared their neighbourhoods of similar objects. There are currently five dwarf planets recognized by the IAU in this category. Ceres orbits in the asteroid belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The others orbit beyond Neptune and are sub-classified as plutoids.

==Most likely additional dwarf planets==

These trans-Neptunian objects are theoretically large enough to be dwarf planets. Dozens more could have been included.[tpl]cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets |author=Mike Brown|publisher=CalTech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl] Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined. Both are more massive than the 5[tpl]e|20[/tpl] kg recommendation of the IAU 2006 draft proposal as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet.[ref]
