CATEGORIES: Retail markets, Retailing, Reuse, Calques

A flea market (or swap meet) is a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise. Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items at low prices are commonplace.
Many markets offer fresh produce, unique products, old clothes, and plants from local farms. Renters of the flea market are vendors. It may be indoors, as in a warehouse or school gymnasium; or outdoors, as in a field or parking lot or under a tent. Flea markets can be held annually or semiannually, others may be conducted monthly, on weekends, or daily. Flea-market vendors may range from a family that is renting a table for the first time to sell a few unwanted household items, to scouts who rove the region buying items for sale from garage sales and other flea markets, and several staff watching the stalls.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Dictionary.com |year=1998 |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/flea+market |title=Flea market[/tpl][tpl]cite web |work=Conjecture Corporation |year=2003 |title= What is a Flea Market? |publisher=Wisegeek.com |accessdate= February 12, 2012 |url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-flea-market.htm |title=What is a flea market?[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Americana Resources Inc.

==Regional names==

Different English-speaking countries use various names for flea markets. In Australian English, they are also called 'trash and treasure markets'. In the Philippine English, the word is tianggê, believed to be a loanword from the Hokkien spoken by Chinese Filipino emigrants,[tpl]cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20101112-302769/Tiangge |title=The Philippine Inquirer: Tiangge |publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09[/tpl] or possibly from the Nahuatl tianguis via Mexican Spanish, supplanting the indigenous term talipapâ.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tagaloglang.com/Tagalog-English-Dictionary/English-Translation-of-Tagalog-Word/talipapa.html |title=Tagalong Lang |publisher=Tagaloglang.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09[/tpl] In India it is known as gurjari or shrukawadi bazaar or even as juna bazaar.

In the United Kingdom they are known as "car boot sales" if the event takes place in a field or car park, as the vendors will sell goods from the 'boot' (called "trunk" in American English) of their car. If the event is held indoors, such as a school or church hall, then it is usually known as either a "jumble sale", or a "bring and buy sale". In Quebec and France, they are often called "Marché aux puces", while in French-speaking areas of Belgium, the name Brocante or vide-grenier is normally used.

==Origin==

Albert Lafarge writes that one of the first American flea markets was the Monday Trade Days in Canton, Texas, which began in 1873 as a place where people would go to buy horses; later, they brought their own goods to sell or trade. Other towns quickly adopted this pattern of trade, but the modern flea market was supposedly the brainchild of Russell Carrell, an east-coast antique show organizer. Working as an auctioneer in Connecticut, Carrell thought to run an antique show like an outdoor auction, only forgoing the tent, because fire hazards were too expensive to insure. Carrell's 1956 Hartford open-air antiques market was claimed to be the first modern incarnation of the flea market, although the true flea market does not consist of professional antique dealers, but rather of people looking to make some extra money on the side.

==Etymology==

While the concept existed in places such as what are now India, Bangladesh, and China for millennia, the origins of the term "flea market" are disputed. According to one theory, the Fly Market in 18th-century New York City began the association. The Dutch word vlaie (also spelt vlie, meaning "swamp" or "valley") was located at Maiden Lane near the East River in Manhattan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.aurorahistoryboutique.com/tag/fly-market/|title=History Blog Insight into History - A Weekly Instrospective Into The Past[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.arkansas.com/arts-crafts/flea-markets/ |title=Flea Markets in Arkansas |accessdate=2008-10-11 |year=2006 |work=Arkansas Arts and Crafts |publisher=Arkansas Department of Parks & Tourism[/tpl] The land on which the market stood was originally a salt marsh with a brook, and by the early 1800s the "Fly Market" was the city's principal market.Google books: The geographical and historical dictionary of America and the West ..., Volume 3.,  By Antonio de Alcedo, George Alexander Thompson, p. 409., 1812
Another theory maintains that "flea market" is a common English calque from the French "marché aux puces" (literally "market of the fleas").flea market. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition, 2000 The first reference to this term appeared in two conflicting stories about a location in Paris, France in the 1860s which was known as the marché aux puces (flea market).
The traditional and most-publicised story is in the article "What Is A Flea Market?" by Albert LaFarge in the 1998 winter edition of Today's Flea Market magazine: "There is a general agreement that the term "Flea Market" is a literal translation of the French marché aux puces, an outdoor bazaar in Paris, France, named after those pesky little parasites of the order Siphonaptera (or "wingless bloodsucker") that infested the upholstery of old furniture brought out for sale."
The second story appeared in the book Flea Markets, published in Europe by Chartwell Books, has in its introduction:
