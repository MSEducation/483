[[Learning object]]

CATEGORIES: Data management, Educational materials, Educational technology

A learning object is "a collection of content items, practice items, and assessment items that are combined based on a single learning objective".[tpl]citation|last=Cisco Systems|title=Reusable information object strategy|url=http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/779/ibs/solutions/learning/whitepapers/el_cisco_rio.pdf[/tpl]  The term is credited to Wayne Hodgins when he created a working group in 1994 bearing the name[tpl]citation|last=Gerard|first=R.W.|title="Shaping the mind: Computers in education", In N. A. Sciences, Applied Science and Technological Progress|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BTcrAAAAYAAJ|year=1967[/tpl] though the concept was first described by Gerard in 1967.[tpl]citation|last=Polsani|first=P.|title="Use and abuse of reusable learning objects",|url=http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/rt/printerFriendly/89/88.|year=2003[/tpl]  Learning objects go by many names, including content objects, chunks, educational objects, information objects, intelligent objects, knowledge bits, knowledge objects, learning components, media objects, reusable curriculum components, nuggets, reusable information objects, reusable learning objects, testable reusable units of cognition, training components, and units of learning.
Learning objects offer a new conceptualization of the learning process: rather than the traditional "several hour chunk", they provide smaller, self-contained, re-usable units of learning.
They will typically have a number of different components, which range from descriptive data to information about rights and educational level.  At their core, however, will be instructional content, practice, and assessment.  A key issue is the use of metadata.
Learning object design raises issues of portability, and of the object's relation to a broader learning management system.

==Definitions==

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines a learning object as "any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training".[tpl]Harvnb|Learning Technology Standards Committee|2002|p=45[/tpl]
Chiappe defined Learning Objects as: "A digital self-contained and reusable entity, with a clear educational purpose, with at least three internal and editable components: content, learning activities and elements of context. The learning objects must have an external structure of information to facilitate their identification, storage and retrieval: the metadata."[tpl]Harvnb|Chiappe|Segovia|Rincon|2007|p=8[/tpl].
The following definitions focus on the relation between learning object and digital media.  RLO-CETL, a British inter-university Learning Objects Center, defines "reusable learning objects" as "web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective".[tpl]citation|chapter= Learning Objects|url=http://www.rlo-cetl.ac.uk/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=235&Itemid=28|title=RLO-CETL: Reusable Learning Objects|accessdate=2008-04-29[/tpl]. Daniel Rehak and Robin Mason define it as "a digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning".[tpl]Harvnb|Rehak|Mason|2003|p=??[/tpl]
Adapting a definition from the Wisconsin Online Resource Center, Robert J. Beck suggests that learning objects have the following key characteristics:

==Components==

The following is a list of some of the types of information that may be included in a learning object and its metadata:

==Metadata==

One of the key issues in using learning objects is their identification by search engines or content management systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]  This is usually facilitated by assigning descriptive learning object metadata. Just as a book in a library has a record in the card catalog, learning objects must also be tagged with metadata.  The most important pieces of metadata typically associated with a learning object include:

==Mutability==

A mutated learning object is, according to Michael Shaw, a learning object that has been "re-purposed and/or re-engineered, changed or simply re-used in some way different from its original intended design". Shaw also introduces the term "contextual learning object", to describe a learning object that has been "designed to have specific meaning and purpose to an intended learner".[tpl]Harvnb|Shaw|2003[/tpl]

==Portability==

Before any institution invests a great deal of time and energy into building high-quality e-learning content (which can cost over $10,000 per classroom hour),Rumble, Greville. 2001. The Cost and Costing of Networked Learning. Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, Volume 5, Issue 2. it needs to consider how this content can be easily loaded into a Learning Management System. It is possible for example, to package learning objects with SCORM specification and load it in Moodle Learning Management System or Desire2Learn Learning Environment.
If all of the properties of a course can be precisely defined in a common format, the content can be serialized into a standard format such as XML and loaded into other systems.  When it is considered that some e-learning courses need to include video, mathematical equations using MathML, chemistry equations using CML and other complex structures, the issues become very complex, especially if the systems needs to understand and validate each structure and then place it correctly in a database.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

==Criticism==

In 2001, David Wiley criticized learning object theory in his paper, The Reusability Paradox which is summarized by D'Arcy Norman as, If a learning object is useful in a particular context, by definition it is not reusable in a different context. If a learning object is reusable in many contexts, it isnâ€™t particularly useful in any. 
In Three Objections to Learning Objects and E-learning Standards, Norm Friesen, Canada Research Chair in E-Learning Practices at Thompson Rivers University, points out that the word neutrality in itself implies a state or position that is antithetical ... to pedagogy and teaching.
