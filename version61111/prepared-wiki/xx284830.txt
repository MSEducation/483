==Early life==

Donatelli grew up in a rural area of Pennsylvania. She began playing piano at the age of three and studied classical piano for 15 years, winning first place awards in the National Federation of Music Clubs’ piano competitions three consecutive years. After college she set her musical career aside for marriage and family and did not begin singing professionally until her sons were in their teens.
While living in Atlanta, she was encouraged to return to music after attending an Atlanta jam session that attracted the region's top players, including guitarist Russell Malone. Donatelli sang several songs with Russell, and began getting calls for performances. When veteran blues singer Francine Reed joined Lyle Lovett's band, Donatelli joined the three-nights-a-week engagement at the Ritz-Carlton.[tpl]cite web|last=Herndon |first=Holly |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2008/oct/20/temecula-vocalist-donatelli-headlines-tonights/ |title=TEMECULA: Vocalist Donatelli headlines tonight's Jazz at The Merc Page 1 of 2 |publisher=UTSanDiego.com |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2013-08-12[/tpl]
