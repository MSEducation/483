The Old Guard was an Australian anti-communist organisation which was started in 1930 although at least one historian has claimed it existed as early as 1917.  Its exact origins are disputed.  It has been described as a paramilitary, quasi-official, vigilante, counterrevolutionary, anti-communist organisation.  The Old Guard had a similar purpose and was composed simarly to the National Guard of the United States.  It had legal sanction under the Peace Officers Act 1925.
The group was primarily concerned with the social conditions arising from the Great Depression and the New South Wales government led by Jack Lang.Keith Amos. Campbell, Eric (1893–1970).

Neither the Old Guard or the New Guard supported the Australia First Movement.  In response to rumours of fire-starting by agitators the Old Guard was a driving force behind the development of country bush fire brigades in New South Wales.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/nswconstitution/html/dismissal/bgr/impact.html |title=What if Jack Lang had not been dismissed? |work=Issues: New South Wales Constitution and Government |publisher=NSW Public Schools |accessdate=10 August 2013 [/tpl] As the threat of communism waned the Old Guard had little to do. It was dissolved sometime in the 1950s.

==Secrecy==

The group was sworn to absolute secrecy regarding membership, its division into cells so that its leaders were obscured and the destruction of its own records.[tpl]cite book |title=Australia: A Biography of a Nation |last=Knightley |first=Phillip |year=2001 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0099772914 |pages=142-144 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=I72ZsVtpxcUC |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl]  Media reports on the group in the 1930s were scarce.

==Split==

The New Guard split from the group in 1931. Eric Campbell wanted a more visible organisation than the secretive Old Guard.[tpl]cite book |title=History of Australia |last=Manning |first=Clark |authorlink=Manning Clark |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Melbourne University Publish |isbn=0522845231 |page=534 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=PYpNYjr_xQEC |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] The New Guard was less of a military force compared to the Old Guard which opposed the split because it was fearful of communists exploiting the division.[tpl]cite book |title=Sense and Nonsense in Australian History |last=Hirst |first=John |year=2009 |publisher=Black Inc |isbn=0977594939 |pages=239, 242 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=i_hjZdbplaoC |accessdate=10 August 2013[/tpl] Both groups had devised plans to neutralise each other should it be needed.

==Members==

At the heights of its popularity the Old Guard in Australia had a membership of around 30,000.[tpl]cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |coauthors=Paul Jackson |year=2006 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1576079406 |page=66 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nvD2rZSVau4C |accessdate=9 August 2013[/tpl] Members were loyalists and idealists devoted to the British Empire and ready to pre-emptively act to prevent a socialist revolution in Australia.  Old Guard leaders were Protestant, wealthy Anglo-Australians.  Membership in rural New South Wales and ties to the New South Wales police force were strong.
At the federal level the Old Guard had closest ties to the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Defence.
Like many former officers of the Australian Army George Wootten joined the Old Guard.A. J. Hill. Wootten, Sir George Frederick (1893–1970).  Australian Dictionary of Biography. National Centre of Biography, Australian National University. Retrieved 10 August 2013.
