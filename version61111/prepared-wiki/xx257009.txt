Archbishop John Murphy Farley commissioned the parish in 1907, purchasing the entire city block for $58,000. The cornerstone was laid on May 31, 1908 by Cardinal Logue, Archbishop of Armagh, who was visiting on the occasion of the centenary of the Archdiocese of New York. The building was solemnly dedicated on February 21, 1909.[tpl]citation|title=The Catholic church in the United States of America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ|year=1914|location=New York|author=Catholic Editing Company|page=382[/tpl]

A 105-unit affordable housing development which SEBCO built on the last parcel of city-owned land in the South Bronx was the Sister Thomas Apartments in 2008. At the dedication, the New York State Housing Finance Agency stated that "In the '60s and '70s the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx was a desolate place lined with the carcasses of buildings still smoldering from the latest fire…. The only refuge was St. Athanasius and its priests and nuns, who became beacons of hope and leaders in the tenants' rights movement…."[tpl]citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/08/10/2010-08-10_unholy_treatment_of_boro_nun.html|title=Unholy treatment: New pastor at St. Athanasius Church kicks out beloved Sister Thomas|first=Patrice|last=O'Shaughnessy|date=August 10, 2010|work=New York Daily News[/tpl]
Nevertheless, Sister Thomas and the flea market she long organized were expelled from the parish unceremoniously in 2010, dividing the community, shortly after the arrival of a new pastor. Many parishioners participated in protests against the move, while others defended the new pastor,[tpl]citation|url=http://brie.hunter.cuny.edu/hpe/?p=4355|title=Protesters Call for New Pastor’s Ouster|last=Hirsch|first=Joe|date=August 23, 2010[/tpl]
