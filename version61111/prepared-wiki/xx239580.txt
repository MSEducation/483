A bamboo bicycle is a bicycle with a frame made out of bamboo.  Custom built and manufactured bamboo bikes have become something of a trend, with producers in the United States, Asia and Africa.Smooth rides for Bangkok's first bamboo bike owner, CNNGo, Greg Jorgensen, 2 September 2010  
Some of the main features of bamboo designs are vibration damping,[tpl]cite web | title = Calfee Design: Bamboo bike | url = http://www.calfeedesign.com/bamboo.htm | accessdate = 2010-05-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100521074250/http://www.calfeedesign.com/bamboo.htm| archivedate= 21 May 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] crash tolerance, and the natural look of the bike. Vibration damping is one of the most desirable features of such bikes. A bamboo bicycle can offer a very smooth and comfortable ride.  As a consequence, bamboo has been made into road bicycles, mountain bikes, and racing bicycles.
Bamboo is also considered by some to be a more eco-friendly material than other more conventional frame materials.[tpl] cite web | author = Jen Lukenbill | title = Bamboo bikes | publisher = AboutMyPlanet | url = http://www.aboutmyplanet.com/environment/bamboo-bikes | accessdate = 2010-05-16 [/tpl]

==History==

Notable current manufacturers include FlavioDeslandes, Calfee Design and Biomega. A company in New York, which is a spin-off of the Bamboo Bike Project, offers weekend-long workshops in which participants can build their own bamboo bicycle frames.[tpl] cite web | title = Bamboo bike workshop | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110707210106/http://bamboobikestudio.com/workshop.html[/tpl]

==Technical aspects==

Different methods exist to treat the bamboo poles and make them durable. All methods aim to cure the material in order to improve durability. One company smokes and heat-treats the bamboo. Others use a torch to achieve the same effect. Ovens can also be used. To prevent water-damage the bamboo can be coated with a sealant such as polyurethane.
The bamboo poles can be joined in different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members.
