Bodhendra Saraswathi was a 17th-century Hindu pontiff and the 59th Jagathguru (head) of the Kanchi matha, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. He spent his later life in Govindapuram.

==Early life==

Bodhendra was born to a Brahmin couple, Kesavapanduranga Yogi and Suguna in the beginning of 17th century at Kanchipuram, which was then headquarters of Kanchi matha.  The couple did not have children for a long time and believed that they were blessed by the devotion to Viswakendra Saraswati(Athmabodhar), the 58th Jagathguru of the Kanchi Matha.  The child was named Purushotamman by Viswakendra Saraswati.
Seeing the extraordinary qualities and immense potentialities of the child, to render incalculable good to humanity, Sri Viswakendra Saraswati requested his parents to hand over the child to the Kanchi Matha with the pious hope of making the child succeed him.  The parents willingly gave the child to the mutt.  The child attained extra ordinary mastery over Sruti and the Smriti.  It gradually dawned on him that namasankeerthanam (chanting of Lord Rama's name) would fetter the cycles of death and birth in Kali Yuga. He chanted Rama nama(the name of Lord Rama) one lakh times every day.The Saints of the Cauvery Delta .P.50

==Initiation of Sainthood==

Athmabodhar instructed Bodhendra Saraswati to proceed to Kanchipuram after obtaining Lakshmi Sreedhar's Bhagawan Nama Koumundhi from the author himself at Jagannatha Kshetram (Puri Jagannadh), and to compose a lakh of Bhagawan Nama slokas (sacred texts on lord) on the basis of Bhagawan Nama Koumundhi. The above mentioned mandate of his guru (teacher) gave him a golden opportunity to pour out his devotion to Lord Rama and to vindicate the efficacy of Rama Nama (name of Lord Rama).
