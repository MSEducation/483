[[Pseudomonas butanovora]]

CATEGORIES: Proteobacteria

 'Pseudomonas' butanovora is a species of Gram-negative proteobacteria capable of growth on alkanes C2-C9, but not methane, as well as other organic substrates such as lactate, acetate, succinate and citrate.  To grow on alkanes, this bacterim expresses a soluble di-iron monooxygenase closely related to soluble methane monooxygenase from methanotrophs. Following 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis, it was determined that  'P. butanovora' belonged in the Thauera rRNA lineage, and is now referred to by its official name, Thauera butanivorans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dubbels |title=Thauera butanivorans sp. nov., a C2-C9 alkane-oxidizing bacterium previously referred to as 'Pseudomonas butanovora'|journal=Int J Syst Evol Microbiol |volume=59 (Pt 7) |pages=1576â€“8|year=2009 |pmid=19528200 |last2=Sayavedra-Soto |first2=LA |last3=Bottomley |pmc=2889399 |first3=PJ |last4=Arp |first4=DJ |issue=Pt 7 |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.000638-0 |display-authors=1[/tpl]
