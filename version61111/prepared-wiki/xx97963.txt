SITO is an online artist collective which began in January 1993,[tpl]cite newsgroup |title=The OTIS Project (attn: artists and photographers) |author=Stastny, Ed |date=27 January 1993 |newsgroup=alt.best.of.internet |id=ed.728159157@cwis |url=http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=ed.728159157%40cwis |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl] making it one of the oldest Internet-based art organizations.  It was started by Ed Stastny and has been maintained by Stastny and a group of volunteers and supporters. 
From its beginning, SITO had a mission different from many established Internet art resources, in that rather than be an electronic journal of discussions or writings about art, it chose to be a repository for artwork in order to facilitate sharing and exposure.  As this was the Internet pre-World Wide Web, SITO accomplished this by using anonymous FTP sites.  Another important part of the SITO mission was to be open to all levels of artists, and at no cost.  SITO was one of the earliest online galleries, and this showcase of artwork has become known as the Artchive.
Popular pronunciations of SITO are SEE-toe and SIT-oh.  SITO was originally called OTIS, which was an acronym for "Operative Term is Stimulate".  The title SITO is merely a reversal of OTIS and is not officially an acronym, though some playful expansions have been suggested by users of the site.  One such expansion is "Still I Think OTIS", which has the distinction of containing a nested acronym.

==Collaborative projects==

Another focus of SITO that soon developed was an active interest in art games and experimentation with collaborative art projects using the Internet as a means of communicating.  The first few such projects dabbled in dividing digital canvases amongst several artists (e.g. Grid and Crosswire[tpl]cite journal |first=Elliott |last=Stone |date=December 1993 |title=Net Surf |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.06/net_surf.html |journal=Wired |accessdate=10 September 2009 |issue=1.06[/tpl] projects) or translating traditional art games such as exquisite corpse to the digital medium.[tpl]cite newsgroup |title=SYNERGY:CORPSE an exhibition |author=Wallach, Harlan |date=5 April 1994 |newsgroup=alt.artcom |id=2nqsri$i2o@Mercury.mcs.com |url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.artcom/browse_thread/thread/82306f1c448db532/fb767e741ac9a730 |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl] These projects were in full swing by 1994 and were grouped together under the heading Synergy on SITO.[tpl]cite web |first=Scot |last=Hacker |date=June 1995 |title=Panicking with Otis |url=http://www.birdhouse.org/words/scot/panic.html |accessdate=11 September 2009[/tpl]
In 1996, the SITO Synergy project HyGrid was honored with a Prix Ars Electronica award.[tpl]cite web |title=ARS Electronica Prix |url=http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=1996 |publisher=ARS Electronica |accessdate=10 September 2009[/tpl] HyGrid is a twisting, looping, multi-dimensional maze of small panels of art which is built up by hundreds of artists. It is still active today. Gridcosm started in 1997 and proved even more popular with over 22000 contributions to its recursing collaborative collage and continues to grow daily.[tpl]cite web |title=Gridcosm Report |url=http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/gridcosm/cosmost |publisher=SITO |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Artistic Interaction and Computer Interactivity: Cooperative art on the Internet|url=http://www.saddlesores.org/Coopart/history.html|publisher=Juan Felipe Rinc√≥n|accessdate=1 May 1996[/tpl]

==OTIS vs. SITO==

SITO originally was announced as "The OTIS Project", with a subtitle of "The Operative Term is Stimulate", which is where the acronym OTIS came from. This mostly whimsical choice became the name of the project and, in mid-1995, became an unexpected problem.  An art college in the United States named Otis was troubled by the fact that OTIS made use of the term "OTIS Gallery" and used the domain otis.org. They sent a cease-and-desist letter and various other threats. The collective discussed the situation and decided something so whimsical was hardly worth fussing over and elected to simply reverse the acronym, thus becoming SITO.[tpl]cite web |title=OTIS vs. Otis College of Art and Design |url=http://www.sito.org/notes/otisvsotis.html |publisher=SITO |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=9 September 2009[/tpl]
