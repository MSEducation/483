==Background==

Brooks was born in Toronto, Canada – his father was an American citizen living in Canada at the time – and grew up in the middle-income Stuyvesant Town housing development in downtown New York City. During his childhood, Brooks' father taught English literature at New York  University, while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at Columbia. Although his family was Jewish,Jewish It's Back, The Weekly Standard, Feb 20, 2003A Loud and Promised Land, New York Times, April 16, 2009. "As an American Jew, I was taught to go all gooey-eyed at the thought of Israel..." Brooks himself is not especially observant.Christopher Beam, "A Reasonable Man", New York Magazine (July 12, 2010) As a child, he attended the Grace Church School, an independent Episcopal primary school in Greenwich Village. When he was 12 his family moved to Philadelphia. He graduated from Radnor High School (located in a prosperous Main Line suburb of Philadelphia) in 1979 and from the University of Chicago in 1983, with a degree in history. His senior thesis was on popular science writer Robert Ardrey, best known for his 1966 book espousing "hard" primitivism, The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry Into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations, in which he argued that humans were descended from "killer apes."
As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. In his senior year he wrote a spoof of the life-style of wealthy conservative William F. Buckley, Jr., who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."University of Chicago Maroon, April 5, 1983. To his piece, Brooks appended the note: “Some would say I’m envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?” When Buckley arrived to give his talk,  he asked if Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered to give him a job."Everybody's a Critic", Mary Ruth Yoe, University of Chicago Magazine(February, 2004).
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the City News Bureau, a wire service owned jointly by the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun Times.Biography page for David Brooks on PBS. He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on himBeam, "A Reasonable Man" (New York Magazine, 2010). In 1984, mindful of the offer he had previously received from William F. Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern on Buckley's National Review. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent life style that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions; Bach concerts; dinners at Buckley’s Park Avenue apartment and villa in Stamford, Connecticut; and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.
 Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. National Review was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. Sam Tanenhaus later reported in The New Republic that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn’t been for his Judaism. “If true, it would be upsetting,” Brooks says.Beam, "A Reasonable Man", ''New York Magazine" (2010). 
After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative Hoover Institute at Stanford University and then got a job writing movie reviews for the Washington Times. In 1986, Brooks was hired by the Wall Street Journal, where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting William Kristol to review Alan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind, which catapulted that book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, The Wall Street Journal posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist in Brussels, from whence he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative Weekly Standard on its inception in 1994–95. In 1996, he edited an anthology, Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.PBS biography of Brooks.
In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary entitled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There to considerable acclaim. The book, a paean to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.
According to Christopher Beam, in 2003, New York Times editorial-page editor Gail Collins called Brooks and invited him to lunch. Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist William Safire, but one who understood how liberals think. “I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn’t make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window,” says Collins. “He was perfect.” Brooks started writing in September 2003. “The first six months were miserable,” Brooks says. “I’d never been hated on a mass scale before.” 
In 2004, Brooks produced  On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense, a sequel to his 2000 best seller, Bobos in Paradise which was not so well received as its predecessor.  Brooks is also the volume editor of The Best American Essays (publication date Oct. 2, 2012). Brooks also authored The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.Random House website The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.  The book was excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011 and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by Random House, in March of that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/18927/the-social-animal-by-david-brooks/9781400067602/ |title=The Social Animal by David Brooks - Book - eBook - Audiobook |publisher=Random House |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/the-social-animal-the-hidden-sources-of-love-character-and-achievement-by-david-brooks/article1938680/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Douglas | last=Bell | title=The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, by David Brooks | date=March 11, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.booksinc.net/book/9781400067602 |title=The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement | Books Inc. - The West's Oldest Independent Bookseller |publisher=Books Inc. |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Brooks |first=David |url=http://www.amazon.com/Social-Animal-Sources-Character-Achievement/dp/140006760X |title=The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement (9781400067602): David Brooks: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22[/tpl] The book has been a commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.[tpl]cite news|title=Publishers Weekly Best-sellers|date=April 3, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011|publisher=The Maui News|url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/547973/Publishers-Weekly-Best-sellers.html?nav=12[/tpl]

==Political views==

Ottawa Citizen  conservative commentator David Warren has identified Brooks as the sort of conservative pundit that liberals like, one who, in contrast to hardliners like Charles Krauthammer is "sophisticated" and "engages with" the liberal agenda.David Warren, A War Between Two World Views 2009-07-17 When asked what he thinks of charges that he's "not a real conservative" or "squishy," Brooks has said that "if you define conservative by support for the Republican candidate or the belief that tax cuts are the correct answer to all problems, I guess I don’t fit that agenda. But I do think that I’m part of a longstanding conservative tradition that has to do with Edmund Burke, which is be cautious, don't think you can do all things by government planning, and Alexander Hamilton, who wanted to use government to help people compete in the capitalist economy." In the same interview with Howard Kurtz in September 2012 Brooks talked about being criticized from the conservative side, saying: "if it’s from a loon, I don’t mind it. I get a kick out of it. If it’s Michelle Malkin attacking, I don’t mind it." With respect to whether he was "the liberals' favorite conservative" Brooks said he "didn't care," stating that "I don’t mind liberals praising me, but when it’s the really partisan liberals, you get an avalanche of love, it’s like uhhh, I gotta rethink this."Howard Kurtz, "David Brooks, Riling Up the Right" The Daily Beast September 30, 2012
Brooks describes himself as having originally been a liberal before, as he put it, "coming to my senses."  He recounts that a turning point in his thinking came while he was still an undergraduate, during a televised debate with free-market economist Milton Friedman. As Brooks describes it, "was essentially me making a point, and he making a two-sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point. That didn’t immediately turn me into a conservative, but ....”[tpl]cite journal |last=Yoe |first=Mary Ruth |date=February 2004 |title=Everybody's a critic |journal=University of Chicago Magazine |volume=96 |issue=3 |url=http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0402/features/index-brooks.shtml |accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the belief of commentators and political figures that American and British forces would be welcomed as liberators.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] In the spring of 2004, some of his opinion pieces suggested that he had tempered his earlier optimism about the war.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]
Brooks' public writing about the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is in line with the opinions of his neoconservatives former colleagues on the Weekly Standard, as pointed out by Glenn Greenwald. His dismissal of the conviction of Scooter Libby as being "a farce" and having "no significance" was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.
On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times entitled "Party No. 3". The column proposed the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.[tpl]cite news | first=David | last=Brooks |  title=Party No. 3 | date=August 10, 2006 | publisher=The New York Times | url =http://select.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/opinion/10brooks.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | work = | accessdate = 2009-02-16  [/tpl]
Brooks has long been a supporter of John McCain; however, he did not show a liking for McCain's 2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a "cancer" on the Republican Party.[tpl]cite news | first=Danny | last=Shea |authorlink= | title=David Brooks: Sarah Palin "Represents A Fatal Cancer To The Republican Party" | date=October 8, 2008 |  url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/08/david-brooks-sarah-palin_n_133001.html | publisher =Huffington Post |accessdate = 2009-02-16 [/tpl] He has referred to her as a "joke," unlikely to ever win the Republican nomination.David Brooks: Sarah Palin Is A 'Joke', TPMTv on Youtube, November 15, 2009 But he later admitted during a CSPAN interview that he had gone too far in his previous "cancer" comments about Palin, which he regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values."CSPAN Book TV: In Depth - David Brooks" (December 4, 2011) CSPAN Book TV: In Depth - David Brooks
In a March 2007 article published in The New York Times titled "No U-Turns",[tpl]cite news|title=No U-Turns|url=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/opinion/29brooks.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2007 |last=Brooks|first=David|accessdate=September 13, 2008[/tpl] Brooks explained that the Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections, which he considers the most important purpose of a political party designed to serve the political class.[tpl]Vague|date=May 2012[/tpl]
Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. ... I remember distinctly an image of--we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking, a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good president.”[tpl]cite web |last=Sherman |first=Gabriel |title=The Courtship: The story behind the Obama-Brooks bromance |publisher=The New Republic |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-courtship |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl] Two days after Obama’s second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.[tpl]cite news |first=David |last=Brooks |title=Run, Barack, Run |url=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2006 |accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl] However as of December 2011 in a CSPAN interview, Brooks' opinion of Obama's presidency was more tempered, giving Obama only a "B-" rating, and said that Obama's chances of reelection would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.
In writing for The New York Times in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/opinion/12brooks.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Tel Aviv Cluster | first=David | last=Brooks | date=January 12, 2010[/tpl] He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since". In Brooks' view, "Israel’s technological success is the fruition of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."

==Social views==

Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and divorce. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex...and having fewer partners." He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair."New York Times, April 17, 2005, 4-14
As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of same-sex marriage, pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage.  We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity.... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."New York Times, November 22, 2003, A-15
Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.

On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages moraly reprovable behaviour. Brooks stated he smoked it in his youth, but quit after feeling highly embarassed during a class presentation under the influence.
