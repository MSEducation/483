The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a cabinet department of the United States federal government, created in response to the September 11 attacks, and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the United States and its territories (including protectorates) from and responding to terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. The Department of Homeland Security, and not the United States Department of the Interior, is equivalent to the Interior ministries of other countries. In fiscal year 2011, DHS was allocated a budget of $98.8 billion and spent, net, $66.4 billion.
Where the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2013[/tpl] On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.
With more than 200,000 employees, DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.napawash.org/pc_management_studies/dhs.html |title=The National Academy of Public Administration |publisher=Napawash.org |accessdate=November 24, 2011[/tpl] Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.
On December 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as the next Secretary of Homeland Security.Senate confirms new homeland security secretary
According to the Homeland Security Research Corporation, the combined financial year 2010 state and local homeland security (HLS) markets, which employ more than 2.2 million first responders, totaled $16.5 billion, whereas the DHS HLS market totaled $13 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homelandsecurityresearch.com/2010/11/us-hls-hld-markets-2011-2014/|title=U.S. HLS-HLD Markets – 2011-2014|publisher=Homeland Security Market Research|date=|accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl] According to The Washington Post, "DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010".Priest, Dana and Arkin, William (December 2010) Monitoring America, Washington Post
According to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War,[tpl]cite journal|last=Andreas |first=Peter |title=Redrawing the Line: Borders and Security in the Twenty-first Century |journal=International Security |volume=28 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=78–111 |doi=10.1162/016228803322761973 |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Science/documents/Redrawing_the_Line.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.Perl, Raphael (2004)."The Department of Homeland Security: Background and Challenges", Terrorism—reducing Vulnerabilities and Improving Responses, Committee on Counterterrorism Challenges for Russia and the United States, Office for Central Europe and Eurasia Development, Security, and Cooperation Policy and Global Affairs, in Cooperation with the Russian Academy of Sciences, page 176.

==Etymology==

In an August 5, 2002 speech, U.S. President George W. Bush stated: "We're fighting...to secure freedom in the homeland".Bovard, James. "Moral high ground not won on battlefield", USA Today, October 8, 2008. Retrieved on August 19, 2008. Prior to the creation of DHS, American presidents had referred to the United States as "the nation" or "the republic", and to its internal policies as "domestic".Wolf, Naomi (2007). The End of America, page 27. Chelsea Green Publishing.

The choice of this phrase raised questions regarding the self-image of the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.spectacle.org/1201/bartlett.html|author= Bartlett, James|title= Homeland: Behind the Buzzword|publisher=The Ethical Spectacle|date=December 2001|accessdate=January 26, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Creation===

In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush announced the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security (OHS) to coordinate "homeland security" efforts. The office was headed by former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, who assumed the title of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. The official announcement stated:
[tpl]Cquote|The mission of the Office will be to develop and coordinate the implementation of a comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks. The Office will coordinate the executive branch's efforts to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/nat_strat_hls.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120112224223/http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/nat_strat_hls.pdf|archivedate=January 12, 2012|title=National Strategy For Homeland Security|work=pdf file|publisher=DHS|date=July 2002|format=PDF[/tpl][/tpl]
Ridge began his duties as OHS director on October 8, 2001.
The Department of Homeland Security was established on November 25, 2002, by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. It was intended to consolidate U.S. executive branch organizations related to "homeland security" into a single Cabinet agency.
Prior to the signing of the bill, controversy about its adoption centered on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency should be incorporated in part or in whole (neither were included). The bill itself was also controversial for the presence of unrelated "riders", as well as for eliminating certain union-friendly civil service and labor protections for department employees. Without these protections, employees could be expeditiously reassigned or dismissed on grounds of security, incompetence or insubordination, and DHS would not be required to notify their union representatives.
The plan stripped 180,000 government employees of their union rights.Chomsky, Noam (2005). Imperial Ambitions, page 199. Metropolitan Books. ISBN 0-8050-7967-X. In 2002, Bush Administration officials argued that the September 11 attacks made the proposed elimination of employee protections imperative.Stephen Barr. "DHS Withdraws Bid to Curb Union Rights", The Washington Post page D01, February 20, 2008. Retrieved on August 20, 2008.
Congress ultimately passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002 without the union-friendly measures, and President Bush signed the bill into law on November 25, 2002. It was the largest U.S. government reorganization in the 50 years since the United States Department of Defense was created.
Tom Ridge was named secretary on January 24, 2003, and began naming his chief deputies. DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, but most of the department's component agencies were not transferred into the new Department until March 1.
After establishing the basic structure of DHS and working to integrate its components and get the department functioning, Ridge announced his resignation on November 30, 2004, following the re-election of President Bush. Bush initially nominated former New York City Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik as his successor, but on December 10, Kerik withdrew his nomination, citing personal reasons and saying it "would not be in the best interests" of the country for him to pursue the post.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] On January 11, 2005, President Bush nominated federal judge Michael Chertoff to succeed Ridge. Chertoff was confirmed on February 15, 2005, by a vote of 98–0 in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in the same day.
In February 2005, DHS and the Office of Personnel Management issued rules relating to employee pay and discipline for a new personnel system named MaxHR. The Washington Post said that the rules would allow DHS "to override any provision in a union contract by issuing a department-wide directive" and would make it "difficult, if not impossible, for unions to negotiate over arrangements for staffing, deployments, technology and other workplace matters".
In August 2005, U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer blocked the plan on the grounds that it did not ensure collective-bargaining rights for DHS employees.
A federal appeals court ruled against DHS in 2006; pending a final resolution to the litigation, Congress's fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for DHS provided no funding for the proposed new personnel system. DHS announced in early 2007 that it was retooling its pay and performance system and retiring the name "MaxHR".
In a February 2008 court filing, DHS said that it would no longer pursue the new rules, and that it would abide by the existing civil service labor-management procedures. A federal court issued an order closing the case.

===Consolidated agencies===

The following 22 agencies were incorporated into the new department:“History: Who Became Part of the Department?” United States Department of Homeland Security website. Retrieved on August 22, 2008.

==Overview==

===Homeland Security Advisory System===

On March 12, 2002, the Homeland Security Advisory System, a color-coded terrorism risk advisory scale, was created as the result of a Presidential Directive to provide a "comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to Federal, State, and local authorities and to the American people." Many procedures at government facilities are tied in to the alert level; for example a facility may search all entering vehicles when the alert is above a certain level. Since January 2003, it has been administered in coordination with DHS; it has also been the target of frequent jokes and ridicule on the part of the administration's detractors about its ineffectiveness. After resigning, Tom Ridge stated that he did not always agree with the threat level adjustments pushed by other government agencies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/speeches/speech_0053.shtm|title=Remarks by Governor Ridge Announcing Homeland Security Advisory System|publisher=Dhs.gov|date=March 12, 2002|accessdate=November 24, 2011[/tpl]
In January 2003, the office[tpl]clarify|What office?|date=January 2010[/tpl] was merged into the Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council, both of which were created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council, similar in nature to the National Security Council, retains a policy coordination and advisory role, and is led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security.
As of January 13, 2011, the DHS advised the American public of an 'elevated national threat' level, recommending that all Americans 'should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves and their family, and stay informed about what to do during an emergency'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/files/programs/Copy_of_press_release_0046.shtm|title=Copy of press release 0046|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=January 13, 2011[/tpl]
The National Terrorism Advisory System, or NTAS, replaces the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS). The NTAS will include information specific to the particular credible threat, and will not use a color-coded scale.

===Ready.gov===

Soon after the formation of Department of Homeland Security, the Martin Agency of Richmond, Virginia worked pro bono to create "Ready.gov", a readiness website. The site and materials were conceived in March 2002 and launched in February 2003, just before the launch of the Iraq War.[tpl]cite news|first=Daniel|last=Forbes|url=http://www.antiwar.com/forbes/?articleid=2679|title=$226 Million in Govt Ads Helped Pave the Way for War|publisher=Antiwar.com|date=May 28, 2004|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oaaa.org/public/view.asp?PUBLIC_SERVICE_ID=7|title=Homeland Security: Ready.Gov|work=12/29/2003|publisher=Outdoor Advertising Association of America|accessdate=October 31, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017171339/http://www.oaaa.org/public/view.asp?PUBLIC_SERVICE_ID=7 |archivedate=October 17, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/20/lad.08.html|title=CNN Live at daybreak|work=Aired February 20, 2003|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] One of the first announcements that garnered widespread public attention to this campaign was one by Tom Ridge in which he stated that in the case of a chemical attack, citizens should use duct tape and plastic sheeting to build a homemade bunker, or "sheltering in place" to protect themselves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/america/other/faqs.html|title=Homeland Security Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=ready.gov|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/america/getakit/cleanair.html|title=Clean Air|publisher=ready.gov|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] As a result, the sales of duct tape skyrocketed and DHS was criticized for being too alarmist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lies.com/wp/2003/02/21/are-you-readygov/|title=Are You Ready.gov?|work=February 21st, 2003|publisher=lies.com|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] The site was promoted with banner ads containing automatic audio components on commercial web sites.

===National Incident Management System===

On March 1, 2004, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) was created. The stated purpose was to provide a consistent incident management approach for federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5, all federal departments were required to adopt the NIMS and to use it in their individual domestic incident management and emergency prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation program and activities.

===National Response Framework===

In December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) was created, in an attempt to align federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management. The NRP was built on the template of the NIMS.
On January 22, 2008, the National Response Framework was published in the Federal Register as an updated replacement of the NRP, effective March 22, 2008.

===Cyber-security===

The DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and requirements for cyber-security in the U.S. The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System.[tpl]cite web|title=National Cyber Security Division|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/editorial_0839.shtm|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=June 14, 2008[/tpl] The DHS Science and Technology Directorate helps government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities.

===First Responders===

The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) runs a number of technology-based programs aimed at assisting first responders, including R-Tech, Communities of Practice, and the Virtual Social Media Working Group.

====R-Tech====

The DHS S&T First Responder Technologies (R-Tech) program helps first responders by finding solutions in areas that first responders have gaps in their abilities to respond. The program tries to do this through fast prototyping of technologies, giving technical help and support, and sharing information.Home - First Responder Communities of Practice. Communities.firstresponder.gov. (U.S. Department of Homeland Security). Retrieved 2014-02-24.

====Communities of Practice====

Seal Description: In the center of the seal, a graphically styled white American eagle appears in a circular blue field. The eagle's outstretched wings break through an inner red ring into an outer white ring that contains the words "U.S. DEPARTMENT OF" in the top half and "HOMELAND SECURITY" in the bottom half in a circular placement. The eagle's wings break through the inner circle into the outer ring to suggest that the Department of Homeland Security will break through traditional bureaucracy and perform government functions differently. In the tradition of the Great Seal of the United States, the eagle's talon on the left holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 seeds while the eagle's talon on the right grasps 13 arrows. Centered on the eagle's breast is a shield divided into three sections containing elements that represent the American homeland – air, land, and sea. The top element, a dark blue sky, contains 22 stars representing the original 22 entities that have come together to form the department. The left shield element contains white mountains behind a green plain underneath a light blue sky. The right shield element contains four wave shapes representing the oceans alternating light and dark blue separated by white lines. Background: The seal was developed with input from DHS senior leadership, employees, and the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts. The Ad Council, which currently partners with DHS on its Ready campaign, and the consulting company Landor Associates were responsible for graphic design and maintaining heraldic integrity. Going Forward: All 180,000 DHS employees will soon receive a DHS lapel pin and a personalized DHS certificate. The personalized certificate signifies that the employee was part of the Department of Homeland Security at its inception. The seal will ultimately be used on department materials, signage, credentials, badges, vehicles, sea vessels and aircraft. Media wishing to obtain a high resolution version of the new Department of Homeland Security seal should contact the press office.[/tpl] describes the seal as follows:

==Headquarters==

Since its inception, the department has had its temporary headquarters in Washington, D.C.'s Nebraska Avenue Complex, a former naval facility. The [tpl]convert|38|acre|ha|sing=on[/tpl] site, across from American University, has 32 buildings comprising [tpl]convert|566000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of administrative space.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/testimony/testimony_0019.shtm|title=Statement of Secretary Tom Ridge|publisher=DHS|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] In early 2007, the Department submitted a $4.1 billion plan to Congress to consolidate its 60-plus Washington-area offices into a single headquarters complex at the St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Anacostia, Southeast Washington, D.C. The earliest DHS began moving to St. Elizabeths is 2013.[tpl]cite press release|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2013/07/29/dhs-opens-new-headquarters-st-elizabeths-campus|title=DHS Opens New Headquarters on St. Elizabeths Campus|publisher=DHS Press Office|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2013[/tpl]
The move is being championed by District of Columbia officials because of the positive economic impact it will have on historically depressed Anacostia. The move has been criticized by historic preservationists, who claim the revitalization plans will destroy dozens of historic buildings on the campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/southern-region/st-elizabeths-hospital.html|title=Most Endangered Places|work=2/2009|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=February 4, 2009[/tpl] Community activists have criticized the plans because the facility will remain walled off and have little interaction with the surrounding area.[tpl]cite news|first=Joel|last=Holley|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/16/AR2007061601192.html|title=Tussle Over St. Elizabeths|work=Washington Post|page=C01|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] On January 8, 2009, the National Capital Planning Commission approved the Department of Homeland Security's plans to move into the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ncpc.gov/mediaroom/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=256&F_CATEGORY_ID=6&|title=NCPC Approves Final Master Plan for DHS Headquarters at St. Elizabeths[/tpl]
The new DHS headquarters campus is now slated to open in 2021. The five-year delay is due primarily to spending cuts in construction funds imposed by Congress. In fiscal 2011, DHS and the General Services Administration (GSA; which oversees construction for DHS) requested $668 million for construction and consolidation but received only $77 million. In fiscal 2012, DHS and GSA requested $377 million but received only $106 million. In fiscal 2013, President Obama's budget suggested giving GSA $56 million in construction funds, and DHS $89 million (to be used primarily for local road improvements and for moving the Coast Guard into its new building). The two agencies had requested $460 million. Only the new Coast Guard headquarters building is due to open on time (in 2013). This is because GSA has relied on $200 million in funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and a large appropriation from the fiscal 2009 federal budget to complete the structure.Medici, Andy.

==Criticism==

===Excess, waste, and ineffectiveness===

The Department of Homeland Security has been dogged by persistent criticism over excessive bureaucracy, waste, ineffectiveness and lack of transparency. A House of Representatives subcommittee estimated that as of September 2008 the department has wasted roughly $15 billion in failed contracts.[tpl]cite news|first=Dana|last=Hedgpeth|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603200.html|title=Congress Says DHS Oversaw $15 Billion in Failed Contracts|work=The Washington Post|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2008[/tpl] In 2003, the department came under fire after the media revealed that Laura Callahan, Deputy chief information officer at DHS with responsibilities for sensitive national security databases, had obtained her advanced computer science degrees through a diploma mill in a small town in Wyoming. The department was blamed for up to $2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the Government Accountability Office revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees, with purchases including beer brewing kits, $70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable, boats purchased at double the retail price (many of which later could not be found), and iPods ostensibly for use in "data storage".[tpl]cite news|first=Eric|last=Lipton|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/washington/19cards.html?ei=5088&en=5e9000b0261c5602&ex=1310961600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1164294012-DXvgXm9ImuoTtQCqwkhFjA|title=Homeland Security Department Is Accused of Credit Card Misuse|work=The New York Times|date=July 19, 2006|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Lara|last=Jakes Jordan|url=http://www.homelandsecurityweekly.com/news/dhs-credit-fraud-071906/|title=Credit Card Fraud at DHS|work=Homeland Security Weekly|date=July 19, 2006|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9353365/|title=Government's Katrina credit cards criticized|agency=Associated Press|date=September 15, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Dana|last=Hedgpeth|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603200_pf.html|title=Congress says DHS oversaw $15 billion in failed contracts|work=Washington Post|date=September 17, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2008[/tpl]

===Fragmented congressional oversight===

Current and former DHS officials, 9/11 Commission members, liberal and conservative policy groups[tpl]cite book|title=Task Force Report on Streamlining and Consolidating Congressional Oversight of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security|year=2013|publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center|page=6|url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/downloads/sunnylands/homeland%20security%20report%2009-11-13.pdf[/tpl] and the ranking Republican member of the House Homeland Security Committee, Peter T. King, have strongly criticized the growing number of House and Senate panels that regularly demand formal reports, testimony and formal briefings from DHS officials and staff. By 2010, there were 108 congressional committees and subcommittees claiming jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security,[tpl]cite news|title=Who Oversees Homeland Security? Um, Who Doesn't?|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128642876|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=20 July 2010[/tpl] up from 86 committees in 2004, when the 9/11 Commission published its final report, which addressed this issue, stating that "Congress should create a single, principal point of oversight and review for homeland security."
Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff warns that too much oversight results, ironically, in too much autonomy for the department: "The DHS winds up getting a mixed message. ... So either the department has no guidance or, more likely, the department ignores both because they're in conflict. And so the department does what it wants to do."[tpl]cite book|title=Task Force Report on Streamlining and Consolidating Congressional Oversight of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security|year=2013|publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center|page=13|url=http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/downloads/sunnylands/homeland%20security%20report%2009-11-13.pdf[/tpl]

===Data mining (ADVISE)===

The Associated Press reported on September 5, 2007,[tpl]cite news|first=Michael J.|last=Sniffen|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090500795.html|title=DHS Ends Criticized Data-Mining Program|work=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=September 5, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] that DHS had scrapped an anti-terrorism data mining tool called ADVISE (Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement) after the agency's Privacy Office[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_rpt_advise.pdf|title=ADVISE Report: DHS Privacy Office Review of the Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight and Semantic Enhancement (ADVISE) Program|work=pdf file|publisher=DHS|accessdate=July 31, 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] and Office of Inspector General (OIG)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_07-56_Jun07.pdf|title=ADVISE Could Support Intelligence Analysis More Effectively|work=pdf file|publisher=DHS|accessdate=October 31, 2007|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Ryan|last=Singel|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9353365/|title=Homeland Data Tool Needs Privacy Help, Report Says|publisher=Wired|date=March 20, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl] found that pilot testing of the system had been performed using data on real people without having done a Privacy Impact Assessment, a required privacy safeguard for the various uses of real personally identifiable information required by section 208 of the e-Government Act of 2002. The OIG report noted that ADVISE was poorly planned, time-consuming for analysts to use, and lacked adequate justifications. The system, in development at Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory since 2003, had cost the agency $42 million to date. Controversy over the program preceded the Privacy Office and OIG reports; in March 2007, the Government Accountability Office stated that "the ADVISE tool could misidentify or erroneously associate an individual with undesirable activity such as fraud, crime or terrorism."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-07-293|title=Early Attention to Privacy in Developing a Key DHS Program Could Reduce Risks (GAO-07-293)|publisher=GAO|date=February 28, 2007|accessdate=July 31, 2007[/tpl]

===Fusion centers===

Fusion centers are terrorism prevention and response centers, many of which were created under a joint project between the Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs between 2003 and 2007. The fusion centers gather information not only from government sources, but also from their partners in the private sector.Monahan, T. 2009. The Murky World of 'Fusion Centres'. Criminal Justice Matters 75 (1): 20–21.[tpl]cite web|last=Jeffery|first=Keith|url=http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/smashing-intelligence-stovepipes?page=0%2C1|title=Smashing Intelligence Stovepipes|publisher=Security Management|accessdate=November 24, 2011[/tpl]
They are designed to promote information sharing at the federal level between agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice, US Military and state and local level government. [tpl]As of|2009|7|df=US[/tpl], the Department of Homeland Security recognized at least seventy-two fusion centers.Report on Fusion Centers July 29, 2009 Democracy Now Fusion centers may also be affiliated with an Emergency Operations Center that responds in the event of a disaster.
There are a number of documented criticisms of fusion centers, including relative ineffectiveness at counterterrorism activities, the potential to be used for secondary purposes unrelated to counterterrorism, and their links to violations of civil liberties of American citizens and others.Monahan, T. and Palmer, N.A. 2009. "The Emerging Politics of DHS Fusion Centers." Security Dialogue 40 (6): 617–636.
David Rittgers of the Cato Institute has noted
 
 a long line of fusion center and DHS reports labeling broad swaths of the public as a threat to national security. The North Texas Fusion System labeled Muslim lobbyists as a potential threat; a DHS analyst in Wisconsin thought both pro- and anti-abortion activists were worrisome; a Pennsylvania homeland security contractor watched environmental activists, Tea Party groups, and a Second Amendment rally; the Maryland State Police put anti-death penalty and anti-war activists in a federal terrorism database; a fusion center in Missouri thought that all third-party voters and Ron Paul supporters were a threat....”Rittgers, David (February 2, 2011) We're All Terrorists Now, Cato Institute

The Privacy Office has identified a number of risks to privacy presented by the Fusion Center program: 1) justification for Fusion Centers, 2) ambiguous lines of authority, rules, and oversight, 3) participation of the military and the private sector, 4) data mining, 5) excessive secrecy, 6) inaccurate or incomplete information, and 7) mission creep.Privacy Impact Assessment for the Department of Homeland Security State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative December 11, 2008 http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_ia_slrfci.pdf

===Mail interception===

In 2006, MSNBC reported that Grant Goodman, "an 81-year-old retired University of Kansas history professor, received a letter from his friend in the Philippines that had been opened and resealed with a strip of dark green tape bearing the words “by Border Protection” and carrying the official Homeland Security seal."Meeks, Brock (January 6, 2006) Homeland Security opening private mail, MSNBC The letter was sent by a devout Catholic Filipino woman with no history of supporting Islamic terrorism. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection "acknowledged that the agency can, will and does open mail coming to U.S. citizens that originates from a foreign country whenever it's deemed necessary":
 
 "All mail originating outside the United States Customs territory that is to be delivered inside the U.S. Customs territory is subject to Customs examination," says the CBP Web site. That includes personal correspondence. "All mail means 'all mail,'" said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman, emphasizing the point.

The Department declined to outline what criteria are used to determine when a piece of personal correspondence should be opened or to say how often or in what volume Customs might be opening mail.
Goodman's story provoked outrage in the blogosphere,Cole, John (January 9, 2006) Your Mail- Free for Government Inspection, Balloon Juice as well as in the more established media. Reacting to the incident, Mother Jones remarked that "unlike other prying government agencies, Homeland Security wants you to know it is watching you".Dees, Diane (January 9, 2006) Department of Homeland Security opens Kansas professor's mail, Mother Jones CNN observed that "on the heels of the NSA wiretapping controversy, Goodman's letter raises more concern over the balance between privacy and security".Transcript from The Situation Room (January 12, 2006)

===Employee morale===

In July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS was last or near to last in every category including:
The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency. Examples from the survey reveal most concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, leadership generating high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization.[tpl]cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688|title=Homeland Security employees rank last in job satisfaction survey|publisher=ABC Inc., WLS-TV Chicago|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Bill|last=Conroy|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136|title=DHS memo reveals agency personnel are treated like "human capital"|publisher=narco news|date=January 31, 2007|accessdate=October 31, 2007[/tpl]
