CATEGORIES: Welsh domestic cricket competitions, ECB Premier Leagues

The South Wales Premier Cricket League, also known as the SWALEC Premier Cricket League for sponsorship reasons, is the top level of competition for recreational club cricket in South Wales. The league was founded in 1999 as the South East Wales League, being renamed following its accreditation as an ECB Premier League in 2001. 
There was another change in 2010, when a new Premier League was formed by taking the top five clubs from the 2009 South Wales Cricket League and the top five clubs from the 2009 South Wales Cricket Association. The original South Wales Cricket League has now been renamed as the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire Cricket League, and it and the South Wales Cricket Association now act as feeders to the new South Wales Cricket League.
