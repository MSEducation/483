Serpico is a 1973 American crime film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino. Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler wrote the screenplay, adapting Peter Maas' biography of NYPD officer Frank Serpico (born 1936), who went undercover to expose corruption in the force. Both Maas's book and the film cover 12 years—1960 to June 15, 1972—in the life of Serpico, who was trying to be an honest policeman. 
The film and principals were nominated for numerous awards, earning recognition for its score, direction, screenplay and Pacino's performance. The film was also a commercial success.

==Plot==

Working as a uniformed patrolman, Frank Serpico excels at every assignment. He moves on to plainclothes assignments, where he slowly discovers a hidden world of corruption and graft among his own colleagues. After witnessing cops use drugs, commit violence, take payoffs and other forms of police corruption, Serpico decides to expose what he has seen, but he is harassed and threatened by his peers. The struggle leads to infighting within the police force, problems in his personal relationships, and Serpico's life being threatened. Finally, after being shot in the face during a drug bust on February 3, 1971, he testifies before the Knapp Commission, a government inquiry into NYPD police corruption between 1970 and 1972. After receiving a New York City Police Department Medal of Honor and a disability pension, Serpico resigns from the force and moves to Switzerland.

==Production==

Prior to any work on the movie, producer Martin Bregman had lunch with Peter Maas to discuss a film adaptation of his biography of Frank Serpico. Waldo Salt, a screenwriter, began to write the script which director Sidney Lumet deemed to be too long.  Another screenwriter, Norman Wexler, did the structural work followed by play lines.
Director John G. Avildsen was originally slated to direct the movie, but was removed from production due to differences with producer Bregman. Lumet took the helm as director just before filming.
The real-life Frank Serpico wished to be present during the filming of the movie based on his life. Initially he was permitted to stay, but was eventually dismissed from the filming, as Lumet was worried that his presence would make the actors (particularly Pacino) self-conscious. 
The story was filmed in the streets of New York City. A total of 104 different locations in four of the five boroughs of the city (all except Staten Island) were used. An apartment at 5-7 Minetta Street in Manhattan's Greenwich Village was used as Serpico's residence, though according to the Peter Maas book, he lived on Perry Street during the events depicted in the film. Lewisohn Stadium, which was closed at the time of filming, was used for one scene.
As the storyline needed to show the progression of Serpico's beard and hair length, individual scenes were filmed in reverse order, with Pacino's hair being trimmed for each scene set earlier in the film's timeline.
Woodie King Jr., originally cast as a hoodlum, was replaced after suffering a broken leg while filming a chase scene for this movie. He returned to the set two months later to play Leslie's friend Larry in the party scene.
Playwright Sidney Kingsley loaned his apartment to Lumet for use to film the party scene. In 1935, Kingsley had hired an 11-year-old Lumet to appear on Broadway in his play, Dead End, and they had remained friends ever since.  Ironically, Kingsley, after months of research, had written an award-winning stage play about the NYPD, Detective Story, which was adapted into an iconic, award-winning film about the NYPD.

Its Greek name is Dromoi Palioi, or "Old Streets". Sidney Lumet's direction was recognized by both the BAFTAs and the Directors Guild of America. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture – Drama.
