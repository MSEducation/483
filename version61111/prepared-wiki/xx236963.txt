Even though the only single, "The Carpenter" reached number three on the Finnish singles chart, Nightwish failed to gain national fame until the release of their second studio album, Oceanborn.
The male vocals heard on "Beauty and the Beast", "The Carpenter", "Astral Romance" and "Once Upon a Troubadour" are sung by Tuomas Holopainen, and the whispers in the beginning of the demo version of "Eti√§inen" is also done by Holopainen. After this album Holopainen never sang on an album again, because he thought that he was not good enough.
However, he provides some of the background sounds on "Moondance" of the second album Oceanborn and on "Master Passion Greed" of the sixth album Dark Passion Play.
